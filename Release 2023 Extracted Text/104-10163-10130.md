HE CLOSING OUT ALL HIS STATIONKEEPERS IN MICARAGUA, DID

NOT VANT. TO: ABANDON WEAPONS TO FALL INTO WRONG MAÑOS, NOR

TO GIVE THEN TO NIC GOVI. GENERAL SOMOZA KNEW AMWORLD WAS

LEAVING BEHIND SOME RESERVE EQUIPMENT AND WOULD KEEP

ENOUGH WEAPONS FOR LOCAL SECURITY. HE DID NOT KNOW NUMBERS

RECOVER WEAPONS, OTHERWISE HE WOULD HAVE TO DUMP THEM IN

OCEAN. ZABOTH, AMBIDDY-I AND AMJAVA-A, WHO IN MANAGUA ON

OTHER BUSINESS, VISITED. BLIFE ISLAND & MARCH TO CHECK

SITUATION. IF HOS WISHES RECOVER WEAPONS, MOST FEASIBLE

METHUD IS BY AIR. A CARIBOU OR C-I23 TYPE AIRCRAFT COULD

LAND ON BLUFF STRIP, LOAD WEAPONS AT NIGHT AND FLY THEM

OUT MEXT MORNING. IF HQS DOES NOT WISH RECOVER WEAPONS,

AMBIDDY-I COULD BE TOLD TO MAKE OWN ARRANGENENTS TO G*P

REFERENCE: (A) HNMA-4315, 17 April 1969

(B) HNMA-4324, 1 May 1969

Attached (USC) for the information of Headquarters is a

copy of a memorandum prepared for the LNPURE Chief on 12 May 1969.

This menorandum sets forth information race:ved that day by the

cos from AMBIDDY-1 who is considering going into a dry dock venture

In Corinto with Jose Maria ZELAYA, private secretary to President

SOMOZa.

ZELAYA has cabinet rank.

He is believed by many to be

pro-Communist although, as in the

caze of similar reports about

francisco j. LAInEz, no real proor of these allegations seems to

De produced.

When shown this menorandum,

the LNPURE Chief said he

thought it quite likely that ZELAYA is strongly anti-American

as reported by AMBIDDY.

3.

AMBIDDY says that for the first time he recently heard

Somoza utter unfavorable words about the United States

AMBIDDY "wondered" to the COS if ZELAYA could be exerting some

avil influence on Somoza..

The Station will seek to draw AMBIDDY out at length on

this matter at an opportune time.

It is preposterous

to expect Governor ROCKEFILIER to learn anything about a

ROCKEFELLER will go back to

the Unitad States, make his report to NIXON, and then go about

She found it to her liking and wrote

a favorable story but some unidentified character at the

HEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manuel AR. IME Buesa

1..

ARIIME comes to Managua frequently, always using

LANICA Airlines

and frequently flying over Cuba.

He is.

aware of the pussibility of a highjacking and says that he

would never make it nist of the Havana airport alive if

the CASTRO Government were to get hold of him.

2.

He explains his trips as legitinate business.

One of his enterprises lies

In obtaining ratigue uniforms,

canteens, web gear.

and similar equipment and supplies

for the Nicaraguan

National Guard.

Another enterprise,

In which he was involved a year or so ago, involved lumber

and cabinet woods which he hoped to export fron Nicaragua

to the States.

dealt with a Nicaraguan businessman

named MOLINA in this matter.

It seens to have fallen through.

At one point last year (1968) I heard that ARTIME was trying

to serve as middleman for investments by KRUPP interests in

Germany here.

I have heard no more about thís.: A more

recent line is Nicaraguan beef. for export to the states.

He says that he has made contact with the top man of the

8 8W restaurants in the States. This man, after checking

samples of Nicaraguan beef; says he will buy all he can get.

The supplier at inu

end would be CARNIC, a meat packing

nterprise owned by President soMorro

There is no doubt

ARTIME could find a ready market in the States but he may

be stymied by the import quotas,

especially since Nicaragua

over-exported to the states in 1968 and had troubles as a

result.

3.

ARTIME drops by to see me at my home often although

not on avery trip.

His visits to ma hava baen lasa frequent

of late.

We have easy rapport.

He knows who I represent.

closest friend in Nicaragua.

ARTIME often stays at his

home.

On a couple of occasions ARTIME has been by to

see me with another mutual cuban friend, Primitivo

ABLANEDO, Who used to live at il Bluff on the Last Coast.

"El Gallego" ABLANEDO now. lives in Managua and makes his

living renting out dump trucks and construction and hauling

equipment.

On one occasion ARTIME came by with a Cuban I

believe was named VILA.

Cuban friend (she teaches Spanish at the American Embassy)

tells me that VILA owns a restaurant in Miami but that

ARTIME has no connection with

this enterprise.

ARTIME always comes with sor sone when he visits

ae--not because he feels need for a bodyguard as some

suspect, but simply because he still doesn't know how to

drive a car and I live some distance out of town.. Our

visits are pleasant, involve a scotch or two at nost.

The last two times ARTIME has not had anything to drink.

We talk no operations or othen such business.

My personal

views on dealing with CASTRO, especially on howwe should

have dealt with him in the past,

are rather hawkish and I

think ARTIME finds these views pleasant to his ear although

he is well aware that they are not "policy."

5.

ARTIME told me some months ago--before the elections.

of meeting with "Bebe" REBOZO.

The meeting was arranged

through CONDOM, ARTIME has not claimed to me to have met with

Mr. NIXON either before or after he assumed the presidency.

CurTent Rumors in PBRUMEN Exile Community

HOMY QUALIFIED DESE

CAN DIDGE INDEERS

ENC100:20.302

As usual the first month of 1969 featured a large number of russors

waking the rounds in the PBRUMEN exile community.

while we normally rend

to ignore such runors, we are forwarding a couple of tidbits because they

relate to GPVALIANT.

2. The first of these rumors deals with a new strup which has pre-

surably been formed for the purpose of trying to deal through GPVALIANT.

Asong those in the group are Carlos Prio, Lincoln Rodon, Juan J. Remos,

Sergio Carbo, and Edgardo Butari.

This group reportedly meets every Thurs-

day at different houses:

The last meeting in January was held at the home

of Lincoln Rodon.

At this merring Prio presumably stated that Butari was

& better contact to GPVALIANT than is Emilio Nunez Portuando.

The general

consensus was that Butari is a better contact because he is a business

partner of Bebe Roboso and everyone knows Reboso's influence with GPVALIANT.

The rumor mill has it that the group intends to pretend that it favors

political and democratic: solutions to the PBRUMEN problem but that they

really seek armed intervention.

In this same connection Father O'Farril

has recently told AMPALM-4 that AMBIDDY-l is once more connected with WOFIRM

and that INCORE-2 has joined hia.. The rumor mill says further that AMBIDDY-l

and AMCORE-2 are planning to open training camps once again with the tacit

encouragement of the-above group. According to AMPALM-A O'Farril himself

does not agree with the version of AMBIDDY-l and ANCORE-? wanting to estab-

lish training camps.

O'Fartil feels that the solution AMBIDDY-l is looking

for is through agreements between LNFORT (GPVALIANT) and the Soviet Union.

NIBALDA has piciod up information quite similar to that learned

chrough AMPALM-4. He also has reported the existence of this group and

sald that they are collecting money fron the retugees in order to buy arms

and equipment to ovezüirow AMTHUG-1.

According to WIBALDA important men-

bers of Alpha-66, Segundo Frente, DRE, Autenticor, and Ortodoxos are in-

volved even thogh these organizations themselves aro not participating

as groups in the t0:ániitt.

Jose FERNANDEZ de la Torre

On 2 March 1962 a report said he was a cuban

refugee uno talis anti-Communist but vas

actually sent to Nicaragua to make Coszunist

propaganda.

On 8 May 1955 he vouched for the

entry into Vicaragua of Jesus FERIANDEZ Suarez,

a Cuban (no OS! or Station traces).

Cliote:

FERNANDEZ is known personally to LABOTH and to

the Chief of Station, whose opinions about ta

are that he is a Cuban businessman who is

both anti-Communist

and anti-Castro because of

the loss of his business interests in Cuba.

His principal business in Cuba involved dis-

tribution of the products of Procter and Gaable,

the soap and chemical company.

He is now

tanager of Distribuidora Inter-Americana S.A..

an import/export and distribution firn in

Managua.) : On 18 January 1967 the Guatenalan

Security Service requested traces on the subject,

along with a list of other Cubans. No reason

for the request was given to OSN.

Orlando CASTRILLO S., Bachiller

On 20 November 1965 he wrote a letter to La

Prensa, the opposition newspaper in Managua,

asking

them for 30,000 copies of an anti-soMOZA

caricature in order to sell them and raise funds

for university student grants.

There are no OSN, SAC or Station traces on' the other

persons mentioned in letter nunhar 2 of the raference.

i: *1:0

Both ZABOTH and the Chief of Station have discussed

with AMBIDDY-1 the "intelligence net" mentioned by the reference.

The stated Station position was

"we are happy to maintain con-

tact with you and to discuss this matter from time tr time on an

Informal and personal basis, but the policy of our organization

¡s that we do not engage in

intelligence activities in a friendly

country except in coordination with the local government.

Therefore; even though you asture us that General SOMOZA knowa

and approves this activity, we would have to have a tirect ra-

quest from him before we could cooperate with you in any kind

of an official capacity."

This appears to have sufficied to bep.

our lines open to those involved witliout committing us to de

anything more than listan.

MIAMI, 3 April 1967 :

DeAr J1I,

Pardos us lateness in writing, but I have had to run around

& lot, The fundamental subjects which I wished to discuss

1. I was displeased when our Nicaraguan friend discussed

the eubject of the implements which we had in Bluelfield

with General Somoza before I had discussed anything with

him (Genral Sonoza); above all without oven consulting

with me bofore he went ahead and did 1t, this put me in

& difficult position with the Government. This 1 what I

discussed witt. Carlos:

ca11 Somoza that

enother place which is less accessible. Me agreed with

no on consulting with the company, and the answer he gave

to (b) was that Till he planted the "other Ixlend" in with

Somoza, and nothing else was sald. Thank God that I did

Fa11 on that job, and I did pass some unpleasant moments.

2.During Somozas' stay in the USA I have seen him Irequently

and I have taken American Investors, who wish to put their

englial to work In Nicaragus, to see hill. He have conversed

soplously about his projects. He wants to do the following:

Turn over his power when hia mandato la terminatod. Raisa

farmers the chance to take their products to big markets,

through the construction of highways, silos to store grains

and favorable legislation for the snall farmers. The

only thing that worries me is the extraordinary influence

that "Che Lainez" has on him in economics. There are

diverse comentaries about this individual on whether he 18

a nonber of the Connunist Party of not; but the truth 1e

(I know him personally) that he is a social outcast, bitter,

ivery intelligent and very ambitious. Furthernore, when

he tries to please someone he acts like their servant. Il

he 1s not a Conmunist then he is easy material for the

communists.

3. Somoza has promised me to continue to nove the subject

0f Cuba to the Irternational 'spheres, and 1n his appearance

In meet the press" he has already done 1t.

!. There 18 a 'GARCIA" who 18 a syndicate leader of the

wharfs? of New York, who through Adolfo Jimenez told me

about & new invasion that was planned for Haiti, directed

by me and leaving Irom Nicaragua... I responded segativoly.

It seens that they spoke with others about the project and

& runor started which said that I was preparing an Invasion

01 Halti Iron Nicaragua; I then went to see the Haltian consul

1n Hiant to make 1t clear to him and his Government that 1

was not an adventurer, and that neither I nor the Nicaraguan

Government had the slightest intention of interfering with

The consul has now to!? 1a that Duvalier vishes to speak

with ae. I told him that I would be glad to speak with hin

when he wished and when the interview would be kept secret.

I think that this interview could be useful, for I bave

found that the Haltian Government has a grudge agalast the

U.S. I do not know what we will spoak about but I think

that I can get some good information for you (plural).

S. I think that we can expect violent rovolts in Nicaragua,

I thiak that the dismissal of Raul Castro and Vilma Espin

and cultural revolutinn of China" surprisid us.

I bellove that pronaganda for CUBA should be centered on

planting distrust in the Armed Forces

and on making Fidel

Castro appear unstable as a person. Il ho has not even

boos faithlul to his own "brother," then what can the rest

of thon oxpoct 1f they are not even his relatives? I think

that we should emphasize the furdamental part that Raul and

Vilma had in consolidation of Castrolan and 1t5 xine to power.

I do not think that Almelda das the control nor the

Influence over the Arry that Raul had, and therefore a

conspiracy and revolt of the Armed forces is easier.

There 1s no doubt tiat Fidel do assigning key posts to

mon and women who are his porsonal Irlends, without

regard to whether they are good or bad Communists. This

Is going to bring ab.ut problons with the old guard of the

Communist Party and with the people in the new guard who have

boon hastily taught Fidel'a doctrine but have received

Sommunist indoctrination (many of them sympathize with Raul).

"It seems that russia 1s vory displeased with Fidel and

1t would not surprise me 11 funsla would try to cause an

attack on him; we should inadhuate this in the propaganda

agalnst CastIo for we know that his paranoic mentality and

his disgust for sussia would most emphatically make him

start to purify and trio roprisals against Moscow's unconditional

demands; an atmosphere of tension would then be created

between Russia and F1del.

until everything is taken out. That will take part of this

given him for last month I will have to give him

MEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: @ Teraination of Hanuel Artine Buesa

1.

o the night of 13 agnuary 1967 the uriter usin

ne operational aliag James E

Wilson met with Artime in a

room in the Hotel Columbus in Miaul, Florida.

The purpose

of the meeting was to formally terminato Artime's aggociation

with the Agency.

This Involved the obtaining of termination

Secrecy Oath and Quit Claim, the payment of $3,000 to cover

the final periodical payment through 31 Docember 1866 and

obtaining outstanding receipts.

z.

The mosting was cordial and all paper work involved

In the proceedings was accomplished without incident.

There

was of course the expected lengthy discussion on what he had

done (or tried to do) for the Agoncy in the past and an un-

doubtedly sincere effort to impress upon ne that he was ready

and willing for any task ho might be callod upon to do in

the futuro.

Artime made only one request a rather passionate

one--for financial assistance for the immediate family memberg

of two Hovement for the Recuperation of the Revolution (MRR)

members who were executed so the regult of operational missiong

to Cuba and the wife of anucher who is serving a 30-year

sentence. (It will be recalled that Artime hag been furnishing

receipts for the $3,000 he has been receiving in recent months

claiming that the money goes to the families of MRR members

who have lost their llves or been imprisoned while on MRR

aissions.)

We are examining these three cases and if worthy

will arrange for financial benefits under the "survivors and

martyrs" section of the AlBUD activity.

4.

Artime has a sterile Headquarters telephore number

Fe was nut "'¿couraged

In maintaining a loss contact by

1f ho had any itemn of interest to pags along and was assured

that if ho ever had any "new" 1dras, if he put them in writing,

they would be studied.

It was, however, made very clear to

him that his formal assoclation with the Agency was terminated

and that there was no prospect of any ¿inancial aggistence i.

the foreseeable future.

15 December 1966 and was told to pass

It on to his ileadquarters contact for proper hanuling. and

distribution.

This report is forwarded as a follow-up in

case the information failed to set into proper channels, as

It has a direct connection with Reference A and is a sequel

to Reference B.

Between 7 and 13 December 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked

times with Frank MARSiALL, at the

latter's request.

MARSHALL First called AMBIDDY=1

and asked if they could meet

at MARSilALL's office

to talk about the possibility of MARSHALLi

investing in the business proposition in which AMBIDDY-1 was

involved.

(A concession for a commercial record player with

a telavision type screen on which scenes are displayed which

ars supposed to be synchronized with the music.)

After two

auch meetings, which AMHIDDY-I describad as "get-acquainted"

and "feeling-out" sessions (the two men had never met in par

sos praviously),: MARSHALL asked if he could visit AMSIDDY-1

privately

in his hotel room.

They met on 12 December 1966 at

AYBIDDY-1 replied that the weapons in

so press the point, saying he kney there were otners.

AMBIDDY-1 at last reluctantly admitted that he did have

few more scattered around under tight security the says this

is not true, in fact), but indicated that he had other plans

for their use.

MARSHAL! paid he did not, camp where they

were or what

they cost, he would buy then.

AMBIDDY-1 asked

him why he wanted weapons so badly, and MARSAlL replied that

he was always in the market for weapons.

AYBIDDY-I said he

was aware of that fact, but this did not sound like just

another routine business deal.

He went on

to say that he

would not even consider releasing any of his aras without

knowing where they were going and for what use, and that he

had heard that MARSHALL had sold weapons previously to the

Communists.

He would have nothing, to do with sun an opera-

regardless of any possible profit in it.

He tried to

Licit as much information as possible, but got very little.

MARSHALL said they had a common friend

In General SOMOZA,

and MARSHALL had een bitter enemies up until about the dat

those years.

AMBIDDY-1 said he had to know how rany armas

were wanted, when, where, and for what purpose. Marshall said

he wanted all he could get, as soon as possible, in Costa RiCa,

and the reason was that he knew a roup was being prepared and

he wanted to get his own people ready in time.

AMBIDDY-1 said

he would have to think about the proposition and would give

him an answer in about three weeks.

(He intends to stall and

sake no conmitments, hoping to draw out more informition. He

will not agree to sell any arms.)

1. On 7 Deceaber 1966, AMBIDDY-1 talked with Daniel

ODUBER at the lattar's office.

ODUBER said he was worried

about all the talk of coup plotting, weapons and other indica-

tors of posaibla violence.

ODUBER

again mentioned to AMBIDDY-1

that ha had a finca on the Pacific Coast near the Nicaraguan

border which has an airstrip adequate for a C.46 or C-47

type aircraft,. and made an effort to feel out AMBIDDY-1 about

the possibility of landing arms on that airstrip. AMBIDDY-1

nonconnital and ODUBER did not press the point.

бо

AMBIDDY-1 said (as his opinion) that he had gotten

the impression from talking with MARSHAll and ODUBER that.
