B. A usually reliable source has reported a conversation

about the possibilities of re-shipping goods to Cuba througn

Brazil. HERNANDEZ said that Ruben SUAREZ Y Alvarez, representative

Another Cuban exile reported that Byron Cameron,

Among the

persons attending the neeting were Teofile Babun Franco,

co-owner of the

Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation,

Miami, and two of Babun's employees,

Oscar Fernandez

Viego and Eliseo Gomez'Fernandez.

Babun and Cameron are

friendly shipping-business competitors in the Caribbean

area.

During the course of conversation at this meeting,

Cameron mentioned that he was in contact with an unidenti-

the Cameron group

and Ernesto "Che'".

Guevara.

After a preliminary discussion at the 3 Harch

meeting,

it was thought that the amount

of $150,000 for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $5,000

money,

payable in acvance, was too high, and Babun felt

that this situation was just another attempt to swindle

patriotic_Cuban exiles.

Another meeting was then held

on 5 liarch and a counter-offer of $100,000 was made for

the assassination of Fidel Castro, plus $2,500 for ex-

penses, payable in advance.

Cameron promised to check

with his contacts after returning from a trip to the

Caribbean.

During a meeting on 15 March attended by Cameron

and Babun and his associates, the following terms were

agreed upon for the assassination of the Cuban officials:

Fidel Castro, $100,000; Raul Castro, $20,000; Ernesto

"Che" Guevara, $20,000; and $2,500 for expenses, payable

in advance.

The time-limit for the proposed mission

would be 90 days from the date when Babun could verify

In early April 1964 Eliseo Gomez Fernandéz met

with Jose

"Pepin" Bosch.

Bosch agreed to advance $100,000

and Babun and his associates would advance $2,500 for

expenses.

JulLoLobo Mavarria, a wealthy Cuban exile

in New York, subsequently agreed to the terms, provided

that his name was not involved.

Babun gave

advised his

group, and

on 25 April he reported that his group had

already called its man in Cuba and told him

to proceed

as planned and that "their other man" would be heading

for cuba shortly.

The final comment was

"we hope to

have some good news for you between 20 and 25 Hay." .

Lobo planned to fly to Miami on 19 May to arrange

for

the transfer of $100,000 to a safety deposit box, the

keys to which are to be held jointly by Cameron and a

confidant of Lobo.

7.

The identitles of the persons in the Cameron

group and how they plan

to proceed with this mission

are not known. Babun's associates are reluctant to

nake any unnecessary queries because they have invested

$2,500 and because Cameron made it fairly clear at the

beginning that the Mafia was involved.

police officer in the St. Louis, Missourl, Vice Squad

who was about to retire and who

has numerous connections

in the lafia.

Cameron implied that "the other man" in

question is in spain.

Cameron knows that he could be

indicted for conspiracy and that if there is any

treachery on his part, Babun and his associates would

not hesitate to sink his ship, the M/V CAYMAN HOPE.

In late May 1964 a prominent Cuban exile who

spoke with Jose "Pepin" Bosch reported that Teofilo

Babun and Eliseo Gomez had a plan under way to assas-

de1 105-82-555-3263

1. Reference la made to your letter, dated 13 April 1964,

captioned "Lee Harvey OSWALD, Internal Security • Rassia •

Cuba", and to the attachment which contained statemente made

by one, Eugene J:

HOBBS, HMC, USN. Your letter requested

certain informátion regarding subject's Marine assignment at the

Naval Air Station, Atsugi, Japan, in 1957 and 1958. The remarks

furnisbed below are addressed to the contents of your letter and

to the statements in the attachment.

2. The Ateugi Naval Alr Station le located approximately

35 miles south and west of Tokyo, Japan. At the time in question,

Atsugi was a "closed" base in the sense that Americas and in-

digenous personnel entering the Station were required to possess

official identification carde. Within the Station, the flight line

areas were restricted, as la the case of all such Stations, and

certain hangar areas were further restricted for the performance

of classified functions.

Gott

3. The Joint Technical Advisory Group (JTAG) occupied

an area within the Station, consisting of 20 to 25 individual

residences, two dormitories, an office area, a power plant

!!

BeTATal Butler-type warehouses, and & club building used for

recreation and a bachelor officers' mess.

The JTAG aTOR WAS

anion ares and there was no occasion for the regularly assigned

ration personnel to visit the TAG arel. The club war open only

do 5TAG personnel and their gueste. Two of the living quarters

wese occupied by the Navy commanding officer and his deputy

Lechase the quarter a at JIAG were of better quality then the

housing accommodations provided at the Station.

4. JIAG air activities were conducted from a classified

bangar ares at one end of the flight line. OSWALD did not have

access to this area. Prlor to the time in question, JTAG bad

been publicized by Radio Peking as being a headquarters for

American intelligence activity. For this reason, and because

JIAG was obvioualy not a part of the Naval Air Station complement,

there were rumors and gossip regarding the unit and its activities.

This condition was regarded as normal under such circumstances.

Being there at that time, OSWALD could have heard such gossip;

however, there la no information to indicate, nor la there reason

to belleve, that he obtained factual knowledge regarding JTAG and

Its mission. (For your information, an incident involving the

landing of a U-2 in a rice paddy in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan,

was reported in the preas and aroused some public interest. That

incident, however, occurred in December 1959, which was some

time after OSWALD had left Japan).

5.

There were no Navy personnel assigned to JTAG.

Moreover JTAG did not participate in, or transier any of, ita

activities to & Station in Baggkok. Regarding the statement by

HOBBS that & Navy Commander was recrulting Navy Personnel

for an assigament in Bangkok, it la noted that the Navy at that

time was conducting certain air reconnaissance activity from

Atsugi using other types of aircraft.

6. The following should be considered with respect to

your source's assertions that OSWALD's squadron was in Cubi

Point, Philippine Islands in January 1958 where it kept its gear.

In what the source now knows to have been a bangar for a U-2::

airplane; and that the squadron was back in Atsugi, Japan in

: May 1958.

The term "U-2" was not known publicly and did not

gain world-wide notoriety until the 111-fated Powers mission some

two years later. Therefore, it in highly unlikely that the term

"U-2" would have meant anything to OSWALD, even ll be had bea

It and had been able to identlly the term with any aircraft t dubiVED FRON

Point, at Atsugi or anywhere else.

7. To summarize: Thore is so evidence or indication that

OSWALD had any association with, or acceas to, the JAG

operation or its program in Japan. This applies also to iaformation

regarding the U-2 or its mieslon. Even lI OSWALD had seen a

U-2 aircraft at Atsugl or alsewhere, this fact would not have been .

considered musual nor have constituted a ureach of security.

Limited public exposure of the craft itself. but not of its nomen-

clature or mission • was accepted as a necessary flok. It is

most unlikely that OSWALD had the secessary prerequisites to

differentiate between the U-2 and other aircraft engaged in

classified missions which were similarly visible at Atsugi at the

same time.

that such a tape, if broadcast at all, was aired over a local USSR facility

for internal consumption.

2. With respect to the same question, Yurly NOSENKO was asked

II any attempt had been made by the soviets to exploit OSWALD for propa-

ganda purposes, such as Radio Moscow broadcasts, telecasts or lectures.

NOSENKO replied that this had not been done either in Moscow or in

Minsk. NOSENKO later reviewed this statement and confirmed it.

=. (1)

Source was queried on the OSWALD affair on 23 January

1964. Source reported that his own Department was involved

directly with OSWALD because OSWALD came to the USSR as a

tourist in 1959. He had not come to special Soviet attention in

any way until Source's Department received a report that OSWALI.

had asked to become a Soviet citizen. It was implied that Source

11992

himself examined OSWALD's request. The KGB decided to look:

into OSWALD's case to see if there was any operational interest,

which part of the KGB might have use for him and what was behin

the request. It was decided that OSWALD was of no interest

whatsoever so the KGB recommended that he merely go home to

RECORDIN

the U.S, as a returning tourist and there go through the formalities

•wita the Soviet Embassy of requesting to become a Soviet citizen.

OSWALD then made the dramatic gesture of suicide when he

received this response. He had been supposed to go on a trip

with other tourists but failed to show up for the group.

At his hotel

BHAY S

it was found that his key had not been turned in at the desk, so it

was presumed that he was still in his room.

ті.'.

Source himself was not present at this phase of the operatipa

but merely read a report of it.

(2) Now worried about the possibility that OSWALD would

do this again ll refused asylum, the Soviets decided to give him

& temporary residence permit although they had no intention of

giving him Soviet citizenship. We asked why he had been sent to

Minsk and Source replied that this was merely by chance. They

had not wanted OSWALD to stay in Moscow and Minsk was chosen

arbitrarily.

(3) Asked about Marina OSWALD, Source said that she was not

a contirmed Communist and had been thrown out of the Komsomol

for not paying her dues. She had so higher thoughts than to live a

good life, have better dresses and such things.

She was a stupid

woman and had no interest in improving herself. "From the Soviet

point of view she already had anti-Soviet characteristics. She was

not too smart anyway and not an educated person."

(4) Finally OSWALD got tired of living in Minsk and wanted

to go back to the U.S. He had married Marina and wanted to take

her with him. The Soviets decided to let them go and used Marina's

uncle to talk to them and peisuade OSWALD not to spread anti-Soviet

propaganda after his departure. The uncle pointed out that the

Soviet Government had allowed OSWALD to live here, that he had

married here and the Government was going to let his wife leave

with him, etc.

(5) Asked why the Government had allowed Marina to leave,

Source replied that this was perfectly natural.

She was legally

married and expressed the desire to leave with her husband. Under

Soviet law there is so question but what she would be allowed to leave.

(6) The thrust of Source's account was that neither OSWALD

nor his wife had at any time been of any interest whatsoever to

Soviet authorities, that there had not ever buen though!

given to recruiting either of them as agents and that, in e

fact, the Soviets were glad to get rid of them boir.

b. (1)

During an interview on 30 January 19id, Source

commented that "doctors examined (O5WALD) WALD) " and "cherc

mere no indications that he nas completuly a psycho." During

an ensuing discussion of the passible involvement of the Soviet

government in the assassination of President Kennudy, Source

stated, "No matter how l may hate anyone, but I cannot speak

against my convictions and since l know this case I could

unhesitatingly sign off to the fact that the Soviet Union cannot

be tied into this (assassination) in any way." He continued

that the KGB was frightened of OSWALD, and would not have

discussed such a matter with him. When the possibility of

recruiting OSWALD was brought up, the decision was "absolutely

not. " The only involvement permitted was to arrange for Marina

PRUSAKOV's uncle in the MVD [Col. Dya PRUSAKOV) to ask

OS WALD not to sprcad anti-Soviet propaganda in the US in vicu

of the fact that he had been allowed to stay in the USSR and was

being allowed to leave. Source commented that he was aware

that the KGB had no subseguent interest in OSWALD because

after the assassination of the President, Source had to make a

•complete investigation and even sent several KGB stall personnel

to Minsk to investigate on the spot, "not trusting official papers."

(2) When speaking of OSWALD's request to return to the USSR,

Source semarked that OSWALD "went to Mexico to apply for

permission to go to the USSR. Our people asked Moscow and we

said absolutely not because be is completely undesirable -- there

was no interest in him whatsoever."

(3) Asked his opinion on Cuban involvement in the assassination,

Source staled that he had no information on this subject, but he did

not believe that the Cuban government was involved. He gave as

& reason that if any word of such involvement had leaked out,

Cuba would have been crushed by the US.

This agency has no information which would speciacally corroborate

or disprove NOSENKO'& statements regrading Lee Harvey OSWALD.

QUARTERLY REVIEW

NOVEMBER, 1988

A SLOWING IN THE MILITARY

• Defense expenditures rose at more then a 84 billion

seasonally adjusted annual rate during the third

quarter ol 1966--tbe sharpest tale of adrance lor

any quarter since the cacalation in Vietnam began

in the spring of 1965. Unless the United States in-

volvement in Soutbeast Aris goes lar beyond the

levels eurrently contemplated by Pentagon straie

gists, the peak in the impact of defense procurement

on the economy may have already been reached.

This is not to say that the increase in delense spend-

ing is about to come to an abrupt halt or that the

rise in delense production is about to terminate.

Outstanding commitmento and programs already

underway virtually ensure a lurtber expansion of the

military establishment. However, what is most

critical to the economy as a whole is that the rate of

increase in spending is likely to slom down consid-

wably. Even allowing for a military personnel com

mitment in South Vietnem of & ball million men,

the advance in defense spending should become

little more then a modest updrift by the summer of

1967. This implies a slippage in orders for military

equipment in the dear luture.

It is a bit too carly to find any deinitive statistics

indicating that the scolerating rate of growth in

the militery establishment is about to be reversed.

To be sure, the Delense Department recently at-

nounced & marked reduction in draft calls, but there

Is some evidenoe that capacity limitations at training

senters, rather than a programmed slowdown in the

arred lordes buildup, was involved. Altbough mili-

tary prime contract awards dipped in August (tbe

barest reported figure) to the lowest level since

March, this may have been merely an adjustment

brought about by the exceptionally high level of

contract awards in July. Alo, the sharp upswing in

While the current crop of statistics is difficult to

and in the procurement of equipment presage a

slowing in momentum

By the end of this year, American military person

As far as can be ascertained, eurrent Pentagon strat

at the end of June. While some of the inventory in

Vietnam and in transit may represent a drawdown

ol stocks in otber areas of the world, it is nevertbeles

apparent that the inventory buildup has been quite

extensive. Earlier this year, aircraft sorties against

targets in both North and South Vietnam were being

launched at a rate of approximately 25 thouzand a

month dropping 45 thousand tons of air munitione.

While the sortie rate has not risens very much above

• that level, there has apparently been some modest

merease in munitions consumption.

It thus appears that the curent air munitions

production rate is running above foreseeable require

sente Consequently, some retrenchment in output

levels is clearly required to avoid an extraordinarily

large surplus of bombs, and rockets.

There is aiso some indication that ground ordnance

-ride ammunition, artillery shells and grenades

Jay require some adjustment as well. Nevertheless,

as combat operations in

• South Vietnam are ex-

panded with the larger U.S, involvement, consump-

tion of these items will continue to rise. However,

brase cartridge requirements for defense production

sisted for the fire quarter of 1967 are substantially

the same as those of the lourth quarter of 1966, This

say reflect a rise in inventories and some flattening

in the output sate

there sbould be a perceptible decline in tbe rate of

torease in the armed loroes a number of months

prior to tbe attainment of the peak level of involve

Production of air ordnanor bombs, rockets, ebells

specile kgures are clessiled, indications are that

such production has grown from approximately 50

tbousand tons s month to something in the ares of

rate for Vietnam operations as indicated by declassi-

Summing Up

Fitting the pieces of the delense espenditure

outlook togetber, in the context of the apparent

military strategy, implies further signifcant increases

to expenditures during the current quarter, with

modest increases thereafles through the summer of

1967. It appears that with the financing of a ball mil.

lion troops in South Vietnem defense expenditures

would run somewbere between 570 billion and 872

billion a year. (Such expenditures during the third

quarter of 1966 ran at a 8612 billion seasonally ad-

Justed annual rale.) At the present rale of expansion,

the 570 billion plus level will be reached sometime

in mid-1967, indicating & virtual fattening in es-

penditures tberealter.

Forecasis of US. military expenditures in recent

years have been notoriously off the mark and, indeed,

our expectation of a slowing in the rate of outlays

could easily go awry. Certainly, bould the Vietnam

buildup be escalated beyond the 500 tbousand man

level or should a crisis erupt eleethere in the world,

the outlook would be fos a seemingly open-ended

expansion in our military establishment

The more intriguing alternative, and bopefully

the more probable, is how much-could militery

expenditures be eut should a truce be reached in

Vietnam sometime in 1967 followed by & US. troop

withdrawal?

May estimate of the extent ol the reduction must

Test upon some judgment of the cort of the was in

Vietnam at the beight of our involvement. While

such estimates can be only approximate, owing to

the paucity of orcial information, it is nevertbeless

posable to develop geDeral orders of magnitude. I1,

lor example, me add the cost of aircrall lorees, muni.

personsel in the logistic and training pipelines, we

artive at a figure of approximately 82 billion a montb.

Although at a 870 billion to 872 billion level of

delense expenditures, it might be supposed that all

costs of the Vietnam war would be met out of current

expenditures, & cessation of the war is most unlikely

to bring the level of delense outlays down by a full

S24 billion. In the first instance, some of the expenses

properly charged to Vietnam, such as personnel and

basic maintenance costs of the 7th Fleet, currently

stationed off Vietnam, would go on war of so war.

Bo would some of the costs of the eir force bases in

Thailand. Hence, should the war terminate and the

armed forces be reduced by nearly a million men,

defense expenditures would probably fall back to

somewbere between a §50 billion to 855 billion annual

rate.

The Economic Consequences of Peace

A truce and withdrawal ol American troope ear-

lier this year would have come during a period of

expanding civilian markets. Such an event would

probably have forestalled the stringency in the

money markets last summer and presumably would

have contributed to a more balanced, soninflationary

prowth of the economy.

Bhould & truce be reached after the Vietnan

escalation has run its course and defense expendin unes

have risen to a more than $70 billion level, the de

Rationary impact on the economy could be rather

significant. A truce reached earlier this year would

probably have involved a decline in delense speading

of only 85 billion to 810 billion. A truce reached, tay.

in the summer of 1967 could precipitate a drop in

military outlays of more then 8$15 billion, Moreover,

the falloil in military expenditures might well be

occurring about the same time
