These small new details are alarming, for they

The NaziSS

reached this state only at the very last stages of its existence. In

this sense the world of the concentration camp develops like a

cancer within society, corrupting the executioner along with the

victim.

A CALL TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE

say so as clearly as possible.

So long as the Rus-

Out of the cacophony of the thousands of documented reports

the "concentration camp man"

emerges.

He is nightmarishly

typical. He is hungry, sick and afraid. He lives in wooden bar

racks, or under a tent, or in earth caves.

His fate is locked be.

tween barbed wire barricades, beneath observation towers. Unde

constant threat of dogs and rifles, he works far beyond the powe

of his muscles. Given.neither the means nor time to wash, he wear

foul rags.

He is awakened before down; at night, having returned

exhausted from work, he stands in an interminable line, near a hos

pital lacking medicaments. In the middle of the night, in every

kind of weather, he is aroused by blows to unload freight cars. Thi

is a faithful condensation of hundieds of reports- and thousand:

The world of the concentration comp keeps growing. Yester

day the Soviet Union had only political detention camps.

cruel civil wer of the collectivization period started her on this en

terprise of forced labor which plays its part in every economic see

spreads across Siberia to the White Sea and the Baltie, from th

very outskirts of Leningrad and Moscow to Baku.

During nearly their entire existence, the Nazi camps were bu

during the last years did they become an integral part of a sidiet

founded on a new type of human exploitation. In Russia this deve

The class that organizes the camp

These camps are thu

And. it is this unique quality of the Sovie

system of concentration camps which fills us with such horror.

Imagine the mass graves of the old Buchenwald erupting wit

a resurrection of their dead, delegates of a protesting humanit

Th

strongest obscenities would be too weok. Millions of men toda

THESE ARE THE FACTS:

Within the Sovier sphere, a system of concentration

camps exists, rivaling in exterit and horror those of Nazi

Germany. President Truman has stated, on the best au-

Phority arailable to him, that the Russians hold 16 million

hopeless human beings in these camps.

On the basis of thousands of documented reports from

errapees from behind the Iron Curtain, the distinguished

Frarich writer, David Roussat, issued his appeal to human.

ity, reprinted in abridged form sbore, for an investigation:

into the Soviet concentration camp system.

Me. Rousset's demand deserves the fullest attention

of the Ameriern people. We of the Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaige hare therefore undertakén to make there facto

known as a publie service. We will not keep silent before

this monstrous international erime, now driving thousands

of human beings, destituto, through the Iron Curtain. Nor

shall me abandon those who flee the Soviet terror.

Therefore me call on the American people:

+(1) To join with Mr. Rousset in demanding an impartial

investigation of the Soriet concentration.camp system.

(2) To support the Iron Curtain Refugee Campaign so Phat

Christocher Einet

Member of the Board of the I.R.C.

Two years ugo the International Rescue Comnittee started 1ts

Iron Curtain Refugee Cunpulgn under Adniral Byra, which has con-

tinues under the Chairmanshly of General Spaatz.

this year, in

response to an increasing need, the Committee launched an extended

program to raise fuids to set up reception centers for refugees along

the Iron Curtain, to be krown us Frontler Frecion Stations.

head or me pere arone contone, as hailed this project as a most

this project as a nost

vital and neglected phase of the fight aguinst Comunist aggression.

Mr. Jackson pointed out that one of the most successful subjects of

Soriet propaganda was the neglect of the anti-Commist refugees in

the lest, a neglect which makes a mockery of our professed sympathy

for the enslaved peoples.

The Iron Curtaln Campaign is not only necessary to encourage and

best use of the anti-Communist refugees,

it is also the most

dranstic and persuasive kind of anti-Colmunist propagunda in America

aud throughout the western world by publicizing the versonal stories

of those who risked their lives to choose freedon.

Its work is huaani-

tarian and only indirectly political, out the political effect is all

the greater for that reason.

slinor Lipper,

whose book "Eleven Years In Soviet Prison Camps"

1s the most authentic document on soviet slave 1ab0r,

has come to this

country to help raise funds for these Frontier Stations.

Rowever, be-

lore her arrival, evidence of a whispering campaign against the Inter-

national Rescue Committee became clearly apparent.

Berore the dinner

for Miss Lipper on October 3lst, which was addressed by General lede-

Governor John Lodge of Connecticut and Mrs. Miram Cole Houghtan,

President of the General Federation of Women's Clues, all the speakers

were confidentially approached in efforts to dissuade them from co-

operating with the Committee.

Most of the rumors and criticisms were based on the alleged nar-

roi socialist nature of the INC policy and personnel.

thet the Frontler Stations would only help "Socialist" refugees. It

was even intivated by some who regard Communists and Socialists as

equally dangerous that the IRC was or might be a disguised Communist

It was also alleged thut David Martin, Executive Director of the

and that he had secretly changed his

name to Martin in order to cover his Communist past.

The facts are that David Martin, who was born and educated in

Canada, never had any connection with either the Canadian or the amer

ican Communist parties.

He was a Socialist and has active in the

Canadian labor movement in his youth, but he was never a Communist

and he is a socialist no longer.

of his family wished to do so and far from making a secret of this he

explicitly states it in minors thor.

Souice of tharres

The ortgin of the attucks on Nartin and the IRC have been truced

to Czarist bhilte Russian sources, with an anti-semitic buckground, who

are affillated with like minded grougs in Americz.

Most of the at-

tacks have been by word of mouth

The only document we have discovered

1s un anonsmous attack on the IRc which purports to be hritten by a

British Intelligence Officer.

This attacks Eugene Lions, head of the

• Comnittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia,

and charges that

Lyons, Maruin and the Stute Departent are all engaged in a plot to

back Russian Socialists to the evelision of all other anti-Communist

refugees:

the absuruity of the clarges vecomes apparent from the fact

that Eugene Lyons himself shares Mr. Hoover's economic views and works

for the REiDER'S DIGEST.

lillian Benry Chamberlin, a menber of the

-Lyons committee,

is a columnist for the hAlL STReET JouRNaL and an

editor of the conservative nows letter, HUMAN EVENTS, and Isaac Don

Levine, a leading

representative si the Lyons committec in Europe

nolas sirular conservative econome viers,

as reflected in the edi-

corlal policy of PLAIN TAili magusine of which he was founder and cditor.

Nevertheless,

absurd as the charges are, they have been highly

effective, decause

they have been circulated

by some people with Im

portant social and

business connections among business men who know

nothing of the confused Russian religec picture.

When so muny demands

are mide for funds in connection hith anti-Communist and humanitarian

causes the mere element of doubt is suificient to prevent donations,

and most people haven't the time or interest to make a detailed in-

vestigation.

Mr. Vadin Makaroff,

a Russian Czarist refugee who is married to a

rich American woman who

is socially well connected

has been the most

active promoter of the attack.

He has boasted that he cost the Iron

Curtain Campaign $200,000.00 by his efforts with one group of fifty

very rich business men, who had been ready to contribute generously

after hearirs Miss Lipper at a meeting of

roff's political viens and background can be judged by the feet that

he 1s a Director of Merwin K. Hurt's organization.

The sttscis have been very saillfully timed because General Spaatz

had reluctantly agreed to becone Chairman (since he hates public speak-

etc.) and only consented to serve for one year "because of the ex-

contional palitical Importance of the Iron Custeth Refugee Campaign.

His term of office lapsed in November.

Meanwhile the smear campaign

has made it virtually impossible to get a nei Chairnan of national

stature becsuse the need to investigate and combat the charges will

make greater denands on the Chairman's time.

In the absence of a new

of sinilar standing the salse Impression is conveyed that Gen-

eral Spaate resigned because he disapproves of the Committee.

Another reason why the att.ck is damaging is that the Frontier

Freedom Stations project is so great in scope, and the

Ever since 1943 David Martin had been corking on his book about

Tito's recent reforms in order to get help from the west, althoigh

are still far from adequate.

Immediately after the close of the work of the Minallovich Commit-

Dürid Martin went to England, Germany and Italy to Investigate the

plight of the

Yugoslay refugces fron Tito, and of other unti-Communist

On his return he organised with me the Refugees' Defense Com-

mittee, which

fought the battle of the anti-Corimunist refugees fron be-

hind the Iron Curtuin, Including the Russians who were being repatriated

to russia under the Yalte greement against their will, and who were

discriminated against uy ViRRA.

Mr. Martin was the Secretary of the

American Committee

and did prictically all the work.

We collaborated

closely with the British Refugee Defense Committee, hesded by Lord Halffax.

As the attached clippings show, our Committee accomplished almost

the only really effoctive ind widely publicized work in exposing the

Communist infiltration and exploitation of UNPRA in some countries.

Martin actually succeeded in reversing some of UNRRA's Policies In re-

gard to the repatriation of anti-Communist refugees behind the Iron

•Curtain.

To do this effectively required imense work, research and

documentation for which David Martin was almost wholly

Mr. Martin also worked with the leaders of the Internatlonal

Peasent Union and helped to lrait and publicize their appeal to the

UN to investigate Sovlet persecution in their countries (in the Balkans

and Central Europe)

on Septenber 29, 1947.

This appesi vas carried on

the front pages of

the New York nerspapers and was widely reported

throughout the world. It set a precedent for other similar appeals.

Martin also organized a Committee to ald the Baltic University-

1n-Exile in Wester Germiny.

This University was then

to preserve the culture of those small countries which were the victims

of Soviet aggression and Genocide.

Record of the Internutional Rescue Connittee

In 1948 David Martin began to work professionally for the Inter-

natlonal Rescue Committee, while continuing his volunteer work for the

Refugees! Defense Committee, He worked at first as Assistant Director

of. the IRC under Sheba Strunsky, niece of the late Simon Strunsky, whose

witty and conservative column "Topics of the Times" appeared on

1 torial page of The New York Times.

the Refugees!: Delense Comnittee.

Although the International Rescue Committee 1s a straight reller

and resettlement oiganization,

not a political comnittee.

it has been

almost the only american groun to ald and resettle anti-Communist as

well as anti-fascist refugees,

regardless of religion or nationality.

As such,

its work has not only rendered a great humanitarian service,

but,

indirectly,

It has also rendered a great political educational ser-

vice to the anti-Communist cause

by pubilcizing the sullerings of the

victins or Soviet percecution and expiaining why they

sought to escape,

or refuses to return.

Other great relier organications,

such as the

Vational Catholic Wer Relier Services,

have rendered a

similar service,

We have recoived a number of applications for

employment with the Dom Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan.

These applications are for highly skilled professionals in

The applicationg were

submitted to Dow by frank Christensen, Director of Resettlonent,

International Rescue Committee, which is a Ford Foundation

sponsored project.

2.: In view. of possible arrangements between Ford

Foundation and CIA, ve wonderod if our contacting Christensan

would be disruptive.

We, of course, would like to have their

assistance through Christenson, their representative hero,

regarding contact with DPs.

If everything proceeds according

In this connection, Martin montioned the fact that these stations would

opportunity for intelligenco work.

Ho oftered to employ

any person recoumended by CLi and to make available to such persons all pertinent

files and facilities without the knowledge of other IRC personnel. : Details bould

have to be borked out in the near future.

Farthermore, martin requested an opportunity to discuss the subject of

security with responsible Ch officiala.

He is concerned both about the physica

security of the various frontier stations and about the arclusion of infiltration

agents. Soperate discussions covering the various stations night be necessary.

Martin has held discussiens rezarding this project with various State

In preliminary discussions, these

people are described by Martin as being favorably disposod toward the project of the

frontier stations, pending reactions fran the fiold.. Martin is currently in lash-

IRi- F5561

Dear Sir,

I sish to acknowledge your litter of 21 August 1951, in sbich you

set forth the Interest

of the Harvard Univercity Library in securing cer-

tais docusents or nicroflins thereof of Individual displaced persons o.

refigees. vio have been of concern to the Interratioral Refugee Organiza-

I uderstand fully jour interest in recuring these docients. and

while I vould 1lk: la coupl with your renuest I do not think it will be

possibie to do so for reacons which I will set forth velou.

The question oi docuentation of individual refugces and of ac-

cess to such documente has leen a natter of conalderable controversy ever

sinse 1945. first in UNRRA and later in the IRO. hE a result of basic dif-

ferences in political views concerning the hardling of displaced persons

and refuges it has been recessary to isfeguard all indliidual dossiers

with the greatest of care.

These dossiers contain not only facts about the

Individusl refugee and his Immediate family, but also about his reistives,

many of then are not displaced persons and are cbill in their countries of

origin.

As a natter of fact, the Organization sed a great deal of diff1-

culty in securing toe cooperation of individual airplaced persons in con-

pleting ou: Registration Forns, because of the fear that these refugees bad

that such data night fall into the hands of individuals, institutions or

goverments which might take punitive action aga'ast relatives or displaced

persons refusing to return to

their countr?

of orizln. The IRO assured all

displaced persons that their perconal records aml documents vould le sale-

guarded to as gent an extent as posaible and voila be made availatle to

goverrments only for the purpose of directly

ass'eting in securing the re-

settlement airoed of the i:dividual concerned.

He have attempted in every

way to fallen this policy consistently.

As ve

approach the end of IRO opcratione, ve are makiag plaus for

the dispo.al of the

I:diviaval case records either by giving thes to govern-

ments la the couatzles of raception, or y destriction of the recoris. or

where the refugeet are

still in Germasy or Austrla, by turring the docuients

over to the United lations High Connissioner for Refugees. I regret tbere-

fore thes in view of the security factors Involved, 1t vill not be possiule

to agree to jour proposal that certain ai these ladlildual recoros be made

available to you for purposes of aistoricai researcia.

I might add, 1f you will permit an expression of opision on the

aunject, that unless you were to secure a complete eet of records, 1t 1s

sost unlikely that the type ci saipllig suggested in your letter vould

Through the Curtain

Despite the apparent Impenetra-

blilty of the iron curtain between

East and West, refugees from Red

isranny continue to make their way

into free territory at a rale of 500

to 1500 a week.

They

bring

with

them not only

vital intelligence of what goes on in

the Red-dominated sectors. of Europe,

but in many cases real talents and

abilities which can be used to help our.

cause.

They also bring hope.

They

are living reminders that ordinary:

decent people are not easily sold on

the fraud of Marxism, Russian-style,

and that democracy still attracts free-

minded men if they have any kind of

& choice.

Unfortunately, these iron curtain

refugees are not getting a very warm

reception on our side now.

They land

with a horde of other displaced per-

sons, but they are not technically qua-

lifed to teceive D.P: ald. Neither is

the International Refugee Organiza-

tion equinped to handie their problems.

And unless some answer in their

needs is found soon, they will be com-

pelled to believe Russian propaganda

that western freedom is "Inindom to

starve."

It is to be hoped that some aficial

program will eventually be esolved to

ald them in finding a permanent new

piace.

Their talents, like those of the

other D.P.'s, can certainly be used in

the mobilization prior ahead.

E: 296-518-119962

Punding such arrangements, how.

ever, it is vital that their minimum ra

quinserts be met through private

charity. General Carl Spaatz has just

accepind the chairmanship of the 2 non

urtain Refugee Campaisn." which i

oraniang such ati, in the belled that

it will materially assist our security

as well as serving a humanitarian pur

pose.

Contributions may. be sent to

the campaign, care of the Interna-

6d West

We should not let down any' person

who turns to us through the curtain,

because every one helps us in our pur

pose eventually to destroy the curtaini

Iron Curtain Refugees

ACCORDING to Soviet propaganda the West's much-

a theme stressed over and over again inan

effort. to reconcile the victims of Red tyranny to their

fate, and more particularly to discourage them from

attempting to escape from bondage.

Even without propaganda, the risks Involved in flight

from the Red bloc are enough to deter all but the most

spirited. If they are not shot down by the frontier

guards, they are sent to & living death in Siberia. Never-

theless, from 500 to 1,500 people risk their lives

each

week In a desperate gamble for freedom.

Gen Carl. Spaalz, former chief of the Air Force, estl-

mates

that during the past three years 300,000 men,

women and children have broken through the Iron

Tenccepting chairmanship.of the campaign to raise

$1 Millon to make the lot or these refugees easier once

they have escaped from the Soviet worid, Gen Spaatz

said he had done so because, he viewed the movement

besond its hunanitarian purposes as something

"vital

to our national security." He cited the cases of three

eminent Russian scientists iho had been assisted after

their escape and who brought valuable information

about Soviet progress in nuclear research.

signilicant fact:

"Among them are people who have been

providing us with an understanding of the Sovict

mentality as well as with vital intelligence. on

what is happening behind the Iron Curtain.''

Gen. Spant cited the cases of three eminent

Russian

scientises who had been assisted by

the Intemationai Rescue Committee after their

One, he said, was among "the foremoss

Russian nuclear physicists under-whose Jirec-

tiod a vital program of nuclear research. was

carried out at a major Russian university."

Ал-

other,

he said, was "engaged. in important geo

logical surveys in the Tashkent area of

the

U'SSR, now beliered to be a proving ground for

Soviet atomic experiments." The third, accord-

ing to thè general, was a "very prominens geola-

gist" who had surveyed Arctic areas of the

USSR "now reported lo be the sites of secret

air bases."

Lest anyone be learful shat the Sovicks are de-

liberately, planning-the escape of enemy agents

under the guise of relugces; Ges. Spantz said

that, with the screening given by the goveri

ment, there was slight chance that enemy agents

• could enter this country as, relugees.

The or

ganization gives aid only to those who, in addi-

tion so being anti-Communist, have given indi-

cation of their opposition to Nazism.

Hence we have here a campaign which ought

to appeal to every Amencan.

It not only offers

help to relugees from Red oppression, a most

charitable undertaking, but it serves lo increase

the security of the United Stales and the remala-

der of the free world.

ently as a ruservoir of sourco loads, and a nunber a hile characters, such aa

Lysenko, have bogs exploited and Interogated by CIA.

It 1s a reasonablo: probability

that we have bean in touch with all his charaders who hare my momise from our

standpoint,. am Inornation exists on these charactors in Indax.

' It Is also &

reasonable probability that the IRC stable of displuced parsons is a no more

promising group tish the roster of displaced porsons brought. In by the ut heran

Councll, the NarC, so siy other argenimation operating in the business.

Tho only

differenco 1s that birdin's smart publicity work gets a story in the paper and he

tags the tem "spelalists" on his DP's.

Actually, tharafare, what wright Flold

1s asking for is an ansarted segrent of suma 400,000 displacod persona non in the

US. It would appoar. to promise mich botter service for then if they formlated

to us the type of persons they have possible interest in, and aksed us to elve than

data from our filos and from any agencies vith which we do businoss. Actually,

Le they have sona jason for wishing the entire tists files ar a singla outfit,

there is a Committee for the Placement of Displacod Professionals (nave unexact

which serves as a algaring house and deals through all the oher agencies such

as the Cithollo, Laceran, and Jewish agencies,

In the resettlement of persons

who actually have higar and epecialised educational bad grounds.

Tals ratfit 1s

also a NY sourca, and our office there has full accose to their fileo..

If Wright

Flalds vants end es justify a spcal and time consuming 10b, this mould bo the

bost outfit to tap.

3.. Shaffer and i both agroo that 1t 18 proper und appropriato to check this

raguirement back to fright Fiedl through our om chainals.

Off hand, it would

appear that a contiruing guido, lth clear outlines of the types of poople of

Interest to Wright Fiold, muld bo the most fruitiul may to handle this 18 all

partlos so agread..

empire for the freer air of western

democracies if they could be sure of

jobs to support themselves.

The potential salue of these people

with their knowledge and skills in the

struggle to protect the world against

Communist tyranny is inestimable

Some of them who recently have come

through the Iron Curtain and to the

United States include a leading Rus

sian nuclear phasicist and a promi

nent oil geologist Many more, due to

the strictness of American immigra

tion laws, can get only as far as France

or West Germany.

Still others, with information which

could be of immense value to the. free

powers, would

like to leave Soviet

Russia or its satellites, but dare not

do so

because they do not know

whether, being destitute, they can

find the means of survival. To them,

and to thousands who lately have

fled from Soviet dominated countries,

Communist propaganda shouts that

"political freedom in the West mears

'freedom to starve.'"

It that is all that awaits them, many

will accept terror and misery under

Communist rule rather than risk pov-

BERLIN (Westérn Sector):

In response to the Communist threat to take over Berlin

by means of a Soriet Whitsuntide youth inrasion last May, the

Iron Curtain Refugos Campsign launched "Project Berlin."

Replying to a special appeal, indiridual Americans and American

business enterprises contributed enough to permit the shipment

of almost 4,000:000 Ibs, of butter, cheese, milk and egg poder,

children's canned tood, and clothing.

This aid and the continuing

serrices of all kinds are administered by our Berlin office in the

elcsest cooperation

with Genoral Maxwell

mander in Berlin, and Ernat Reuter, Mayor

tance berwgen themselres and the Communiat police appararus.

Since there are no camps of ary kind in the Paris area, the 60.000

refugies there are among the most destitute in Europe.

dreda of these escapees come to the IRC's Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaign office ergry reception morning to ask for tood parcela

or clothing or adrice. On the busiest morning this your, 500 food

parcels were giran out. Very trequently. oscapres are sided in

establishing themselres in smell businesses or in their own pra

fesgiori in France, or in arranging for their migration to other

countries there they can make a fresh start in life.

To assist in the work of tha Paris offica, a Committee of

American ladies hes been ast up under the patronage of Mrs.

David Bruce, wite of the American Ambassador to France.

The Committoe is at presens endeavoring to establisti a hostal

that will provide emergency shelter for new escapeas arriving in

the Paris arga.

The International Rescue Committes also maintains offices

in STOCKHOLM, BRUSSELS, ROME AND LONDON, there the

samo humanitarian services are made available to Iron Currain

retugers.

THIS VITAL WORK OF AID MUST CO ON.

So long as Sortes

lertor enstinues, thousands will continue to rink all in their den

verare flight lo freerlom. Millions are being expended by the U. S.

Government and individual Americans lo counternet the big lie of

Soviel propaganda with the truth of freedom.

But truth le more

than worde, Underaourinhment, lack of decent elothing and shelter,

the lack of concrete evidence of Wentera support and approval,

rould make there human beinge vulnerable lo phe continuous

stream of Soviel propaganda that political freedom in the Weit

means "freedom lo ntarve." Prattlings about freedom mean little

For refugees coming from the Balken countries and southern

Russia, Turkey is the nearest and in many cases the only country

which affords immediate.asylum. To escape to Turkey they must

cross some of the most perilous trontiers in the world. On the

Bulgarian frontier it is estimated that 80% of those attempting

to escape are shot down. The hundreds that do suce

ing are completely dependent on the IRC's Iron Curtain Refugee

Campaign because this is the only American relief organization

which maintains an office in Turkey.

The Paris office has become one of the chief centers for fron
