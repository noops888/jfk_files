I, MA

being first duly sworn, depose and say:

I. I was born on 2 September 1928, was graduated fron Lanouth

College, Jackson, Tennessee, and Vanderbilt University School of Medicine,

Nashville, Tennessee, and have been employed by the Central Intelligence

Agency since November 1958. I have been in the Psychiatric Staff of

the Office of Medical Services of the Agency since that time.

2.

In the sunner of 1971 the Medical Office was approached by

the Director of Security concerning the preparation

of a ysychiatric

study on Daniel Ellsberg, who had been accused of leaking the Pentagon

papers.

To the best of my recollection, it was my understanding Iron

the Director

of Medical Services

that the DCI was knowledgeable and had

approved the Director of Security's visit and the request that was being

made of the Medical Office. There was general reservation and concern

expressed about such an effort involving as it did potentially

controversial and highly speculative efforts... It was felt that such

activity, involving as this did an American citizen, might be outside oi

the Agency's purview.. It was recognized that such efforts, waile

desirable in some quarters, could be misunderstood, misinterpretea, ana

mistakenly considered to have been derived fron the doctor-patient

therapeutic relationship which was in fact far fron the case. An initial

effort was prepared by Dr. 18

under the direction of nyself

based upon a review of magazine and newspaper articles containing

biographical data about Ellsberg, as well as sone FBI documents consisting

of Interview reports by informants about Ellsberg-

3. On 12 August 1971, on instructions fron the Director of

Medical Services, the writer met with iir. Davia loung, Roon 16, Executive

Orfice Building, to discuss the natter of a psychiatric mite-up on the

case of Daniel Ellsberg. lir. Young, at the time the appointment was made,

had stated that there was more information which he wished to discuss.

The meeting lasted for approximately an hour and Mr. Young was joined by

a lir. Linney (probably Liddy), who seemed to be an assistent. Mr. Young

stated that the Ellsberg study had the highest priority and had been

requested by Mr. Ehrlichman and Dr. Kissinger. Vr. Young also stated that

the President had been informed of this study. He stated that it vas a

multi-faceted approach and the psychiatric report would be only one facet.

He stated that he understood that the Agency was uneasy about undertaling

such a study and assured me that there had been no delineation as to how

Information derived from the study would be utilized, and 1l there were

any utilization that great care would be given to make it nonaitributable

to the Agency. Mr. Young was interested in knowing what kind of data

would be needed in order to provide further study of the sort done

"on Fidel Castro." Later on Mr. Howard Hunt joined the group'. Mr. Hunt

recognized me, being a former Agency employee, and ve greeted cordially.

I2. Hunt amplified on lix. Young's comments and stated it was his wish to

"try Di. Ellsberg in public.". Other comments were made by Vir. Hunt or

"Mr. Linney" to the effect that the aim would be to render Dr. Ellsberg

ineffective or to make him the object of pity as a broken man. Mc. Hunt

stated that he wished to see dain of the sort that "psychiatrists found out

about Barry Goldvater in 1964," and he expressed Interest in being able

to refer in a knowledgeable way to Dr. Ellsberg's oedipal conflicts or

castration fears and

other similar points.

4. It seemed from Mr. Young and "ir. Linney" that there wes

considerable concern that Dr. Ellsberg had a great deal more sensitive

information which it was feared he would from time to time periodically

expose.

"fir. Linney" stated that Dr. Ellsberg thought of himself as

"having the white hat and the President as having the black hat."

5. A discussion was held with the grouy concerning the dangers or

preparing such a study in isolation and ithout the opportunity for the

free give and tale discussions among experts, as had been the case in our

other studies. I was informed that more biographic material vas available.

I was requested to give examples of the kind of information needed. I

pointed out that insofar as possible, "although possioly not available,"

data from early life from nurses or close relatives vould be useful. I

agreed with "Mr. Linney" that school progress, including testing, would be

helpful. In the same way, year books, his years in college and in the

military, conments fron friends would be helpful. Mr. Hunt also stated

that it would be useful for Dr. Ellsberg's first wife to be interviewed

and he felt, "You can easily arrange that under an operational alias."

It was pointed out that the first Mrs. Ellsberg would be cooperative.

6.. Information was also offered by ir. Hunt or "Vr. Linney" to

the effect that Dr. Ellsberg had been in analysis although times or

location vere not knom for certain. "fir. Linney" pointed out that after

De. Ellsberg gave the Pentegon papers away, he telephoned his analyst

stating, "Now I an free."

7. "HI. Linney" and lir. Young, with Mr. Hunt's assent, pointed

out that the Illsberg study was of the highest priority, even over the

SALT negotiations. It was agreed that the further biographic information

regarding Dr. Ellsberg vould be sent to us and Mr. Hunt agreed to manage

this. li. Hunt would also make arrangements whereby periodic conferences

would be held as necessary. Mr. Hunt did, however, offer that he did not

wish to come out to the Agency if he could avoid it.

8. At this point Mr. Hunt made some coments in the presence of

the group based on his previous acquaintanceship with me and he remained

behind and made some further coments expressing a desire that nis

presence and participation in the neeting not be nentioned at the Agency.

After arriving back at the Agency I informed Ir. Hunt by telephone that

it was not feasible for me to avoid reporting Vr. Hunt's presence at the

neeting. it. Hunt expressed great regret that this was necessary,

stating that he had adequate contact with General Cushman and was on good

terns with the Director. He was reluctant in agreeing to ny statenent

that it was necessary to inform the Director of Medical Services.

Mr. Hunt trished to know if this could be treated as confidential medical

information, but could not tell the writer in what way. I discussed the

entire situation--the dangers and the reservations and the gravity of

the situation with the Deputy Chief, Psychiatric Staff, the Director

and Deputy Director of Medical Services.

9. On 13 August 1971, additional infornation vas received fron

the White House. To the best of my

knowledge this was from Howard Hunt

and consisted of poorly Xeroxed classified FBI reports and Department of

State documents. ‚This material provided additional

data and

on

20 August 1971 the Director of liedical Services and

the writer net with

the Deputy Director for Support concerning the White House request in

the Ellsberg case and the continuing pressure and desire for a psychiatric

study. The problems associated with developing the study and our

continuing reservations were discussed in detail. In view of lir. Hunt's

enthusiasm, concerns existed about the checks anã balances to actions

based on a study if one vere to be undertaken. To the best of ly recall

the Deputy. Director for Support was in agreement with us.

While the

additional Information furnished further' suggested that Ellsberg was

under emotional pressure it was not possible to arrive at any firm

conclusions or comprehensive understanding of the man's personality.

The additional information indicated that:

a. He had revealed quasi-Secret information while

still in the service when he was applying for

Ph.D. fellowship.

b. He had volunteered for Vietnamese service for the

State Department In 1955 while under the stress of

obtaining a divorce from his first wife.

c.

He had sought psychoanalytic treatment betveen the

fall of 1968 and 1970 with a psychoanalyst. (who was

determined to be professionally qualified and

reputable) in California.

---

## Page 7

d. He may have been involved in leaking information

about a Soútin vietnanese in 1970 while he was

actually in psychoanalytic treatment.

Io the best of my recollection it was agreed that the

implications of the ebove data would

be orally discussed by me with

Mc. Hunt, It. Liddy and Iir. Young.

It was also agreed that there would

be the greatest reluctance

to undertake any interview of the forner

Mrs. Ellsberg, and it was hoped that after this a written document would

not be necessary.

10. The Deputy Director for Support considered advising the

DCI, but it was decided that I would first visit Mr. Young and inform him

that the additional material basically provided for no further

understanding. It was hoped that this would put an end to the situation,

but if further material was forwarded the matter would have to be dealt

with at that time.

11. The Deputy Director for Support stated that alter the meeting

with Mr. Young, the DCI would be brought up to date.

12. Following the meeting on Friday, 20 August, and in accord

with the discussions on that date, a call was placed on Monday, 23 August,

to Mr. David Young at the White House. Mr. Young was informed that we

had received the material which had been forarded and that we had

considered it, ana would be available to discuss the data iurther.

Mr. Young stated that he would have Vir. Hunt call me. He stated that

Hr. Hunt's office vas elsewhere in the building and he did not have his

number immediately available. As of 27 August 1971 Mr. Hunt had not

called me.

13. On 30 Septenber 1971, there is a yellow memorandum of a

telephone call to me from David Young at the White House with the

message that Mr. Hunt suggested meeting Wednesday, 2T October, at 11:00 a. I.

On 12 October 1971 I received some nore data Iron Mr. Hunt at the White

vere interested in obtaining information which could be used to defame

or manipulate Ellsberg. While it was never expressed, it was my

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI:

Meeting With Mr. David Young

1. In connection with instructions from the Director of Medical Services,

an appointment was arranged for 12 August 1971 at 2:00 PM with Mr. David Young,

Room 16, Executive Office Building, to discuss further psychiatric input in

of Daniel Ellsberg.

Young, on the telephone, stated that there

was more information available which he wished to discuss.

2.

The meeting lasted for approximately an hour and, MI. Young

was joined

by a MI. Linney

(?), who seemed to be an

assistant.

Mr. Young stated

that the

Ellsberg study had the highest priority and had been requested by Mr. Erlichman

and DI. Kissinger. Mr. Young also stated that the President had been informed

of this study. He stated that it was a multi-faceted approach and the

psychiatric report would be only one facet.

He stated that he understood that

the Agency was uneasy about undertaking such a study and assured the writer

that there had been

no deliniation as to how information derived from the

study would be utilized, and if there were any utilization that great care

would be given to make it nonattributable to the Agency.

Mr. Young was

interested in knowing what kind of data would be needed in order to provide

further study of the sort done 'on Fidel Castro."

Later on Mr. Hovard Hunt

joined the group. Mr. Hunt recognized the writer, being a former Agency

employee, and we greeted cordially.

Mr. Hunt amplified on Mr: Young's

comments

and stated it was his wish' to "try Dr. Ellsberg in public."

Other

comments were made by Mr. Hunt or Mr. Linney to the effect that the aim would

be to render DI. Ellsbery ineffective or to make him the object of pity as a

broken man.

Mr. Hunt stated that he wished to see data of the sort that .

"psychiatrists found out about party Goldwater in 1964," and he expressed

interest in being able to refer in a knowledgeable way to DI. Ellsberg's

oedipal conflicts or castration fears and

other similar points.

3. It seems from Mr. Young

and Mr. Linney that there is considerable

concern that DI. Ellsberg has a great deal more sensitive information which

it is feared he will from

time to time periodically expose. Mr. Linney

stated that Dr. Ellsberg thinks of hinself as "having the white

hat and the

President as haying the black hat."

Meeting With MI. David Young

4.

Some discussion was held with the group about the need to

incorporate joint efforts in studies of this sort.

A brief description

was given of the seminar type of approach which our Staff has evolved over

the years, and of our need to peruse the material and to discuss it in an

oral manner back and forth among qualified participants.

The group

was

agreeable to this and stated that more biographic material was available.

The writer was requested to give examples

of the kind of information needed.

The writer pointed out that insofar as possible,

"although possibly not

available," data from early life from nurses or close relatives vould be

useful.

The writer agreed with Mr. Linney that school progress, including

testing,

would be helpful.

In the same way, year books, his years in college

and in

the military,

comtents from friends would be helpful. Mr. Hunt also

stated that it would be useful for DI. Ellsberg's first wife to be interviewed

and he felt,

"You can easily arrange that under an operational alias."

It was pointed out that the first Mrs. Ellsberg would be cooperative.

Information was also offered by Mr. Hunt or Mr. Linney to the effect

that DI. Ellsberg had been in analysis although

times or location were not

known for certain. Mr. Linney pointed out that after DI. Ellsberg gave the

Pentagon papers away, he telephoned his analyst stating,

Mr. Linney and lI. Young, with Mr. Hunt's assent, pointed out that

the Ellsberg study was of the highest priority, even over the SALI negotiations.

It was agreed that the further biographic information regarding DI. Ellsberg

would be sent to us and Mr. Hunt agreed to manage this.

Mr. Hunt would also

make arrangements whereby periodic conferences would be held as necessary.

Pir. Hunt did, however, offer that he did not wish

to come out to the Agency

if

he could avoid it.

At this point Mr. Hunt stated to the group that the writer had been

helpful in the medical management of one of his daughters.

He informed the writer

that this daughter was now engaged and another daughter would be going to

hellesley next fall.

Mt, Hunt did not wish it known of his presence

meeting.

He stated that his house was in the process of being painted by the

son of the Director of Security and EB

nas been trying all summer

to find out what I was doing." After arriving back at the Agency, the writer

informed it. Hunt by telephone that it was not feasible for him to avoid

reporting MI. Hunt's presence at the meeting.

Mr. Hunt expressed great regret

hat this, was necessary, stating that he had adequate contact wit

eneral Cushman and was on good terms with the Director. He was reluctant i

agreeing to the writer's statement that it was necessary to inform the

Director of Medical Services. Mi. Hunt wanted to know if this could be

treated as confidential medical information, but could not tell the writer

in what way.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting with DD/S and D/MS Regarding Daniel Ellsberg

1. D/MS and the writer today spoke with the DD/S concerning the

White House request on the Ellsberg case. D/MS made three points

with which the writer is in agreement:

a) The additional information furnished provides further

evidence that Ellsberg was under pressure.. Nontheless, the additional

material provided does not allow for any substantive conclusions or

understanding of this man's personality. He sought psychoanalytic

treatment between the fall of 1968 and 1970 with a qualified and

reputable psychoanalyst in California.

The allegation that after leaking

the Rand study that he called the analyst and stated, "now I'm free" would

suggest that Ellsberg was still involved in dealing with problems which

either brought him to analysis or which were uncovered in the course of

the treatment.

In going to Vietnam for the State Department in 1965 while

involved in obtaining a divorce from his first wife, he had sought to

discharge internal tension by taking action; his añalÿtic treatment was

unsuccessful in altering this propensitys. Ellsberg

revealed secret

information in the course of applying for a Ph.D. fellowship while still

in the service; he may have been involved in leaking information about a

South Vietnamese in 1970 prior to leaking the Rand study. These actions

may have also been the resultants of internal pressures--the 1970 incident

while he was actually in analysis.

b) There is hesitation about the Psychiatric Staff undertaking

to interview the former Mrs. Ellsberg.

It was agreed that there would be

a great professional reluctance at such a procedure.

There is considerable concern about the use to which the

requested study would be put.

In view of Mr. Hunt's enthusiasm, concerns

exist about the checks and balances to actions based on a study if one

were to be undertaken.

2. The DD/S considered the advisability of discussing the matter at

this point with the DCI.

It was decided that at this point the writer

would again visit Mr. Young and inform him orally that the additional

material provided allows for no further understanding other than as noted

above. It was agreed that the writer would not accept any requirements

to undertake to interview the former Mrs. Ellsberg.

It is hoped that this

will put an end to the situation, but if

further

material is forwarded,

the matter will have to be dealt with at that time.
