REQUEST FOR RENEWAL

PROJDCT INTEMPIY

I. CURRENT OBJECIN

AND, RELATED PROJECT ACCOMPLISHMUNTS.

Ao

The overall objoctive of the LIEPIX project activity is to collect

operational Information on the LIN'RICK Installation and personnel, as well

as rolated targeta of opportunity, through stationary and mobile photo

rephic and physical surveillance coverage.

Corollary objectives which are

to be fulfilled through the use of the LIMPIY Installations and personnel

aro as fOllows:

1) To provide operational Information pertaining to the dally activities

and morements of LIbRICk personnel, particularly those individuals of

Intalligence interest, as wall as information on the LIMERICK physical

facilities ani visitors to the premises.

2) To callect operational information pertaining to other targets of

opportunity, other official installations, and persons of Intelligence

Interest operating In Mexico.

3) To provide operational support and other protective semices to Station

personnel and operations as may be deemed necessary.

Bo. The abore objectites are to be fulfilled through the use of the LINtellite

LILYRIC, and LICATTA fixed Installations, the LIVIRAP mobile unlt, and

services of contract agents Raymond H. GERENDE and Oliver G. SCANILING. These

objectives are in consonance with and represent partial fulfillment of the

following sections of the current Related Mission Directive as approved for

Nexico City Station!

Prlority A, Section 1, Subsection e

Priority A, Section 2, Subsection e

Throughout the perlod under revien, Project LIMPIY contimed to contribute

directly and significantly to the fulfillment of Station and Headquarters'

requests and requirements for coverage of vardous targets falling within the

framework of the above cited objectives and the Related Mission Directive.

i or me

Specific examples of LIMPTY progress, accomplisments and contributions by

each project componant are as fOllOWs:

vate

Throughout the reporting period, until operational actlyity was terminated

and the photographic equipment evacuated from the LIMLED basehouse on

26 September 1964 (because of security implications stemming from the

release of the Warren Coumission report, see Section II, CHANGES),

the

IMITED Installation provided daily photographic coverage and physical

surveillance of the main gate of LIMERICK installation during the afternoon

and early evening hours." The Station considers the LINUED photographic

coverage an essential and roliable tool for lollowing the dally activities

of the target personnel and the arrival and departure of visitors, sone of

whom have been PairINirs. In addition,

the LINWed installation provided

a fixed radio dispatch base for the LIMBRACE tean.

Because of the

extremely tight security mensures instituted by the local security forces

in the limediate vicinity of the LINERICK Installation, stakeouts by the

untlateral survelllance team are procluded. However, with LIMITED

personnel dispatching the ten from positions removed fron the protective

securitinting, onto targeta departing the installation, survelllance

coverage. 1s made pose ble.

2) LIGYRIC

The LITYRIC Installation also provided photographic and fixed visual sur

veillance of the frout of the LIMbriCK installation throughout the period

under revler, during the morning and early afternoon hours..

This photo

graphic coverage and the written logs of the movement of LIMERICK

ersannel prepared by LILYRIC personnel, complements the LINHED covera

sed by the Station in Its KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK targ

and has been judged to be of equal quallty and value to the LINED

coverage.

3) LICATTA

The LICANTA Installation continued to provide coverage of the back of

the LIMBRICK installation, the garden, and patio area where many of the

personnel and their families congregate. This coverage gives the Station

its roal insight Into the LIMERICK target and provides a large part of the

Information on which the Station bases its Identification of LIMERICK

staffers, their rank and positions, the staffing estimates, and the

Intelligenco comactions of the various officers.

In addition some

Information of LAURICLE Interest 1s provided by LICALLA (ses paragraph 2,

section f of HNMA-24235 dated 2 September 1964 for further details).

4) I, IONERAP

A greatly Increased use of the LIENIRAP unlt was evidenced throughout

the period under revlew.. This asset was employed extensively for photo-

graphic coverage of PCM Headquarters, the PCM Women's Congress, the hones

of pod members and the residences of

foreign Communist exiles in Mexico.

Much of this coverage was in support of past or planned recruitment

LTOXIDE-1, prior to the Station's successful recruitment of this higa-

level PCH member.: The section primarily responsible for the Station's

ant1-PCM activity has classified the LIANIRAP coverage as a most

"valuable" part of their effort.

PHOTO COVERAGE - GENBRAT

196?

During the 9 month period from l November, to 1 August 1964, the LIMPTY

project produced approximately 770 rolls of operational st1ll photographs,

of which 595 rolls were directly concerned with the LIMERICK target.

This

coverage, linked with the daily. logs kept by the basehouse keepers of tha

activities of the LIMERICK persomel, while contimally contributing to

the Station's regular CE effort, has been particularly effective during

crisis times such as the APFLOOR investigations. While the photographic

coverage is used almost exclusively for Station operations in the LIMERICK

aTOR, LIENPIY has also provided direct support to other operations such as

providing verification of a double agent's visits to the LIMERICK

installation.

6) Oliver De, SCANILING

Juring the parlod 1, December 1963 through 30 August 1964, Long-tern Station

asset, Oliver C. SCANILING (ps) contimed as the cutout to the LINUED

basehouse, and made his regular contribution as the alternate contact of

LICASA-1 In this sonsitive LAURICLE operation.

SCANILING also performed

mmerous pretext Investigations, serviced accommodation addresses, and

prepared formal casing reports.

Of particular significance were

SCAYIL.ING's regular checks of the accommodation address used in the

sensitive ALIMPULSE operation, the thorough Investigation of a former

SMoTagent of interest to KUBARK, and detailed casings of the Chinese

Communist Fair.

(See also Section VI, PLANS, for SCANILING's future

operational assigment).

7) Raymond Ee GERENDE

luring the period under review, GERaNDE contimed in his assigment as

the Station cutout to the LILYRIC and LICALIA basehouses, the LIENTRAP

unit and as the processor of the raw photographic take, and with the

assistance of LIIMPIY-10, continued to provide and service the majority

of the accomodation addresses used by the Station. The contributions.

made principally by GRINDE (and to a limited extent by SCAMLING) to the

sensitive AMROD operation can accurately be described as unique and

essential to the success of that operation. Although this activity is

necessarily a Headquarters directed effort, the local contributions of

GERENDE and SCANILING are integral ingredients of that operation.

Do It will be noted from the above samples of LIEMPTY contributions to the

Station's progress towards fulfillment of the pertinent sections of the

Related Mission Directive, that notwithstanding their demonstrable value

and Importance, these contributions actually represent only a portion of

the activity directed towards the fulfillment of each objective.

Therefore,

any precise measurement of project progress is precluded. However, based

on the performance and overall contributions of the LIEMPTY projout during

the past project year, the Station concludes that this project 1s essential

to the fulflllment of the Related Mission Directive and must be continued

during the forthcoming project year.

II.

CHANGES

A)

On 24 September 1964, the Station was Informed by Headquarters that &

LIMPTy project photograph which was one of several supplied to the Warren

Commission In November 1963, would be published in that Commission's formal

overt report. Since LIMERICK offIcials would undoubtedly be able to

recognize the individual In the photographs as s vialtor to their

installation and with a view towards the attendant possible security problems,

the LIMITED, LILYRIC, and LICALIA operations were suspended on 26 and 27

September and all photographic and other compromising equipuent was evacuated

from these basehouses. All basehouse persomel were briefed in general on the

situation and specifically on how to cope with any possible inquirles from

Goversment offlelala or LIMERICK Inspired or prompted newemen. Complete

emerzercy commications systens were arranged for all basehouse persomsl,

Raymond, H. GRINDE and Oliver G. SCANMINt. Upon receipt by the Station of a

copy of the photograph, it was determined that the LIMLIFD basehouse had

provided the photograph in question. This consideration, linked with further

analysts of the limitations upon any counteractions available to LIMERICK

offictals, allowed the station to ro activate the LILYRIC and LICALLA bases

an a phased basis in early October 1964. However, because LIMMED was the

originator of the to-be-published photograph and due to the age and deterio

rated condition of the LIMMED property (owned by KUBARK), Station Mexico

Ity ald not reactivate LIMMED and presented to Headquarters a plan for th

onolition of the present INNED structure with recommendations for th

construction of a new building complex. (See MEXI 1307 dated 20 October 1964

for additional details).

B) In accordance with paragraph 2 of HMNW-12297 dated 28 January 1964, the

value and productivity of all assets under Project LIEMPIY was Closely

reviewed against the necessary security and efficiency reguirements. It was

determined that LIEMPIY-12 and LIBMPIY-8 could be terminated ulthout causing

Intolerable gaps in operational coverage or an unacceptable decrease in

efficiency.

Both LIEMPTY-12 and LIEMPIY-8 were terminated on 30 June 1964;

at the same time, in keeping with the ODYOKE economy progran, a further effort

was made to reduce the costs of this project by placing LIEMPIY-19 on an

hourly rate for work perfored for the Station.

On 30 September 1964, the field Case Officer responsibility for Project

LIEMPTY was transferred from Jeremy L. NIARCOS to Cornelius L. PEUVION;

however, the analysis of the finished take from the photographic basehouses

continues to be performed by Robert B.. RIGGS.

II!.

The effectiveness of the LIEMPTY project mist be judged on the basis of the

reliable dally coverage provided rapidly. and sacurely for the station and

interested Headquarters' components on the LIMERICK Installation; the rapid

mobile covorage provided regularly by LIENIRAP; and the support to these and

other operations provided by Raymond H. GERENDE and OlIver G. SCANTLING.

(See Section I, Subsection C for specific examples of this effectiveness).

In the opinion of Station officers who use the LIENPIY photographic product or

raceite LIEMPIY operational support, this projoct has responded most satisfactorily

to the needs and requirements.

IV. PROBLEMS

A) The only major operational/security problemwhich confronted project LIENPTY

during the period under revlew were the security implications stemming from the

rolease of the overt Warren Connission report. (See paragraph II, Section A).

the procise damage occasioned locally by the report, cannot be measured until

the mid-November release of the report annex containing the actual LIMMKI

During the interin perlod, the emergency contact systems are

have been ravlowed and strengthened, and no undue concern has been displayed

by any of the project persomal. Potential Station countermeasures to the

possiblo LINERICK reaction to tho publication of the subjoct photograph were

outlined in MExI-1013 dated 25 September 1964.

No umisual personnel problems have arlien and the overall performance of all

agents comected with this project has been satisfactory.

V.. IIAISON AND INTERAGENCI COORDINAIION

Not applicable.

VI. PLANS

A) The future of the LINTED basehouse, property and personnel will bo determined

within the near futuro.

(See Section 2, subsection a).Station has acquired

another apartment on a temporary basis in the LILYRIC complex to replace the

loss of LIlmED coverage and 1t will be activated after the acquisition and

clearance of basehouse keepers.

B) No basic changes are contemplated in either the admiriistration or operation

of the LICALIA Or LILYRIC bases. Station will again Initiate motion picture

coverage of selected LIMERICK personnel engaged in conversation in the

garden ares in an attempt to obtain fIlm which will lend Itself to lipreading

by Headquarters' speclalists.

C) The Station plans to maintain the Inereased level of LINTRAP operational

activity, with this asset being targetted in the near future against the

Pertido Popular Socialista (PPS) In support of the station's new PPS

penetration program.

operatimal duties outlined in Section I.

No other basie operational or

administrative changes are planned for Grinde for the ensuing perlod.

E)

The removal of Oliver G. SCANTLING as the cutout to the LIMMPD basehouse

was a result of the recent death of his wife, his pending trip to Japan. as

fa menber of the Medican. Olyuple, team, and the Station's desire to give

more operational responsibility to Raymond H. GRENDE. After SCANILING's

return from Japan, he will assume operational duties and responsibilities in

an activity not comnected with Project LIbMPlY.

Therefore, salary and

operational expenses for SCANILINt are programmed for six months only.

P). Other than presented above, Mexico City Station plans no other significant

project changes since it 1s felt that this project 1s now operating at 1ts

optimus size. Justification for the retention of three basehouses was

presented in detall In ENMA-23343: (which 1s avallable at Headquarters).

Efforts will be contimed, however, to refine and better utilize the exating

project organization and assets.

VII. COSTS (ALl figuros are dollare, v. s.)
