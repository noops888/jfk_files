MEMORANDUM: Chief, Task Force W

SUBJECT

: British Press Speculation that DRE Raiders may

have used British Territory as a Base

REFERENCE : DIR 32616 (OUT 70518)

This memorandum is for your iniormation only, and

does not recommend action.

Bits and pieces of infor-

mation have suddenly and recently appeared concerning

Cuban exile activity in the Bahamas, and of equally

sudden and recent probes by non-Cuban Bahamian rest-

dents, which may or may not mean something. I also

continue to be somewhat puzzled, as mentioned below,

by the unusual atutude of Chief, Special Branch,

08

Bahamian Police, with regard to the Anguila Island query.

1. In response to a recent request from the London Station for

guidance in the event it is queriedby_liaison concerning the DRE raid on

Cuba, mainly resulting from British press speculation that the raiders may

have used a secret base in the Bahamas, the Station was informed that the

DRE, In a press conference of 25 August, said that the boats had sailed from

Marathon in the Florida keys, and that British territory apparently was not

involved. Also that the raid was launched without our knowledge or support.

2. In addition, on 27 August 1962, the FBI informed Mr. Wallen that

it had received an inquiry by way of its Miami field office from Mr. Gregg 06,08

Bentley, new head of Special Branch In the Bahamas concerning his recent

investigation of a number of Cuban extles on the Island of Anguila who allegedly

told him they were there on a CIA mission. Mr. Bentley)claimed to be concerned 06

because he would of course have to report the matter through the Colonial 24

operat nur d were must dield that vie Bureau might i won cu. lendey

Mr. Wallen suggested that the Bureau might inform Mr. (Bentley] 06

that the activity was definitely not Agency sponsored, but that we might get

in touch with him at some point through MI-5 on this and similar problems. ?4

C/TFW, in being informed of this report, stated that he also had recently re-

ceived the same query from the local MI-6 representativelin Washington, D. C., 24

and had also denied any Agency involvement.

Station's attention with the comment that because of coincidence and logical

placement Anguila conceivably could have been used by the raiders as a staging

area and base.

3. It has since come to our attention that maritime operation PARRO1

mounted by WAVE on 22 August involved a scheduled rendezvous on Ariguila

key between a WAVE asset and two UR internal officlals. The operátion

was unsuccessful in that the two UR officlals failed to make the rendezvous

as scheduled. HAVE is now planning to rerun the operation on 30/31 August.

52103

4. The above is being brought to your attention since our knowledge

of the use of Anguila as a rendezvous point may possibly cause some future

embarrassment if the British should learn uf it and mistakenly associate

It with the actirities of the exile group investigated by Mr. Bentley

06

Another development, at least peripherally involving the Bahamas,

is described below:

The U. S. Coast Guard on 21. August 1962 inquired as

to any interest we might have in one W. Carney, who, in turn,

is interested in obtaining rights on the Island of Navassa.

Navassa was described as lying thirty miles due west of the

westernmost tip of Haiti, and is under Coast Guard adminis-

tration.

According to TFW/PM we have looked into the Island

and found it uninhabited---and possibly uninhabitable---with

no water or harbor facilities. CI/Liaison, at our instruction,

has informed the Coast Guard that we are not sponsoring Carney,

but probably had no objection; and would like more details.

b. Carney describes himself as a retired marine engineer,

who owns property in the Bahamas, and who takes out private

fishing parties.

He wants to use Navassa as a private fishing

resort, a refueling station, and a watering point. The Coast

Guard has apparently reminded him that there is no water and

no harborage on Navassa, but he is still interested.

c. The Coast Guard has an unmanned radio station on the

island. For some legal reasons they cannot sell, or even lease,

property on the island, but they could give Carney a five year

revocable permit, maintaining the right to inspect and approve

any construction.

The Coast Guard is continuing to check into Carney, and

will probably give him the permission he is seeking if they find

nothing derogatory on him.

Although Carney is a permanent

resident of the Bahamas, he also has a New York address which

was given as 655 Pelham Parkway, North, Bronx 67, New York.

6. In addition, an Agency contact, a resident of the Bahamas, who

travels extensively throughout the islands, recently reported that he had

personally observed during a trip through the southern keys that several

of the key's which previously were uninhabited were now occupied by a

number of Cuban exiles. According to source, the Briüsh authoritles] !!

apparently are puzzled as to their presence there and as to what to do

7. Much of the above indicates that a number of Cuban exiles are

showing up in remote areas of the Bahamas, and the Britishjare no doubt"

concerned over their presence and possible CIA Involvement. Mr. Bentley's

query concerning the groud of exiles he allegedly investigated on Anguila

1 Island emphasizes British foncerns It also sounds somewhat provocative

0b in that Mr. Bentley claims to have thought it prudent, after having been

told by an unnamed Cuban exile leader that they were there on a CIA mission,

to double checi with us before submitting an official report to his own

Headquarters 24
