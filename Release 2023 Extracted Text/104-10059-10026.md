Carly in April 1968 the Cifice of the General Cou-

sel nade available to Central Cover Stall (CCS) a copy of a

letter and an attached liat of organizations sent to tbe

Internal Reyenue Service (IRS) by Hr. Jon Prappier of Ram

parts bagazine.

The letter, dated 5 April 1968, had been

furnished OGC through IRs liaison channels.

The letter appended

a list of 145 tar-exempt organizations and

indicated that all

were suspected of kavlng bees funded by or having cooperated

with CIA.

3.

The letter indicated that the listed organizations

were only a part of the organizations being scrutinized by

Ramparts and that other available sources of Information on

these and other suspect organizations had already been examined.

The other sources of taformation mere stated as including the

Ilterature of the organizations and interviews with their staff

members; records avallable in the Attorney General's offices

In Illinois, Massachusetts, and Ney York; data avallable at

the National Intoraation Bureau In New York, Group Research,

Inc., in Washington, D.C., and the Foundation Library Centers

Ramparts asked the IRS

to make these naterlals avallable for inspection at a mutu

ally convenient time.

1. A revier of available CIA data on the listed organi-

rations has soown that 39 of then were at one time or another

sonehow associated with CIA. Only two of these:

are of current operational interest. These two activitles

Three additional project organizations, not

included in the Raparts list, may be vulnerablo because

they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed foundation

funding instruments included in the list. Only one of these,

is of cur

The CA Stall was furnished a copy of the Rasparts

letter and list and has checked out the organtzations of

possible previous CA Stail Interesi. All organizations not

readily identifiable with knows project organizations or as

Ces funding instrumenta have been traced with RID, with CS

area divisions that night logically have bad an interest in

with the IRS, representatives of COS and OGC also examined

available IRS data (999-A'3 and Iorms 1023) on the listed

organizations.

Thia tas done before the IRS documents vero

made available to Ramparts, in order to be sure that restiicte

S90-A, Part I data would not be turnished to Ranparts and to

try to establish the reasons for Ramparts' interest In the

organizations.

Our current findings are the results of these

various file

roviews.

the several categories of organizations on the Ramparts list.

are still of active operational interest. Both received

the Agency has had sone direct or indirect operational tles

In the jast which vere not cited in the pross duringlula- Ol

Annex C lists the 45 organizations included in the

April 1968 list which had former Agency operational ties

which were subject to press allegations during MHDOWEl.Ul Annex

D lists and briefly discusses the 55 organizations Included

In the Ramparts Ilst that had no known operational connection

wIth CIA.

Annex I lists and discusses three hitherto uner-

posed operational activities that are not included in the

April 19bo Ramparts list but which are vulnerable because

they were covertly funded by hitherto unexposed funding tastru-

ments included In the Ramparts 11st.. Annex E showg a copy of

the jull Aprtl 1968 Ramparts list.

7. The 42 tormer project organizations listed and des

cribed

at annex. B which have not previously been charged "ith

CIA assoclation In American press comment fall into five

general

categories:

a. Foundations and other organizations used as

itting funding conduits for covert subsidies to pro

ject organizations and other operational sctivities.

Sixteen organizations fall into this category. Eleven

of then are suitipurpose legitinate toundations. waich

were roculted by CCS. Four were created or recruited

for exclusive use in funding one project each and one

was used for a one tina travel grant.

b.. M1tt1ng logitimate foundations and organiza-

zions used exclusively to provido junding and status

cover for singleton agents.

six organizations were

used in this way and provided cover for seven agents

1n various parts of the vorld.: Some of these organi-

zations also provided one-time support for unwitting

Individuals of operational interest.

Proprietary of suonidy project organisations.

There are six of these: Projecta CAMANTILLA! @WUHUSTLER,U

FOCLPROOF, ETHANABLE, SGPANFISH, and ABSTRIKER).

d. Three organizations with which there nere

and leads but which were not actively involved opera-

tionally.

## Page 5

99778T

Eleven unwitting organizations which received

grants fron project organtzations for operational or

cover reasons or which cooperated with project organi-

zations.

He cannot aay with complete nssurance that all 55

of the apparently innocent organizationg on the Ramparts

Iist in fact never had any Agency ties.

Our researches bave

shown that RID Indices are often Incomplete.

We have found

operational use data in CCS files on organtzations with no

record in RID.

The same is true in other cases where infor

mation was avallable in CA Staff or area division flles on

organizations which drew a blast in RID. It seems likely,

however, that any undetected operational interest in the

organizations was in the period of the early 1950's and of a

sarginal nature.

9.

In reviering avallable intornation on the listed

organizations ve attempted to deternine whether there was a

logical external basis for Ramparts' interest in the organt-

zations or whether sona form of Internal Agency leak might

be involved. Our reviews and analysis shor falrly conclu

sively that Banparts has been proceeding on the basis of

overtly available information, supplemanted by interviews

with project personnel:

All but three of the 18 terminated but hither

to unexposed project organizatlong and 24 of the 55 or

gantzations which actually had no Agency ties are sone-

how related to project organizationg or funding lastru

ments previously exposed. Some of the organizations

made legitimate or covert grants to previously exposed

organizations, others received covert or legitimate

grants fron previoisly exposed funding instruments or

fron innocent foundations that had made legitinate

grants to exposed organizations, and still others had

officers tho were associated with exposed CIA organt

zations.

Thirty-one innocent organizations on the

Ranparts list and three of the hitherto unexposed

organizations of lormer interest to the Agency have.

no such known ties to exposed Agency organizations.

In most of these cases, however, the names of the

organizations are similar to those of exposed organ-

izations or are of a nature that makes then suspect.
