2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

ADMINISTRATIVE- INTERNAL USE ONLY

29 March 1995

MEMORANDUM FOR: Executive Director

THROUGH:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Director, Center for the

Study of Intelligence

John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

Appointment of Directorate Focal Points

for JFK Assassination Board Requests

1.

It is recommended that you request the Directorates

to appoint focal point officers for purposes of responding

to requests from the (President Kennedy) Assassination

Records Review Board.

2. Background

President Clinton appointed the Board to oversee the

release of records related to both the assassination of

President Kennedy and the investigations into the

assassination.

The Board has forwarded to us the first

(attached) of what are likely to be many requests for

additional information from CIA records.

The Historical Review GrOUp (HRG) has reviewed more

than 400,000 pages of

JEK-related records, most of which

were contained in the "sequestered records" that were

collected for the House Assassination Committee's

investigation and in the Oswald 201 file.

Up to now, no new

searches have been required. Now that the Board has begun to

generate requests

for additional information, the Agency

needs to create a mechanism fo processing the requests and

for tasking components to conduct records

searches.

It is probably advisable to have HRG continue to

serve as principal liaison with the Board. HRG could

continue to receive the Board's requests and to be

• responsible for coordinating responses from CIA.

(Another

option would be to assign someone elsewhere to be the

principal liaison and restrict HRG's role to that of

reviewing

documents for declassification and assisting with

coordination.)

3. Recommendation

a proposed memorandum for your signature.

SUBJECT:

Appointment of Directorate Focal Points

for JFK Assassination Board Requests

1.

Addressees are requested to appoint

a focal point

officer for your directorate who would be responsible for

responding to requests

for information from the (President

Kennedy) Assassination Records Review Board.

2.

The Agency has received the first (attached) of what

are likely to be many requests from the Board for

information related to the assassination of President

Kennedy and to the investigations into the assassination.

Up to now, the Board has focused on the "sequestered"

records that CIA had collected for the House Assassination

Committee's investigation and documents that had been part

of the Oswald 201 file. It is expected that the new requests

will require records searches to be. done for additional

information.

3.

The Historical Review Group (HRG), which has been

the

Agency's principal liaison with the JFK Boara, will

continue in that role. HRG will receive requests from the

Board, and then forward them to the Directorate focal points

for action. Responses from the Directorates will be

coordinated by HRG, which will make the the responses

available to the Board.

4.

Please provide the name of your focal point officer

to John Pereira, Chief/HRG (x30373-secure)by 7 April.
