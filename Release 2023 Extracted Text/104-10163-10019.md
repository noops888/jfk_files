1. On 1 11sy 1883 I travelled to Harrisbure, Pennsulvanie.

Indiridual belonging lo the Cuban military. He could supply no slgnifl-

potontial source for this type of informition was one Eloy GUTIERREZ

According to subject, GUTIERREZ was formerly a Cuban

army officer and would have many contacts in this area. As an aside,

sibieat stated that GUTIERREZ had supplied weapons to Fidel CASTRO

during tho 1058-58 perlod through an individual who ts knew chly as

(inu) CONZALEZ. GONZALEZ apparently in turn obtained the weapons

from a (Inu) SAGARO who was a resident of Sartiago de Cuba, O1 even

Joct could no longer remember where he had heard this information and

could only add that as be remembered, GONZALEZ had Been SKORZENY.

In Madrid and isrussels, Belglum, during this period. It lo fell that this

piece o information may be of more than normal significance in that we

recall having been told several years ago tha: SKORZENY was of opera-

tonel Interest to KUBARK.

As we remember, SKORZENY was at that

15. UFGA 7428, 31 January 1969, contains Informalion obtalod

by JMWAVE regarding Subject and indicated him to be emotionally un-

stable, eccentric, and generally reputed to be something of a rut. We

are Inclined to agree with this information in so far ae Subject'a eco-

nomical theory is concerned. During his stay of almost one year as

an asylee in the si gentine Embassy in Habana, Subject spent the coplous

spare time availablo to him writing an economic treatiso. On our moet-

ing with Subject on lay 4th, Subject provided us with a handwritten

short summary of this docament. According to this summary, Subject

has been attempting to correlate economic cycles with peaks af sunspot

activity, He backe up his "economie argument" with reference to the

Old Testament and the Aztec Calendar.

#l Subject has been expounding

this th. ory in puble we are not surprised that he is considered some-

what of a nist. It should be noted, however, that many otberwise sane

and unstul people belleve in horoscopes and other similar superatitione.

Wo do not feel that this quirk in his personality must necessarily bo con-

aldered derogatory in terme of his possibio operational exploitation by

KUBARK. Although we have spent less than ten hours with Subject, our

Imprasalon is that bo la a rational individual in terma ol ble attitude

towards and reiationships with other individuals and personalitles around

him. As a matter of lact, we obtained the Impression that Subject pos-

sOUses more than his fair share of what is sometimes termed "common

sonBo". The handwritten summary al Subject's economic theory as per-
