MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: Project KDAFGHAN Termination

1.

# request for termination action is contained in

paragraph four, herein.

2.

Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides

the Mexico City

Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-

erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to

assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials

of the

installation,

and to fulfill various requirements in support

of other Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project

en-

compasses two assets, NDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-Z, who have been

associated with the project since 1962.

While this project may be of some value to the FBI

(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of

known leaders

of extrenist groups in the U.S. 3s veli

photographs of persons tho are subjects of identification

orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.), it is

of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City

are other neans of obtaining photographs of

TD) Cuban personnel.

4.

Is early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review

of all Cuban operations in

an attempt to improve their overall

security.

Although NDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no

apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period.

of time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity

to the Cuban Erbassy, and the potential (perhaps imnediate)

• danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-L's Cuban relatives made

it clear that the agents should be terminated.

In view of the

aforementioned, as well as security considerations in the JAYAX

case, in/l requests approval to terminate this project effec-

tive

31 July 1972.

In order to meet termination commitments,

project NDAFGHAN was amended on

30: June 1972 by DIRECTOR: 285255

in the amount of $9,000, increasing the project's authorizatior

from $11,950. to $20,950

tor FY 1972.

KDAFGHAN-1 and ADAFGHAN- 2

were terminated on 1 August 1972.

There were no security inci-

dents during the termination.

Purpose

KDAFGiAN is a support project which provides the Mexico

City Station with fixed photographic and physlai surveillance

of the Cuban

Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The

objectives of the project are to turnish photographic coverage

of the Cuban installation during daylight hours,

to assist

the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the

installation and to fulfill various rcquirements in support

of other Station Cuban operations.

Description

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,

KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, Who have been associated with

the

project since 1962.

Both agents continue to furnish information

on a timely basis on the personalitics and activities

of the

Cuban target. A description of the individual assets

is set

forth below:

a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288248) :

A Cuban lawyer in exile in

Mexico wno left Cuba in 1960.

He has boen the principal

agent of the KDAFGHAN Projoct sinco 1962.

KDAFGHAN-l's

cover is that of a translator and would-ve writer.

holdings from his deceased father also provide financial

backstopping.

All photographic coverage of the main Embasgy

gate through final printing and mounting is processed by

KDAFGHAN-1.

b. KDAFGHAN-2 (201-305604): KDAFGHAN-2 is the mother of

KDAPGHAN-1.

Changes

The only major change during the project posr was the

installation of a TV monitor/robot camera combiration during

October 1970, the month designated as

"Cuban month."; This

added coverage contributed to the comptlation of target

studies on several Cuban officials.

Mese studies wini be

used as a starting point for future opcrations, ranely the

rocruitment/defection of these officials.

Accomplishments

1. The main value of the production of the KAFGHAN

Project has

been in catablisning the pattorn of various Cuban

Embassy employees.

The monitoring has also revealed which

automobiles the various employces usually drive.

Photographic

coverage of the visitors to

the main gate of the Cuban Embassy

and logs of the movement öf Cuban Embassy personnel have proved

very useful in identifying now Cuban PCS employees in Mexico.

Normally the Station has buen able to match movendits of new

and old employees during the initial poriod when duties and

contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so

identify their duties.

KDAFGHAN has provided current photographs

of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has

often provided positive identifications of these persons.

Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer

vis1ting lexico, was identified in this way.

2. The Station utilizes KDAFGHAN photographic coverage

and logs to verify the visits of Station assets to be Cuban

Embassy•

3. KDAFGHAN also provides coverage of what appears to

be American visitors to

the Cuban Embassy main gate.

In the

case of Americans who arrive in automobiles bearing U.S.

license plates, the license plate number, car description,

and storile copies of photographs are given to the fSI for

identification.

A significant result of the KDAFGELY operation

included a photographic of a specific individual - an old FBI

target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

1. KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the

KDACOUSTIC-3 operation, an operation aimed at the recruitment

or defection of a DGI officer:

This coverage enabled the

Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant

factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents.

This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during

the coning year since a more aggressive recruitment program

against the Cuban target is planned.

Problems and Security

No agent control or operational problems have been

reported. Neither were there any security problers encountered

during the period.

Gerald D. FAHLANGER

continues to be the

Case Officer and handler of KDAFGIAN-1. FAHLANGER has met

and could continue to mect KDAFGHAN-2 in an emergency. The

alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets

KDAFGHAN-I when FAHLANGER is not available.

Both Case Officers

are known to the assels in allas,

and both meet KDAFGHAN-1

in a Safehouse. During February 1971 the safchouse was

changed in compliance with normal opcrational security.

Meetings are generally held once a week.

More frequent

contact can

be

can call KDAFGHAN-1 at his home and say they are

made by telephone. In an emergency' friend

anyone

"Pope Simon."

KDAFGHAN-1 will reply "I haven't seen him

since lust Christmas."

KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the

Cuban

target in general. He has not been specifically briefed

on this operation.

Future Plans:

The Station is constantly examining the possibility of

an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy.

A successful audio device would serve, in most cases,

to

identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN-1

since they normally identify themselves to the gate house

attendant.

There are a few Station assets who have occasional

access to the gate

house, and it is conccivable that one of

them could

place a quick

plant device, provided security

conditions

are favorable.

The

Station currently has under

consideration a recruitment effort against a lower level

employce of the Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous

help in such an operation.

Costs:

1. General:

This renewal request is for FY 1972 in

the amount of

$11,950 and FY 1973 in the amount of $11,950.

2. Source of Funds: Project KDAFGIAN is included in

the Western Hemisphere Division's

Operating Program in the

amount of $10,844 for FY 1972 and

$10,841 for FY 1973..

The additional Funds required are to be absorbed from within

Wll Division allocation.

the Mexico City Station

with fixed,

selective photographic and physical surveillance

•of the Cuban Embassy and Cuban Consulate in Mexico City.

1s designed to provide information in support of Priority A,

paragraphs 2 and 4. of the current Operating Directive,

the Cuban target present

in Mexico and the support

rendered by Cubans in Mexico to exile ind other leftist

groups in Mexico.

Description:

1:

The LIONION Project currently encompasses.

two agents,

LIONION/1 and LIONION/2,

a basehouse directly across

from

the

Cuban compound, and a safchouse for meetings with Station Case

Officers.

The

two agents furnish photographic coverage during

daylight hours of the main

entrance to the Cuban Embassy.

In

addition, on a

spot basis, photographic coverage and visual

surveillance of

the Cuban Consulate entrance is possible.

The

agents also act as dispatchers for the unilateral LIEMBRACE

surveillance team when the LIFMBRACE team is being used

against Cuban target individuals.

A description of the

individual assets is set forth below.

LIONION/1 (201-288248): A Cuban lawyer in exile in

Mexico who left Cuba in 1960.

He has been the principal agent

of the LIONION Project since

1962. LIONION/1's cover is that

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the

Cuban target in general.

He has not been spocifically

briefed on this operation.

Futuro Plans:

1.

The Station is re-examining the vardous points of

view which the LIONION basehouse

provides of the Cuban

Embassy complex in ordor to detcrmine what steps can be

taken

to improve the usefulness of the LIONION product.

For

instance, fron tho window in the room where the pulso

camera proviously was installed, an excellent view can be

had of the Cuban Embassy garden

and the walkways botwoon

the threo Cuban Embassy buildings--as well as the Consulate.

• The Station plans to have LIONION/1, on a spot-check basis,

observo tho garden aron. In this way, the Station hopes to

update its intormation on the location of the various

ottlecis' olfices,

the general pattorn of movement and

activity, etc.

This area will also be observed during

the

night to

soo if it can be determined which arcas are being

used for living quarters or offices.

2.

It is also planned to assess LIONION/l's ability

to observe

and

draw appropriate conclusions from his obser-

vations, and to write those un for the Station.

Depending on the need for Consulate coverago,

MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Westorn Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: LIONION Project Renewal Request

Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for the

poriod 1 July 1909 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) for $11.994.

Funds are available.

2. Project LIONION 15 a support project which provides

the Nexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The surveillanee is conducted by two indigenous agents located

in i basehousé

directly across from the Cuban compound.

times the principal agent also acts as a dispatcher for the

LIEMBRACE surveillance

Information is radioed tu the

team concerning the departure of Cuban officials, thus allowing

the team to remain a more discreet distance from the target.

nudio

3.

As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, an

device planted

in

the galehouse of

the compound

could

be monitored at the LIONION

basehouse, aiding gicatly in

identifying visitors. Since the time

the Station submitted

the renewal, hoverer, this device ceased to function along

with the rest of the

LISAMPAN devices.

This installation

was monitored through carrier current from the LISAAPAN/

LISASHl baschouse..also

situated in front of the compound.

Since the connection between the two basehouses

was by carrier

current only, and

since the agents in each basehouse are un-

aware of the

other's

activity,

i possible compromise

of the

LISAMPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

4.

Although the LIONION Project does not produce dis-

seminable positive intelligence,

it is considered by the

Station as essential to its Cuban operations.

The 1.100 or

more selective individual photographs produced annually,

with the visual observations,

were effectivo in

providing timely operational information.

In addition,

8,000 foet of pulse camera film is produced annually, recording

the imago of cach visitor to the Consulate.

The years of

experience of the principal agent have given him

intimate

knowlodgo of tho target personalities.

He often brings mattor's

tỏ tho immediato attention. of the Station without having been

levied the specific requirement to do so.

As a result, the

Station is aided

greatly in keeping abreast of the day to

day activities of

the Cuban compound.

In recent months, the LIONION Project was useful to

the Station in checking out statements made by ESMARROW-1.

In March 1969, the Project provided photos.uf three

u.s.

citizens who visited the Cuban Embassy and were suspected

of being draft dodgers.

The photos

were passed to the FBI

within three hours of the request for information.

Other than the loss of the audio device in gatchouse,

there have been no changes.

The operation continueg to run

smoothly.

PROJECT LIONION RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1.

Project LIONION 15 a long-term support project designed

•to provide fixed photorraphic,

technical, and physical surveillance

of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specifie

objectives aro:

To furnish photographic covcrage during the

daylight hours of the main entrances to the target

installations.

To maintain in readiness a listening post to

support technical opcrations against the targets.

To radio dispatch physical survelllance teams

against persons associated with

the targets.

To provido for & mechanism which can fulfill

various niscellaneous PBRUMEN support requirements.

The above-cited objectives are in agreement with the over-

all objertives of Station Mexico City.

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative

responsibilities for Project LIONION vere transferred from Howard a.

TRECKLE to Cornelius L. PEUVION.

No. agent handling, control, of

administrative problems were encountered during the past year.

C. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, project LIONIOY is an operational

support project and does not, produce disseminable positive

intelligence.

During the past ycar this project did provide over.

5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering

or leaving the target installations,

as well as approximately 8000

feet of pulse camera film.

Information

of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which

LIONION-1 provides in daily logs,

has been incorporated into Station

files and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP

agencies, i.c., LNERGO.

LIONION has been particularly useïul in

spotting new employees whose photos

are then passed to LITANIL-?

for identitication.

## Page 49

- 2 -

D. Effcotiveness:

1. Project LIONION 1s considered by the Station to be highly

effective and essential..

In addition to providing the valuable

photographic covérage cited above, LIONION-1 continues to provide

Interesting observations on the personalities and activities of

the personnel working in the targets.

LIONION-1 reporting is

being incorporated into the recruitment operations

targeted against

LIRING=? and

LIRING-16.

WIn early July LIONION-l obtained and furnished a new safe

apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly

with LIRESORT-1 as

well is LIONION-l.

The safe site has been

stocked with a suffielent supply of food so as to allow two persons

to live there

for at least three days in the event the Station

ever needs a coollng-off site for an agent or defector.

3.

Throughout the past project year LIONION-l continued to

function.effectively as the radio dispatcher for the LIEMBRACE

Much of this effort was expended in estimating

the novement/ habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his

pending recruitment.

E. Problems:

1. On 27 June LIONION-l was hospitalized for emergency

surgery to

treat a perforated ulcer.

Since LIONION-2's presence

was

required at the hospital during

the operation and also through-

out the

postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage

was

suspended until 10 July.

2.

Other than a temporary postopciative morale slump on the

part of LIONIOY-1, there have

been no significant personnel,

security, or administrative problems.

F. Liaison:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

G. Interagency Coordinatior:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

H. Plans:

1.

The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-l's

experience, training, and location to provide the photographic

coverage cited above.

In additlon, the Station plans to make more

•extensive use of the operational loy books and personality

obscivations provided by LIONION-l in support of an intensive

physical penetration program.

2.

Curing the ensuing period, the Stition plans to utilize

LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 as

LP operators for a portion of the

LISANPAN technical penetration operation.

It is anticipated that

this additional tank will not be levied on LIONION-1 and LIONION-2

until after I January 1968.

I. Costs:

For the past project year, I January through 31 December

1967, it is estimated

that the

total project cost will be about

$9,000.

It is approved for $11,666.

ACTION REQUIRED: Approvals Requested Paragraphs One

and four

1.

Approval is requested.to rencw Project

LIONION for the period 1 January through 31 December

1967 at an annual exponditure

of. $11,666.00,

including

$5,574.00 for FY 1967

and $6,092.00 for FY 1988.

WH

Division programmed $12,000.00 for this activity for

FY 1967 and funds

are sunilable.

The Project cost

has been

increased by 9668:00 over the previous year,

occasioned by a small monthly raise for the Principal

Agent and a new provision for miscellancous opcrational

expenditures.

2. Although this two-man Project does not

produce positive intelligence, it contributes.sub

stantially and dircetly to the coverage of the Cuban

Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs

in bull of personnel und visitors as well as iniorma-

tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,

and supportiny recruitment attempts.

It is contemplated

that the Project will afford support to the extensive

technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAUPAN)

currently scheduled for installation in mid-January

1967.

One of

these penetrations is scheduled for the

Embassy gatehouse where visitors would normally

Identify themselves upon

entering.

Information from

the gatehouse is to be transmitted securely to the

"LIONION baselouse as well as

to the LISAMPAN listening

post.

By collating this

and other LISANPAN intormation

with

the photography, it is hoped to be able to identify

photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.

" LIONION PROJECT RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives:

There have been no changes in the objectives of the LIONION Project as

set forth in the renewal requent of last year.

8. Changeas

Howard A. TRECKLER has assumed the dutiea of Case Officer for LIONION slace

the departure of Lawrence ?. BARKER In Auguet 1966. TRECKLER 18 knOwn to LIONION-1

and 2 as "Jose"' or

"Joe":

TRECKLER meets with LIONION-l at least once each

week and sees LIONION-2 only if he visice the LIONION basehouse. With the

departure of Hugh I. FRANCOITE (P) In August 1956, Wulter W. CORNDUAT (P)

assumed the duttes of technical consultani for the project.

CORNBURY is known

to LIONION-1 and 2 a8 "Jack".

LIONION-1 1s being given a pay increase of

$8.00 (U.S.) per month effective 1 January 1967. There are no other changes

contemplated for the coming year.

C. Intelligence Production;

The intelligence production is the same as that reported in the reneval

request for last year.

It 19

difficult to estimate the intelligence value in

numbers of reporte as

there are so few positive reports made from this type of

production on the photographic end of the project. But this photographic

coverage 1a of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the

PBRUMEN target.

Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONION's

time will be used in support of that operation.

D. Effectiveness:

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from

that expressed in the renewal request of last year.

LIONION has further es-

cablished his importance to the Station's operational activitics by demonstrating

his ability to spot surveillance targets at LIRING from only a physical descrip-

tion provided by the Case Officer.

If the planned LISAMPAN notivity gets underway,

LIONION observations and insight Into activities of LIRING will be increased

The apartment spotted by LIONIONal and obtained by the Station across from

LIRING that was mentioned in

last year's renewal request is scheduled to be

utilised in the LISAMPAN operation.

The location of LIONION=! across from the

target and his background knowledge built up

over the years are invaluable

to the Station's coverage of the primary target of the Related Mission Directive.

SEGGET/SAPOK

E. Problems:

There were no aijor problems

during the past year.

One security problea

involved the claloed spotting of some

of the photogaphic equipment from the

street by David M. WILSTED (P). A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONIONal

and the Case Officer

talled to reveal any such equipuent as being visible from

the street. However, auditional security measures were taken by darkentag the

background in the room behind the equipant through hanging of heavier drapes

on the window,

drapes on the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind

the equipment. This also serves as a security check against the prying eyes

of the household servant as LIONION-1 can now open the door fully to the room

when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment.

The other problem

is the obtainiag of inmigrado status for LIONION-2. This

involves the depositing

of fúnda to a bank account and la discussed under paragraph I.

F. Liaison:

There is no liaison involved in the project.

G. Interagency Coordination:

• Not applicable.

H. Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION-1 keep special logs on the activities of

selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past ycar.

With the case

ufficer handling LIONION-l directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to concinue

picking his brains for additional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully

LIONION-1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take

from the LISAMPAN operation.

I. Costs:

For Calendar Year 1966:

1. In the period l January through 30 June 1966, $4,500.00 was expended.

The projected

expenditure for july 1966

through 31 December 1966 1s $5,000.00.

This totai project year expenditure 18 approximately $1,000.00 under tbat

approved by Headquarters.

However, chis amount is probably due to having

drawn film and other supplies from overall Stadon support without their

having been charged off againet the Project

was made.

In addition, the Station has had to make e loan to LIONION-2 for gaining status

to qualify

for inmigrado status in Mexico. This loan is held in a savings

account in a Mexican bank to prove to the

Mexican authorities that .LIONION-2

can support herself.

Funds are withdrawn from this account moochly, sometimes

with interest, and deposited to & checking account where LIONION-l withdraws

the funds and they are applied to the revolving account for financing the

operation. The Initial balance-deposited to the accoint in February 1966 was

$4,800.00. Withdrawals have been made at the rate of $240.00 per month and

88 of 30 October 1966, the total account had been reduced by $1,680.00, leaving

a: balance in the account of $3,120.00 which should carry the account chrough

The original objectives. of che project have not

changed but have been added to in the last yoar.

The project is functioning

well

•as. a technical (primarily photographic) sirvelllance operation against the EBRUMEN

Embargy In Mexico City.. It lo designed tu:

Furnish photographic inverage during daylight hours of the

two entrances of che carget installation.

2. Dispatch physical survelllance.teana agalnst persons

assoclated with the target.

3. Keep in readiness a satening post (LI) for the monitoring

and recording of techuical penetrations of the target.

Assist the Station in building up Individual dossiers on

officialo of the cargot Installation.

5. Monitor Station activitler Involving direct contact with

the target, and furnish an observation post (OP) for

other Station assets.

Objectives 4 and s are additlong to thoae objectives set forth in the

original project outline.

plated in the

coming year.

D. Effectivenes?, The project is cousidered both highly successful and

esseutial by the Station.

In addition in excellent photographic coverege provided

by the LIONION agents, the Station has found in LIONION-l a first clasg asset for

other operational duties.

The LIONION besehouse was essential to nounting and

monitoring the LIRHYMe tecruitient (and harassuent) operation. C/O Walloce B.

without the LIONION

base and the expert knculedge of LIONION-l of target personnel and activitias,

such an operation as LIRuns could not have been tounted. It night be noted

this operation was an attent to satisfy the top priority requirement laid on

Stätion Mexfco by Headquarters. It is expected that additional similar ouerations

will depend to a large extent on the facilitles provided by the LIONION operation.

Another very effective performance by LIdIONal was his obtaining. - - by

sharp observation and quici, intelligent, secure accion - an apartment in

building directly across the street from

che target Esbassy, The Station had beea

sooking an apartuent in this bullding. for many years.

E. Probleng. The problem of cover for LIONION-l burked out well during the

year to the point where

It ceased being a problem.

By living hia cover as a trans-

lator he was enabladto build in atrong self protection when called upon to do some

tranolations for the uffice of che president of Mexico.

Toward the end of the year,

LIONION-1 recelved the coveted status of "Inmigrado" which confera a great deal of

Inmunity from harrassment by Mexican authorleleo.

Ihe only problem now besetting the project is LIONION-l's excessive work

load. An inúleated above, an attempt is being made to alleviate this load.

The operation has no flalson connection. LIONION-L'a connection

wich the Mexican Presidency is non-operational.

G. Interagener Cecidination. Not applicable.

8. Plans.

It Is planned

to make better use of LIONION-l'a observations

and

operational loj books during the coming jear rather than settle for his excellent

photographs alone:

It has been found that he can often supply valuable addicional

information because of his "jeel" for those perrons liho are

under constant obser-

vation from the LIONION base.

LIONION-1 can read significance into actlvlty which

might so unnoticed or be

misinterpreted by observers with less experience.

LIONION-1 will also be called upon for assintance In future recruitment operations

as In LIRIYYE.

Several such operations are being contemplated for calendar 1966,

the period for which project is being requested.

for calendar 1965:

In the perfoil 1 January through 31 Mitober 1965

of a sensitive target employee.

The Case Officer in charge of

the attempt sat with LiONION-l for several weeks observing the

movement pattern of the target employee.

LIONION-1 manned one

of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical

surveillance of the taryet employee while near the Baschouse.

to a large extent on the facilities provided by

this Project.

Another very effective performance by LIONION-I was his

obtaining, by sharp observation and quick, intelligent and

secure action, an apartient in a building directly across

the street from the target.

The Station had been seeking

an apartment in this building for many jears.

The only problem currently besetting the Project

this, Headquarters is assuming the task of developing some of

for LIONION-l has ceased to be a problem. He has

received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good deal

of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.

He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly

out of the Office. of the President of

Nexico and thus has a

strong protective

security factor built into it.

F.

Liaison: The Project has no

liaison connection.

LIONION-1'S

cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-

operational.

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable.

8. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-I's

observations and operational logbooks during the oming year

rather than to settle for his excellent photographs alone.

It has been found

that he can often

supply valuable additional

information because of his "feel" for those persons who are

under constant observation from the Basehouse.

He can- read

significance into activity

which might go unnoticed or be

aisinterpreted by observers with less experience.

He will

also be called

upon for assistance in future recruitment

operations

similar to the case mentioned in paragraph D

acove.

Several such operations are being contemplated for

calendar year 1966, the period for which the Project renewal

is being requested.

MENORANDUM FOR: WIl/EXO

SUBJECT

LIONION Project

1.

LIONION Is a new project which is submitted in the

amount of $10,178.

This is a photographic surveillance opera-

tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

Two

agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban lawyer in exile,

and LIONION-2, his nother.

The agchts act as observers and

photographers.

LIONION- 1

is also used as a dispatcher for the

LIEMBRACE

surveillance team, from which he is compartmented,

to cover individuals associated with this target.

These agents

were previously

used in connection with the unlinteral tele-

phone

tap

operation against the Cuban Embassy.

The current

photographic

operation began in the latter part of 1962,

and was

previously funded under Cuban FI funds.

The operation

has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban

Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of

actlou and personal associations.

2.

The

security of this operation, particularly the

agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,

appear reasonably sound.

Both agents know that they are

working for AlS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED

in October 1963.

penetrations of the

However, LITAML-7 and LITAMIL-9, who e

Cuban

Embassy, are avare of this

activity, as they are used to help identify indlviduals

photographed.

Approval for the IIONION Project is recommended.

It is requested

that, in order to assist Headquarters'

evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data

furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.
