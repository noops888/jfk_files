A=3 said he thought it would be better for the tro to meet at the bar

of the Del Prado Hotel at about 1800 on 18 lov. Lay asked 3 for Instructions.

versation would use the word Acapulco if the incident simla be raported -

Paratlan if not. (1-9 called as scheduled and the word icapuleo has used).

I=? was advised to keep avay from A-3 who vas beliered to be in toon ini

He ung told not

3. L-9 has some lingering suspicions about A-3 - said that back in Cuba.

1-3 used to drive a Mercedes Dens, 190-SL sports car, bright red,

which he sold

to an officer in the Perdcan Embassy - L-9 found this strange since the Mexican,

who had dineratic status, could bring a ney car into Cuba duty-fore at rich loss

For one thing, though anti-

attractive blonde of about 25, and has a rather rettring personality.

Attachnent A

In copliance with DIR-40146, Edward D. Knapman was dispatched

to Mexico City, from JWAVE to conduct a debriefing of LITANIL~9.

Knapman

arrived here 29 May 1963 and conducted the debriefing at three sessions

totaling eigat hours on the nights of 29 May, 31 May and 1 June 1963.

2.

Attachment B 1s largely positive. Intelligence while Attachment C

is basically of operational interest. The intelligence debrieflrg mas

conducted on the basis of current and past intelligence requirements lists

avallable at the Mexico Station.

To the extent feasible we atteapted to

pinpoint ultimate sources, but headquarters will note that a sizable part of

the information provided was based on personal observation and impressions.

diadquarters should keep in mind that I-g's perimeter of access was the city

of Habara and that he was exposed principally to bureaucrats who are identifled

with the regine. We caution headquarters on this rather obvious point, per-

haps because ve were exposed recently to AMKNOCk-1 who has been living deep

"In the entrails of the monster" in Oriente and who had a different view of

the temper of the people in that area from that given by LITANIL? for

Havana.

3.

In attachment C are the ansters to a series of questions of operational

Interest which were posed after a thorough review of the LITA!Ti-g operational

file.

In some cases fuller biographic information can be obtained from L-9

1f and when required.

L-9 was most cooperative and understood clearly what

the debriefer nas looking for.

In most cases, however, it is not probable

that L-9 will be of great help in making operational approaches and pitches

because of his present position.

Intelligence

1.

Subject had nothing meaningful to add on disaffections or

realignments as a result of the October crists.

With regard to internal friction within the GOC, he said that

there is considerable criticisn of the "old" Communists by the

"new" Commists

and 26th of July.

He cited the case of Felipe *GUERRA Matos' criticisn of

Joaquin ORDOQUI and Nicolas GUILLEN (previously reported) as cases in point.

By and large, the new Communists and Fidelistas are grabbing off most key

position in the government bureaucracy.

Fidel Castro is still the principal

leader of the Revolution and both the PSP and the Soviets know that he is

vitally important to them.

mented that the PSP view PURS as an attempt by Fidel Castro to absorb it and

that the PSP consequentiy has seen cool to the idea.

provide no information worth reporting.

5. Source was questioned on the positions of Lazaro Pena, Lizardo,

and Juan. MARINELLO.

He had little of importance thought he

8. Source xas questloned about Chicón military activities. He

answered that he say ho Chinese, heard no comments äbout the Chinese

and did not get the Impression that the Chicoms are significantly active in

any fleld in Cabs.

When assed about Cuban Confidence in the Soviets, he said that most

people he had stee to set that the Soviets would coet to Cuba's defense ta

case.of an American invasion if it happened to suit Soviet Interests at the

time." He said that to his knowledge Soviet technicians were getting along

well with cubans, but he feels that the Cuban people view the Soviet with

detachment socially: and have very little to do with them.

Source was queried on any comments he had heard concerning a

GOC desire for a rapproachement with the United States.

he had heard noshing specific, but that he personally felt this was a

prospect frequently considered by Castro.

11. In view of Sources excellent sub-source in INFA (Conchita), It had

• been hopeà thai ne nould be able to provide some valuable information on

this organization.

Actually, he had little to add to Conchita's comments in

regard to Fidel's attitude toward Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

We asked for

Conchita's evaluation of Carlos Rafael, and received Information which has

many times been forwarded to headquarters and need not be repeated here.

Conchita made no seaningful comments on the effectiveness of Soviet and

Satellite technicians

assigned to INRA.

(See also paragraph 5 of attachment

B concerning Fidel Castro which may be of PI interest.)

12.

When asied about the principal reasons for industrial difficulties,

Source said that he heard universal complaints about the need for spare parts.

He could only pinpoint the transport industry. He had no specific information

on how some Uos, anufactured spare parts were being received, but commented

that Canada might be the source. He could give no specifics and said that

all correspondence on these matters is closely.held and encoded when cabled.

He has had no access to such inforration.

13. Regarding the rationing system, he said that it is working more

smoothly now than a jear ago and that grumbling is less now than in the

past. He sald that things are better organized now and that he saw no desper-

ation because of food or other shortages.

•14. Source said that he had heard of no significant increase in diseases,

though there was such coment about cases of gastroenteritis.

Source isi no information whatever on the export of the Cuban

Revolution and on the traints of revolutionaries com other areas in Cuba.

16. Regardinz diploratic relations with other Latin American countries

and Spain, his understanding is that the GOC wants no more breaks and is

especially interested in maintatning the tie Nith Madrid since Spain 1s the

mother country and an airline link to Europe.

17.

With regard. to the Civil. and. Foreign Services, Source said that

-there is

more stability and discipline In both than there was a year. ago,

vilth a consequent rise in morale.. He said that there is much less free-

wheeling on the part of subordinates, but now the chiefs are expected to face

up to

their responsibilities and the competent must carry the load for the

majority who are incompetents.

We commented that this was not a phenomenon

absent in other public services and tried to flush Source out on the quality,

loyalty, arid efficiency of the services.

He sald that loyalty 1s increasing,

quality 1s. circumscribed seriously by insufficient academic preparation and

Job training and efficiency has increased in the past year because of better

discipline and improved administrative practices.

Subject had nothing of consequence to add regarding the organization

of the Ministry of Foreign Relation and the Foreign Service.

This subject

will be covered to some extent in the operational attachment to this dispatch.

See paragraph 7 of attachment B concerning the rumor that Armando #HART will

replace Raul ROA at MINREX.

Source had little information on

Catholic Church is not being molested and that relations between it and

the doc have improved.. Pope John all was viewed with favor by the co.

Batistianos in Miami frequently take che opposite view.)

Source had nothing of value on the Ministry of Education, the

University of Habana, the literacy progran, the establishment of new technical

and scientific institutes, the quality of education at secondary and primary

21. Regarding the United States, he feels that there 1s still a furd

of friendship among the Cuban people and admiration of american technology.

He said that a few of his friends listen to U.S, broadnests, but he had

nothing to say concerning their comments and the extent to which these broad-

casts are having an effect.

Regarding the temper o. the Cuban people, source does not believe

that the ingredients for a revolt exist.

He feels that the regime may have

more support now than it had a year ago, or, if such is not the case, that

people are just more resigned to it.
