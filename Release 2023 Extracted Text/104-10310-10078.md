MEMORANDUM FOR: Special Assistant to the

ATTENTION

Mr.. Richard Fuller

SUBJECT

REFERENCE

Department of Justice Request, dated

15 Jan 1976, Pertaining to "Domestic

Collection--270 Calls" (OGC 76-0178)

: Request of OGC, dated 26 Jan 1976,

Requesting Division D Assistance to

Respond to Subject Request -

1. This memorandum responds to reference request

and its contents are for the information and use of

Mr. George W. Clarke, Assistant General Counsel.

2. Attached, in accordance with reference request,

is an unsanitized

copy of Division D memorandum FID 113/72

for transmittal to the Department of Justice.

. 3. Subject Department of Justice request asked, in

memorandum dated

requesting a legal opinion

thorough search of our files fails to indicate that such

a memorandum was ever written. We speculate that the

request to the OGC was verbal. We note, to support this

thesis,

that the memorandum (sub-paragraph 3) of subject)

of James Boylan, OGC, is dated 25 February 1972 and suggest

that this memorandum

is actually the subject of both

sub-paragraphs 2) and 3) of the subject request.
