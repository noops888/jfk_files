any anti-Communist Cuban group which succeeds in neutralizing the present Cuban

(90), FITZGERALD recalled that

AMLASH-1 "spoke repeatedly of the need for an assassination-weapon. In-particular,

he wanted a high-powered rifle with telescopic sights or some other weapon that could

be used to kill Castro from a distance." (90) FITZGERALD said that he told AMLASH

"that the U.S. Government would have no part of an attempt on CASTRO's life. (90)

OCCURRENCE:

(SANCHEZ met with AMLASH in Paris. AMLASH indicated that although he was unable to

carry out his plans during the past year, he "continued to feel that his solution to

the Cuban problem was the only one feasible and that he had to continue trying."

AMLASH "was told that the U.S. Government could not

and would not in any

way become involved or provide assistance in the task he had planned for himself."

(100)

However, the IG REPORT explains that SAS "contrived to put (MANUEL) ARTIME and

(AMLASH) together in such a way that neither knew that the contact had been engineered

by the CIA.

The thought was that ARTIME needed a man inside and (AMLASH) wanted a

silenced weapon, which CIA was unwilling to furnish to him directly. By putting

the two together, ARTIME might get his man inside and (AMLASH) might get his silenced

weapon--from ARTTME

Jan. 26,1961

OCCURRENCE: Harvey was asked about notes written by him andesilver from their

meeting in January of 1901, concerning Executive Action. One portion of the notes

3 Be with Ku ARE

stated, "Be within KUBARK, one focal point for control, search, training, case

officering, etc. -- GDP authority in this focal point mandatory. DCI officially

advised?" (57)

Harvey testified that he did not know whether the DCI was advised

that he had been asked to create a capability for Executive Action and had taken

certain steps to have an assessment of assets in that connection. (57)

Harvey

clarified that the wording of the memo probably meant that consideration should be

given to the question of how, whether and under what circumstances the DCI should be

officially advised of his program, "I want to make it clear that this in no way

means he should be advised.

Limited period throuph ARNOLD StivEryfor the spotting, of individuals with criminal and under-

world connections in Europe for possible multipurpose use, none of whom were ever advised of

When HARVEY-was asked if the multinurpose use included assassination, he stated that if

he had ever been directly ordered to perform an assassination, he would have considered the

people spotted by R.J. Win as possibilities. (50)

He testified

that before someone would have

actually been approached to carry out that operation, there would have been a lonp period of

assessment and cross checks. As far as he knew. the particular spotting mechanism never went

that far.

So far as HARVEY could recallk.J. Win was used only once in connection with an opera-.

tion in the Congo, which was not an assassination operation.
