JIM,

SO AND SO DREW AN ADVANCE SOMETIME IN THE PAST FROM YOU FOR

OSWALD! OR "FOR THAT PROJECT UNDER SUCH AND SUCH A CRYPTO"'"'

"IT WAS A FAMILIAR CRYPTONYM TO ME AT THE TIME, WHICH I

HAVE SINCE FORGOTTEN, AS WELL AS THE TIME THAT THE ADVANCE OF

THERE APPEAR TO BE SEVERAL DISCREPANCIES IN THE RECOLLECTIONS

OF MR.

A. GRAYOHAIRED MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT.

FOR INSTANCE

AFTERNOON FLIGHT OF A PRIVATE PLANE. HOWEVER, KENNEDY WAS SHOT

AT MIDDAY IN DALLAS, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

SENT TO TOKYO.

MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD THAT OSWALD

HAD BEEN TAKEN TO JAPAN FOR QUESTIONING AFTER RETURNING FROM THE

SOVIET UNION IN 1962.

INTEREST IN RUSSIAN

THERE HAS BEEN SPECULATION ABOUT WHETHER OSWALD CAME UNDER

THE CONTROL OF THE INTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN JAPAN.

IN A RECENT BOOK,

'LEGEND. THE SECRET WORLD OF LEE HARVEY OSWALD, " EDWARD JAY EPSTEIN

DESCRIBES OSWALD'S INTEREST IN THE RUSSIAN LANGUAGE AND HIS

STRANGE CONTACTS WITH JAPANESE CIVILIANS.

BUT OFFICIALS OF THE AGENCY HAVE DENIED UNDER OATH HAVING

EVER RECRUITED, TRAINED OR MANIPULATED OSWALD, AND FORMER SENIOR

OFFICIALS OF THE AGENCY HAVE ANGRILY DENDUNCED AS IRRESPONSIBLE

ATTEMPTS TO CONNECT THE AGENCY TO THE ASSASSINATION.

THE AGENCY WILL NOT SAY WHETHER IT HAS EMPLOYED INDIVIDUALS.

MR. WILCOTT SAID THAT AFTER LEAVING TOKYO IN JUNE 1964 HE SERVED

AT THE AGENCY'S OFFICES IN ROSSLYN, VA; AT THE MAIN HEADQUARTERS

IN MCLEAN, VA., AND AT THE STATION IN MIAMI. HE SAID THAT HE
