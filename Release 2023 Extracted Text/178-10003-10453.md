SELECT COMMITTEE TO

STUDY GOVERNMENTAL OPERATIONS WITH

RESPECT TO INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

(PURSUANT TO 5. RES. 11, I4TH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20510

June 26, 1975

Mr. William E. Colby

Director of Central Intelligence

Central Intelligence Agency

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Colby:

On May 27 and June 2, the Senate Select Committee informed

the Central Intelligence Agency of the Committee's plans

for examining the field of foreign intelligence and

the

subject of covert

action.

In the area of the domestic

activities of the Central intelligence Agency, the

Select

Committee intends to address a wide range of issues,

including the domestic aspects of CIA's foreign operations.

The Committee intends

to approach the issues of the cIA's

domestic activities with a broad perspective, realizing,

as I am sure you agree, that the threats to United States

security and

the need

to protect sources and methods oi

intelligence, as well as CIA installations and personnel,

cross our national borders.

Basically, the subjectsor investigation fall into the

following five headings:

1. Counterintelligence activities at home and those

counterintelligence activities abroad which involve

American

citizens, including activities undertaken

pursuant to the Director's

authority to protect intel-

ligence sources

and methods.

2.

Foreign intelligence activities at home and those foreign

intelligence activities abroad which involved American

citizens.

3.

The domestic operations of the CIA undertaken in sup-

port of activities abroad.

June 26, 1975

4. Relationships between other organizations, public and

private, and the CIA.

5. The use of CIA personnel, funds, or facilities for pur-

poses unrelated to its intelligence missions.

Within these broad subjects of investigation, the Committee

will examine "questionable activities" by the CIA.

activities are those where there exist, in the words of the

agreed upon Outline for Inquiry Procedures,

"specific alle-

gations of Agency

or Executive Branch abuses or other con-

troversial specific matters where there is reason to believe

improprieties may have occurred"

The following categories

are believed by the Committee to be among those in which

questionable activities have taken place:

mail openings;

electronic surveillance; equipment testing within the United

States; surreptitious entries; penetration of dissident

groups;

use of cover and

false documentation; security inves-

tigations, including those

initiated as a result of or in

connection with news leaks; use of polygraphs; political

misuse of the CIA; assistance provided CIA by

other agencies

or private companies and CIA's assistance to them; CIA

management of its investments; CIA use of proprietaries,

co enies and chais

notional organizations and devised facilities; CIA experi-

ments with drugs on unwitting U. S. citizens; CIA detention

of individuals within the United States.

In regard

to each questionable

activity

chosen

for study,

the Select Committee will examine the nature of the activity

and will

attempt to evaluate the results.

The Committee

will also l00k at the CIA's authority to undertake the

activity, the relationship between the activity and the CIA's

missions, the internal mechanisms for initiation and review,

and the external mechanisms for control of such activities.

Though

the initial focus will be on the specific question-

able activity, the Select Committee's inquiry is designed

to reach

fundamental issues which bear directly on the ade-

quacy of the administrative organization and procedures of

the CIA, and the legislation presently controlling the

Agency.

Among the major issues which the Committee will

address are:

The annexed notifications set forth requests for additional

Agency, the

committee requests that the CIA

provide the

individual's last known address.

Finally, the notifications

indicate the names of the staff

members who, in addition to

the committee's

senior staff, will be working in these areas.

The Committee, in the course of the next few months, will

undertake other subjects

lor investigation as its work

proceeds

and will notify you as appropriate.

We look forward to your cooperation in these matters.

ATTACHMENT I.

DOCUMENTS REQUESTED FOR STAFF REVIEW

This attachment lists files

and other documentary

materials which the Select Committee hereby requests be

made available for staff review.

In the first instance, all of the specified material

will be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA head-

quarters. The Committee will continue to select particular

documents to be transmitted to the committee's offices in

Washington to be used in preparing for hearings and the

Committee's report.

In order to expedite production of the requested

materials we have indicated, where known to the Committee,

offices within the CIA which would be appropriaté starting

points to search

for the materials. This effort to

expedite matters does not limit the CIA's responsibility

to search for such materials throughout the Agency, using

as appropriate, lists and indices of CIA projects and pro-

grams.

This request calls for "all files" of various programs

or projects, and "all files" regarding particular incidents

or entities.

Requests for "all files" are intended by the

Committee to include all subject, correspondence chronological

DooId:32112056 Page 7

and all other files or unfiled documentary materials in

the

office, or

storage repositories, of the organizational

unit which managed the program or project in question.

The requests also include all such files in the .

offices or storage repositories of the responsible Division

Director, Office Director, and Directorate Deputy Director,

in the DCI office,

and in any

other part of the Agency which

had significant involvement or connection with the program.

Where the Committee requests "documents" or "docu-

mentary materials", those terms are defined as all corres-

pondence, memoranda, notes, working papers, buck slips and

routing slips, studies, reports, charts, films, tapes, and

all other writings, printings, typings, or drafts, and

copies or reproductions.

When files for a specific project or program are re-

quested under the best known designation of that project

or program, the request includes files of any earlier or .

later versions of that project. Thus, the request for

Project MHCHAOS would also comprehend files for the ante-

cedent MHALPHA and MHPASHA projects and for the subsequent

MHVAPOR.

When any files, portions thereof, or particular docu-

mentary materials are no longer available, the Committee

HH 50955

DocId: 32112856

Page B

## Page 9

- 3 -

requests that they be specified with an accompanying

explanation of when and

under what circumstances they were

destroyed.

If no information regarding their destruction

is available, please specify the earliest time, and under

what circumstances,

CIA first became aware the

items were

missing.

We expect that staff representatives of the Committee

and of CIA will expedite compliance with these requests,

and indicate priorities for production through preliminary

review of this notification and discussion of the files

involved. It would also be helpful if CIA identifies those

persons within each Directorate and Division or Office who

are actually in charge of reviewing and assembling material,

so that Committee staff can also discuss these requests with

them and resolve rapidly any questions or difficulties

which might arise.

We also expect that a good deal of this material will

be readily available in view of the reviews already done

by CIA in this area over the past two years. As soon as

some portions of any requestsare available for review, the

Committee staff should be notified in order that they may

begin their inspection while the remainder is being assembled.

Finally, it should be noted that this document re-

quest does not supersede any earlier requests

for material

in this area which are still outstanding.

If CIA staff

encounters

overlap in responding to this and earlier

re-

quests, the Committee

staff

should be promptly notified.

FILES

The following files are requested. In order to expedite

their location, the Committee has indicated offices which

to be the best starting point for a search. This does

not limit, nor supersede the general guideline that all files

throughout the CIA relating to a project be procured. If pro-

jects herein identified are not CIA projects, but are identi-

fiable as projects of other agencies with which CIA had some

connection, the request is for all CIA files regarding such

projects.

In the first instance, all of the specified material will

be reviewed in unsanitized form by staff at CIA headquarters.
