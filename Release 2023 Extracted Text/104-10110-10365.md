1. I acknowledge that by virtue of my duties I have been exposed to or. the recipient

of classified information, which, in itself, or by the implications drawn from it, is highly sen-

of the United States. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information

classified information or material acquired as a result of this association.

to the United States Government for the protection of such information and that the termina-

tion from this relationship with my employer and/or the United States Government does not

relieve me of my obligations under this oath or any other previously executed Secrecy Agree-

ments. I understand that I will not be relieved of these obligations except when specifically

advised in writing by the sponsoring activity of the U. S. Government.
