Depilatory: A chemical depilatory (Thallium Salts) was

procured and tested for surreptious use on CASTRO. The

plan was to "dust Thallium

outside CUBA;

the powder would be absorbed into his skin

Mexico City with a high officer in the Cuban armed forces who was subsequently

to become a CIA asset known as A.M. LASH-1.* SABARS met with A.M. LASH to

sound out his views on the Cuban situation. A.M. LASH was in Mexico City to

attend a "leftist-sponsored" conference.

(78).

The March 1961 meeting was inconclusive, but it led to other meetings out

of which Project A.M.LASH was created. A.M. LASH-1 "repeatedly insisted that

the essential first step in overthrowing the regime was the elimination of

CASTRO himself, which /A.M. LASH-1/ claimed he was prepared to accomplis. He

repeatedly requested that we /CIN furnish him the special equipment or material

needed to do the job." (79) .

OCCURRENCE: Memo for Richard Helms from Gen. Lansdale concerning NSA cover.

The memo

alludes to a conversation on the previous day, Jan. 31, 1962, about NSA cover for the

Cuba Project. It indicates that Cuba cover is top priority.

It indicated that this was not

possibly known to the members of the United States Intelligence Board.

The problem seemed to

be to be able to decide how much of NSA,(National-Security Agency) Sj assets were needed to

provide cover for the Cuban project.
