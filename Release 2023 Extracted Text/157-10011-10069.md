Project IMMOVE

The following is a summary of the attached extract of the OS files

pertaining to the incarceration of four persons in 196l.

Project IMMOVE is an Agency cryptonym covering paramilitary training

activities at a location in Louisana This training activity took place during

the period 12 February 1961 through 12 April 1961 and was in support of the

general Agency effort culminating in the abortive Cuban invasion. In support

of the IMMOVE mission a holding facility was required for dissident trainees.

The holding facility was a jail which was turned over for exclusive Agency

use by a local toucans, sheets

During the course of the training at UNMOVE?

four individuals were involuntarily detained in this jail. The individuals were

three Cuban trainees held in the jail from 9 April until 20 April 196l and a

Spanishy ship captain held from 29 March 1961 until 20 April 1961.

The captain, who jumped ship on 28 May 1961, was in charge of a ship which

was transporting ammunition in support of the Cuban invasion. It was deter-

mined that the individuals kaowledge of the IMMOVE operation presented a

security problem for the entire Cuban invasion operation. The captain was

taken into custody by the United States Border Patrol in New Orleans who,

upon instruction from the District Director, Immigration and Naturalization

Service, turned him over to the custody of Agency representatives. The

captain was then transported to the jail where he remained in the control of

the deputy sheriff in charge of the jail until 20 April 1961. After 20 April 196l,

the captain was transported to New York City where he was turned over to

I & NS who took custody of him until he left the country on 19 May 1961.

The three Cubans were jailed for several reasons, all relating to their

- reluctance or inability to carry out their training. Release from the project

site was determined to create a security hazard and they were also held in

the jail until after the invasion. Upon their release each of the individuals

was given a small amount of money and allowed to return to their choice of

residence in the United States.

The foregoing is a summary of several Office of Security reports attached,

which were written after the fact. These reports and other Office of Security

files do not document the precise level of approval for the operation, insofar

as it involved the detention of these individuals. It is clear however, from a

review of the files, that the jailing was the subject of a variety of correspondence

between IMMOVE, Headquarters, and the Miami Station. In the case of the

ship captain, the operation from his apprehension until the time he left the

United States appears to have been accomplished in a close coordination with

I&NS.

go free and return to his wife in Cuba, as he

desired.

Through the cooperation of the Immigra-

tion and Naturalization Service and the U.S.

Border

Patrod, he was taken into custody and de-

tained until Security representatives could place

tamin a nearby ade or dese with

whom the Security Officer had established liai-

son.

No records are

maintained of the Incarcera-

tion and the sheriff and his deputies, have prom-

ised to deny that anyone was incarcerated should

there be any future inquiries by reporters.

The

Captain was removed from

the jail on 20 April

1961 taken to New York City, where arrangements

were made with the District

Director, IENS, to

allow him to remain in the area until 1 June

1961, when he expected to obtain the release

of

his wife and infant

son from Cuba.

This entire

incident was handled without incident or ani-
