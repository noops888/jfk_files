1• IN THE FACE OF MOUNTING EVIDENCE THAT ALVARADO IS FABRICATING HIS

STORY OF SEEING OSWALD TAKE MONEY IN THE CUBAN EMBASSY, URGE YOU FOLLOW

UP WITH HIS LOCAL NIC CASE OFFICER

AND

AVAIL

NIC SERVICE, WHICH CAN SEND

GOOD: KUS

YOURSE OF E2 OF THE

TO MELP

IN THE INTERROGATION.

WE FIND

INCREDITLE THAT THE

CUBANS WOULD

BRIEF AND PAY AN ASSASSIN IN FRONT OF A NIC INTERLOPERS WE THINK IT

POSSIBLE OR EVEN LIKELY THAT HE HAS BEEN IN AND OUT OF THE CUBAN EMBASSY

AS A MIC AGENT TRYING TO INFILTRATE CUBA AND HAS PICKED UP THE NANES AND

FACES THERE IN SO DOING.

ALL WE HAS SAID ABOUT OSWALD HE COULD HAVE

GOTTEN FROM THE NEUSPAPERS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN INCORRECT ITEMS SUCH AS

HIS STATEMENT THAT OSWALD WORE GLASSES.

INE FACT THAT ALVARADO IS A CALL, NICES AND INTELLIGENT YOUNG MAN

NOT MEAN HE IS NOT A FABRICATOR.

FYI VE AND OTHER AGENCIES ARE

BEING FLODDED BY FABRICATIONS ON THE GPFLOOR CASE FROM SEVERAL CONTINENTS

SOME ORIGINATING WITH PEOPLE ON THE FRINGES OF THE INTELLIGENCE BUSINESS.

SUCH PABRICATIONS ARE NOT USUALLY DONE FOR MONEY, BUT OUT OF SICKLY

FANCY AND A DESIRE TO CET INTO THE INTELLIGENCE GAME•

WE DO NOT THINK IT A REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE THAT BOTH DORTICOS ARD

PIVARADO TALK ABOUT MONEY PAID TO OSWALDO

FOR ONE THING, PAY FOR ANY

ASSASSIN IS A FACTOR WHICH IMMEDIATELY RIGES IN THE MIND OF EXPERT ANO

LAYMAN ALTARO SECONDLY, DORTICOS MAY HAVE HEARD THROUCH SOME RUSSIA!

OP. CUBAN SOURCE IN THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT THAT DURAN WAS ASKED WIETHER

THE CUBANS PAID OSWALD FOR THE ALLEGED ASSIGNMENT.

WHILE WE DO NOT INSIST THAT ALVARADO'S STORY IS BEYOND ALL BELIEF

WE DO URGE THAT MEXI PLACE IT AND ALVARADO UNDER THE MOST SEARCHING

SCRUTINY• HIS INTERROGATORS WUST PRODE DEEPLY INTO HIS MAKE-UP AND

LEAD HIM BACK THROUGH THE THROUGHT PRECESSES WHICH MAY HAVE LED HIM

MAKE THIS POSSIELE MIS-STEP.

I. SECURING CONFESSIONS OF FAPRICATION

A SINPAINETIC ATTITUDE, STRESSING AWARENESS OF THE SEVERE MENTAL STWAIN

THE SUBNECT MUST RE UNDERS AND WITH GENEROUS RECOGNITION OF HIS "DISIC-

ALLY FINE MOTIVATION," COUPLED WIT: PROMISES OF FACE-SAVING SECRECI

AND EVEN SPECIOUS HOPES OF "USEFUL? FUTURE COOPERATION ARE OFTEN EFFEC-

TIVE, HOURS MUST BE DEVOTES TO THESE TACTICS.
