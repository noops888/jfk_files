LINOUS INS LIASSA LILYRIC - Request for a loan to LIMOUSInE

ALION PIQUIRED: REFIRENCES

The ownership and bookkeeping of both the LIMES and

LILYRIC properties 18 carried in the name of a real estato compasy

which LIMOUSINS controls. Thie company owns several otber prop-

ortios including a major tract of land on the outskirts of Mexico

City which LIMOUSIN& has been holding for rosale at a profit.

However, his oxpenses on this property have been heavy over the

past year which bas left his company in a very short cash position.

LIMOUSIE delayed selling this tract pending completion of a high-

way which gives

access to the property and increases its value.

This highway is now complete and LIMOUSiNE is working out the

deta1l8 of

the salo of this property to a consortium of insurance

companies which will construct a housing developient.

LIMOUSINE

oxpocta to start reallzing substantial cash on this sale during

the third quarter of 1968.

Due to the short cash position of his company LINOUSINE

has asked the Station for a moratorium on the noney due to the

station from to LINESA and LILYRiC properties for calendar year

1967 and the first half of 1968. LIMOUSINE'& indebtednong to the

Station for calendar year 1967 18, as follows:

LIMESA - LIMOUSINE bes turned in an accounting on h1a

expenses for the LINESA property. which he has paid.

• After des

ducting his expenses (water, taxes, etc.) he owes the statlon

LILTRIC apartent wiich Is 3,000 MN per month or 36,000 MN poT

repayment sohol he should be pat 36, 00w ering 1967

the loan should be fully ropsid by June 1968.

LILYRIC)

By SU June 1968 his indebtednoss will be Increased by

approximately 25,210 MN (approximately 13,000 MN for LIMESA and

15,310 MN fOr LILYRICO

A LIMOUSINE's estimated total debt to the

Station by 30 Jane 1968 18 esttmated at 86,542.61 AN (58, 332.61:

iN for calender year 1967 and 28,210 MN for the first six monthe

of 1968)

86,543.61 MN equala $6,923, 11 (US/CY).

Therefore LIMOUSINE requests a loan of 58,332 MN,

amount already due to the Station for calendar year 1967 and &

second loan of approximately 28,210 IN which represents the money

which will be due on 30 June 1968 (LIMOUSINE accounts on a aeni

annual basts). He has promised to repay all monies due to the

Station during the third quarter of 1968.

5•

The Station strongly recommends approval of this loan

for the following reasons:

LIMOUSINE has been a falthful Station saset for many

years.

Re has nover rofused a request of the Station's and has

offered his sorricas continuously without renumeration (the Station

does give hia Christmas gifts)

financial dealtixs with the Statlon and we have no reason to bellove

that he will default on this debt.

Dire to unexpected construction and repair costs on

the LILYRIC building and & poor rental performance (this latter

1s partially due to the Station phich has vetoed soveral potential

tenants on security grounds), the LILTRIC building is in the

red. LINOUSIT doesn't expact it to be in the black for at least

two more years. Since the Station has turned down several tenants,

1t 18 partially rosponsible for

this problem.
