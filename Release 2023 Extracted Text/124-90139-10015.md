RE:

MARIA CELIA GIRONA SANCHEZ

ANTONIO DE SOUZA CARVOJAL

(8101

The foregoing was furnished

to the Liaison Agent on

November 29, 1963, by Austin Horn, CIA, who inquired if the Bureau

had any objection

to CIA initiating an approach of the subjects

through the use of Baralt ](S)

OBSERVATIONS :

It is the opinion of the Liaison Agent that CIA does

not have a strong foundation for initiating an approach as indicated.

The Agency could be on a fishing expedition and we may find it

desirable to object to CIA's proposed action in the absence of

additional information.

We also should bear

_in

mind that the

Bureau is free to consider the use of Baraltif we felt this

operation

should be handled by the Bureau.
