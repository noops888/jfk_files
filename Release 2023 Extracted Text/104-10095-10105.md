MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting of the Task Force (Augmented)

1. Bob Wall, Russ Holmes, Bill Sturbitts, Chris Hopkins,

Ray Reardon and Launie Ziebell met with John Leader and me

this afternoon for about an hour and 20 minutes. The subject

of the meeting was to discuss the problems posed by possible

unclassified release of Agency documents concerning Oswald

and related subject matter. Some of the points made are

summarized below.

2. Ziebell said that he had been engaged since April 1976

going through the so-called Oswald file page by page. He

estimates that 75% will be declassified by mid-December. The

kind of material being deleted for FOI release are as follows:

station references from cable traffic to avoid showing the

location of stations; information identifiable as having come

from Liaison; information identifying clandestine operations;

information identifying persons whose positions might be

impaired. He noted that the telephone taps in Mexico City

were among the deleted materials. He noted that there are

still some files to be reviewed in addition to the Oswald file,

including some 2-1/2 safe drawers in the Office of Security,

the Mexico City Station files, soft files, and "the Rocca collection,"

CIA/SIG, and OGC and DCI files.

3. Bill Sturbitts noted that Mexico will spon have a new

president, a man who has had control of Liaison for a number

of years.

He can be expected to not look favorably upon

publicity of that relationship. Sturbitts noted that the telephone

tap was involved in this relationship. Sturbitts also noted that

the photographs of the unidentified man at the Soviet Embassy,

if released without "cropping" to delete the background, would

reveal the location from which photograph surveillance was

conducted and make possible the identification of the person

in whose name the property was rented.

We discussed the size of the file problem, in addition

to the so-called Oswald file which is being declassified by

Ziebell.

The Cuban Ops file being reviewed by the Task

Force in LA Division does not, for the most part, have any

relation to assassinations; however, there were basically

some 900 file folders which in turn led to another 300

folders. Because these are basically operational files their

release poses problems.

5. There was discussion about sending a cable to the

Mexico City Station inquiring both as to what records are still

there relating to the period of Oswald's visit to Mexico and 24.

afterwards, and also for a statement on the reaction of Liaisonj

and the Mexican government if materials on this subject were

released to the public. The feeling was that such a cable should

come from the IG.

6. Bob Wall felt that the IG and the DDO should consider

the matter in preparation for discussions with the DDCI. Those

present agreed to assemble some material that would give some

feeling for the size of the problem, of reviewing for unclassified

release, and samples of the kinds of information that would be

released and the significance of it in security terms and in

terms of the Agency's equities.
