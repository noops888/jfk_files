COMMENTS RE DEROGATORY TRACES

ATTACHMENT TO FORM 772

Cancellation way roquested in February 1968 because

of indications that Subjout was involved in "clandestine sabotage

activity and suspicions that Subject failed to report his activi-

tios to CIA.

Thereaftor, Subject was treated as a "hostile".

In the ensuing months Subjoct was describod as

"an extremely

valuable penetration" because of his important and accurate

intelligence information and operational reports.

Subject was

givon a polygraph exanination

to clear up questions about pos-

siblo affiliation w1th Cuban intelligence, unreported associa-

tion with gangstor elements, etc.

His rosponses showed no

information which would provent CIA using him for ops purposes.

Request for POA was again requested on 7 September 1968.

This

РОЛ

request was turned down on 15 October due to Subject being

an

"agent of a foreign powor."

Sinco that tine Subject has continued to provide verbal

and written information roports concerning Communist and subver-

B1vo elements, guerrilla activities,

Soviot activities, sabotage,

continues to roport accuratoly and often and has

a very pro-U.s.

attitudo.

Subject was again polygraphed on

29 November 1971 (a copy

of which is

contained in

Subject's

CI/OA folder).

His responses indicated no deception concern-

1ng truthfulness of reporting to CIA,

no compromise of his

U.g. Government connections, non-involvement in illegal arms

dealings, etc.

MEMORANDUM FORS CI/OA

SUBJECT

AMCLEVE-15

(201-300985)

Subject, a Cuban now living in Caracas, Venezuela,

is a Station Caracas penetration of the Venezuelan General

Directorate of Police and of tho Special Group, a maller,

somewhat autonomous unit within DIGEPOL. A POA was requested

on Subject on 25 January 1968, to use Subject as stated above.

On l February 1967, WH/3/V requested cancellation of the POA

request because.of

indicationg that Subject was involved in

clandestine sabotage activity and there were suspicions that

he had failed to report his activities to CIA or DIGEPOL.

Station Caracas was directed to handle Subject as a "hostile".

The

Station was advised that they could maintain contact with

Subject as a source of information on activities of DIGEPOL

and the Special Group but that no requirements were to be

levied on him.

The Station was advised that they could make

spot payments for information received from Subject. CI/OPS

co-ordinated on these directions to Station Caracas.

The Station acknowledged their instructions but

demurred on Headquarters' interpretation of AMCLEVE-15'&

effect, that assets are

unsavory individuals, who are never under complete con-

trol and who soldom disclose the complete rango of their

activities to their supervisors.

The station added that they

were interested in subject because of his position as a "trusted

confidant" of certain highly placeu Venezuelan security officials.

In the ensuing months the Station came to describe

Subject as "an extremely valuable penetration" because of the

intelligence information and operational reports he furnished.

For example, he reported on the involvement of the Venezuelan

military in

a Cuban exile plan to attack Cuba.

And, he also

reported on

a plan of Cuban exiles to ship arms from Venezuela

as part of an infiltration scheme.

He has reported such

operational information as a deucription of the capabilities,

layout and equipment of DIGEPOL

operationa.

Included in this information was his report that, at least on

papor, the U.S. Embassy was a target for a operations.

has also reported on the personalities and workings of the

organizationg with which he 1s associated.

at the same timo

the Station had an independent report that Subject was involved.

in a scheme to obtain "curare poison for approximately forty

hypodermic necdles".

Information the Station did not query AMCLEVE-15 about the

mattor.

The Station said that they disapproved of his involve

ment in wild Cuban exile schemes but that Headquarters restriC-

tions in February 1968 prevented the Station from discussing this

involvement with him.

In May 1968, the Station informed Headquarters that

they belleved that Subject was collaborating fully with CIA and,

further, they believed that he would not expose, inforn, or

work against clA.

They added that Subject was still capable of

•engaging in independent Cuban exile

activity without informing-

his Cans Officer.

The Station also

requested a polygraph exam-

ination for subject.

5. Subject was given a polygraph examination to resolve

specifically his bona fides, possible affiliation with Cuban

Intelligence through relatives, unreportou association with

gangster elements, thefts from

WOFIRM and other questions

involving possible derogatory information on Subject. Subject' a

responses, described as substantially truthful by the examiners,

appear to contain no information which would prevent cIA's

operational use of Subject.

On only one question, that involv-

1ng Subject's association with an alleged rackoteer, Lefty Rodenthal,

sensitivity persist.

The examiner commented,

"...In fairness

to subject this sensitivity is belicved generated by genuine un-

certainty over the amount of Para military

items which he had

been instrumental in getting for Rosenthal from Cuban exile

arms supplies,
