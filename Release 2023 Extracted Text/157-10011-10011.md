attend a "leftist-sponsored" conference. (78) .

The March 1961 meeting was inconclusive, but it. led to other meetings out

of which Project A.M.LASH was created. A.M. LASH-1 "repeatedly insisted that

the essential first step in overthrowing the regime was the elimination of

CASTRO himself, which /A.M. LASH-17 claimed he was prepared to accomplish. He

repeatedly requested that we /CINT furnish him the special equipment or material

needed to do the job." (79).

with an effective range of hundreds or thousands of yards," (92) he decided finally

that he knew, as a Doctor of Medicine, that "we could devise some technical means

of doing the job that would not automatically cause him to lose his own life in

the try." (92)

Samuel HALPERN and@SANCHEZ requested assistance from Dr. Edward GUNN of the CIA

Office of Medical Services.

(92)

On Nov. 20, 1963, they told GUNN that "the

device for administering the poison (a ball point pen rigged as a hypodermic syringe)

had to be ready in time for SANCHEZeto catch a plane at noon the next day." (93)

The next day GUNN delivered to SANCHEZ a pen capable of injecting a poisonous

insecticide known as "black leaf 40". (92-93)

Bill Harvey's absence) specifically for information about all CIA action teams inside

Cuba on 30 Oct and again on 31 Oct so that I could give a firm report to Dept. Sect.

Gilpatric prior to negotiations with the Soviets. Chered had not mentioned the

Matahambre sabotage team when I asked about action teams inside. Chevegedid mention

that two action teams were inside (ome small one in contral Cuba, an in a but

200 men in Western Cuba), that these teams were under orders not to

"at 16:50 tonight, Lt. Col. Patchel informed me that

Bob Hurwitch of State had just telephoned to report that Radio Havanna reported the

capture of a CIA sabotage team at the Matahambre mines.

Lansdale was in a staff meeting at the time and he asked Patchel to check the truth

of the information with CIA. Patchel informed Lansdale at 1705 that he had talked

to Bill Harvey who reported that sabotage teams (of 4 and 2 men each) had departed

the US on 17 Oct and gone in on 19 Oct, made an attempt, gone into hiding when the

exfiltration point was cut off; they had remained in hiding until 2 Nov, when they

were picked up.

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states:

"The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false.

Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandum dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonic conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and Cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous operations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and AMORT) teams and Lansdale did not ask, according to Cheever

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

OCCURRENCE:

President Kennedy's visit to Mexico greatly enhanced U.S. goodwill in

It fulfilled U.S. plans to impress upon Castro that Mexico is solidly with the

United States and the West. State believes this should ease the way for future discussions

about Cuba with the Mexicans. Re: Operation MONGOOSE, the joint communique issued by

"They proposed

to respect and maintain the principles of non intervention--whether this intervention

may come from a continental or extracontinental state--and of self-determination of

peoples." In response to a Lansdale query, the Department of State noted that "There

were no developments resulting from the President's trip to Mexico including the text

of the joint United States-Mexico communique which alter the basic guidelines which govern

the Cuba Project." Lansdale noted that the CIA now had 45 Asians in Havana operating.

OCCURRENCE: As to Phase I, CIA staff personnel up to 47) are devoting full time to this

effort. "A very large number of additional personnel are devoting part time efforts to

Operation MONGOOSE." Hard intelligence coverage of Cuba has been developed. Fifty-nine

controlled agents inside of Cuba exist. Not so successful on infiltrating intelligence

reporting in resistence cadre teams. Failure to meet the original schedule of team in*

filtrations primarily was due to two factors: "(a) Lack of policy approval by higher --

authority to make ary extensive utilization of Department of Defense personnel and support."

"Had we been permitted to mount a more intensive and agressive, the original infiltration

schedule probably would have been met, possibly exceeded." The speed and extent of future

infiltration teams for resisitence purposes into Cuba "will of course depend upon policy

approvals by higher authority and the amount of support we can count on thereunder."
