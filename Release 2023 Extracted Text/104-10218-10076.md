3. In; is sub' itting the apartsent she occupies here. She

hi:: purchased the KUBARK-owned household effects which

2n I' id to her for that apartment. For this

She was given a post office box address to use to contact

the Station in the event that she does return to Mexico

and joels it necessary to do 8o. But no committeent was

nade to her regarding any future contact or payzent for

Information.

5.

She was previously told that the telephone number of the

New YOT& KUBARK OffICo is listed In the directory and

she could call that office 11 contact vere necessary while

she was in the lalted States. She asked li that would

still bi the case and was told that it was but only to

attempt such contact for an important or urgent matter.

But sin:a she tends to liberally apply importance to a

vide Viiloty of events and subjects, and since she 1s

Ilkely is be short of money shortly after arriving, 1t

would rit be surprising 11 she did try to establish such

contact.

The first steps to organize the lcxican triters'

issocia-

-tion (AEM - Asociación de Escritores de l'éxico) were taien

in February of 1964 after Bartolome Costa-inie and the Zaulana

Bookstores published a proposal in the netropoiltan neispigers,

offering to establish a rew series of libary prizes ind urgirg

the lexican writers to join an association that could provide

material berefits for its senbers. The first necting of the

Ars was held on 1i August 1951. For sone tine the ArM renaired.

organized

fron time to tire, such as the society of literary i-

thors and The Society of Friends of Mexican Bools wiich never

achieved aby effectiveness or respectability. lenico's establis:?:

and well knor writers have airays shunned these urganizations.

LICookY-1 became interested in the 1n: through her triendshi?

with Costa-nic and sar the rossibilit; of building tre in iuta

an organization which would include the middle of the road and

right wing authors tbo had been systeratically boycottec since

the Lazaro Cárdenas' regine then Narciso Bassols, a menber of thie

Connunist Party, was linister of Education.

3. LICCOKY-l began a one nan canpaign oi recruiting relatively

well known right wing vriters who could tot be considered rediccre

or nonentities. As LICCOLY-i's campaign bozan to succeed it be-

case easier to recruit the more importart writers of lexico cover-

persuaded Carlos Pellicer Ciara, well koon Mexican rost, 10

miters to join. In all LICCCKY-l recruited about 30 of the well

known lexican uriters to conc into the dt"'. it this tine LICOCKY-

I knew nothing of the Curopean Community of triters (cours - Soviel a tusia

Conunité Juropea degli Scrittor!) or plans to form a carous its s

of Latin American Vriters (CLE - Comunidad intinoanericana de

Escritores).

1. LICCOKY-l has been appointed to the Board of Directors es

the iD! which permits LICOOKY-l 10 attend all toard l'eetings and

she is relied upon to do all details of organization and planning

the ari projects

to assist the l'exican vriter which is the ültin: ti

objective of the AE!!.

5. In this work LICOCitY-I has developed friendships with the

leaders of the AEl Including Fellicer and Juar Rulfo, both of

whon were Mexican delegates to the COCS Conference held in

Geneva, Switzerlard during the winter of 1955. Feilicer has i-

vited LICOCky=l to his bore ind confers with iei on int grubiers,

usually once a week. She has free entrance to zullo's office it tic

Instituto Indigenista und he has visited LICOXY-l's apartnent.

to defeat any atteupts by COUES through its affiliate Cli to foir.
