EFFECT OF AID WITHIN ANY GIVEN COUNTRY.

HE SAID THAT FOR THE PAST: TWO OR

THREE MONTHS, HE HAD COMMENTED ON PRESIDENT DIEM'S AND HIS OWN RECOGNITION

THAT SOUTH VIETNAM MUST ACHIEVE BETTER QUALITATIVE UTILIZATION OF AMERICAN

AID, HE REITERATED HIS CONCEPT OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY, HIS THEME THAT AN

UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRY SHOULD NOT BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO LIVING AT TOO

ARTIFICIALLY HIGH A STANDARD BASED ON FOREIGN AID, AND HE EXPRESSED THE

BELIEF THAT SOUTH VIETNAM IS MOVING TOWARD A BETTER "STRUCTURED" UTILIZATION

OF. AID AND IS CONCENIRATING IT AT THE GRASS ROOTS AMONG THE PEASANTRY. HE

COMMENTED THAT URBAN INDUSTRIALIZATION AND OTHER FORMS OF URBAN DEVELOPMENT

DID NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE MASS OF PEOPLE AND PROVED TOO SLOW IN ACHIEVING

AN IMPACT. HE REMARKED THAT HE CONTINUES TO SEARCH FOR WAYS TO DIMINISH THE

LEVEL OF FOREIGN AID REQUIRED IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND BELIEVES ALSO THAT WAYS

SHOULD BE FOUND TO DIMINISH THE NUMBERS OF AMERICANS DEPLOYED THERE. HOWEVER,

NHỤ DID NOT IMPLY THAT ESSENTIAL AID OR ESSENTIAL AMERICAN PRESENCE SHOULD IN

ANY WAY BE DISCARDED..

3.

NHU SAID THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND CONGRESS TEND TO LOOK UPON

THE PROBLEM OF UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES AS AN ISOLATED PROBLEM ACCENTUATED

CRITICALLY BY THE COMMUNIST THREAT, AND TO CONSIDER. AID AND AMERICAN PRESENCE

MORE AS MEASURES IN THEMSELVES BY WHICH IO MEET THESE CRISES. ON THE OTHER

HAND, NHU AND DIEM SEE AMERICAN AID AND PRESENCE IN SOUTH VIETNAM, ACCORDING

TO NEU, GIVEN THE LARGE SCOPE OF THE PHENOMENA, AS A RAMIFYING "MEETING OF

CIVILIZATIONS. " NEU SAID THAT DIEM HAD USED THIS EXPRESSION RECENTLY IN AN

INTERVIEW WITH AMERICAN REPORTERS TO MEAN THE MEETING OF WESTERN (AMERICAN)

CIVILIZATION WITH SOUTH VIETNAMESE CIVILIZATION. NEU REMARKED THAT THIS WAS

A FERMENTING PROCESS AND COULD HAVE "EXPLOSIVE" CONSEQUENCES FOR SOUTH VIETNAM.

NEU COMMENTED THAT THESE CONSEQUENCES OF THE "MEETING OF CIVILIZATIONS" WERE

INHERENT IN OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE FOREIGN AID AND PERSONNEL WERE PRESENT TO

A LARGE DEGREE. IN THIS CONNECTION, NHU SAID THAT COLONIALISM IN ITSELF HAD

NOT BEEN ALL BAD. REFERRING TO VIETVAM'S EXPERIENCE WITH THE FRENCH, NEU SAID

THAT THE WORST ASPECTS OF COLONIALISM HAD COME AT THE LOWER RANKS OR AT THE

BOTTOM OF THE FRENCH COLONIAL STRUCTURE AND THAT THEY HAD RESULTED FROM THE

ACTIVITIES OF FRENCH "ADVENTURERS," COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVES, AND LOWER

FUNCTIONARIES. HE: ADDED THAT THESE KINDS OF REPRESENTATIVES WERE PRESENT ALSO

AMONG THE AMERICANS CURRENTLY IN SOUTE VIETNAM, WHILE, AT THE UPPER ECHELON OF

AMERICAN PRESENCE, THERE WERE MANY REPRESENTATIVES WHOSE ROLE WAS CONSTRUCTIVE

AND HELPFUL TO SOUTH VIETNAM.

4. NHU CONTINUED BY EMPHASIZING THAT HE IS NOT ANTI-AMERICAN AND THAT

HE HOPED THAT HIS COMMENTS WOULD NOT BE MISCONSTRUED IN THAT SENSE. HE SAID

THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM HAS ATTEMPTED TO PROVIDE ITS PEOPLE WITH A

CLEAR NATIONAL DOCTRINE AND THAT HE FELT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD MADE CONSIDERABLE

PROGRESS IN ACHTEVING THIS GOAL. HE COMMENTED THAT IN HIS OPINION, THIS WAS NOT

THE CASE TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO, BUT HAS BECOME TRUE GRADUALLY DURING THE
