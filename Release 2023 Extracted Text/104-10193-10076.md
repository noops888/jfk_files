I concar in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on duties No. 2, 3 and +.

I believe desy io. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong, "

with jastification. I also think, however, that duty No. I, insolving the overall

administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more

appropriateiy be rated "proficient, " or perhaps "strong."

I concur in the evaluations given Mr. Harvey on' duties No. 2, 3 and 4.

I believe duty No. 2 could have been rated "outstanding" rather than "strong, "

with justification. I also think, however, that dity No. I, involving the overail

administration and management of the Station and its personnel, should more

appropriately be rated "proficient, " or perhaps "strong. "

It is difficult to prepare a fitness report on this

" largely because forms do not lend them-

selves to measuring

his many unique characteristics.

His

strengths are in professional knowledge and competence in

the operational field, in & toughness of mind and firmness

of attitude, while the latter in past years have moved him

into positions that were sometimes stronger than superior

officers, with a responsibility for adjustuents necessary

in matters of policy in relation to Agency position in the

community, were able to handle easily, his own closeness to

policy positions. of the Agency within the U.S. community in

the last two years has found him with a real ability to

handle policy matters

and to adjust to necessitles, without

losing his firmness and his independence of thought.

2.

He is sometimes accounted to be less than outgiving

of information about operational matters in which he is engaged,

yet it should be remembered that this characteristic has been

part and parcel: of a sound operational attitude in his career.

He has a wide knowledge of personalities vithin the officer

corps of the DD/P and is for the most part a good selector of

officers to accomplish necessary tasks..

MEMORANDUN IN LISU OF FITNESS REPORT

The following statement relates to the performance of.

Willian K. Harvey, GS 18, Chief of FI, Division D.

This officer has held a series of responsible positions

in DD/P and its predecessor clandestine intelligence organiza-

tion for well over ten years:

clandestine operations in general and especially so in that

phase öf clandestine staff. and operational activities concerned

with the procurement, handling and exploitation of highly

sensitive ard critical intelligence and operational materials.

BERE

His performance generally over the recent years has

proved him to be one of the outstanding officers of the DD/P

organization.

He has demonstrated clearly superior perfornance

both in

staff responsibility at leadquarters and as Chief of

Base in a very important field station where he was directly

• engaged

in supervising and carrying

on operations successfully

against targets of the highest priority.

In the period under review, June 1959 to. March 1960, he

took

over and

directed functioning of one of DD/Ps most

sensitive components charged with achievement by special

means against targets of the highest importance.

This included

carrying on negotiations and liaison with other components

of CIA and other Agercies and Departments of the U. S. Government

concerned with his special field.

His performance of this

responsibility in many respects has been outstanding.

He has

continued to demonstrate his fitness to handle a wide range of

positions of major responsibility within the clandestine service.

Among his outstanding characteristics.are: thorough

understanding of his profession and ability to make

this clear

Services is general.

SUBJECT:

Fitness Report - William K. Harvey.

November 1957 - January 1959 -

1. Subject's abilitles and performance are too generally known

to require detailed comment.

One of the very senor officers in.

KUDOVE he has been chief of what is probably

the largest and most.

productive overseas Base of KUBARK for approximately seven years.

During this period Subject has been personally responsible for a

number of operational successes, some of inich have been of national

importance.

Possessed of driving eneras, determination and initia-.

tive, he has fei equals in professional experience and competence.

Throughout his administration.of the Baze he has establisned and.

maintained. exceedingly high standards of accomplistent, discipline

and endeavor.

•Subject's judgement, on occasion, is Impulsive and

proposals of

the Base havi been, fron time to time, advanced and

defended with greater vehemence

and more. exhaustively than the

occasion, objectively.speaking,

required. Subject's basic self-

discipline, good sense and loyalty, however, have prevented any such

Incidents; which are in large measure manifestations of the highly

charged atmosphere

from

and insistent operational pressures of Berlin,

developing into serious I'riction with the German Station or

washington headquarters.

2.

It has been a pleasure to serve with this officer and,

during nis assignaent, he has consistently rendered dedicated and

effective service of the very highest order.
