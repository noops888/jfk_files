HISTORICAL RECORD OF JUWTFA CUBAN OPERATION
1. PURPOSE.
The purpose of this report is to document activities of Joint Uncon-
ventional Warfare Task Force, Atlantic (JUWTFA) during the CUBAN operations
from 25 October 1962 through 1 December 1962.
2. GENERAL.
a. JUNIFA was activated at Fort Bragg, North Carolina on 25 October
1962 by direction of Commander in Chief, Atlantic with the approval of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Major General (then Brig Con) William P.
Yarborough, Commanding General, US Army Special Warfare Center was
designated Commander, JUWIYA as an additional duty by CINCIANT with the
concurrence of CG, USCONARC.
b. CINCIANT component commanders, with the exception of CTALANT
activated JUWTFA component forces required under Appendix II to Annex Y
of CINCLANT Contingency Operation Plan 314/316-61 and passed operational
control to JUWIFA on 26 October 1962. CIAJUWTFA was not activated during ?
the emergency. OPCON of Naval forces listed in Appendix II was not passed
to COMNAVJUVIFA. Naval forces were made available on an "as required".
basis.
c. Planning and operations commenced on 26 October 1962 and continued
through 1 December 1962.
3. MISSION.
a. The JUVIFA mission was to prepare, coordinate, and execute as
directed by CINCLANT, a detailed country plan for the conduct of uncon-
ventional warfare (UW) operations in CUBA
b. As stated in COMJUWTFA (Draft) OPLAN 314/316-62, COMJUWTFA would,
when directed by CINCLANT, (conduct unconventional warfare operations in
CUBA in support of and in coordination with plans and objectives of
CINCLANT component commanders to:
(1) Reduce the combat effectiveness and morale of the CASTRO
Government.
(2) Provide U. S. military personnel and other selected individuals
the means to remain free from enemy control in unfriendly territory

AUGMENTATION.
JUWTFA.
(1) Prior to the activation of JUWTFA, JUWTFA planning and
functions were a responsibility of the Plans Division (J58) of CINCLANT.
At activation, JUWTFA was organized in accordance with the joint Table
of Distribution in Appendix II to Annex Y of CINCLANT OPLAN 314/316-61
and provided 26 officers and seven enlisted men. JUWTFA was augmented
with additional persomel under authority contained Sub-section 5,
Section 2, JCS Pub 2, dated November 1959, subject: Unified Action
Armed Forces, (UNAAF).
(2) The initial staffing of JUWTFA was inadequate and required
considerable personnel augmentation to provide internal and external
security, communications and administrative support, liaison, and additional
staff personnel to plan and conduct operations.
(3) Additional personnel and equipment were obtained from the
Army and Air Force to provide essential communications on a twenty-four
hour basis, provide adequate administrative and control procedures, and
augment the staff to meet all operational requirements.
(4) Based on the augmentation needed to make JUWTFA fully
operational, recommendations were submitted by COMJUWTFA letter, dated
26 November 1962, subject: "Organization for the Conduct of Unconventional
Warfare in the Atlantic Command Area." This letter proposes a new Joint
Table of Distribution providing for a full wartime complement, a planning
staff, and the necessary staff augmentation to bring the planning staff
to its full wartime complement.
b. ARJUWTFA.
(1) Colonel William Evans-Smith, Commanding Officer, 7th Special
Forces Group Airborne, Ist Special Forces was designated Commander, Army
Forces, JUWTFA (COMARJUWTFA) on 26 October 1962 A command and control
element, Special Forces Operational Base (CSFOB) was activated at Fort
Bragg, and COMARJUWTFA was assigned operational control of Army Forces
listed in Appendix II to Annex Y of CINCLANT OPLAN 314/316-61, less the
military police platoon, light truck company, and CIC detachment.
(2) Subsequently, CG, USA SPWAR Cen was directed by CINCARLANT
to provide ARJUWTFA, from within U. S. Army Special Warfare Center resources,
the psychological warfare, CIC, light truck and military police type support

listed under Appendix II to Annex Y of CINCLANT OPLAN 314/316-61. Augmenta-
tion from outside U. 8. Army Special Warfare Center resources was required
to provide military police type support for both JUWTFA and ARJUWTFA
security. Two officers and 66 enlisted men were attached to ARJUWTFA as
a substitute measure.
(3) In addition to the above augmentation, the SFOB was augmented
to achieve a proper operational readiness status, Further, ARJUWIFA
operational planning and training exercises conducted indicated a require-
ment for additional SFOB cugmentation and increased force tabs to properly
undertake operations in CUBA Recommendations for changes in the ARJUWTFA
troop list vere forvarded to CINCIANT by let. Indorsement, this headquarters,

e. CIA(PROV). JUWIFA.
18 December 1962
(1) A CIA Liaison Officer was furnished-to-JUWTFA on 26 October
1962. The representation provided was of no real value in operational
planning Insofar as his fametioning was primarily that of a liaison
officer with CTALANT rather then an integral member of the JUWTEA staff.
(2) The organization, resources and capabilities of CIAJUWTFA
were unknown to JUWIFA throughout the operation. Consequently its
augmentation needs ware not determined.
5. EXERCISES CONDUCTED: During the period 20 October 1962 through
4 December 1962, JUWTFA monitored and/or conducted the following exercises
and training:
Amphibious Training Exercise:
(1) During the period 2-5 November 1962. twelve selected Special
Forces personnel conducted Belf Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCUBA)
lock-out training from submarine USS SPIKKFISH, vicinity Norfolk, Virginia.
Adverse weather and the inability of submarines to bottom because of
external SONAR equipment precluded fulfillment of all training objectives.
However, familiarization was accomplished in lock-out procedures and the
tecimiques of lung svim drills, shipboard training, and infiltration from
submarines. This training pointed out certain deficiencies in amphibious
entry techniques. Further joint training is required to perfect and
standardize Special Forces techniques in all phases of amphibious entry
operations.
(2) During the period 3-4 November 1962, the two Special Forces
"A" Detachments scheduled for infiltration from submarines participated
in amphibious infiltration training vicinity Mayport, Florida. Utilizing
submarines USS SEA CAT and USS TIRANTE, training was conducted in ombarka-
tion, debarkation, float outs and towing, beach Landing, and recovery
operations. Considerable difficulty was encountered because the Special
Forces Detachments lacked proper equipont, rubber landing boats, safety
equipment, and water proofing material. In aterial. In addition, the detachments
had had no previous training in submarine operations. Results of training
were unsatisfactory and additional training was requested, including the
use of SEAL Team Detachments for beach reconnaissance, after receipt of
proper equipment.
(3) A second submarine training exercise was conducted in the
Florida Key area on 16-17 November 1962 by two Special Forces "A" Detach-
ments and two SEAL Team Detachments, who embarked on the USS SEA CAT and
USS TIRANTE from Key West, Florida. Ten-man rubber boats had been procured

and the Special Forces Detachments had conducted inflatable boat training
et OPA LOCKA. This training, the previous submarine training, the use of
proper equipment and the use of SEAL Toom Detachments, all contributed to
a successful exercise. Problems encountered revealed a need for allent
motors for Special Forcen uss, Infra-red signalling equipment for Special
Forces SEAL Team use, better waterproofing material for equipment.
b. Joint Air-Ground Operations:
Throughout the month of November 1962 all Special Forces detech-
ments scheduled for air infiltration conducted air drops and tactical
exercises from lot Air Commando Group C-47 and C-46 aircraft at Fort
Bragg, North Carolina. Instruction and training included the use of the
CIA procured HRT-2 Homing Beacon and the commercially procured SKYCRAFTER
VHF (AM) radio for air-ground commmication. Results obtained on both
items were marginal and the development of satisfactory equipment 10
required. The field exercise covered marshalling, infiltration, assembly,
sterilization of DZ's, movement to safe areas, and establishing commics-
tion. While the above training was considered successful it was apparent
that additional Special Forces - Air Forces training in unconventional
warfare air operations is required to develop better techniques, coordina-
tion, and ability to conduct unconventional warfare air operations.
c. Exercise Devil's Trident:
This exercise was conducted, as approved and directed by CINCLANT,
beginning with E-Day DEFCON stand down on 30 November 1962 and ending with
exfiltration (D13) on 4 December 1962. The purpose of the exercise was to
cest modified prepositioning, infiltration, and resupply phases of COMJUWTTA
OPLAN 314/316-62, follow-on detachments were not played. Although the Sea
infiltration was successful and all flights were flown, on schedule, train-
ing results were considered marginal because adverse weather precluded
actual infiltration and resupply drops and adverse atmospheric conditions
Msrupted comamications. However, JUWTFA planning for prepositioning,
infiltration, and rosupply phases was considered valid.
6. PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED.
General: Problems were encountered in all the major JUWIPA
functional areas. In some cases these problems were solved, in others
unsolved because solution was beyond the capability of COMJUVIFA. The
major problem areas are discussed in the body of this report. Others,
less significant to effective performance are discussed in the separate
inclosures and appendices.
b. Personel and Administration:

(1) No mobilisation designee rosters were maintained for JUWTFA
in pre-alert plamming. JUVIFA was hastily manned with officers and
enlisted men with, for the most part, no previous exposure to unconventional
varfare and joint staff duty.
(2) The Mobilization JTD-made no provision for headquarters
support personnel Comcenter, Bupply, Adjutent General and Security.
In consequence, no units or activities had been_previously designated to
provide this support Personnel, when finally made available, were not
properly qualified to perform their duties. Particular difficulty arose
with respect to security clearances. The headquarters was manned by some
key personel who were
who were not cleared for Top Secret material, and more serious,
staff section chiefe not efo not authorized access to consitive intelligence which
was prerequisite to valid planning.
؟
(3) The procedures and policies for administration were completely
lacking on activation of JUWTFA. In consequence, diversion of effort and
backtracking to correct errors occurred in the formative stage which were
Injurious to operations and planning.
c. Logistics
(1) Logistical planning for guerrille supplies had not progressed
to the point of solid coordination of qualitative and quantitative require
ments. Specific requirements, including packaging and rigging conformation,
were not determined. CIA prepacks for the initial supply of a 5,000-man
force were the only supplies available throughout the operation. Pre-
stock requirements to includo storage and positioning are not fully met
at this time.
(2) Advanced base reconnaissance and base support agreements were
non-existent at the time of the alert. JUVIFA support requirements were
imposed an unprogrammed responsibilities of installation and activity
commanders in consequence. This situation was equally applicable to air
movement requirements for prepositioning and displacement and coordination
of post-link up logistic support of JUWTFA forces in CURA. The latter two
problem areas are the subject of coordination at this time.,
d. Operations and Intelligence:
(1) The largest single impediment in the field of operations and
intelligence was the almost complete gap which existed between the CIA
and JUWITA. This single factor makes any confidence in the JUWIFA plans
evolved during the emergency an impossibility. The nature of unconven-
tional warfare is such that there must be a continuity in operations and
intelligence in the transition from a condition short of war to military
operations. The lack of such continuity makes unconventional warfare

COMJUWTFA CS
SUBJECT: Historical Record of JUWTFA CUBAN Operation
18 December 1962
operations in support of contingency operations by a JUWIF a movement
planning exercise unrelated to the situation which exists in the target
area.
(2) The complete and utter lack of current unconventional warfare
catimates of the situation with resultant working intelligence require-
ments led to serious intelligence gaps which were never closed during the
operation. This situation was aggravated by what can be considered a
denial of available intelligence of a sensitive nature due to lack of prior
establislment of the need for access and need-to-know for JUNTEA Head-
quarters in pre-emergency planning.
(3) The pre-emergency JUWIFA planning was premised on preparation.....
of country plans by a subordinate Tenent of COMJUWIFA when activated.
This procedure delayed evolution of properly coordinated plans until the
onset of the emergency and created a situation which was not conducive to
planning an unconventional warfare operation.
(4) Psychological Warfare and Civil Affairs plamming was impeded
by policy gaps, lack of discernible continuity of objectives jectives and programing
for Cuban operation and intelligence upon which viable planning could be
based.
(5) Plaming requirements completely unrelated to JUVITA capabili-
ties, unsupported by proper policy guidance as to national policy, without
allocation of resources necessary for operations, and seemingly inconsistent
with national intelligence estimates diverted from the effort to evolve a
workable plan for support of CINCIANT OPLAN 316-62. This was particularly
serious in view of the limited unconventional warfare experience in the
JUWTTA staff.
e. Commmications:
(1) Pro-emergency planning gaps in frequency allocations, reargition
signals and link up communications requirements vere a cause of major careera
in the first two weeks of planning.
(2) Cryptographic clearances and devices which were required for
COMJUWTFA COmmand and control denied JUWTFA headquarters direct communica-
tions with component forces and adjacent headquarters for the first week
of operations.
(3) Pre-emergency planning gaps in communications equipment
requirements and procurement lead times led to acquisition of equipment
fron JUWTFA component forces at the expense of their capability to support
themselves in case of displacement to CUBA. This situation had not
been corrected as of 1 December 1962.

f. Funding.
18 December 1962
Prior plamming for funding was not in sufficient detail. No
provision had been made prior to activation for financial arrangements
which would provide the necessary funding for establishment of the
beadquarters or to obtain supplies and equipment on an emergency basis.
g. Force Tabs.
(1) The uni-service allocation of Special Forces assets without
a positive control by JCS as to priorities aggravated by transitional
reorganisation associated with the Special Action Force concept found
Special Forces with a dearth of area and linguistically qualified
personnel.
(2) Incomplete pre-emergency planning failed to develop full
requirements for Special Forces participation in CINCIANY OPLAN 316-62,
This was particularly apparent in liaison requirements.
h. Training.
(1) The operation demonstrated a need for Special Forces amphibious
training in submarine infiltration techniques.
(2) Air ground training demonstrated the need for additional
training of both Air Force personnel and Special Forces in the conduct of
unconventional warfare air operations.
