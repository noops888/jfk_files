MEMORANDUM FOR THE KECO.O

SUBJECT: Anatole RE NOSENKO

1.

i 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1969, Anatole Was

consuliod about the NOSENKO case as a fcllo-up to the late

January 1969 neetings. He gave recommendations concerning

the procedures and topics to be covered during the begin-

ning phases of additional elicitation fron NOSENKO which is

to bagin scon.

?. To provide a basis for discussion certain papers

had been prepared for Anatole's revier. (See Attachment A

for list.) These papers were basically questionnaires about

some of the unresolved or questionable aspects of the

NOSENKO case based jaigely on the conidi themes Anatole

hed highlighted or 17 January 1969 when he corsented after

reviewing the October 1957-December 1968 interviers of

NOSENKO. (See transcripts KY 1, 2, 3 and 4.) Other papers

concerned topics related to the NOSENTO case, senoranda

NOSENKO had written, sumnaries and questionnaires prepared

fron both collateral infornation and NOSENKO's intormation

and sunnaries and questionnaires prepared exclusively on

the basis of information obtained from NOSENKO during the

1967-68 interview period. Each of these papers was read by

Anatole. Anatole's comment, our discussion, or any comment

is detailed in Attachment B, which sets forth crucial ques-

tions in the NOSENKO case.

3. Anatole was told The Director had decided that the

question of NOSENKO's bona fides had not been resolved and

had directed that additional elicitation and questioning of

NOSENKO would be undertaken innediately and expeditiously

pursued. It was understood, of course, as Anatole knew,

that he was to make a major contribution to the questioning

of NOSENKO and that information to this end would be made

available to him: there will be the closest coordination

with hin, including a timely review of future transcripts

based on the new elicitation phase.

It was understood his

views, comments and recommendations will be transmitted and

seriously considered if not explicitly implemented. Anatole

emphasized the need for him to review in advance all topics,

if not in all cases the specific questions, to be discussed

with NOSENKO after the new elicitation phase begins. He

understands the new elicitation phase will begin with Attach-

ment C and that there will be no additional topics discussed

with NOSENKO until after Anatole has an opportunity to

review them and comment.

4. The following summary points energed during the

course of our discussions as things which nust be considered

in the NOSENKO case information and as papers or question-

naires are outlined and topics selected for further elicita-

tion from NOSENKO:

a. NOSENKO, as I understand the situation, has

had full access to newspapers, magazines, radio and TV since

approximately August 1968. Anatole was told I have no

knowledge of the periodicals or cooks he has read.

b. NOSENKO has recently been afforded a controlled

break from isolation and an opportunity to have feminine

companionship.

c. Since December 1968 the FBI has been inter-

viewing NOSENKO about topics previously discussed as well as

other matters of interest to the FBI which do not originate

with NOSENXO. Anatole noted that FBI access to NOSENKO must

be controlled according to the new elicitation procedures.

d. That it is my opinion only that NOSENKO may

think he is entering into or close to entering into a new

relationship with the Agency on the basis that he has

satisfactorily answered all questions during the period

1967-68.

e. That it has not been possible and it may never

be possible to isolate or pinpoint either the exact informa-

tion or the point in time when NOSENKO was given new infor-

nation or additional information which might be relevant

upon analysis to the question of his bona fides or his mission.

f. To date there has been a concentration on pre-

paring elicitation questions on the basis of information

obtained during 1967-68 period because (a) this is the infor-

mation Anatole has reviewed, and (b) this information has been

considered to be the standard for assessing NOSENKO and his

information and arriving at conclusions, since these inter-

views were designed to elicit information which would help

resolve discrepancies apparent in his previous statements,

and (c) at this time this information is better organized

and in contrast to infornation from 1962, 1964, etc., is

retrievable as an accurate or literal NOSENKO statement.

8. That the sumnaries and questionnaires, prepared

to date may not include every conment or statement NOSENKO

has made during the 1967-68 period because it has not yet

been possible to isolate, by indexing and extraction, every

riference to a person or a topic. Anatole was told that

the sorting or isolation process has been completed only

through Memorandun N-188, from a total of approximately 260

memoranda.

It was emphasized that most topics and persons

were discussed with NOSENKO several times

at varying intervals,

and that the majority of topics were not covered to completion

in one or two interviews. NOSENKO also wrote memoranda on

topics which may not have been covered during interview or

which may relate to interview topics but which have not yet

been correlated with the interviews.

h. That research and analysis on most topics is

incomplete, both with respect to collateral information and

previous statements from NOSENKO.

i. That, as Anatole knows, there is certain collateral

or related information such as information from the FBI con-

cerning NOSENKO which has not been made available to him.

Anatole realizes this type of information may be vital to any

consideration of the NOSENKO case and he also points out the

possible if not probable relationship between FBI infornation

and sources and the problem of penetration of American intel-

ligence and Soviet disinformation. He hopes the FBI will

agree to release pertinent information to him and discuss

sources in the ncar future. He realizes any analysis or

assessment of the NOSENKO case will suffer to the extent

infornation

is withheld from hin. Anatole understands the

problem even though he obviously does not accept it as

logical or helpful. He stresses the need for us to press

the FBI to make appropriate information available to him.

j. M

That infornation we are dealing with in the

transcripts of the 1967-68 NOSENKO interviews is not neces-

sarily information previously known to or discussed with

NOSENKO and that, for instance, the body of informaticn ro-

sulting from the 1967-68 information has been expanded con-

siderably by NOSENKO's review of hundreds of names and

photographs provided him. It was also noted that it has not

yet been possible to isolate topics new to NOSENKO about

which he was asked to comment during this period. Neither

have we been able to isclate or determine when in the past

new, topics or questions of possible significance were intro-

duced to NOSENKO.

4. We discussed in detail Anatole's recommendations

and evolved an iritial selection of Crucial Questions (Attach-

ment B) and from these the first topics and/or questions to

begin in the new elicitation phase with NOSENKO (Attachment C).

Anatole expects to review

and comnent and to frame additional

questions after he reviews the transcripts of the first

elicitations. He has requested and expecis, as this can be

accomplished, to review and comment about a summary of each

Crucial Question.. The summary is to set forth both collateral

and NOSENKO information and detail, with attachments if neces-

sary, exactly what NOSENKO has said. Also, pertinent photo-

graphs and appropriate other documentation is to be attached

for comment or verification of identity by Anatole. Anatola

insists that he review and assist in the framing of all ques-

tions to be assed of NOSENKO and he states that he will

stipulate the order of questioning by both topic and specific

question where appropriate. He will specify or indicate areas

as set forth in Attachment C where questioning may proceed

without his detailed guidance but he expects to be consulted

about each topic. He pians to carefully tailor the elicitation

approach and, more importantly, to

set down detailed guidelines

to follow when the elicitation or questioning becomes nore

direct and concerned with those subjects considered, now or

later as revised, Crucial Questions. Anatole foresees a period

of relatively bland elicitation which will be followed by a

gradual sharpening of questions to the point where there will

be a confrontation or hostile interrogation. He also foresees

another polygraph oxanination either before or after the

period of confrontation. The

method or approach to the

elicitation from NOSENKO is elaborated in Attachment C.

Anatole's recommendations about confrontation tactics will

follow after the results of the elicitation phase have been

analyzed. During the period NOSENKO is being asked to com-

ment initially, work on additional elicitation topics will

continue.

5. Anatole continues to express his concern about the

problem of an Agency penetration and his absolute belief

that there is a continuing need to strictly compartment as

many aspects of our research as possible and to restrict

knowledge about our continuing efforts and particularly the

details to get to the bottom of the NOSENKO case. He

emphasizes the need to severely limit dissemination of the

results of the elicitation from NOSENKO although he under-

stands it will be necessary to provide the results to the

FBI. He is concerned

about the dissemination of his KY tapes

and the possible implications since he now believes he may

have erred in outlining too many areas of concern in the

context of considering NOSENKO's bona fides. Anatole was

told the KY tapes have not yet been made available to the

FBI but that, of course, he would be advised about any

proposal or decision to disseninate then.

6. In relation to the point about Anatole's concern

about knowledge of his infornation I told Anatole that it

would be necessary for him to comment in detail in the

future as he had recently on certain items. He was told

that, as he knew, we are at a stage in the NOSENKO case

where details such as the organizational assignments of

individuals and identifications and the number of leads

provided were tending to obscure the Crucial Questions

and divert our attention from the central problen oi why

NOSENKO would have been dispatched. I told Anatole quite

frankly there was a feeling he had not been fully cooperative

on the NOSENKO case. There was a belief that he should

furnish the details of his knowledge about individuals,

operations, the KGB, etc., so that others can try to judge

the accuracy or inaccuracy of NOSENKO's information.

Anatole was told that it would come as no surprise, to him to

learn that the fact he has not told everything he knows is

still a problem and that there may be some misunderstandings

since it is obvious his detailed knowledge has had and will

have a direct bearing on the NOSENKO case. Anatole firaly

but amicably reaffirmed his position concerning cooperation

on the NOSENKO case. He said (a) it was obvious that

research to daze and collateral information supports his

position that NOSENKO is a dispatched agent; (b) that he

will continue to cooperate fully as he has when there has

been an exchange of informacion; (c) that he would not give

details now because to do so would result in a situation

where it is "Anatole against NOSENKO" and it is obvious that

more evidence than this is required for an objective conclusion

about NOSENKO; (d) that details will follow after research is

analyzed or during the process of analysis as we examine

information and the details are pertinent; (e) that it is

unnecessary for him at

this time to give additional details

atcut personnel or the KGB organization except when these

details reflect on major items -- overall these details are

not crucial and there is nothing to gain by considering snall

items and details. If, however, snall details becone a major

point such as in connection with KOVSHUK', CHURANOV, GUK'

GRYAZNOV then duging the review he will pinpoint the specific

and detailed contradictions. He reiterated his previous con-

ments pointed to the waste of time and diversion involved in

pursuing details and leads to recruitnents or persons of

interest to the KGB when there is nothing crucial or significant

involved.

CRUCIAL GULSTIONS

A. ANATOLE was consulted 31 March and 1 and 2 April 1909

concerning his

rocomendations on hor to proceed to clicit

additional

information Iron NOSENKO. ANATOLE offered specific.

topics and questions about which NOSENSO is to be questioned

after setting forth itens or topics which M'ATOLE considers

the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS which need explanation or resolution.

These CRUCIAL QUESTIOYS arc set forth below with conment or

notations which emerged during our discussions.

B. ANATOLE understands that the inmediate period of

clicitation fron NOSENKO is part of the program to attempt to

resolva the bona fides of NOSENKO. le understands that his

participation and contribution is actually the implenentation

of the progran he originally believed was to be followed

bofore thero were any conclusions about NOSENKO's bona fides.

ANATOLE had been reviewing his filo matorial and the transcripts

of his conments in January 1959 (The KY transcripts) so he

was prepared to discuss aspects of the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS as

well as spocific ciicitation topics. As our contribution to

the discussion with ANATOLE we had prepared 26 papers relating

specifically to NOSENKO and I had notes concerning other points

or topics to be discussed. Each paper vas read by ANAtoLe, he

papers aud, as set forth below, he

conmented about certain of the papers or related natters.

After outlining the CRUCIAL QUESTICS we worked out an elici-

tation guido to be followed with NOSENSD as tho beginning of

the progran. The clicitation guido is detailed separately.

C. ANATOLE submits the following as his recommendation

about how to procoed wich NOSENKO:

1. Isolate the CRUCIAL QUESTIONS fOr Our guidance

and consideration. (He basically accomplished this 31 March

and 1 and 2 April although obviously these nay be revised)

2: Devise questions for elicitation. The questioning

of NOSENKO is to begin innediately and is to follow the pro-

ceduros set forth separately. (Tho initial phase of this was

• accomplished. Additional or revised clicitation topics or

questions will be considered when the results of the first

elicitation phase are revieved witi ANATOLE).

3. A polygraph exanination. (ANATOLE believes anothor

polygraph based on questions he will help frane will be ossential:

It is his opinion that it will be possible to nako the polygraph

neaningful if questions are based on a careful revier of the

results of the clicitation and specifically on the basis of

his inowleuge. ANATOLE believes it should be possible to uso

the polygraph effectively and to eliminate or explain nore

adequately tha qualifications concerning NOSENKO's veracity

such as "substantially truthful" by pinpointing questions

and areas where there remains downt. ANATOLE agreed there

night be a question of when a polygraph examination should

be adsinistered sinco it nighe be nore effectivo after tho

confrontation or hostile interrogation of NOSENKO.)

4. A hostilo/confrontation interrogation phase at

which time NOSENKO would be faced with the errors, incon-

•sistencies, falsehoods, otc. in his story and advised that

his nission failed. This phase of the approach to NOSENKO

would only be undertaken upon conclusion of tie clicitation

phase or if or when NOSENKO's attitude changes during the

elicitation phase. The confrontation would be undertaken

only when full research on cvery aspect of each CRUCIAL

QUESTION has been completed and specific questions are

framed with ANATOLE on the bagis of NOSENKO's information oI

answers and all collateral information. In this connection

ANATOLE expects continuing research on eack crucial question

so that each can be examined on the basis of a sunnary of all

inforsation about the question, the dotails of what NOSENKO

has said and related or collateral information such as

photographs or documents, etc. The hostile interrogation phase

ANATOLE anticipates will be undertaken only afier full consid-

eration of all possible problems. For examplo ANATOLE stresses

he will need to reviow the Bagley letter of November 1966 to "

MOSENKO since this will bo a key closent in considoring how to

proceed with the confrontation as sell as to attempt to determine

his nission failed. This phase of the approach to NOSENKO

would only bo undertaken upon conclusion of tie clicitation

elicitation phase. The confrontation would be undertaken

only khen full research on cvery aspect of each CRUCIAL

QUESTION has been completed and specific questions are

framed with ANATOLE on the basis of NOSENKO's information or

answers and all collateral infornation. In this connection

ANATOLE expects continuing rosearch on each crucial question

so that each can be exanined on the basis of a summary of all

inforsation about the question, the details of what NOSENKO

has said and related or collateral information such as

photographs or

documents, etc. The hostile interrogation phase

ANATOLE anticipates will be undertaken only after full consid-

eration of all rossible problems.

topics of any interviows:

I told LüTOLE it was ny opinion

that once clicitation éroa iOSLNiO began on the basis of his

reconnendations that other interviors would stop. le

recognized and agread that there nigit be a tactical and/or

psychological problon with NOSENKO by shifting tho interviow

techrique to clicitation rather than consultation and a

response to questionirg. AlATOLE could not eaphasizo too

stronglg- the need to let NOSENKO respond fully with nininal

prodding or stizulation and nithout scireshing his neaory:

ANATOLE was told it was ny understanding the elicitation

pation alchough i did tell ANATOLE

that tho clicitazion trars-

cript results would undoudtedly be siven to the FBI just as

ANATOLE says this team approach will be recessary to inplement

a fast moving interrogation, based on the script he will help

icvise, which will not permit sOSE:k0 tino to reflect or

think about his ansvers. The tactic will be to insisi on

ments: every response and reply is to be ural and transcribed

attachrents but deforred comment except to note that HOSENKO

that ANATOLi first notod it was a nistake to pernit YOSENKO

of the HOSENKO case most important and a topic which requires

his study particularly in view of the fact lo now has extracts

This is to be an elicitation topic later after ve

of the paper HOSENKO Timetable and Associates I told ANATOLE

the researcher had found it impossible to date to sort out

and isolate NOSENKO'S 1967-63 statenents about his career

during the period 1960 to 1962. ANATOLE was told this was

obviously a priority job but that it just had been an in-

of the opinion now questions can lo aslied but agreed to defer

clicitation on

this case prinarily because I pointed out

that in 1965 a paper was written setting forth apparont

inherent security seainesses in the dohnson case some of which

at least suggosted strongly that, in addition to Johnson's

lack of access at one tine, the kCe could have anticipated

a blow at any monent. I outlinod sone of the points I recall

about the weaknesses of tho principals and quite frankly I

told NATOLE that I doubted that anyone currently of the opinion

NOSENKO is bona fide would be any nore inclined to crodit the

1965 paper today than he has in the past. I agreed that it

mighü be usoful to again atteapt to got NOSENKO's story about

the JOHNSON case when this story would be exclusively NOSEYKO's.

In connuction with our discussion about KOVSHUK possibly working

with and associating with journalists MiATOLE said he recalled

an incident which he thinks took place in 1959 whon he net

KOVSHUK on the street not far from the KGB offices when KOVSUK

to scestablish relations which had been broken after BROCHES

left France. ANATOLE knows about this fron reading ZARUBIN

paper and he knows that the KGB wanted to talk to ZARUBIN

about this.

ANATOLE referred to the neod to analyze

In this connection MATOLE was told Stato

Security was securely organizing this investigation and that

Departnent inquiry based on a need to clarify certain possible

problens. ANATOLE said that he saw CHERGPANOV aftor CHEREPANOY

had transferred to the Anerican Embassy Section vearing a

Li. Col, military uniform. MiNTOLE said this was unusual and

it suggests to hin that CHEREPANOV was ongaged in an operation,

AVITOLE says a basic question for confrontation will

be abous the inclusion of a "speclal security officer" in a

delegation such as one hoaded by the foreign "inister. He says

the inclusion of a porson such as NOSpiRo is very unusual. The

Foreign Minister and his aldes, etc., are trusted nen who go

- abroad regularly. These are always experienced ko? officers

on the operations in support of the delegations and the planning

is kell in advance. These officers can handle anything. At a

This goes to the basic question of cooperation with the FRI and

his knowlerge which he concedes is a basic FPI decision about

-what he sees of the rocall telegram information. ANATOLE has

seen only NOSEUKO's information (transcripts, otc.). The

significance of this may bear on the question of rank discussed

AVATOLE nutlined the steps In be talen to abtain fron

Nasusso a statement which in its ultinate iritten forn may serve

lots as a control and a propaganda instrument. ANATOL! believes

that leading lOSErkO to a final alsolute vritten and documented

statenent against the Soviets will not caly permit us to judge

HOStko more accurately by observing his reactions but also

provide additional psychological pressure useful in the final

stages of dealing with NOSEstn when we confront hin with the

evidence ve linoy he was on a mission. A'ATOLE helieves the

final-denunciatory statement nay help tip the balance in gaining

YOSENKO's CoOperation/confession.

• The steps to be taken are as folios:

A. Elicit from

specific as possible condeming the Sovict regime, the KGB, the

party, individuals, etc. Tols sbould he at a fast tempo. (This,

can bogin inmediately.)

B. After reviewing these statenents elicit from

NOSEND Increasingly detailed condernatory statements by having

D. After NOSENKO has enumerated and elatorated his

denunciation and conderating of the soviets, orally and at

lonath he should be asked to write in his cir lords a statenent

which he will agree can be published. He should be asled at

this point, although it nay he necessary to ast hin carlier, if

There was little discussion of this excent to consider

need to revier more and consider this a topic for later questionins.

39. PREISEREUND

A''ATOLE considers this a topic worth more study and

review on the basis that something may have been overlooked

which relates to aisinfornation about the American Enbassy ot

American personnel, We should not consider this case, closed and

more research is needed.

CAMATOLE sees no relevancy to the questions re GOLITZYM.

If we have sone operationally significant angle he can approve

questions but he sees none - he finds this unnecessary and question

15 especially unnecessary.

pointed out the !. sic and only question with espect to dOSESXO

is misinfornation

and he sees no advantage or assistance

resulting fron question about GOLITZYM, Hoirever, he said this

was not his decision.

lie was told the paper about the GOLITZYN

question

was prepared by a researcher who works exclusively

at this tine on the 1967-1968 naterials and the researcher

responded to a general requirement to extract information and

frane questions to be asked of NOSENKO which could be tested

against known infornation. The researcher obviously believes

that if NOSENXO were to nake a false or mislcading statement

which GOLITZYN has of could deny or prove wrong NOSENKO would

be in a bind. ANATOLE was also told he must understand that

compartnentation in research and on NOSENKO as well as on

"larger, issues neans that we will revier a few papers which are

useless in the larger context eventhough to the researcher who

has a narrow view the concern is real.)

40. Gennadly Ivanovich GRYAZNOV-

ANATOLE's reaction to the questions and paper was that they

.will not accomplish nuch of significance re GRYAZNOV since he

thinks there is a GRYAZNOV relationship to the code clork cases

which can only be ictermined after that research and analysis

of infornation about GRYAZNOV. He agreed the questions could

be used later

• during elicitation

as tine fillers and prelininary

to hard questions but not nuch will come because the questions

are not to the point, which he did not explain fully.

ANTOLE did specifically challenge ncetao's story of his

cinse relationship with GaYAZUNV as a lIe. ANITOLE notes the

possibility there ias leinge of his identification to the FPI

and ClA OF GRYAZAny as a source. Particularly A'ATOLE says

POSed's story of a close relationship with GRYAZY in 1962

is probably false because there was mo

previous reintionship

leading to this. ANATOLE said definitely that GIACSOV would

have been punished if the k6ß knew he vas identified as a source

to GOLITZY:?.

ANATOLE says there is a contradiction with HOSENKo trying

to build up his relationship with GRYALS and don-play or,

more accurately minimize, the extent of his relations with

CHURNOV and GUK. ANATOLE believes it was a deliberate part

Of NOSENKO's legend to set him close to CRYAZNOY since GRYAZNOY

was an ackrowledged source of some of rolltzy's infornation.

The NOSENKO-GRYAZNOV relationship will be a key element in

future questioning:

A. "Cosment on NOSEYKO Family Felations" was a paper in

• which A'ATOLE found little of importance or significance as a

crucial point except that as the discussions progressed he de-

veloped the idea that the 1945-50 period may be crucial after

all. SATOLE sees little nuestion about most of his life and

secifically ANATOLE says the horoserial question is not "ir.

line vita avallable cridence". ANATOLE thought these questions

would rive MosENn the impression to are "unprofessional" but

innediately conceded this is renlly not a problen since NOSENXO

has not been handled very professionally in the past.

B. "NOSENKO - Homosexual Aspects"

MATOLE questions any assunption that OSENKO had any

"expertise" on homo

operations. He just does not think NOSENKO

was an "expert" or a

"specialist" and points out he can run

then at level he has described with very little knowledge.

ANATOLE Says he knows NOSENKO was not a homosexual before and

doubts ho would have been consulted ly anyone as a "specialist".

In view basic doubts if any question:

in be used should be

woven into other topics and not treniel as separate subject.

• 41. RUNYANTSEV

After reading the paper ANATOLE said there is nothing

to ask NOSENKO at this time. ANATOLE naintains this will be a

special question later. ANATOLE directly relates the RUMYANTSEV

case to what he considers was the serious mistake of asking

..NOSENKO about the May 1959 conforence. (See N-223) Ile also

thinks further questions on the conference should only come

later. ANATOLE saw cicarly why no questions should have been

asked about RUNYANTSEV and May 59 Conference but after nistake

made it may be we will want to adjust and consider what we might

gain by sone questions during elicitation or if touching on this

point will upset the phasing of questions to NOSE:KO. This

natter will be discussed further after idiATOLE reads the papers

carefully. AYATOLE was told it will be clear to him that the

May 59 neeting was known through GOLIENE/SKI and there was

some indication from this source also of wide scale nisinfor-

nation prograns. It was also noted that in my opinion the

questions for NOSENKO, even with hindsight and my knowledge of -

how seriously GOLITZYN's infornation about this conference has

been viewed, were normal intelligence officer questions which

NOSENKO could expect based on the overt infornation nade available.

Certainly the questions were not unusual except for the fact

"that they indeed were different fron other questions asked of

NOSENKO because they zouched on political matters. To the extent

that 11-228 showed NOSENKO soneone at a lato dato was interested

in political natters NOSENKO nay have been alerted. Certainly it

would seen those questions were completely out of context :

out of the blue so to speak - and since there was no follow-up

NOSENKO way feel there is to real interest because there has

"been no real interest in natters political with him.

A. "HOSENKO - US Of Alias by KGB Officers"

ANATOLE connented these were very good questions. They

could be asked during elicitation or later during the crucial

or hard questioning phase when we were assured of fast follow-up

questioning.

B. "NOSENKO - Knowledge because of Association with other

KBS Officers".

AVATOLE thought this was excellent approach. le

commentod in connection with paras o and 1l and using this paper

stressed need to elicit all possiblo fron iOSENKO orally during

intervier and no written nenorandun. MiATOLE outlined need for

NOSENKO to list exact dates of all his service assignments;

when he first met each officer; detailed biography of each

officer, etc. He retained without connent the 28 March 1969

addendus to RAOVSKIY, ¡UTYREV, and SUROV.

42. Nikolay S. SKVORTSOV and Vladinir Vasilyevich KRIVOSHEY

MINTOLE, as with these officers, separately lists KGB

officors of special significance as part of the enumeration of

CRUCIAL QUESTIONS because they are not only proninent in

*OSENKO's story but also of major concern to us since they work

against Anericans. They aro important even without NOSENKO.

In most instances also there will be the initial new elicitation

about then from NOSENKO. Then NOSENKO's previous information

will be collated and compared with collateral infornation,

including previous information from GOLITZYN, after which ANAtoLE

will review, conment with now information, if any, and frame

pertinent questions for NOSENKO. Specifically ANATOLE says

that NOSENKO's statement he consulted SKVORTSOV about tourist

operations 1955-59 is nonsense. SAVORISOV was in Gernany until

1959. NOSENKO should be asked what kind of tourist operations,

etc.

45. NOSENKO-ASen GEORGIEV Case

ANATOLE believes these questions useful now in

elicitation phase. He wants to review everything NOSENKO has

said about Anatoliy S. KOZLOV and view any photos. I could

nọt confirm that KOZLOV had participated in the can case.

ANATOLE asks if we can confirn KOZLOY was Chief of the American

Section when NOSENKU left the Section in 1955 and what NOSENKO

said about early relations including precise dates when NOSENKO

says KOZLOV was his boss. In this connection it is noted that

NOSENKO says KOZLOV was Chief of Dept I (Page l of paper) then

Doputy Chief of Dept 7 (page 4). ANATOLE says as clicitation

question NOSENKO should be asked why the denotion and also shat

happened to GORBATENKO.

Not unexpectedly, MATOLE said he would eventually

want to see tha file on the GEORGIEV case to

see what the

tie-in

ANATOLE says this topic is definitoy a confrontation

but he also makes the point he considers the

important separately from considerations of NOSENKO, le recalled

MT. O'NEAL was to review the file with him and arrange interview

as NOSENKO

is concorned which nay go to penetration in the M'i ENB, Moscow

or even to Germany. The tining is important.

B. In connection with NOSENKO's stories about his status

and cover in Geneva in 1962 and 1964, ANATOLE would like to

review all verified info against NOSENKO's statenents. For

example was his diplomatic passport verified, etc.

C. MATOLE would like to review the lists of other nenbers

of the delegations of which he was a member as well as the

lists of other dolegations there at the sane time.

(531 NOTE: Check N-127, page 7 - he could take orders of

D. Atter considerable reflection ANATOLE thinks it is quito

importanco. Ho had to accede to his interviewers to avoid moro

questions about why and how he becane a lt. Col. ANATOLE

thinks ho may have been revarded (pronoted) quictly with only

a very few persons knowledgable. (S!! NOTE: Check all roports.)

NATOLE suggests this question for polygraph: "Did the

travel document you brought reflect your true rank on the basis

of your success and achievements of your game with AIS which

began in June 1962 in Geneva?

In this connection also ANATOLE points to two promotions

in one ycar (1962) (See N-181 pg 27): Chief of Section then

•Deputy Chiof of Department. How has NOSENKO explained this

when he was not in his first job even three months and he had

no major successes in Geneva (except contact with CIA?) - What

; were the cases he handled and the recruitnents he made in 1962?

53. Aserican Ambassadors

ANATOLE believes at a later date NOSENKO should be

asked or confronted about operations against American Ambassadors.

However, as an olicitation question ANATOLE thinks ho

should be asked if he knew of any Anerican Ambassador who was

recruited at any time by SCD?

Later, under the hostile interrogation he would be

asted if he knew about an important high level SCD American

agent who was recontacted and reactivated when he visited floscow

in 1959. Other questions to follow fron the tean of interrogators

such as who did or would have handled this agent, etc.

54. Yurly GUK's Agent in Wasnington

ANATOLE thinks this case needs attention again even

though it may not bear on the HOSENKO case. He says it needs

analysis and future research on tho basis of what action the

FBI took. If there is sonething pertinent to NOSENKO wo can

considor for later use.

55. Yuriy Vasilyevich KROTKOV

ANATOLE says we should extract and review what

NOSENKO has said about KROTKOV and line out the parallels

in the info. ANATOLE notes KROTKOV - Oct 1963; Cherepanov -

Nor 1963 and NOSENKO - Jan 1964, and he thinks we need to frame

questions to includo KROTKOV in our considarations. He recalls

KROTXOV promised an expose of the KGB and this never canee

about.

Our great reed now is for hard,

For this,

lie therefore hope,

Therefore,

since there are many loose ends and unclear bits fron his

addition, GOLITSYN was given the CHEREPANOV papers with

supporting documentation, as hell as the KROTKOV case and

BELITSilY, the UNACUTE and POPOV cases.

In general, this was nearly everything available to us in

of why GOLITSYN might lie about this

POSENKO served fron 1957 or 1953 in the

Connents:

As noted above, this contradicts

NOSENKO's story of having nade this transfer

three years thus coating legend is trying

to cover up.

This suggests to GOLITSYN that

there was

some success

in the Enbassy during

his period

which is supported by other ob-

¡crvations (see below).

12 There is reason to doubt the validity

of GOLITSYN's statement, since NOSENKO is in-

dependently known to have been involved in at

least one, and perhaps two, strictly tourist-

type operations involving U. S. citizens in the

period 1956-195s.

One was Richard BURGI, whom

NOSENiO recruited in June 1956 in the company of

Inatoliy KOZLOV, Chici of 11/7, who has confirmed

NOSEiKO's story and identified his picture.

the fact that he lad beco.c Deputy

would presumably have come out of

GOLITSY"'s talks with koUSiluk, anyway.

- GOLITSYS had earlier said that PETROV

was chief of I1/1/1, GRYAZIOV the

materials.

KOVSHU! was, of course, named

by GOLITSYY many times as an active case

officer in II/1/1.

Contrary to NOSENKO's statenent that GORBATENKO

remained as chief of Il/1 until 1959, GOLITSYN knew that

GORBATENKO was sent as senior KGB advisor to Hungary

shortly after the llungarian Revolution, probably about

January 1957.

Cornents:

(1) Since this is a high-powered job and

represented a promotion, GOLITSYN thinks it may

well have been given to

GORBATEiNO as a result of

success in operations against the American Embassy,

specifically a recruitaent.

GOLITSYN thinks NOSES*
