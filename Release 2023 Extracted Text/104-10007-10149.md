1. I discussed this informally with Mr. Arthur Dooley, CI Staff,

who is knowledgeable on the OSWALD Case. Mr. Tooley mentioned that a

graphological assessment had not been done to his knowledge to determine

if personality restructuring had been attempted on OSWALD in the USSR.

Mr. Dooley questioned whether such an assessment would really make a

worthwhile or reliable contribution to the issue of OSWALD's motivation,

and warrant the time and expense involved; that if such an assessment

was attempted in any fornal sort of fashion, the "official" results:

may only ada confusion to the motivation issue, since such results

would not have truly scientific validity. He noted that the samples,

to his recollection, represented varlous envirormental conditions ranging

from normal passport applications, to condensed diary notations and notes;

that a child's handwriting changes fram grade school to college as the

speed of nototaking increases and the pressure mounts. In this case you

are dealing with a disturbed mentality as well.

Based on his familarity with the case Mr. Dooley feels that

OSWALD's motivation is largely explained in terns of his neurotic background

his failure to achieve status, and his very deep resentment to all suthori

After his stay in the Soviet Union, OSWALD's writings indicate that ho fett

neither society had mich to offer; and in effoct, he rojected both.

Mr. Dooley noted that undoubtedly other factors cane into play te

formulate OSWALD's idea to assassinate the President. For example, OSHALD

saw a movie on TV about an attempted presidential assassination with a riflo

shortly before his deed, which could have sparked him into action.

Warten Connission has indicated, the real motive may never be known.

Mr. Dooley said that the files are available for inspection by an

SB officer at any time to look for handriting samples or any other purpose,

Tit rod view of the above, he did not feel that anything could be proved for

therefore questioned the merit of the suggestion at this tine.
