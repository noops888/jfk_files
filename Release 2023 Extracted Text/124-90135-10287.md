to the Cuban exiles in Madrid from the Spanish Government, and

MANZARBEITIA pointed out that the subject is a close friend of

and who is a close associate of ex-President JUAN PERON OI

Argentina, who also lives here..

MANZARBEITIA said he is personally

On 4-4-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA advised that one of

his sources had reported to him that subject had been seen

at the Bodegon Restaurant in Madrid on 4-3-61 in the company

of JORGE ANTONIO.

From this it would appear that subject's

presance in dadria is definitely knowa to the cuban exiles (a)

On 4-10-51 Mr. WILLIAMSON advised that for the moment

subject is being given protection by two members of the Directorate

General of Security (DGS) in Madrid.

He said that he had re-

ceived information on that date that the DGS was planning to

use a pretext in an effort to debrief the subject. (

On 4-11-61 JESUS MANZARBEITIA and JOSE M. CABEZON,

who heads the delegation in Spain of the FRD, called at the

Madrid Office and supplied the following information.

Approximately. a month ago CABEZON, through a Spanish

newspaperman to whom he had given an interview concerning

agent

for a Spanish Government organization, not otherwise sp

identified.

(As has been previously reported to the Bureau

under the caption AUGUSTIN PARRADAS SICILIA, aka; IS - CUBA

8 SPAIN, PARRADAS apparently is employed in something of an

informant capacity with the Information Section of the Spanish

High General Staff.) CABEZON said that PARRADAS indicated an

interest in introducing

CABEZON to his superiors, but that

this was never done.

MANZARBEITIA advised that he had been approached by

an Inspector PRADAS of the Directorate General of Security in

Madrid, with which individual they maintain contact as repre-

sentatives of the FRD here, to arrange an interview with the

subject for the purpose of obtaining any information which the

subject might be willing to volunteer. MANZARBEITIA pointed

out that Inspector PRADAS is in charge of the investigation

of Cuban matters in Madrid and is most helpful to them;

accordingly he agreed to tall to PARDo LIARA and through JORGE Ul

MANZARBEITIA said that they expected to be furnished a copy

of the questions and answers on 4-12-61, and that they would

furnish a copy of the same to the Madrid Office thereafter.

*(u)

On 4-11-61 MANZARBEITIA and CABEZON made available

a copy of the first report of PARRADAS, which he had supplied

to them.

The contents of this report have been incorporated

into a letterhead memorandum, 12 copies of which are turnishec

for the Bureau together with 12 copies of an evaluatioi

memorandun.

The confidential source abroad mentioned in the

letterhead memorandum is MANZARBEITIA, and the memorandum has

been classified confidential since both MANZARBEITIA and

CABEZON are furnishing intornation of Bureau interest on a

continuing basis to the Madrid Oftice. C

of 4-11-61. This

is a resort area.

{u)

From the above it appears rather obvious that the

interview of subject on 4-10-61 by MANZARBEITIA and GABINO

DELGADO had been the pretext interview mentioned above by

Mr. WILLIAMSONIon 4-10-61.

Inasmuch as this is primarily a matter coming within

CIA jurisdiction and inasmuch as Mr. WILLIAMSON had been keeping

the Madrid Office currently advised of all his activities in

an effort to debrief the subject, on 4-11-61 he was furnished

orally with full information concerning all the interviews of

the subject that were going on and the apparent conflict of

interest between the Directorate General of Security on the

one hand and the High General Staff, represented by PARRADAS,

on the other hand. At the same time he was furnished with a

copy of the report prepared by PARRADAS which contained the re-

suits of his interview of the subject on 4-7-61.

Mr. (WILLIAMSON

He said that this report

esentially contained all the information which had been furnished

Inspector PRADAS that he could supply no additional information.

translation of the REGUENGO report is set

forth below:

(U)

JOSE PARDO LLADA is currently residing in

the Hotel Emperatriz in lladrid.

He claims to be an

enemy of Communism but at the same time he backs almost

all the measures adopted by the CASTRO government.

He

tries to justify the system and made various allusions

to the lack of capacity of persons in responsible

positions in Cuba and placed the blame on them for

the present chaotic situation in Cuba.

He does not

describe IDEL CASTRO nor the members of his government

as Communists although he recognizes that all of them

are dominnied and under the control of members of the

Communist Party. He claimed that REGINO BOTI, Minister

of Economy, RAUL CEPERO BONILLA, Director of the National

Bank and

ex-Minister of Commerce, and LUIS BUCH, Minister

of the Presidency, are all anti-Communists.

him the truth inasmuch as both PERON and JORGE ANTONIO

were completely ignorant about everything concerning

his journey.

This latter would appear doubtful inasmuch

aS JORGE ANTONIO went to the airport to meet the subject,

and it is obvious that this latter and his people tried

to cover up the arrival in Madrid of the subject. It was

evident that the subject has a good, old

From information obtained from Subject, it

would appear that with regard to the aid which the govern-

ment of CASTRO gives to Spanish Communists, perhaps the

most important is that of furnishing Cuban passports to

those who lack documentation.

The subject considers that

an invasion of Cube will be a failure, insisting that

six or seven thousand men can do nothing because there

are so many people who are still with CASTRO.

Subject

thinks it would be necessary to wait more time, to let

the matter mature, aot that an internal uprising would be

more successful.
