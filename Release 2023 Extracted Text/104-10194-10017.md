COMMENTS OF REVIEWINO' OFFICIAL

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur genorally in the

supervisor's ratings of Mr. Vitále's performance as listed; but I

must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a

moro junior clerical type and that dir. Vitale should not be considered

as performing GS-8 level Intolligence Assistant work at a Proficient

rating. • Indeca, he 15,

not qualified for such

and his official position title should be changed to prevont in to.e

misunderstanding as to the somewhat uniquo nature of his value to

the Agency.

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

For approximatoly

four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale

worked with me in providing Headquarters'

support to JMwIVE

in its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN.

In such

a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanies,

requirements and PBRUMEN personnel of these

operations was

invaluable in (1) the preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee; (2)

the provision of timely operational

Information, perlodically requested by the front offices

of

both NH/ COG

and WHiD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations.

While

under my supervision, Mr. Vitale wis a conscientious, loyal

cooperative employce

who

readily and willingly performed ali

tasks assigned to

him in an exceptional manner.

He always

expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary

to finish the task at hand.

He has a very pleasant person-

ality, getg along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

a good

sense of

cost consciousness in the use of government

equipment

and materials.. The rating letter "s" most accurately

reflects

the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during

the

• period he was under my supervision.

As noted in the last Fitness Report, I concur generally in the

ratings

of Mr. Vitale's performance as listed; but I

must again note that these are duties which could be performed by a

as performing GS-& level Intelligence Assistant work at a Proficient

rating.

Indeed,

he

in my opinion; not qualified for such a roje

COMMENTS OF REVIEMINO OFFICIAL

I have had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely

nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings

of the duties as

listed, it should be noted that these same duties could

be performed equally well by a nore junior Intel Clerk or Intel Assistant

and, therefore,

the overall rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not

accurately reflect his capability.

In my opinion it would be very diffi-

for subject to perform competitively with other

Intel Assistants

il not impostia s-s level, and I recommend his position title be

changed to Ops Support Assistant, a role in which he performs capably.

Comments of Reviewing Official:

This employee had no qualifications for assignment in the German desk or

German operational field. He was carried in the German Branch in a

casual status while an assignment suitable to his talents was being located.

The fitness report for the period of his duty with the German Branch is

accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried

out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
