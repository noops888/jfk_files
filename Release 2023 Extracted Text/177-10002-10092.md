JFK Act 5 (ul 12) (D;

THE PERSONALITY AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND OF

PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON, AS WELL AS THE CIRCUM-

STANCES WHICH BROUGHT HIM TO POWER, SEEM TO INDICATE

THAT AMERICAN FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC POLICIES, UNDER

THE NEW ADMINISTRATION, WILL PROBABLY ADHERE TO THE

FOLLOWING BASIC DIRECTIVES:

I. IN THE SHORT RUN, AS A NATURAL RESULT OF

THE MOMÃˆNTUM OF A STRONG ADMINISTRATION, SUCH AS

THAT OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY, NO PROFOUND CHANGES ARE

EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN POLICY

(PRESIDENT JOHNSON HAS ALREADY STATED THAT HE WILL

FOLLOW THE FOREIGN POLICY OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY) :

2. IN THE LONGER RUN, HOWEVER, ONE CAN FORE

SEE:

A) IN THE FIELD OF FOREIGN POLICY, WITH

THE PREDOMINANCE OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT OVER THE

WHITE HOUSE "STAFF" (WHICH REFLECTED THE STRONG

INTEREST IN INTERNATIONAL POLICY), THERE PROBABLY

WILL BE:

I) NO SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE FROM THE

KENNEDY LINE IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION;

THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL TEND TOWARD A WAIT-AND-

SEE ATTITUDE;

II) IN THE FIELD OF RELATIONS WITH

WESTERN EUROPE, OR MORE PRECISELY WITH FRANCE, A

LESS RIGID ATTITUDE AND ONE OF GREATER ACCEPTANCE

OF THE FRENCH POSITION, WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF MAIN-

TAINING A UNITED WESTERN FRONT VIS-A-VIS THE POSSI-

BILITY OF A POLITICAL OFFENSIVE BY THE KREMLIN:

III) IN RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA,

THE INTERVIEW WHICH PRESIDENT JOHNSON WILL HAVE

THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTER WILL CER-

TAINLY BE MORE ENLIGHTENING THAN ANY PREDICTION

MADE AT THIS TIME;

B) IN THE FIELD OF DOMESTIC POLICY, THERE

WILL POSSIBLY BE AN IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN

THE EXECUTIVE AND THE LEGISLATIVE WITHIN THE LINE

OF "COMPROMISE"; THE NEW PRESIDENT, MUCH MORE THE

CONSERVATIVE THAN THE INNOVATOR, WITH INTIMATE

CONNECTIONS WITH THE CONGRESS, AND A SOUTHERNER,

WILL HAVE MORE FACILITY IN GAINING APPROVAL OF THE

BIG BILLS ("'CIVIL RIGHTS," "FISCAL REFORM," "MEDICAL

AID," "AID TO THE AGED," ETC.) PRECISELY BECAUSE H

WILL ACCEPT MORE CONSERVATIVE FORMULAS OF COMPROMISE;

THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL ALSO TEND TO BE MORE

CONSERVATIVE WITH REGARD TO GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION

IN THE ECONOMY; HOWEVER, RADICAL CHANGES CANNOT BE

EXPECTED, SINCE JOHNSON WILL ALSO FACE THE PRESSURE

OF THE MORE LIBERAL WING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY,

AND ANY MORE PRONOUNCED SPLIT WITHIN THE PARTY WOULD

BE FATAL TO THE HOPES FOR VICTORY IN NEXT YEAR'S

ELECTION.
