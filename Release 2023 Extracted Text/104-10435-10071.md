• OCTOBER 1950

Early in October 1950, DIMITROV visited the Lavrion Camp where he met

with a number of his Bulgarian friends and advised them that he had been

given a "charter and instructions", by certain members of

to form a committee of five members for the planning and execu-

tion of a fight for the liberation of Bulgaria. This committee, according

to. DIMITROV, would be established in Athens and would cooperate with other

similar committees which have already been formed in France, Germany, and

other countries. The committee would later expand to 20 members and would

establish a so-called "Democratic Agrarian Bloc". Recruits would come from

among the members and sympathizers of the Bulgarian Democratic Party

(Moushynov) and from the Gichev Agrarians. Eligible Bulgarian emigres

would come to Greece from Western Europe to assist in the work, and pro-

minent members of the Gichev Agrarians and of the Democratic Party would

be assisted in escaping to Greece (presumably from Bulgaria) to join the

organization.

DIMITROV listed the organization's tasks as follows:

a. Intelligence activity in Bulgaria.

b. Organization of an underground resistance

c.

movement in Bulgaria, and

Organization of sabotage activity against

Bulgaria.

DIMITROV revealed that he was the president of the organization.

DIMIRTOV took frequent occasion to mention that the

committee had its headquarters in

DIMITROV again visited the Lavrion Camp to inform his recruitsthat they

would shortly be moved to a pleasant hime in Athens which the Americans

were repainting for the purpose. On the occasion of this visit, the re-

cruits were divided into three groups, as follows:

a. a groupd of 10 men to specialize in intelligence;

a group of 6 men to be trained in radio in Germany

c. a group of. 15 men to specialize in sabotage.

The source of hhe information contained in the SODB 31992 described

DIMITROV as"an unprincipaled opportunist and Greek agent".

## Page 13

During this period of time, DIMITROV was the principal agent

in an ill-fated operation which resulted in a major expose and

trial in Sofia during 1951.

The agents used were those selec-

ted by DIMITROV, at least one of whom was pots probably an

operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

"INCIDENT IN VULCHEDRAM"

Excerpt from Agrarians and Communign, by Dimiter Adamar Dimitrov

So one day Iankor ...(was)..' told to go to the "Committee."

the invitation was made personally by Tinko so that it would

not have the meaning and character of an order. (He was the

father of a Communist who probably had an important post in the

capital.)

"We have missed you, lankor, we see nothing of you."

"Oh, well, business you kaow."

"Why don't you com to the office of the People's Conmittee.

so that we can sit and have a talk?"

"To the office?. What would I be doing there?"

"Oh, having a talk."

"What do we have to talk about?"

Twell."

as men and as fellow villagers we have men to

talk about.

Fellow villagers? Tankov felt his blood boiling and

rising to his head.. That expression "fellow villagerg" struck

is sarg as an irony,

as an insult. He felt he was being de

filed by the mouth of that sordid murderer; because it wa

against these fellow villagers that his mania and extremism

had been directed and his fellow villagers had been killed on

his instructions; killed by the rabid mob of the Party during

its first onslaught. And among these fellow villagers whon

this jackal had killed there were his friends: the kind priest,

the teacher and the doctor, all those who were the heart and

mind of the village.

"Like fellow villagers?"

"Anyway,

like friends.

I want to discuss something

with you. It's necessary that I should have a talk with you."

"How I understand.

That's right, be blunt about It. At

what time do you order me to be in your office?"

"But don't take it that way, Tankov. I am not ordering

you, I'= laviting you."

"Okay, when do you want me to come?"

"Come this afternoon, unleas you'd prefer tonorrow."

"Either today or tomorron makes no difference to ne.

I'm coming this afterneon."

Before going there, Jamkor passed by the druggist's,

the only survivor of the circle of intellectuals, and told him

about the invitation Tinko had made to him. He was the only

man with whon he spoke with confidence and with whom he ex-

changed ideas. the druggist rose, shocked, from his desk,

allised his spectacles with sands which were trendlig, then

put his hands on Tankoy's shoulders as if they were expressing

his lote and anciety.

"The devil take hin!" he spat-with disgust.

And there passed before his eyes the tragic scene of the assas

sination of the doctor a few days ago.

After these words had been exchanged and he was sitting

comfortably on his chair,

the Russian opened his legs wide,

assumed a serious air, and started the discussion. He spoke

Bulgarian with great ease, like a Bulgarian.

"The comrades," he said, pointing to tinko and janet,

"spoke to me with flattering

Yankov felt that he was choking with anger, but he con

"I understand," he said, between clenehed teeth.

"It's good to hear that," added the Russian.

"It shows

that you understand things in the right way, from the proper

*People like you are valuable for us. You are exactly

what is required in each village to serve

as an example to

be followed by others, to overcome the stupid hostility of

the villagers toward our social system and thus to facilitate

its completion.

Such persons offer an lumense service to

our causé.:. That is way we give them our respect and our

confidence, and we reward them richly, both morally and mate-

rially: We know how to honor honest men."

"jes, indeed.

I can see that," said Yankor and threw a

glance at the other two "honest men," Taney and Tinko.

Tankoy's highly expressive bint did not escape the at-

tention of the Russian,

but he pretended not to understand.

The two "honest men" went red to the roots of their ears and

their eyes sparked with anger.

"After all this," the Russian went on, "the only thing

that remains is for me to tell you about my proposal..

You

should enter the kolkhos.

There you will be able to develop

all your activity, you will benefit the social whole and you

will create the fundamental pre-requisites for the proper

development and progress of your son."

lankoy rose.

From the first words the Russian organiser

had uttered he understood what he was about to come to.

And,

of course, he did not intend to accept the proposal for

participation in the kolkhos but had intanded - following the

advice of his friend, the druggist - to express his refusal

But when the Russian had

him, and especially when he clearly intimated that he wanted

him to use as the bait for his fellow villagers, his honest

and pure soul revolted.

Yancho Yankoy, who was descending the stairs without being

aware of this.

But the kassian organiser stopped him.

"No nonsense. This isn't the time for it. We shall

And he did think about it.

A few days later Tankor was

Acting Chief, SE

DATE: 21 JuLy 1953

FROM

SE/ 2

SUBJECT: Lyle O. KELLY

I. In accordance with your instructions received through Mr. Donald F.

Ewing, CSE/2, and in coordination with Mr. Mahoney of WH Division, I flew to

DIROBALO, arriving there at noon on 26 May 1953, for the purpose of determining

whether subject bas current operational information concerning SE operations

and personnel that would make him a security risk if he were allowed to ra

settle within the next calendar year.

20. Upon arrival at DIROBALO I discussed the case with KELLI's case

officer, Mr. Philip A. Toney, and the Station Security Officer and learned

that KillY had been in detention until approsimately 15 May when he was released

from confinement and allowed to attend classes and live with other persons who

are being prepared for resettlement.

30

Between 1300 and 1600 hours on 26 May, I reviewed the DIBOBALO Station

files on kater and made an appointment with KilIt's case officer to have a con

ference with KiLLY at 0800 hourg 27 May. It was decided to use the affice of

the Station Security Officer for the meeting because of its inunerability to

other agents and to the laborers who were working in the ares.

The Security

Officer statod that the offico nonld be made available for the time specifiedo

40 At 0800 hours 27 May KuLLI's case officer escorted me to the pre

arranged meeting site and introduced me as Mike Vargas to KELLY who had been

waiting in the office. The case officer informed XELIY that I had arrived fros

Washington, D. C. to discuss his problems with him and would andeavor to resolve

all matters possiblo. KILLY appeared elated and in broken English said that he

was very happy to learn that the organization (I presume he meant CIA) finally

acknowledges him as a friend.. Killy stated that he has been waiting 25 months

to spoak to someone fron Washingtol. The case officer departed fron the roon and

left KaLLY and me standing in the center of the roall.. I asked KaLI to be

seated and told him that I speak Serbo Groatian and inquired if he understood

Serba Croatian. KELLY repliod that ho does speak Serbian and 1s glad that I

speak the languago also because his English was not fluent and he has difficulty

expressing himsell. All conversations hereafter were conducted in Serbo Groatian.

5. I opened the conversation by telling KelLy that his reports and letters

were received and studied very carefully at Washington and assured him that

pressing daties made it impossible for anyone to visit him at any time prior to

the present. KELLY replied that he felt relieved that he was not forgotten by

his friends and that he could now reveal everything that has been a puzzle to

him since his apprehension by the Greeks in 1951, and perhaps learn the causes

for certain actions that were directed against hin.

KELLy stated that he was

imprisoned a few times and that he suffered terribly during those periods

because of his inability to withstand imprisoment.

In order that I might have a clear picture of his background and

initial contacts with the Americans in Sofia and later in Athens, as well as

his associations with other intelligence services in Bulgaria and Greece, KELLY

stated that he preferred to start from the begirning of his clandestine work in

Bulgaria and chronologically bring me up to date on his activities and ensuing

events. Since much of KIlLY's discussion is repeated in a report he had pre

riously prepared and which is in his files and since a great deal of the dis

cussion had no direct bearing on the purpose of the mission, I will for the sake

of brevity and clarity avoid those portions of his story.

are a loon men the that at aled atron a da re realized

the position the people of Bulgaria were placed in and that under Communism

the people were not going to be any better off than they were under the Fascists

or Nazis.

The only salvation for the Bulgarian people was for the Democratic

powers to achieve control and thereby extend their form of goverment to the

! Bulgarian people. He therefore proceeded to exploit Bulgaria with a vien to

organizing adherents into clandestine groups in order to oerthrow the Communist

goverrment that was in control.

KELLY stated that he had organized over 250

cells consisting of soue 10, 000 persons throughout Bulgaria and Macedonda.

According to KELLY, In 1945 he met the American General Crane in Sofia

and the General requested KILLY to prepare a program of his organization out.

lining its mission, functions, etco. Upon complying with this request KELLY

stated that General Crane inforned him that his progran was very favorable and

that he (General Crane) desired KELLY to work for him. Kill said he agreed

and proceeded personally to exploit the cella of his organization in bulgaria.

the Agrarian factions. KMII contimed by stating that he remained in prison

for approsimately six months near Vratsa where he was tortued by the polico in

an effort to extract from him information on his organization and people with

whom he was associated, particularly Americans. KilLI said he did not reveal

the information which the police desired.

10. Tarly in 1947 through members of his organization he was able to make

his escape from the prison.

that he was not avars of anything that had existed between KFL.LY and General

him.

1b. KiLLI realizing that he was wanted in Bulgaria by the police for his

escape fron prison proceeded to work his way out of Bulgaria.

He was assisted

by one Fancha Fernandova near Plovdit. On crossing the Bulgarian border into

Greece Killy stated that he surrendered to a Greek patrol who immediately

channeled him through its interrogation center.

During this procass KHIrY said

he was approached by British Intelligence, a Mr. Andros (possibly Andrews) and

Mr. Scott, and was told that the British had heard of his organization and

wanted him. to work for them. KilLI refused the offer and told the British that

he preferred to work with the Americans. KELLY also said that the Greek IS

had asked him to work for them, and that he refused them also. He was then

placed in a refugee camp In Athens with other Bulgarian refugees.

12. In 1949 during KElLY's stay in the refugee camp he said that he learned

the art of making trinkets as a trade and was allowed to leave the refugee camp

and seek employment in a shop where he could contime his trade. He found a

shop that offered him a job and he accepted.. He stated that he had no intentions

of making a livlihood in that occupation but it did give him an opportunity to

get out of the refugee camp and contime to seek means to combat the Camunists

in Bulgaria.

While on this job Killy mat a Greek woman by the nama of flora

Vavanou who said she had an aunt who lives in Chicago, Illinois. Since they both

wished to go to the United states, they decided to get married and, with an

affidavit of support fron Flora's Aunt, get visas to the U. S.. Their nest

move was to get to Italy through IRO channels.

13. KiLLy claims that he did not loow the Aunt's address of name other

than that she was referred to as Teresa.

KELLY said that he and Flora planned

to separato on reaching the United States. According to KElLI, he checked with

the IRO in Athens and learned that because he was a ulgarian immigrant he was

eligiblo for emigration through IRO and since Flora had probable means of getting

him to the United States he decided to go through with the plan. He married

Flora in February 1949 and by the latter part of March they were en route to

Italyo

I. While In Italy KiLLI stated that Flora communicated with her Aunt in

Chicago who was preparing to process the necessary affidavit for their entry

Into the United States. However, during this period KELLI learned that Flora

was pregnant and according to Italian Imigration officials she could not be

considered for emigration fran Italy until after the birth of her child. On

learning this, KilLI said his whole plan had collapsed and that he could not go

through with it. He decided to return to Athens and leave his wife with her

parents.

They returned to Athens in October 1949. A daughter was born in

15. Now that he had returned to Athens KELLY's intentions were to earn

sufficient funds ($2000) to build a hone for his daughter. He was not con.

cerned with flora as he had married her for the purpose of getting to the

United States. The marriage was to be a temporary affair as they were not in

love with each other and had no intentions of remaining married. Our information

shows that KiLLY worked for the Propaganda Section of the Greek General Staff

headed by It.- Colonel M. A. Alexandralds on his return to Athens. In order to

earn money KELLI decided to write several books on anti-Communism. Since he

was not fluent in Greek be sought the assistance of a Greek scholar who could

translate his writings from Bulgarian into Creek.

KILLY said he wrote two

texts and turned them over to a Greek educator to translate.

16. In August 1950 KELLI decided to take his texts to the American Embassy

in Athens and inquire as to the possibility of having the texts translated into

English and published in the United States. He said he was directed to a Mr.

Dining (probably Mr. Donald F. Ewing), Chief of Information Service, who in turn

Istroduced him to a Mr. Willard Allan also an official at the American Embassy

in Athens. KilLY stated that after several meetings with Mr. Allan he was asked

by Mr. Allan to work with the Americans. KULY immediataly volunteered and was

told in order to get an organization that could accomplish its mission he would

need several assistants.

He explored the Layrion refugee camp for potential staff

personnel and was given the names of Ivan Hristonov and Ivan and Dimitur Donev

Upon the suggestion of the Americans, KIllY said he accepted the persons namedo

He established a headquarters and proceeded planning operations to penetrato

Bulgaria. Kill claimed the Greeks and certsin Bulgarian emigre leaders in

Greece were opposed to his position with the Americans and did everything

possible to belittle his position and impair his operations. The results of

KElLI's abortive missions into bulgaria are contained in a report which KiLLI

prepared at DTROBALO and which is now in his file.

1% During the period in which he was trying to get his operations

counted into Bulgaria, KiLLY was approached by the French IS to work for them,

MILY statad that he immediately inforned his American superiors regarding thi

French approach and was thereafter directed by the Americans in his dealings

and associstions with the Frerch IS.

KILLY listed the following American personnel with whon he coordinated

KELLY referred to the following Bulgarian personnel as having been associated

with his organization and with whon he was acquainted: Ivan Hristonov, whom he

believes supplanted him in the organization in Athens; Ivan and Dimitur Doney,

who he claims are presently in Argentins; Choyo. Stonorskd (probably Stoyo

Chonovsid); Andon Andonov; Gospodin Gospodinov; Hristo iraikov; Vasil lancher;

Kilty continued by stating that he was apprehended by the Greek Police,

allegedly for sate keeping in April 1951. He was placed in detention and ro

mained under Greek control until his departure from Greece to Frankfurt by air.

Fron Frankfurt he was transported to Panama where he arrived on 5 September 1951.

He was placed in detention at a hospital in Panama and was of the opinion that.

perhaps the hespital was an exterminating establishment for undesirables. Later,

however, he said he learned otherwise and through a friend, Mr. Stanley, learned

that he was sent to Panams to undergo several physical check-ups and that after

that was completed he would be removed to an area some 50 miles sway where he

would enjoy full freedon. Also that he would remain at his new location long

enough to learn a language and prepare himself for resettlement. When he in

quired how long that would be he was told that would be about sir months.

20. In March 1952 KELLY was transferred to DIROBALD. He stated that be

remained at DTROBALO for six months and after that period he confronted the

authorities concerning his release and resettlement.

Approximately one month

later KILI# said he informed the Station authorities that he would leave the

area il they did not release him as initially promised. He stated that he was

apprehended and placed in confinement until his release in May 1953.

21.. KELLY advised that the above is a true account of his past ex

periences and in view of my limited stay in DTROBALO would appreciate any answer

I could give him regarding questions that have never been resolved and con

sequently have disturbed him.. KILLI apparently had a list of questions prepared

which he drew from a notebook and proceeded to read. the questions were as

follows:.

do Why was he apprehended by the Greek Police?

bo Why was he placed in confinement in Panama and later at DIROBALO?

ço.

How much longer must he remain at DTROBALO?

Is there any possibility of his working with the organization

(CIA) to complete the mission he initiated?

What happened to the texts he wrote that weretaken to the

United States by Mr. Willard Allan?

Why haven't any of his old friends visited him during the past

two years?

3 In regards to his family - kitty stated that only as a last

resort and only if he had to remain at DIROBALO would he want his fantly

there. He would prefer working and sarding sufficient money ($2000) to

purchase or build a home for then in Greece and drop the whole matter.

He was placed in confinement at Panama to undergo mental and

physical check-ups to assure his recovery from the ordeal which he had

undergone. His confinement at DTROBALO was to prevent his contemplated

and announced escape.

In reply to queries and in his own

Bulgarian operations:

Do I feel confident that KILLY realizes that his chances of resuming his

agents involved in those operations which, if revealed to unauthorized persons,

could become embarrassing.

operations is so minute that the security risks involved to our current operations

would be very little, if any, if he were resettled. Therefore, my recommendation

is to process himtor resettlemento

Lyle O. Kelly

Memorandun from Acting Chief, Operations, DDP dated

7 Jamary 1953, to Chief, SE

core cases, the matter of subject's disposal was discussed with the Chief,

DE/lamin after recolpt of reference. In am innitand de ti at arry time in.

20

For your a la la maling anato dispostion ot taia case, the hear

this Division has reached the conclusion, based on facts set forth in the

following paragraphs, that Kelly, 1f released fron confinement; will be a

source of serious embarrassment to CIA.

30. Subject, @Bulgarian refugee in Greece, was the principal agent

in an 11l-isted operation run fron October 1950 to March 1951.

The

operation resulted in a major expose and trial in Sofia during 1951. The

agents used were those salected by Subject, at least one of whom was

•probably an operative of the Bulgarian Militia and acted as the betrayer

of his colleagues.

4o Subject's behavior during his employment was extraordinarily bad

and characterized by a complete lack of seourity and a conscious effort

on his part to aggrandize himself at the expense of the United States and

n18 fellow agentso uniortunately, duriffithe time of his use by us, ho

acquired considerable information about CIA personnel, operations and

installations in Greece..

He was permitted to come and go freely in the certain

CIA offices in the American Embassy.

50

through another informant the Athens Station learned in early

1951 that Subject had contacted French Intelligence officers in Greece

and had agreed to sell complete details on U. S. plana for operations

against Bulgaria for the sun of 16,000,000 drachmae. All subsoquent

information.on this transaction corroborates the veracity of the original

informant's stary including & French document secured through another CIA

channel which shows that as early as 1949 Subject had been an agent of a

Embassy in Athens.

6. At the urgent request of the Athens Station that Subject be

removed inmediately Iron Athens, arrangements were made for bis trang

portation and incarceration at DIROBALO. To facilitate his removal,

Subjoct was told that he was being taken to the United States for a

meeting of important satellits refugee leaders.

He was flown by CIA plane

to Germany, and from there to Panama by U.S. Army plane.

he developed an infantile megalomania in which he persisted in considering

himself the forthconing Minister-President of Bulgaria,". During his detention

incarcocation at DIROBALO, we understand that these same character traits

have been evident.

1.Financial Finagling in Greece

BULGARIAN

(a) In February, 1951, when Kelly was head of the Democratic Bloc,

three of his men arrived in Athens, coming directly from IRO camps.

They needed shelter, but had no money. They were put on salary, but it

was not enough to cover the sixnonths advance rent which it is the custom

to pay when a lease ls made in Athens. Thus Kelly a advance account wa.

credited with aunts the amount of (danct) $850, which was to be used

to pay the rental advance. the three men were to pay it back in monthly

installments.

Two such installments were paid by the men when Kelly was "interned"

by our people. The men were then able to complain that letty had forced

then into quarters best described as "very inadequate, insecuress and

unhealthy."

Comparing the quallty of the quarters with the amount advanced for

rent, it becomes quite certain that Kelly made some sort of deal with the

landlord in order to make some money.

health and security reasons.

had spent it on hinself.

2. Racinent Manuscript Episode

In December, 1950, Willard Allen, in accordance with a promise made

to Kelly, brought with him to this country three manuscripts, ostensibl

written by Kelly. Allen was to see what he could do to have these manu-

sripts published here. Kelfy hoped to thus exploit and dramatize his

escape from Bulgaria.

cation of the manuscrapts.

On December 14, 1951, in a conversation with Mr. Allen, it was learned

by us that kelly had not written the manuscripts at all. Allen learned this

himself when the real author wrote to him demanding the return of his

works.

credit for the manuscripts. Furthermore, the real author had seen nothing

of the $300 given to Kelly, although they apparently had agreed to go

50-50 on any profits realized from the publication of the manuscrigta.

It 1s clear that Kelly lied to us, and used someone alse's Ilterary

talentsin the hope of gaining noteriety and money himself.

3. Relations with the French

In early 1951, Kelly Informed our people in Athens that a french

Vice Consul fron Salonica had contacted

him in the hope of getting Kelly

to work rethodotect for his country. Kelly was allowed by us to contime

seeing this man until it was determineddjust what the French wanted in the

way of information. tis point was reached,

and Kelly was told not to see

his Frenchman of ay Frenchnen after a certain Thursday.

We know definitely

that Kelly saw saw his Frenchman on the following Friday, Saturday, and

201-45145

Tuesday.

We do not know what was said, but from a source whom we have no reason

to doubt, ( an ex-friend of Kelly's who deserted Kelly and came to us to

warn us of fax the situation with the French) we learned that for a sun

amounting to 16,000,000 drachmae, Kelly had agreed to give the French the

nanes of all the American staffinvolved in plans to infiltrate Bulgaria,

maplus information on Radio fuckalky Gorianin. Kelly was immediately

picked up by the Greek Allen Directorate, acting upon orders from Henry

McLean.

Gerald I. Manfield

Terence U. Hasmith

Lyle 0. Kelly

It occurs to me, lying happily upon my hepatitic bed as I an, that

some sort 88 a statement regarding the "denise" of Lyle 0. Kelly might

be in order "for the record". I shall discuss two aspects of Kelly in

this memorandun, apologizing in advance for the vagueness of the dis-

cussion which 1s due, I shall maintain, to my present horizontal position

far fron records, calendars and the recollectionful clink of the Ismailie

gold pound.

I. The good of Lyle O, Kelly.

In the summer of 1950 QiStair was in the ridiculous position of

being able to do anything because the alien support on which it de-

pended; allegedly forthcoming from the reverend Dr. Glantz, was not

forthconing.

In a bit of a

tizzy, anxious to get cracking, we picked

up Lyle 0. Kelly. We suspected at the time that he was not the new

"white hope",

but we needed someone. through whos we could obtain bodies.

We obtained bodies through Kelly and actually have accomplished some

substantive work. Thus it must be remembered that Kelly performed a

useful service for is.

2. The bad of Inde Oe Relly.

Kelly, unfortunately, is of an essentially Irresponsible

Irish nature.

Moreover, in his stupidity, he conceives all others to

be equally stupid.

Early in our relations with Kelly, before I left

LCDrink in October, we foresaw the need to curb Kelly or to eliminate

bim from our operations.

Since, however, he was still necessary to us,

we tried to use him, restraining him and

teaching him the while.

Kelly, uniortunately, did not learn - he got worse. He "bor-

rowed" and stole money from many sources. He lied to many people, in-

cluding us, and he developed an infantile megalomania in which he per-

Things took a serious turn when Kelly's committee, men he

himself had chosen, came to us behind his back complaining about him.

This became nore serious when his "closest" friend, & Flake, the man

who had actually written the books for which Kelly took credit, de-

serted Kelly and came to us apparently in an honest desire to safe-

guard America and the struggle against Communism from further involve-

ment-with a character as shady as Kelly.

The nost serdous matter, one which could not be ignored, In-

Kelly had advised us that

a Fairy Vice Consul from Salonica had contacted him with regard to work-

ing together. We told Kelly he night go ahead and contime his relation

with this gentleman until we learned exactly what the gentleman wanted.

We learned what was wanted and advised felly he was not repeat not to see

the Fairy agent, of any other Fairies, after a certain Thursday. We know

definitely that Kelly did see this Fairy on the following Friday, Satur

day, and tuesday.

We do not Inor what he discussed with the Fairy but we have no

reason to doubt the word of his Flake friend which is essentially as

follows:

That the Fairies were interested primarily in the

nanes and numbers of all the players (as, that is) in

plans for Infiltration of Dreamland, in information on

Radio Gorianis, ete.; that Kelly had agreed to sell

this Information to the Fairies for a sum of 16,000,000

drachmae and that he had an appointment to complete the

transaction at Il o'clock the following norning.

On this infornation we had Kelly picked up, and are now troubled with

the question of disposing of him.

Since that time we have exantaed nore closely into the fally

affair and have found more lies, more secret agreements, more stater

tunds, more of that good, Irish whimsicality for which Kelly is already

so famous. Note that even if the hearsay evidence regarding the sell-

out to the Fairies is erroneous - although it is becked by several in-

dependent bits of substantial evidence - we still have enough proof of

untrustworthiness. to have a compete case against Kelly. We cannot

continue with Kolly. He is finished.

(It is pertinent to note that Kelly's connittee, and his party

in general, feel no feeling of loss since his removal from active politics.

Not a single person has asked about him except his wife - whome he con-

tinuously disowned - who wanted only to know how she might get in touch

with him to ask him for some money.

The committee and refugees in

I(Flake in general, are in much better spirits than they have ever been

before. Kelly's removal is in every way a tonie.)

I repeat, however, that at certain juncture in our efforts,

Kelly represented the first and only alien body we had and, however un-

wittingly and briefly, served his country well. One hopes he will

eventually come out of his present habitat with somewhat stronger moral

fiber.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Development of the Rift with DIMITRI A. DIMITROY

1. Blography: (See 104 CAGYU, dated 4 October 1950) Born 7 May

1924 in Medkovets, Bulgaria.

Education-studied philology for one year

at Sofia University, 1942-43. In 1942 joined secret branch of the

Bulgarian National Agrarian Union. Claims to have begun underground,

anti-Fascist activitles in 1943 in Macedonia and to have worked closely

with Dr. G. M. Dimitrov during this time. After emerging briefly from

hiding in September 19k, he again went underground engaging in anti-

Communist activities, touring various cities and towns, (including

sections of Yugoslav/Macedonia) and urging members of the Agrarian party

to take positive action against the Communists.

In October, 1946, he

was arrested by the police.. He believes the reason he was not executed

was that the Communists wished to use him as witness against Nikola

Petkor. On 23 July 1947 he escaped to Greece.

2. Initial operation: (See Athe 3200 (IN 46672), 25 October 1950)

In Oetober, 1950, the OKSTAIR Field Chief learned of Dimitrot through

the local peripheral. reporting offfcer and contacted him covertly.

Dimitroy made sir agents Innediately available for infiltration operations:

Three of these six were successfully infiltrated on 10 December, carrying

leaflets signed: in the name of the Bulgarian Democratic Bloc, the emigre

political group organized and headed by Dimitrov.

3. Subsequent activities: Dimitrov has supplied an additional 21

agents

for QKSTAIR infiltration operations, 15 of whom have just con

pleted training in Germany and are being prepared for infiltration by

mid-bay.

4. Origins of OKSTAIR break with Dimitrov:

a. In Athe 4821, IN 30224, Manfield reported on 22 March that -

he was considering breaking off association with Dimitroy because

he had become too unpopular and dictatorial and self-important.

There were also indications of serious misappropriation of funds.

Manfield felt that Dimitrov's group could continue to be utilized

under the leadership of Ivan Done Ivanot.

b. In Athe 5150 (IN 36130) dated 20 April 1951, Manfield

cabled that he had had the Greek Aliens Directorate pick up Dimitrov

and put him under protective arrest for the reasons indicated above

and because Dimitroy Has about to sell out to the French. (This

was discovered through an OPC penetration of Dimitrov's organization.)

He also requested instructions on how to

dispose of Dimitrov for

a period

of three months, which he felt was sufficient time in

which to render him harmless to OKSTAIR operations.

SUBJIRCT: Lyle O. KELLY

10

As a result of discussions between WHD, SE, CFI, and DD/A, It was

decided to send an SE representative to DIROBALO to intervieN Lyle O. KILLY

for the purpose of determining whether he represented sufficient security hazard

to current SE operations out of Greece to warrant his being retained in marimu

detention.

2. In accordance with this agroement, Major Michael A. Hemovich,was sent

to DIBOBALO where he arrived at noon on 26 May 1953.

30

Major Henavich discussed the case with the case officars concerned

at DIROBALO, and then spent twelve hours talidng to KELI,I.

As a result of

this, it has been ascertained to our satiafaction that KülIT does not appear to

have information of sufficient currency regarding staff or agent personnel, or

current operations, in Greece to make his resettlement within the course of the

next twelve months a serlous security risk.

We therefore recomend that Lyle O. KuLLY be given whatever training

in langaago and trade WI Division feels 1s required, and that efforts then be

made to resettle him in South America. Our only request is that this Division

be kept informed of the progress of this rehabilitation and be advised of the

steps taken to resettlo Kali.

In this connection: it should ba pointed out

that KILLI has a wife and child in Greece.

When querled by Major Henovich

about them, he professed no interest in having the wite or child join hing

stating that he would like to provide sone money for the support of the child

1f and when he got a job and could put aside sone money for this purpose. It

is therefore our intention to have KiLLY write his wife a letter telling her

that he has no further interest in her, that she should obtain a divorce, but

that he will provide her with a certain sum of money for the child. (This sun

will be provided by this Division and will probably be in the neighbortiood of

$1000).

1. A review of Agency filos reveals the following data concerning Subject

and his association with CIA.

2. Subjoct was first contacted in October 1950 by the Field Chiaf of OPC

activities in Atheza, Greece. The purpose of this contact was to astess.

Subjees as a principal agent and local point in the recruitment of Bulgarians

to participato: in OPC operations directed against Bulgaria.. For this parposo..

an organization called the Democratie Bloe was establiahed, and Sabject was

placed as ita ostenaiblo organizor and chief.

3. During the pertod October 1950 through March 1951, Subject remained

in the amploy of OPC in Atheas and provided 2l agents for infiltration into

Bulgaria, but he never participated in the cross-border operations.

4. In early 1951, various operational and adminiatrative dificulties

began to manifest themselves and it was decided that Subjoct should be i

removed from hia position. In April 1951 it camo to OPC's attention that

Subjeet intended to sell his knowledge of ClA's activities to the French

Intolligenco Servico. This lait was used as the primary reason for his

removal from active participation in Balgarian operations.

5. Bacause of operational security considorations stemming from bie

duplicity and personal make-up, it was deemed inadvisablo to leave Subject

at large in Greeca and it was decided that he should do transfaried to a CIA

bolding facility.at Fort Claytos, Panama. He was airlifted fross Athens to

Frankfurt where he was hopitalized four days for observation, and then

flown black to Fort Claytos, arriving on 4 September 1951, Ho semained.

there until January 1954.

6. A CIA case officar was dispatched fram headquarters in May 1953

to Fort Clayton where he interrogated Subject. It was determined at that

time that whatever operational knowledge Subject had of CLA, its metboda.

personnel, and operations was obsolete.

was tomporarily toroved to Grence since there were no other immediate

possibilition to resettle him. (The attached understanding with Subject

was affected ola l2 Janusry 1934 at the time ol his tomoval from l'ost

would not abandon Subjast in treace and would take stops to remove hims

on the following occasion:

On 14 May 1957, the Departzent of State informed CLA tar

Subjoet bad contacted their affice and tried to latorest thera in

tha Department of State that ho was living in Newark, Now Jaraoy,

with his wife and saven-year-old danghter and was in Washington

on a viait. The state Departent had no interest tu the flies script

and asked il members of this Agency would like to meat Subject and

discuss the script... This offer was turned dowr.. The cass officer

involved understood that State Dopartmest then discontinued' all

contact with Subjoct. Those la so further infarmation available.

polat of lylag and become involved in deals of which he was the financial

Throughout all his deals, howovas, thate is the thread of alleged

national pride and desiro to projecs himnall la the fight againat Communiana.
