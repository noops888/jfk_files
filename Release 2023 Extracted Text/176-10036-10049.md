Director Shell-Conakry told Embassy officer September 19

his company fueled Aeroflot IL-18 going to Brazil with

Soviet women athletes and Cubana IL-18, both August 27,

upon direct orders President Toure and Cabinet. Fuel paid

for by GOG. Though Embassy generally confident it will

get news bloc aircraft flights between Conakry and Americas

within 24 hours after event, GOG could order security fueling

operation Cubana and Soviet planes telling Shell keep

silent leaving Embassy in dark.

Since no longer clear check through kerosene Embassy

information less precise and less rapid. Any effort to

check by asking GOG clearly counterproductive.

CAS reported above flights.
