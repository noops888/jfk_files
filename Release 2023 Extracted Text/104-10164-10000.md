their association with the Agency. I explained thie Agency's serious

rovervations concerning the possibility of compromise of agents and

operations that are still in being. I explained that the Agency con-

tinues to have associations with some of the individuals with whom

Messis. Barker and Martinez had contact during their Agency

association. Mr.. Schultz seemed to appreciate this problem.

Thus,

in order to attempt to protect those individuals, I explained that the

Agency is currently not in a position to givc Messrs. Barker and

Martinez blanket authorization to identify individuals with whom they

had contact during their Agency association. Mr. Schultz readily

acknowledged those conditions.

4. I mentioned to Mr. Schulty that if, as a result of the

discussions that are now being authorized, Mr. Schultz believes

that certain individuals need to be identified he can make such a

narrow

request to the Agency at that time. I made no guarantee

that we would approve such a request, only that we would consider

it in view of (1) the rationale that Mr. Schultz would offor as to his

nenria, (2) the possibility of publication, (3) the damage to current

oporations, and (4) the precedent in terms of weakening the confi-

donce of current and polantial Aguncy relationships.

the ANSHU'S Unit but rather continue running him as a singleton

agent.

I8 was also felt that he respords more favorably under

the direction and guidance of one case oificer rather than as

a l'sam meaber.

AHCLATTER/1 has perfurmed very well in his new

duties aa refugee debriefer, and

his debriefing reports are

models of

thoroughness, if not of organization.

3.. During the reporting period October-December, AMCLATTER/1

conducted a total of 16 refugee debrielings and prepared reports

on these. Some of the debriefings required as many as four

separato sessions.

In addition, AMCLATTER/1 submitted ten

operational reports dealing with information concerning the

Cuban exile community,

the majority of these stemming from

contacta with Identity A. Two of these were disseminated.

During the period October-December 1965 the following

were expended for AMCLATTER/1:

Salary - $1,344.87; reim-

bursement for POV mileage and operational expenses - $209.94;

total - $1, 554.31.

FOR AN EVENTUAL COUP AGAINST THE GUATEMALAN GOVERNMENT. ALEJOS

PROMISED GARCERAN THAT IF THE COUP WERE SUCCESSFUL, ALEJOS WOULD

ESTABLISH A CUBAN GOVERNMENT IN EXILE IN GUATEMALA WITH GARCERAN

AS ITS "PRESIDENT."

3. GARCERAN SAID THAT THE PLAN IS MERELY IN THE "TALKING STAGE"

AND STRESSED THAT THERE ARE AS YET NO SPECIFIC PLANS, LOCATIONS,

OR TIMETABLES IN EFFECT.

4. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE HAD MADE SEVERAL TRIPS TO GUATEMALA,

AND SPECIFICALLY MENTIONED A MEETING HE HAD HAD WITH ROJAS MARROQUI

(FNU) ON 14 SEPTEMBER DURING THE COURSE OF A FOUR-DAY TRIP "THROUGH

THE FRONTIER." ON THE SAME TRIP ALEJOS ALSO MET WITH ABUNDIO

MALDONADO, JOSE LUIS ARENAS, VILLAGRAN KRAMER, TWO BARRIOS PENA

HE SAID THAT DURING HIS ILLEGAL TRIPS TO GUATEMALA HE HAD STAYED

IN ABOUT 1I DIFFERENT HOUSES.

5. ALEJUS TOLD GARCERAN THAT, IN ORDER FOR HIS COUP TO

HAVE ANY CHANCE FOR SLCCESS, IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HE HAVE THE

FULL SUPPORT OF THE GUATEMALAN AIR FORCE. HE ASSURED GARCERAN THAT

HE HAS SUCH SUPPORT.

6. ALEJOS SAID THAT HE WOULD SUPPLY THE NECESSARY ARMS AND

EQUIPMENT TO THE CUBAN EMIGRES. RECRUITED BY GARCERAN. HE REVEALED

THAT THE LOCATION OF THE TRAINING SITE WOULD BE IN NORTHERN

NICARAGUA, A NECESSARY CHOICE BECAUSE SOUTHERN NICARAGUA IS TO

BE USED BY THE SOMOZA/SCHECK FORCES AS A LAUNCHING SITE FOR A COUP

AGAINST THE GOVERNIENT OF COSTA RICA. (FIELD COMMENT: THIS PROBABLY

1830 hours whoreas the fourth call was received at 2130 hours.

The

caller spoke Iluent English and used extremely vile language insult-

ing to both A/l and his wife.

The conversation during each phone

call was short and made no sense to.A/l who said the caller at one

point identified himself as Jerry WALKER when A/l asked who was

speaking.
