Vi:

OF AMERICANS CONSTITUTED A VC PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE, BUT WAS INSUFFICIENT TO

OVERCOME THE DISADVANTAGES AND VULNERABILITIES, AND THAT ALL AMERICANS NOT

ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN. NEU FURTHER STATED THAT THE GVN

SHOULD SERK MEANS OF REDUCING THE REQUIREMENIS FOR AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSISIANCE,

SINCE SOUTH VIETNAM MUST ACHIEVE AS MUCH SELF-SUFFICIENCY AS POSSIBLE.

3. NHU SAID THAT HE HAD NO RESPECT FOR THE CRITICS OF THE REGIME, BOTE

IN SOUTH VIETNAM AND ABROAD, WEO, WHILE PRETENDING TO BE INTERESTED IN THE

WELFARE OF THE COUNTRY, ACTUALLY ONLY WANIED TO ADVANCE THEIR OWN PERSONAL

POWER AND SELF-INTEREST. NHU STATED THAT NEITHER HE, NOR OTHER VIETNAMESE

LEADERS, CONSIDERED THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION, WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS A

TEMPORARY PRODUCT OF HISTORICAL NECESSITY, AN IDEAL SITUATION.
