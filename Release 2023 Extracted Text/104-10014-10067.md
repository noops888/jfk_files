OBSERVATIONS OF, AND DISCUSSIONS WITH,

L/1 AND FAMILY DURING

THEIR REF OUTING TO CHUY IN EARLY JAN 94.

3. L/1 DID THE DRIVING FROM MONTEVIDEO TO CHUY.

HE DOES

NOT LIKE DRIVING AT NIGHT OR IN THE RAIN.

IN CONTRAST WITH HIS

NORMALLY PLEASANT PERSONALITY, L/1 BECOMES AGGRESSIVE AND

NERVOUS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

4.

WHILE FAMILIES WERE STAYING TOGETHER IN RATHER SMALL

BEACH HOUSE, L/1 AND HIS WIFE GOT INTO A FIGHT. SHE APPEARED

TO BE THE INSTIGATOR.

IN PRIVATE.

DIVORCE HIS CURRENT SEE WILE NOT RAVE THES DAN PEACE TO LIVE

ROOM ONTO HOUSE OF MRS. L/l'S PARENTS IN

A COMPULSIVE SHOPPER), AND THAT SHE HAS TO CONTROL HIM WHEN

SENSIND: PL

CRITICIZED L/1 FOR SPOILING THEIR CHILDREN (HIS OLDER DAUGHTER

BY PREVIOUS MARRIAGE AND THEIR YOUNGER DAUGHTER), BY GIVING

THEM WHATEVER THEY ASK FOR.

MRS. L/1 HAS A POOR RELATIONSHIP

WITH THE OLDER DAUGHTER.

SHE ADDED THAT L/l'S RELATIONSHIP

WITH HIS TWO GROWN SONS IS GOOD BUT SOMEWHAT DISTANT.

6.

F/86 PERSONALLY OBSERVED L/1'S COMPULSIVE SHOPPING WHEN

THEY ALL WENT TO CHUY ON 8 JAN. BOTH L/1 AND HIS WIFE BOUGHT

LARGE NUMBER OF ITEMS TO SEND TO THEIR FAMILY IN CUBA. AT ONE

POINT, L/1 TOLD HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD DO THE BUYING AND SHE

SHOULD BE THE HOUSEWIFE.

MRS. L/1 CALLED HIM A "DUMB SPANIARD"

("GALLEGO BRUIO"). F/86 SUSPECTS THAT L/1 AND WIFE HAVE OTHER

PROBLEMS, POSSIBLY DUE TO L/I'S INFIDELITY. DURING THEIR

SPATS, MRS. L/1 WAS USUALLY THE AGGRESSOR, WITH L/1 TRYING TO

KEEP PEACE OR SIMPLY REMAINING QUIET.

MRS.. L/1 ALSO GOT INTO

ARGUMENTS WITH SOME OF THE PALESTINIAN MERCHANTS IN CHUY.

7.

ONE OTHER ASPECT OF L/I'S FAMILY WHICH F/86 FOUND

DISAGREEABLE WAS BEHAVIOR OF L/1'S OLDER DAUGHTER.

F/86 AND

HIS WIFE WERE BOTH OFFENDED BY DAUGHTER'S FREQUENT SEXUAL

REFERENCES IN FRONT OF F/86'S YOUNGER CHILDREN. F/86 SAID THAT

L/1'S DAUGHTER ACTED JUST LIKE A CUBAN HOOKER.

8.

ON A MORE ELEVATED PLANE, F/86 ALSO HAD SOME PRIVATE

PHILOSOPHICAL AND POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS WITH L/1.

IN RESPONSE

TO F/86'S DIRECT QUESTION, L/1 SAID THAT THE WRITERS WHO HAVE

INFLUENCED HIM THE MOST ARE MARX, HEGEL AND KANT.

L/1 SAID

THAT LENIN'S MAIN ACHIEVEMENT WAS TO RECOGNIZE NEED FOR ONLY

ONE PARTY.

L/1 CONSIDERS LENIN TO HAVE BEEN AN INTEPRETER OF

MARX BUT NOT A GREAT THEORETICIAN.

TO SOME EXTENT, L/1

IMPLEMENT IN USSR.

AFTER LENIN'S DEATH, IT BECAME EXCESSIVELY

BUREAUCRATIZED AND ATROPHIED,

ALTHOUGH THIS SYSTEM DID WORK

WITH SOME SUCCESS IN BULGARIA.

L/1 ALSO ACKNOWLEDGED NEED FOR "NEOLIBERAL MEDICINE" TO

REFORM CUBAN ECONOMY, BECAUSE THERE IS NO OTHER SOLUTION.

ADDED, HOWEVER, THAT REFORMS SHOULD BE INSTITUTED WITH MINIMUM

SOCIAL AND POLITICAL COSTS.

WHILE STATE SHOULD NOT BE

EXCESSIVELY INTERVENTIONIST IN ECONOMY, L/I WANTS STATE TO

RETAIN ITS PROTECTIVE SOCIAL ROLE, BECAUSE MARKET ECONOMY ALSO

HAS ITS FAULTS.

10. L/1 TALKED ABOUT ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN E.

KENNEDY. ACCORDING TO L/1, IN 1969, L/1 PERSONALLY SAW FIDEL

CASTRO RECEIVE A GROUP OF U.S. RADICALS. CASTRO TALKED TO THEM

FOR TWO HOURS ABOUT WHY JUSI ONE ASSASSIN COULD NOT POSSIBLY

HAVE KILLED KENNEDY.

CAVE USEN HIDEST CARISME REACT ENT DEATE

*WHAT<LEE HARVEY OSWALD>SUPPOSEDLY DID BY HIMSELF.

L/1 SAID

THAT THREE GROUPS WERE INVOLVED IN KILLING THE PRESIDENT:

GROUP OF CUBANS,

ONE GROUP O "MAFIOSOS" AND A THIRD GROUP OF

MERCENARIES.

THE THIRD GROUP INCLUDED A MAN WITH A GREEK

NAME. L/1 TOLD F/86 THAT IT IS NOI KNOWN WHETHER ANY OF THESE
