Appreciation for Assistance with JFK

Assassination Documents

This is to express my appreciation for the

important assistance that you and

your colleagues provided

to the Historical Review Group recently. As you recall, we

were directed

to count the documents in the 80 boxes of the

JFK Assassination files and the Oswald 201 File, in

preparation for the DCI's testimony before Congress on

12 May. This involved determining the number of pages in

four specific categories of information, consisting of more

than 160,000 pages.

Without your Division's help, we would

not have

been able to meet the short deadline.

2 .

Please extend my thanks to the following eight

individuals who assisted us:

Pat Berlin

Michael Joseph

John Kirby

Gerald Liebenau

Christopher Rehder

Karl Rohrer

Maria Tovar, /

Again, many thanks for your cooperation.
