Collection Act of 1992

Dear John,

As I mentioned over the telephone, we have uncovered one

more

document requiring CIA review which I am enclosing.

Hopefully this will be the last one.

I am also returning to you CIA's referral under the Act to

HDR of August 23, which John Glennon has reviewed. As you can

see by his note, he completed it several days ago, and I forgot

to pass it on to you when you were over the other day. John

Glennon has indicated one document for postponement.

I am returning it to you with the rest at this point, I have

passed a copy of it on to the reviewers in Diplomatic Security,

who are coordinating a response with CA. I will call you when

I get an answer from them.

If they decide to release it, we

would then have to obtain a concurrence from FBI.

Thank you again for your prompt action in reviewing our

request.

I will be getting back to you on the DS answer after

return

on October 7.

Sincerely,

Hing

Dear Nina:

Thank you for the background on "Roger Channel" from

yOur FAM.

We will discontinue deleting this designator

except where the specific use of it might compromise

something else we need to protect.

I am returning to you herewith the two documents from

the Department of State collection of President John F.

Kennedy assassination records that you sent me on 8

November.

We have identified those passages we want to

continue to protect with yellow highlighting and paper

clips.

' In the State cable from Mexico City of 28 November

1963, we are asking for the deletion of "Roger Channel," in

this case because Do chooses to protect the fact that

Ambassador Mann used this channel to keep readers of this

formerly very sensitive cable to a minimum. We concur with

your other three deletions and your reasoning for them

(though the thira of these is clearly State's to call). On

these an

the 17 May 1957 Ops Memo from Brussels, we are asking foI

two deletions to protect our presence in Brussels at that

time.

Thank you for the opportunity to review this material

for CIA interests.

please let us know.

Sincerely,

assassination records which I had begun to review in your

accompanying lists, we

have released in full--or indicated

no objection to release in full--49.5, and we have indicated

deletions of still sensitive CIA information (really

minimal) in 25.5. This leaves two in your list (both on

review under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of

This collection comprises seven documents (plus four duplicates).

For those passages marked off by red or

black ink brackets, but without yellow highlighting, CIA has determined

Dear Miriam:

Recently during a conversation with Bob Skwirot of the ARRB

staff, I mentioned the 8 documents from NARA'S Warren

Commission collection that I had sent to CIA for rereview in

October 1995 (memorandum attached) •

Bob said that CIA had

already rereviewed various versions of Slawson's report and he

subsequently sent me the attached sheets that show final action

and the CIA'S RIF numbers.

However, he only sent me the final

text of the 55-page version.

At any rate, I was wondering if

there is anything more than

• CIA might supply in response to the

October 1995 request. •

10. Memorandum From the Central Intelligence Agency Project

Officer for Operation Mongoose (Harvey) to the Chief of

Operations, Operation Mongoose (Lansdale)

Washington, October 8, 1962.

SUBJECT

Sabotage of Cuban-Owned Ship

1. It is requested that you present the following proposal to the Spe-

cial Group (Augmented) for policy approval.

2. Policy approval is requested to permit the sabotage of Cuban-

wned vessels wherever and whenever secure access to them can b

attained, normally this will be in non-Bloc ports. Attacks against the

Cuban-öwned ships must be considered essentially as attacks against

targets of opportunity in the sense that in most cases there will be little

advance information prior to the arrival of the ship in a non-Bloc port

and the duration of the port call will be limited.

3.. The following specific types of action are contemplated:

Per conversations with Susan Weetman on 16 May

1997, Volume X is scheduled to be published in June 1997;

all release decisions concerning the FRUS Vol. X documents

are firm and cannot be changed.

Therefore, any JFK review

of these documents will not influence the FRUS release.
