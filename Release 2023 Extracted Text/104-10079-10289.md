the frequent use of the LIENTRAP mobile photographic unit.

a)

Raymond H. GERENDE - Throughout this period, Raymond il, GERENDE

continued as the Station's full-time

the LIMITED,

and LILYRIC basehouses as well as maintaining the cutout

responsibility to the LIstin? mobile photo unit and the LIE PTY

photographic-processing basehouse.

GERENDE agoin made numerous

and essential contributions to the sensitive AROD operation

well as servicing numerous postal acconnodation addresses.

b)

O11ver G. SCANTLING - SCANELING during the reference period,

continued to make his regulai contribution

to Station activities

as the alternate contact of LICASA-l in this sensitive LAURICLE

operation.

In addition, SCANTLING provided detailed casing reports

on the Indonesian Embassy and the home

Of AMRIFT-1; performed pre-

text investigations in an effort to determine the

residence, of a

koy LIMERICK staffer; and successfull: recruited the subject of

MEXI-2315 (dated 19 January 1955) which enabled the Station to

achieve a major technical penetration

of the PBRUMEN Embassy in

Mexico City (see also MEXI-2235 dated. 20 January 1965, for

additional details) • SCANTLING's extremely professional performance

in this recruitment and the subsequent ticklish agent-handling of

the subject is to ba commended.

c) LIMITED

As noted in paragraph 2, section b

of Reference, the LIMITED

photographic, surveillance, and radio dispatching activities were

suspended in

Late September 1964 due to the release of LIMITED

notographs in the larren Commission's overt report. ¡ The Station

subsequently acquired an apartment in the immediate veinity of

the LIMERICK installation and moved the LIMITED basehouse keepers,

LIEMPIY-6 and LIEMPTY-7, into this temporary location.

LILYRIC - Throughout the periol under review, the LILIRIC installation

continued to provide photographic and fixed visual surveillance of the

front of the LIMERICK installation. LILYRIC provided 63 rolls of

operational photograpis during this period which were of definite

value to the Stations KUDESK operations against the LIMERICK target.

IILYRIC made specific contributions to the Station's LIOYSIER-1

operation, as noted in MEXI-1473 of 4 November 1954.

LICALLA - During the period under review, the LICALLA installation

provided coverage of the bach of the IlMERIck installation, the

sarden, and patio area where many of the personnel congregate. LICALLA

considerable

value in providing identifications, locations, and contacts of various

LIENTRAP "take" provided the positive identification and

location of the subject of IMMA-25183, dated 18 January 1965,

•4. SECURITY AND PROBLEMS.

a) During the period under review, there have been no known incidents

which adversely effected the security of Project LIE PTY.

However, as

a pre-

cautionary neasure, the LIENIRAP photographic unit was repainted (a basic color

change) in January 1965. It is believed that this action will increase the

security of the LIENTRAP unit and allow it to again operate in various areas

where it had been used extensively in the past.

b) There have been no major operational, personnel, or administrative

problems in this Project during the reporting perioa.

5. PLANS.

a)

During the past project year,

many of the operational

assignments,

levied on Oliver G. SCANTLING,

while within the realm of the Station's RMD,

have fallen outside the scope

of Project LIEMPTY.

Consequently, a new Project

Outline is being prepared at the Station to cover the relationship with, and

the present and anticipated operational activities of SCANTLING..

b)

Anticipated changes in the LIMITED installation activities were out-

lined in paragraph 2, Section c above.

Other than noted above, there are no

basic operational or administrative changes contemplated for Project ITEMPTY.
