:Dorn Mtv ON, luthor or 216A liticle, and

Juan BRiVIAGA, subject of Article.

1. Donn'

Hale MUNSON, born 1905, resident of Los

Angeles, approached LICONET/1 in 106k claiming he

represented a large group. of Cuban exiles in the Los

Angeles area. MUNSON asked LICCHPT/1 about the location

of training camps, etc. LICOMET/1 reported the discussion

to Station Mexico City and was instructed to avoid MUNSON.

Donn Hale MUNSON is probably identical with the Donn MUNSON

who authored the saga article. There are no additional

identifiable traces on MUNSON.

2. There are numerous traces on Juan ERQUINGA jircorbe,

he ormer of the weapons plant named in the iara article

he 83t also renorted ERitIAcA vas involved in the sale o

arms to Cuban revolutionaries in 1055. Although RI was un-

able to locate the report, it was classified to Manolo MY's

201 file. This nould tend

co support the ooza claim tha

Arcos in obtaining his freedom but admitted

with him in prisoa.

b.

Ray is interested in expanding his

propaganda radio broadcasts.

He spoke in terus

of renting time on a U.S. short wave station

to beam broadcasts to Cuba.

This would be

done at his own expense.

He also mentioned

ithat during Roid's former administration in

the Dominican Republic he had been promised

a site and permission to sot up a short wave

station for Cuban broadcasts.

He may explore

his possibility with Balaguer's present

overnment during one of his business trip:

to the D.R.

I suggested he sound out other

stations in L.A, to see if he could get some

free time and replay for his Puerto Rican

material and have sinco mailed him via

AMBADGER'a list of stations in L.A, who are

known

to have accepted and used other Cuban

tape broadcasts.

HEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meetings with Manolo Ray, San Juan, Puerto Rico

and 15 October 1966

MIG-21--Defecting Pllot--et al.

1.

In lengthy discussions on this point it developed

that Ray has been unable to obtain any more pertinent infor-

nation sinco he first called the matter to AMBADGER's

attention almost two months ago.

Tho basis of the "Hig

Plot"

1s & tip

he received from an inside contact which was

brought to him

by someone exiting cuba.

Ray has not been able to determine if the inside contact

or can arrange contact, with the

Mig Pilot who reportedly is fed up with the situation in

Cuba and plans to defect with his airplane whenever he hay

The "tip" Ray received was to this effect

1.c., that there is a Mig Pllot who is disenchanted and

plans to defect with his plane. One point Ray was specific

on was that the plane was described as "one of the smaller

Migs" and according to Ray 1t 1s not a N1g-21.

2.

After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this

subject (wherein the plane was apparently erroneously

identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims he sent a message to the

inside .contact requesting the complete details-we had asked

for.

He has received no reply.

In response to my request

at the meting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting on

15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was

unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continue until he reached the party and to obtain as much

detail on this

matter as possible so we could hopefully

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow-through

on this and report to AMBADGER.

(It seemed pretty obvious to

me after two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

the "Mig

Plot"

and consequently may never be able to verify

the original

"tip" and obtain further details.

NENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

Personal Situation:

in san Juan high ane sires insand pla ding office

a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the

publicity business.

RAY said he just signed a

contract for the planning of a commercial develop-

ment site in San Juan,

from which he will realize

several thousand dollars profit.

His principal

(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to

raise through private funds the financing of a

plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing

designed by him. He claims with an investment of

$200,000 he can

mass produce prefabricated homes to

sell

for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto

Rico's needs.

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo

was strictly for business purposes.

He hopes to

start a small project in Santo Domingo to produce

prefabricated housing.

The small project he has

in mind can get underway with an expenditure of

$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised

in Santo Domingo.

He said he naturally talked with

some people in the government about Cuba and the

JURE, but that the government must become stronger

and more confident before there would be any possi-

bility of obtaining their assistance--or blessing-- •

in conducting any activities against Cuba.

Internal Contacts.

d.

One gets the impression that RAY lives

somewhat removed from the actual realitiesd the

•Cuban

internal situation.

He has a tendency to

compare

the

internal situation today with that

which existed in Batista's time when he (RAY) was

one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground

resistance

movement in Habana. RAY maintains

direct personal contact with many new arrivals

seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

and also undoubtedly receives a certain amount of

general information and gossip from other JURE

contacts and supporters.

He claims to have many

friends and former associates inside, which is

probably true, but does not have any regular or

secure means to communicate with them.

It appears

obvious .that these friends and contacts are not

working together, if at, all, and that he has no

cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities

such as Carlos Franqui, Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,

specific information

at all

on their activities in recent months but said he

In summary on this

point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-

tain no regular contact with any internal "supporters":

that he undoubtedly still has many former friends

and supporters inside but just what they would do--

far they would go--to support him is a moot

The program is composed without cost

Future Plans.

t.

MY is a man who is relared,

is now engaged

in making a

lexitimate Ilvelihood for hirself, his

wife and three childron but still seriously dedi-

cated and motivated towards secking thi overthrow

of the castro government.

He has a realistic outlook

to a considerable dogree, although as mentioned in

paragraph d., above, his viewpoints on the reality

of the internal situation in present day Cuba aro

somewhat naive.

As an experienced resistance organizer

and fighter in the 20th of July moronent against

Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing

the veneral populace for resistance.

Me also knows

that propaganda is useless and counterproductive

without follow-up positive results.

He speaks of

continuing his local radio broadcasts (which ho

readily admits are useful only to maintain some

spirit amongst the oxiles for possible future use),

and at some

later dato--he has no timetable--hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or

some other site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba.

His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with

action.

He speaks avain of clandestine entry into

Cuba himself

to contact sources within, prove to

that there is a resistance movement, and i

a nucleus for later action.

le openly admits

the blunder of his last "publicized" return and that

if it is done again it must be completely clandestine

unannounced.

He seems to have no fear of returning

and claims he still has plenty of friends who would

hide and help him.

He made an off-hand reference to

furnishing him assistance to enter clan-

destinely at some future date.

He was told that his

in Miami surely knew of several'faaily run"

successfully to Cuba

if and when he was ready to return.

Financial Situation.

•RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his

local business.

RAY plans to travel to the U.S. inerly November for

about two weeks and said he would visit JURE representatives

in several large cities, including D.C. He will be in touch

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY A FiLe

1. During a briel IDY stopover at Headquarters on 23 August 1966,

QUSPORT -I said he had talked with Manolo RAY in San Juan, Puerto Rico

on 22 August.

According to QUSPORT-I, RAY had no additional pertinen

information cancern hir all sped inside contact or hi i recent meeting

inside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepare

o assigt him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-l, however

who the people were or where they are located.

2. RAY told QUSPORT-I that he wanted very much to see the writer

concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT -1

RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious

to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not

mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was

flying.

Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with

the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with

his airplane. RAY told QUSPORT he wanted to discuss the matter with the

He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value

to the U.S, because of the recent access to a MIG-2l in Isreal but that it

would have tremendous propaganda value if a Cuban pilot defected and

brought out a MIG. He said he particularly wanted to discuss the matter

with the writer because if the operation were successful he did not want

Manuel Artime and the MRR or any other exile group taking credit. He

wanied to make sure that he and his group received all the propaganda

advantage which he would in turn expluit internally as further evidence to

his supporters inside that the JURE was active on the island. RAY in the

latter part oi the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT -1

was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the

writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with

AMBADGER. (AMBADGER is the man who was recently introduced to RAY

in San Juan by Harry Mahoney as the man who would insure that any

intormation RAY wanted passed to the Agency would reach them.) @USPORT.

told RAY that if he did not receive a phone call from him before the evening

of 20 August he should give AMBADGER all the details.

3. I told QUSPORT lu plure RAY and assure him that I wanted

him so jrass all the details to AWBADGER even though according lo

CUSPORT-l's arrangement this was nut necessary. QUSPORT-I was

unable, hoverer, to reach RAl by phone during the afternoon of

20 August.

Abour 8 p. 1. on 20 lugust I received a collect phone call

from AMBADGER from San Juan. AMBADGER was very excitea and

said he had to see me right away. liter he settled down a bit he told

me he had just left RAY and his dro locsl lieutenants Emilio GUEDE

and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE). He said

RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility

of defecting a Cuban MIG pilot and having him bring out his plane. In

essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were

substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT-l earlier in

the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and

further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

Who was pressing AMBADGER to see me. He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night. I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in

the next few days and that further there were a few basic facts I needed

to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation.

I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine

the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.

b. Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MIG he flys.

d. RAY's commo if any with the pilot.

.. Estimated timing ior the defection, 1. e.. has the pilo

ndicated he was ready to defect and awaiting instructions,

et c.

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further

information. AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RAY

following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he

did not know the name of the pilot or other details of the operation. (See

Mr. Mahoney's meino attached)

NENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI:

Meeting with AMBANG-1, 28 April 1966

On 28 April 1966 the undersigned, usiny

the engel sheraton in san duan,

Puerto Rico. The tollowing

points were discussed,

in addition to matters perraining to

a projected

meeting of Cuban exiles, covered in a separate

AMBANG seemed much less aggressive than

when I used to talk to him a year and a hall ago.

He seemed dispirited about the exiles and (lietr

chances of ever doing anything to settle affairs

in Cuba.

The exiles do not seen to have any plans

for doing much of anything.

AMBANG-1 agreed that

the overthrow of Castro will probably come from the

inside, and that the exiles will have little

influence on the move that accomplishes it.

feels this is not all to the bad since, as le says,

there are a number of good men in Cuba in important

posts who have

golten sucked bit by bit into support

of communism but

are really not conmunists,

him I believed the US would probably be willing to

such persons if they achieved the overthrow

of the regime and that the US would probably oppose

a wave of vengeance against "decent revolutionaries".

I told him this because I thought there wis some

chance he might spread It about and the word might

"decent revolutionaries" in CubA.

In general, AHBANG-1 had less information

purge situation than I did.

He told me that

relatives of Gustavo ARCOS (201-205568) In Puerto Rico

had been in telephone contact with the family inside

Cuba about 25 April, that Arcos was as of that

Jate still

in prison but the charges against him

were thin and it was hoped he would be out in a

few days.

This means there was at least one

nore telephone call than we knew of previously,

and this has probably

served to increase the

pressure on Arcos).

I asked AMBANG-1 if his

contact with Arcos

in late 1964 might not

have

been responsibie for the arrest. AMBANG-1 said

he did not think so.

We talked some about the

symbolic value of the Arcos family and I expressed

a strong interest in Arcos's selfare and in getting

the latest news about him.

I did this on the

chance that AMRANG-1 might assume Arcos had been

cur agent

and we were concerned about him.

I do

not know if he will actually construe my remark in

this way, however, but it seemed like an opening

to use an important exile channel as a possible

deception mechanism.

AMBANG said he does not

believe there is any truth to the charge of financial

dishonesty levelled against Arcos.

AMBANG stated that Pedro Miret (201-169120)

not get his throat cut in the progress.

I expressed

a great deal of interest in Miret, asking especially

why he should have been selected to make two recent

trips. to Moscow.

AMBANG did not have any idea.

aised the subject of Miret, again, to put him into

the exile rumor mill as a person of special interest

to the US, and thus to flesh out some of the other

parts of

h. Armando Hart (201-222675), according to

AMBANG, does not have the qualities of an adminis-

trator but he is very good at situating himself

politically,

organiziny politically and, in general,

and dealing.

He is NOT under his wife's

thumb, as many say.

AMBANG regards Hart as a much

more decent

person than Aragones and to be well placed

in Aragone's old job because he does not have

notoriously close

connections with'any of the

personalities or factions within the 26th

crowd but gets along with them all.

Concerning the differences between the city

sierra fighters

in the 26th of July,

AMBANG stated

they are real and that the city group fought and

suffered much more.

• J...

AMBANG believes this is not the time for the

US or exiles to make menacing gestitues against Cuba,

for this would merely provide Castro with distractions

from internal problems and perhaps enable him to rally

popular support.

I believe that later in the summer it might be a good

idea to have another talk with AMBANG to keep up with exile

thinking, and feeding more deception thoughts.

Field Comment: Tho position of. JURE within the Cuban exile

connunity was

weakened after Ray tailed to keop his widely-

publicizod promise to land in Cuba by 20 May 1964.

Since then

tho organization has been clatively inactive.

Recontly Ray

has been making an effoit to again establish a strong JURE.

On

22 May 1965 he gave a lecture in Miami to JUR! delegates from

Tampa,

Orlando,

and Miami, in which he stressed the need to

raise

money for the

organization.

The foeling

of some member's

who attended tho lecture

was that it was rather late to

start

asking people to contribute money

to the JURE.

A meeting of

delegates

of the

JURE was held in Tampa, Florida, from 3

to

5 July 1965

to discuss the program and

future plans of the JUre.

On 5 and 6 July Ray hold discussions with representatives of

called on liu 1n April ane inquired as to the laster's ability to tura

senting Coumunicationg Specialtles,

and asked 1f (this FBI) source could

about 1,000 silencers, for use on 9 m machina pistols, and

Subject also made refarence to some vague

MENORANDUN FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Communication from AUBANG, 29 March 1965

AMBING (A) phoned (collect) from Puerto. Rico

on 29

Narch 1965.

He said that the selzure

of arms being

manufactured for

his organization by the ERQUIAGA Manu-

facturing Company in the los Angeles area of California

was very damaging to his plans.

He said there nere some

493

submachine guns being manufactured by this company.

20

of these are for replacements for possibly defectire guns.

He said each

weapon is marked with a special mark and a

serial number which will make them attributable to his

organization.

lie further said that the runs were paid for

except. for $9000. Erquiaga left California about a month

ago with the job unfinished, and A said that they had been

negotiating with Erquiaga's partner.

He did not give the

name of this individual.

He said that there was some ques-

tion as to how much was

owed

had

on the arms, but that the partner

agreed

on the

$9000 figure.

2. A asked

if we could arrange to have the arms released.

I said that I would have to look into the legal

aspects of the problem since the question of the title and

the charges under which they sere confiscated would have to

be clarified.

I pointed out to A that if the title had not

yet passed to him despite his payments, and if the charges

which the arms were seized are valid, he might have no

than a civil suit against the Erquiaga Company

to recover the money paid.

A was very insistent that he must have those specific

because of

the markings and the importance of the

psychological effect that these would create.

5.

I asked how long he would be in Puerto Rico and he

said he would remain a week or ten days.

I told him that I

could not give him

an answer at

this time,

and it was agreed

he would phone me again on Thursday, 1 April.

6.

Immediately after this conversation, I contacted

I. Mayo Stunz in 00,

who agreed to query his los Angeles

office immediately to find out the legal status of the

seizure.
