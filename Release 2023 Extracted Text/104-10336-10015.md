Mr. Donald E. Welzenbach

830 Mississippi Avenue

Davenport, Iowa 52803

Dear Mr. Welzenbach:

I am writing you on behalf of the Assassination Records Review Board, an independent

Federal Agency established pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination

Records Collection Act, 44 U.S.C. § 2107 (Supp. V 1994). The Review Board, whose

members are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, is charged with

the responsibility of collecting records and information related to the assassination of

President Kennedy. Review Board members and staff are required by law to possess

Top Secret, SCI clearances. The Review Board is not seeking to reach any conclusions

regarding the assassination, but is primarily concerned with identifying, clarifying,

locating, and making available assassination records. I am enclosing some explanatory

material about the Review Board and its mandate.

Also enclosed is an excerpt from the book Skunk Works, by Ben Rich and Leo Janos,

which refers to Lockheed's preparation of four sets of falsified U-2 technical manuals at

the request of Richard Bissell of the CIA. It is our understanding that while working as

a CLA historian, you wrote the first history of the U-2 for that agency. We would like

very much to discuss this subject with you, and believe that your past in-depth

knowledge of the U-2 may assist the ARRB in our attempts to clarify the historical

record in this area. I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this letter to Mr. John

Pereira, of the Historical Review Group, Center for the Study uf Intelligence, Central

Intelligence Agency, Washington, D.C., 20505. To the extent that you feel discussing

this subject with the Review Board would constitute disclosure of any information that

is still classified, we would be happy to initiate a discussion between you and the

appropriate officials at the CIA to address any concerns you may have.

Sometime in the near future a member of the Review Board staff will be calling you to

establish a mutually agreeable time for a telephonic interview to discuss certain aspects

of the U-2 program. Should you wish to call us first in response to this letter, please ask

BOARD MEMBERS: John R. Tunheim, Chair • Henry F. Graff • Kermit L. Hall • William L. Joyce • Anna K. Nelson

OVERFLYING RUSSIA

153

The next thing we tried was something called a Salisbury

screen, a metallic grid applied to the airplane's undercarriage

in the hope of deflecting incoming radar beams, but it worked

only at some frequencies and altitudes and not at others.

Kelly thought it was more practical to try special iron fer-

rite paints that would absorb a radar ping rather than

bounce it back to the sender. The paints were moderately ef-

fective but inhibited heat dissipation through the airframe's

outer skin and we experienced overheating engine problems.

But the paint lowered the radar cross section by one order of

magnitude, so we decided to give it a try. We called these

specially painted airplanes "dirty birds" and shipped the first

one out for flight testing in April 1957. Our test pilot, Bob

Sieker, took the U-2 up to over seventy thousand feet and

suddenly radioed that he was experiencing rapid airframe

heat buildup. Moments later his engine blew out and the face-

plate blew off Bob's oxygen mask as his pressure suit in-

stantly inflated. The U-2 dove straight down and crashed. It

took us three days to locate the wreckage and Bob's body. An

autopsy revealed that above seventy thousand feet he had

suffered acute hypoxia and lost consciousness in only ten

seconds. The culprit that killed him was a defective faceplate

clasp that cost fifty cents.

The CIA was so desperate to buy time for these Soviet over-

flights that Bissell got Kelly to sequester four of our test flight

engineers and have them write a bogus flight manual for a U-2

twice as heavy as ours and with a maximum altitude of only

fifty thousand feet that carried only scientific weather gear in

its bay. The manual included phony instrument panel photos

with altered markings for speed, altitude, and load factor

limits. Four copies were produced and then artificially aged

with grease, coffee stains, and cigarette burns. How or if the

agency got them into Soviet hands only Mr. B knew, and he

never told.

Barry,

Per our meeting earlier this week, I called Lockheed security today and discussed the Board's interest in learning what U.2

records Lockheed might have and how they might be searched if Lockheed were to look for records on "the" manual. The security

officer I talked to, Roy Kidd, said he suspected it would be looking for a needle in the haystack, but he wouldn't know without doing some

checking around. He will get back to me. In the meantime, you may pass on the names of the two points of contact, Roy Kidd or Jim

Ghezzi, both at 805-572-4379 (commercial line).

If the Board wants to deal with Lockheed through me, I'll help them do this. If they want to deal directly with Lockheed, that's

fine, too….. I would just ask that you and be kept informed. I told Lockheed the same thing.

Would you mind faxing to me the page from the Ben Rich book? I seem to have temporarily misplaced my copy. My open fax is

-703.482-6350, Thanks.

FAX'd 413/97.

Re: Status of CLA Responses to Assassination Records Review Board's Requests for

Additional Information and Records

Dear John:

I am writing to follow-up on our telephone call earlier today and to convey my serious

concern about the status of CIA's responses to the Review Board's requests for

additional information and records. Although CLA has completed its responses to

several requests, and many others have been answered in part, a significant number of

requests have not been answered - including some that were made more than two

years ago. On many occasions we have been assured that responses would be

forthcoming, only to have promised dates come and go without answers. It is now

extremely important that these requests be answered promptly so that we may conduct

a proper follow-up if necessary. The issues that we can now identify as being of the

highest priority are identified in the text below by double asterisks (**) and we request

that they be answered within the next month. We request that the remaining requests

be answered by April 1, 1998.

The remainder of this letter is divided into two parts: first, a listing of the formal

requests for information and records, and second, a listing of the informal requests for

information and records. Please let me know if your understanding of any of the

following points differs from ours so that we can resolve any potential discrepancies.

'As identified more fully below, the issues are: CIA-1 Organizational Material,

CIA-6 Cables and Dispatches, CIA-13 Backchannel Communications, CLA-IR-03

HTLINGUAL Documents, CIA-IR-04 Disposition of Angleton Files, CIA-IR-07 Claude

Barnes Capehart, CLA-IR-15 Electronic "take" from Mexico City, CIA-IR-21 DRE

Monthly Operational Reports, CIA-IR-22 "A" Files on Clay Shaw and Jim Garrison.

Review Board staff continues to review these indexes. The DS&T should

continue to search for OSP files.

plots. The Review Board will provide possible search query suggestions from

the 1967 IG Report.

The Review Board has requested orally information about a particular DO office.

Since January 1997, CIA has had no response and no time frame for a response.

of the following people and organizations. The results of the searches should be

documented. Once formal documentation of the completed searches has been

provided, the request is complete.
