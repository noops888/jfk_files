MEMORANDUM FOR:

DD/PTOS

SUBJECT

Security Support During

President Nixon's Visit

I. I have received numerous and highly complimentary com-

ments from the Director, the Executive Director and the Acting

Deputy Director for Support for the role this Office played during the

Visit of President Nixon to the Agency on 7 March 196%.

In addition,

Mr. Don Gautreau, the Secret Service Agent responsible for protec-

tive measures during the visit, told me that he had never met a more

highly professional group of personnel than our Security officers.

He was impressed with the comprchensive coverage inherent in our

protective measures.

Our performance on Friday was smooth, efficient and

effective and once more is a tribute to our ability to rise to any

occasion. This is possible only because of the quality of the effort

put forth by each Security Officer who participated. I am very proud

of all of you and I would like to particularly commend Jim Mccord,

Bill Wilkinson and Jim Greene for the work they did in planning our

role in the ceremonies.

Equally impressive was the periormance of

Hollis Whitaker and his people in the provision of audio coverage of

the event.

3. I would like to have copies of this memorandum placed in

the oificial Personnel File of every individual who participated in

making this event such a great success.
