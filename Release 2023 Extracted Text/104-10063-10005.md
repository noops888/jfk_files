APPENDIX 16

Kennedy Jerome FREDERICK - student, SGWU

FREDERICK, a West Indian, arrived in Canada in August

1967 to attend university at ScuU.

FREDERICK is a member of the

militant Negro movement at the University and advocates violence.

He is considered by some parties to be extremely dangerous and

capable of drastic actions.

He was active in organizing the

occupation or the Computer Center at SGwU and was one of those

arrested during the riot.

Maurice HALPERIN - Professor, SFU

HALPERIN was born on 3 March 1906 at Boston, Massachusetts

and entered Canada in the spring of 1y68.

In late 1953 he left the

United States for Mexico in order to avoid testifying before a

United States Senate internal sub-committee:

in 1958, when the

Mexican Government began deporting United states Communists,

HALPirIN went to the Soviet Union, and became a visiting professor

at the U.s.S.r. Academy of Sciences.

Lyoz as a protessor of Economy at the University of ravana,

he remained employed until coming to Canada.

He went to Cuba in Uctober

where

He is currently

employed with the Faculty of Education, Behavioural Science

Foundation, at Simon Fraser University.

As noted above, Laughlin

Bernard CURKIE lobbied very hard to have HALPERIN accepted by

Simon Fraser University. CURRIE was aware of HALPERIN's background

and "watered it down" to get him the appointment.

Of particular interest in this case is the fact that

CURRIE and HALPERIN were associated with the same espionage group

in the United States.

His application for landed status vas

of the SU at SFU, consists of left-wing activists in this

category.

Martin LONEY, who was one of the student leaders

during the SFU incident, entered Canada as a British citizen in

August 1966. Dr. Thomas Burton BOTTOMORE, a leading Marxist

and author on Marxism as well as a British citizen, took up

employment at SFU in 1965 as head of the Department of Political

science, sociology and anthropology (roA

BOTTOMORE, as head of

the PSA, was responsible for the hiring of Kathleen ABERLE, a

British

citizen, and of Thomas Harold BROSE, John William Carl

LEGGETT, Mathan POPKIN and Martin NICOLAUS, all U.S. citizens.

Although the largest concentration of foreign radicals

other activists did take positions in

ot eru epartments I these reluded Sidney COONTZ, Michael Allan

LEBOwITh, Paul baward Ivort, and Maurice HALPERIN, all U.S.

citizens, and Laughlin Bernard CURRIE, a citizen of Colombia.

Mordecai BRIEMBERG, who took over as head of the PSA

Department after BOTTOMORE tendered his resignation in 1967, has

expressed a desire to remain as Department head in order to

keep

his hand in on the hiring.

In this regard, Gerald SPERLING iS,

through BRIEMBERG, making efforts to get Malcolm sauverse an Americar

Marxist university professor who apparently worked for the Communist

underground in Italy during the early 1960's, into SFU.

Professor Donald E. EPSTEIN of the Political Science

Department at the University of Waterloo, an American citizen

described as a draft dodger and an SDS member prior to his arrival

in Canada in 1967, as previously indicated, has been active in

organizing and directing students in tactics and methods by which

they could take physical possession of university buildings.

EPSTEIN, who has been active in student power activities at

Waterloo, has apparently been refused tenure at that University

and there are indications that activist students intend to challenge

the administration in this regard.

Professor Norman STRAX,

an American who was employed

as an Assistant Professor o1 Physics at the University of New

Brunswick, precipitated the crisis at that University.

STRAX was

instrumental in the fornation and activities of the SDS branch at

chat point.

specific foreigners living in Canada.
