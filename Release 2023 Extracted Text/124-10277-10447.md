Reference is made to previous information furnished

you concerning captioned anti-Castro organisetion,

Recently, a source who has furnished insufficient

information to evaluate his zeliability advised thet

Orlando-Bosch Avila, head of MIRR, is making plane to use

an airstrip, not yet selected, in the Bahamas for the purpose

of carrying out raids against Cuba. Two of Bosch's men,

Jesus Sanchez Martinez and (flist name unknown) Conzalez,

will be transported by a fast speedboat to this airstrip

along with about one dozen homemade impact bombs constructed

by Sanchez. An airplane which will be piloted by an unidentified

American reportedly is scheduled to rendezvous on the Bahana

Island with Sanchez and Gonzalez, both of whon will accompany

the American pilot on two consecutive bombing raids, spaced

one or two days apart, for the purpose of dropping bombs on

sugar centrals in the Oriente Province of Cuba.

The source stated that the date of the raid has

not yet been set. The speedboat will be brought from Mlami,

Florida, to some location north of Miami end then will depart

under cover of darkness for the Bahanas.

The plane is scheduled

to depart from its Bahamian airstrip at about 3 a.t. for Cuba

so that the attack can be made during the early hours of dawn.

The same source further advised that Bosch has

also entered into a secret pact with Alpha 66, an anti-Castro

organization hondguartered in Miami, to attack a British freighter

carrying equipment to Cube. This attack reportedly will be

I RELEASE IN PART

Reurairtel 6/9/64 with enclosures. Pornish the pertinent

information transmitted in your 6/9/64 airtel to the appropriate

Bahanian authorities. Keep Bureau, Interested agencies and

Bahanian authorities currently advised of all pertinent developments

LOLE:

MIRR, anti-Castro organization, has been involved in

carpying out raids against Cuba, some of which have been tarted

by U.S. authorities. On three previous occasions, plans, boats,

equipment, bombs and personnel have been seized by Custons authori-

cies.

In connection with a previous plan to attack Cuba, Departuent,

in April, 1964, specifically advised it was requesting Customs,

Federal Aviation Agency and Coast Guard to take all possible

measures to prevent the attack. As recently as May 12, 1964,

Customs seized a homemade torpedo which was scheduled to be used

in a MIRR attack against a Cuban vessel. This attack failed to

materialize.

Information has now been received indicating that MIRR

is planning new attack against Cuba.

This attack reportedly entails

use of airstrip in the Bahanas from which two consecutive bombing

raids will be launched directed against Cuban sugar installations.

Plans are being made in U. S. and material to be utilized in raid

will be transported from U. S. to the Bahamas. EMIRR has previously

used islands in the Bahamas as base fron which to launch such

attacks and we have previously advised Baharan authorities of these

activities sku

MIRR leader reportedly has also entered into secret pact

with Alpha 66, Miami anti-Castro organization,[to attack British

freighter carrying equipment to Cuba. Reportedly, this attack

will also be made from Bahamas at some future time following

completion of current glang lu)

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

Previous investigation has reflected that dr.

Orlando (Bosch Avila, head of the MIRR, an anti-Castro organ-

Ization at Mian,

was compelled to abandon plans for an

attack'

upon the "Las Villas", a Cuban freighter, when this

vessel recently avoided the east coast of South

Florida on a

voyage from Marseilles, France, to Havana, Cube, This ship

departed Marseilles on May 4, 1964, and was scheduled to dock

In Havana on May 25, 1964.

On May 26, 1964, MM I-1, a Cuban exile who is

friendly with some of Bosch's close associates, advised that

Bosch has begun to lay new plans for another attack against

Cuba.

Current Investigation

May 28p 1964, MM T-1 reported that on May 27,

1964, Jesus banchez/Martinez, who 18 also known as "Mimi",

and Evelio Alpizar Perez, associates of Bosch, went to

JU:

MIRR operation. MM I-1 said that Sanchez and Alpizar were

transported from Miami to Orlando, and return, by an American,

age about 47, 5'g" tall, weighing 180 pounds, black andigray:

hair, known only as "Otis", and a friend of Bosch.

"Otis"

was accompanied by his wife or girl friend, named "Carole".

MM I-I said Bosch decided against renting either of these

planes at Orlando, both of which were owned by a medical

doctor, because of exorbitant rental fees demanded.
