2. Ey 5 July 1956, the fourth fligat, the USSR was aware

of tice purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.

One positive action was the standaow of civil flights mile the

mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action which is

believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraft inio Erst

Germany and Poland on 7 July 1955. Also MIG-19's were noved

into Hungary at about this time.

3. The perfomance of the Soviet system on the 5 July mission,

was indeed curious.

procably surmised that the 5 July mission was headed jor Moscow when

the track appeared on a northeasterly heading.

The loss of the

target when it entered Soviet territory was probably deliberate and

"red herring" track returning to the west was either a dodge

or a convenience to avoid brosicasting a track for all the system

to see that a "hostile or intruder" as coming over loscow with no

means available to stop it.

This idea is supported by the use

of a raid nunber assigned in the region just beyond the point

were the track had been "lost".

In addition,

the track wes not

labelad "hostile or intruder" when it vas broadcast after it

had passed beyond Hioscow.

The reporting of the track when it did

appear was caly by Moscow and it has been suggested tot otber

stations had been instructed not to broadcast the track.

Further, iù noT

02 Iay not be a coincidence that the heigat broacast was alnost

exactly balf of the true altitude of the mission aircrait, but on

the sext nissions, four days later, the altitude reporting was

consistently above 50, 000 feet.

By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recognition of

the great height of the mission flights, tracking as better and

in gezeral the performance of the warning systen was much improved.

The next day. 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning

systen closed a 3000 mile track with only two shori periods oi

confusion or track loss.

Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet

with one plot rassed 68,800 which was only 100 feet off target.

The first eight missions proved that the air defense warning

systen is deployed in dopth.

This was evident fro both the continuity

of track and nost forcefully fron the ELITT date collecied. Some

intercepts of Soviet Bloc radars opsrating in the 3000 Ic/s band were

ostined by project ErIiT as follows:

These nunbers cannot be equated to in-

dividual radar sets since the same radar nay be intercepted more than
