fine performance as a conscientious, hard working

and. thoughtful records manager and

registry supervisor.

The CCS registry workload

rèmains".at about the same level as

préviously reported, and Mr. Woods regularly works an hour or so of uninterrupted over-

time every working day personally reorganizing procedures, cleaning out, consolidating.

and rettring files. His entusiastic determination in reducing the numbers of out-of

date and no longer useful files is most exemplary.

Knowing the numbers of primary and

supplemental files involved in this exercise, and as a retiring supervisor, d can only

wish him "good luck"!

Mr. Woods also continues eager to learn and use new methods and techniques.

In this

As could be expected from

even a casual reading of his past fitness reports, Mr. Hoods quickly took hold, and

Despite the

redistributing employee workloads. He also reorganized the placement of file machtne-

n% desks, and service counter to achteve greater employee comfort and effictency in

the utilization of personnel. Although his task as Staff Security Officer is a

secundary function, he also reorganized, simplified and re-wrote the securfty check

and duty officer roster procedures.

He then reviewed, downgraded, and retired approximately 350 Top Secret docu-

completion of this there was not one Top Secret document on the Branch. He devised,

gained approval from FI/D, and carried out a new procedure for the downgrading of

TYLOTE material from Top Secret to Secret so that it could be retired. He retired

approximately 60 Project, 25 Subject, and fifty 201 files. He surveyed the Commu-

This employee continues to be Chief of the Station Registry.

During the past year

his level of performance can be properly evaluated as exceptionahy proficient. He

continues to welcome hard work, is not bothered by constantly changing deadlines

and is able to fill in for any absent member of his unit, and keep up his own work

as well. He is quite conscious of the value of Government personnel and materiel,

and does everything in his power to conserve these resources. He continues to come

up with new ideas on how to perform his functions in a more efficient and effective

manner. This results in benefits to the entire Station. It is regretable that the

position this employee fills does not allow for promotion since he has been periorming

at a level above his present grade for several years.

He has abundant energy and constantly comes up with ideas for the improvement

of the efficiency of his unit..

He welcomes hard work and is able to fill in and

take over any job in his unit and keep up with his own dutles as well. As a

supervisor, he has a slight tendency to be arbitrary when convinced he is right.

This may be due to the fact that the Registry frequently operates under conditions

of pressure due to the recent reorganization, reduction, and relocation of the

Station. The Station has been required to get the job done with fewer people and

under more difficult working conditions.

DDP/OP

Request for Quality Step Increase

for MT. James S. Woods, GS-09

l On the basis of the information presented below. it is recommended

that a Quality Step Increase be approved for

Mr. Jamos S. Woods"

Mr. Woods entered on duty with the Agency in April 1052 as a GS-03.

Records and File Clerk assigned to RID. Since that time Mr. Woods has

served as a Records Analyst at Headquarters, in Koroa and Atsugi, Manila,

and since 1961 in the Central Registry Section of the Tokyo Station.

Mr. Woods is 37 years old and has been in grade as a GS-0D sinco 1958.

3. Mr. Woods' exceptional performance is described by the Tokyo

Station as follows:

"A. Mr. Woods is don on his second tour as Chief of thee Tokyo

Station Registry. This unit is lounted at

and handles

all corréspondence for all Station elements.

In view of the fact that

the Station is locate

deal of responsibility is given to Mr. Woods to ensure that action

responsibility on incoming cables is rapidly and properly assigned,

dispatches are correctly routed and processed, correspondence from

other local military agencies is correctly analyzed and routed, te

twice-a-day courier system is tunctioning criectively, and the Station

flexowriter is rapidly churning out priority disputch traffic.

•"B. The Registry is persently composed of six employers in

addition to Mr. Woods, who is Chief of this unit. Mr. Woods does

an exemplary job in supervising these employees with the result

that the Station Registry is a smooth and well-functioning unit.

"C. In audition to his normal duties, Mr. Woods is constantly

thinking of ways to increase the efficiency of the Station Kegletry,

32ú to be of greater assistance to the Station as a whole. Several of

his ideas have been adopted by the Station with a resulting increase

in effectiveness.

His positive approach to all problems and his

cheerfulness and willingnesy to perform any task have benefited

both the Station and the Agençy.

"D. In view of Mr. Woods' demonstrated ability to provide

leadership to the Station Registry unit, his positive approach to

the solution of the many problems which daily beset this unit,

it is strongly recommended that he be promoted from GS-09 to

Gs-10 at the carliest opportunity."

* Mr. Woods has contiriuod to perform in an over-all "Strong".

manner as indicated in his recent fitness report. He recently planned

and effectively implemented the move of the Cable Secretariat from one

location to another. In a dispatch, dated 22 November 1965, the present

Chief ot Station, Tokyo, stated, "There is little I can add to my prede-

cessor's recommendation, dated 9 November 1964, for promotion of

Mr. Woods.

He is performing his duties as Chief of the Tokyo Station

Registry with efficiency and dispatch. He is a strong supervisor who

constautly strives to achieve the maximum economy in the use of his

personnel and materials."

Consideration had bren given to the granting of in Honor and

Merit Avard to Mr. Woods, but in this particular case it appears that

a Quality Step Incronise is more appropriate.
