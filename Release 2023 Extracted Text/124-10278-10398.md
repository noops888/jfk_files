Previous information has indicated that the

captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carty out

a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.

The airplane scheduled to be used in the raid is located

at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

On December 18, 1963, our source in this matter

who has furnished reliable information in the past advised

that a practice flight in the Aero Commander airplane,

number 126243, Located at the above mentioned airport and

scheculed to be used on the raid, was to be made on December 19,

1963, and that a final practice flight was scheduled to be made

on December 20, 1963. No practice flight will be made over

Bimini as Charles Bush, the owner of the airplane, is opposed

to it for security reasons.

Orlando Bosch Avila, head of the captioned orgenization,

plans to have a quantity of propaganda leaflets dropped from

the airplane during the raid over Cube. Bosch and his

associates have described a boat to be used in this operation

as being 28 feet long with a bridge on top. With reference to

this boat, our source has learned that William Johnson,

United States citizen, pilot and businessman who was involved

in arranging for the airplane to be used on this raid, is

also involved in arranging for the use of the above-mentioned

boat.
