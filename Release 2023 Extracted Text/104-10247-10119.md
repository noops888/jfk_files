AWWHIP/l stated further that AMLASH had decided that he should

like to have the meeting in Rone and that it should take place

sometime before the ind of January (since it 1s now known that .

ANBIDDY intends to go to Europe during the first part of the

week of the l8th, Its quite possible the neeting will take

place during the week of the 18thy WHIP said that he would

not have an unlimited amount of time this time to be in Europe.

We sald we understood this and told AWHIP that "Nick" (N.

Sanchez) Ilkewise could only devote 3 or 4 days to European

meetings. It was agreed, therefore, that for the best

utilization of both men's time, they should coordinate their

travels to Europe.

3. Silencer: AMWHIP opened this subject by saying that

he wanted to get something off his mind even though he was

aware that we were always reluctant to discuss this subject.

He stated that he would be able to get a silencer for a

subject with "Nick'

for discussion between AMLASH and AUBIDDY. AJWHIP/1 stated

that he understood our position on this point. He then pro-

ceeded on the other subjects.

4. ANLASH'3: In response to a request from Will 'SA'CI

(Tansing) we brought up

the subject of AXLASH'3, In summary,

AlWHIP did not have anything to add to his ploture of AMLASH 3

that he has not already discussed previously with v. Sanchez.

However, for the record we sill Include a summary of our con-

versationg

AMLASH '3 for many years,

(since school days) but did not

consider him to be a close friend. He knew ASLASH '3'S

family as he had sold jewelry to them from time to time

during the Batista era in Havana. ASHHIP'I belleved

AMLASH'3 had been associated with the University but had

not actually been a bonafied student. He knew nothing

else about ANLASH'3's educational background. AMLASH'3

Lad known AA$ 2 sor 10 or 12 years. It was the opinion

OR ASNHTP'1 that AMASH'3 was "100% loyal to AMiA"

It further stated that aside from his rather strong interest

In Ilquor and attendant belligerency when drunk, AMLASH'3

was

not open to corruption through financial inducement

or other matertal rewards. He stated that AMLASH 3 WaS VInE

ready rather involved with Ship", and his plotting, nad

acted as driver,

* dire recent caching of arms by ALASH/O In

'Acef's)rarehouse outside Havana. (Acef'» according

to ANNHIP '1; EIRAX*ULASHXI,; has become extremely nervous as

result of his participation la the AULASH planning and has, In

fact, recently resigned his position as flajor of Marianzo) He

wants to return to the study of medicine and to complete his

work for an l.D. degree. He pointed out to AlWHlP'1, and he

agreed with us, that such action would not particularly serve

to add any protection to(Acel's)position, but possibly would

merely call more attention to vdiiian.)

He attempted

to explore the details of ASLASHl 3's re-

crultment for subsequent dispatch lo Spain by the DSI. ANNHIP

stated that he had given this infornation to, he believed,

both "Nick" and to Growery in Europe.. He knew the man who

had recruited Blanco in Cuba as being a notorious DST

operator. He could not recall the aar but stated he had

provided it before on a previous occasion. He did not

know any of the details of AULISH 3's activation in ladrid

or of his contact with Luis Nanuel CANTILLO TOROIC. ANWHIP

I sald be was avare fif only of the fact that ALASH/S had

& been in the company Off"Luls Nanuel". AWHIP'I, however,

offered to elicit as much information as possible about the

AMLASH '3 CANTILLO relationship. He asked for a briefing or

a list of questions prior to his next neeting with AMLASH'3

in Europe.

In discussing the loyalties of AMLASH 3 and the re-

sultant security implications for the AMLASH operation,

ANWHIP stated (see above) that he vas absolutely certain

that AMLASH 3 would never intentionally reveal any thing

to anyone which would jeopardize AULASH 1. (Case Officer

Comment: In discussing Security ramifications of AMLASH '3's

knowledge of the AMLASH I AUBIDDY relationship, bout in the

light of his DSI assoctions, It could be concluded that since

AMBIDDY is now tied closely to AULASH 1, AULASH 3 will also

protect ANBIDDY.)

During the discussion of ANLASH 3, AWWHIP 1 expressed

mild amazoment over the face that we continued to doubt A 3's

bonassdes when ANLASH 1, who had lu, head in doblock, had

enough confidence in the man lo includo him tIme some of lia

most compromisins actlustles. To summartee our posielon 1u

pointed out that his assessment of AULASH'S vas probably

correct, but that to must, in the isterest of kiibet

AULASH I maximum protection possible, mainent take the

pessimistic view point with regard to all of AMLASH'en

but even somewhat pleased with this approach and reiterated

his willingness to obtain whatever Inforuntion was necessary

about AMLASH 3 or other associates of ANLASH 1.

5. ANNHIP I was leaving on the lasts 15th for. San
