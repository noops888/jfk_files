Page 220, lines 5 through 10. This passage concern-

ing the use of CIn

alias documentation by Hunt and others in-

cludes loose language which implies that still another set of

documents was prepared by the CIA for Hunt's

use -- i.e., a

set of documents which was not mentioned during the recent

Congressional "Watergate hearings". As such this is misleading

could serve to create additional difficulties for the Agency.

It is recommended that the OGC make an effort to have the author

rewrite this paragraph in order that this potentially damaging

language be removed from his manuscript. (Page 387, lines 4-9.)
