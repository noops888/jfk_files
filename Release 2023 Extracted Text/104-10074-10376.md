Yeah, ANITA

because I like him so much.' CS: She's a good poli-

tician.

with DENNIS several times recently. CS says they just

heard from DENNIS that he had won"a second prize in

poetry translation," for which he received twenty dollars.

is he any help?"

ABBOTT comments that it helps "off and

on" and BS asks if he's sticking with it... "Your therapy.'

He says he 15.

She urges him to give therapy a chance.

he says it has helped some, adding that he had cried

in two out of the four sessions; that he thinks the guy

is great; that he was just sort of lonesome for CHLOE;

that analyst feels that "I have kind of dammed up and

blocked up a lot of emotion which was giving me other

kinds of mental problems," that he has helped some; that

If he does not come for Christmas, he will probably come

down around New Year's or shortly thereafter.

SMALLS

"down periods" and some

"up

periods."

BS asks if he is able to function and he
