Nir. Williamson departed

, on 21

• February 1971, alter having served as Chief of Station for two and

one half years. The last year of his tour was highlighted by two

oxtremely delicate, highly productive operations targeted against

the

opera-

tion of a most sensitive nature stemming from them. This latter

operation, focused as it was around

called for constant good judgment on how to pursue U.S. Govern-

ment interests with this highly sensitive and significant intelligence

at hand.

(It was highlighted at the WH Division's Chiefs of Station

Conference held in February 1971 as a classic example of both the

collection and use of intelligence on the real "national interest"

level.)

Throughout these operations, Mr. Williamson handled him-

gelf very well, especially during the latter part of hia tenure when

he was under considerable pressure as an alinost inevitable conse-

fact that, under these general circumstances, he continued to

the way for his successor to take up the cudgel from the best

operational platform -- all this speaka for itself and certainly

underlines the fine quality of Mr. Williamson's professional and

personal characteristics.

In the

his officers with both firmnesg and tact.

very well in the local commurity and, during his tenure, established

a wide range of contacts.

Mr. Williamson's relationghip with the

In sum, Mr. Williamson is a "pro" who turned in a strong

perforrance both before and after the chips were down.

of his

travels which

absented

him

fron the Station

for one-half of the past yoar, subject perforce was

inadequatoly qualifled to take charge of

Specializing on Cuban operations entirely, he hag

Ismited knowledge of tho slation's other activitles

the offoctivoness of his porformance of this duty, l could not rate him
