ADMINISTRATIVE
Miami is placing instant case in a pending inactive
status for sixty days, since no leads remain outstanding.
No request for permission to examine subject using
the Polygraph is being submitted at this time because:
1 Subject is in poor health and is waiting to
enter the hospital for treatment; and,
2 INS has a case pending in which INS will at-
tempt to prove that subject served in the
Cuban Rebel Army during the period 1959-60,
and did so voluntarily, thereby subjecting
himself to loss of his United States citizen-
ship.
This report is classified Confidential, since it
contains information originating with CIA, which information

investigations, advised that a former employee of a
Cuban Ministry, who is now in the United States, and
who is described by MM T-1 as reliable, furnished in-
formation which originated with TOMAS CABANAS BATISTA
a Cuban exile.
The information concerned activities
about a group which was represented by PAULINO A. SIERRA.
SIERRA was a Cuban exile opposed to the present government
of FIDEL CASTRO RUZ, Cuban Premier. According to the
source, the SIERRA group was gathering forces for opera-
tions against FIDEL CASTRO. SIERRA, in a meeting in
Coral Gables, Florida, in September, 1963, said that
American businessmen had offered money to help defray
expenses of the group, but that no operations would be
conducted from American soil.
Among those at the meeting and associated
with the group, was FELIPE RIVERO, who had been connected
with the attempted invasion of Cuba in April, 1961, which
operation was known as the "Bay of Pigs Invasion." At the
meeting, CABANAS reportedly stated that SIERRA had named
GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ, Also known as Captain LEON, to be the
commander of the military forces of the SIERRA-associated
group. RODRIGUEZ was described as a naturalized U. S.
citizen, and as having been arrested by the CASTRO govern-
ment and sentenced to a long term. He was freed in 1963
through the intervention of American lawyer JAMES B. DONOVAN
On October 31, 1963, GILBERTO RODRIGUEZ
FERNANDEZ, 620 N. W. 69th Street, Miami, Florida, furnished
the following information to SA ROBERT JAMES DWYER:
