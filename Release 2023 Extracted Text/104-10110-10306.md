SUBJECT: Philip Burnett Franklin Agee

!. NAME OF OFFICER OR EMPLOYEE: Elsie l. Scaletti

2. PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT:

I knew Phil during the entire time he was in

Branch I at Headquarters, and during his tour in

Mexico.

We came to Mexico PCS at the same time.

This means I knew him from 1965 until he resigned.

In Headquarters our relationship was

limited to

business in the office, and that was not very.

frequent. We sat in different rooms.

He handled SE

matters. I did the routing of all Branch

correspondence which meant I decided what he was to

see--this was anything affecting Soviet/Satellite/

Chinese matters.

My main areas of responsibility

were in

the support field.

Even though we were both

processing out at the same time, we did not exchange

stories much.

However, since l traveled as a

"Tourist" and was not therefore allowed to bring

anything into Mexico,

Phil offered to have some of

my things packed with his household effects since

he said he owned hardly anything. One day my husband

and I took sone boxes of things over to his apartment

before work.

I do not remember the name of the

apartment development in Virginia, but

it was the

arden type. His apartment was nice--rairly new

sut sparsely furnisied. He nelsed us unload the trina:

aid take them upstairs. Then we parted. I seem to recal

he had some trouble with his car that morning and we

dropped him off at a repair shop on the way to the

office.

At this time, in Washington, Phil was very

pleasant, was nice to work with.

He did not appear

to be pushy, even though hedid everything he could

to get

the Mexican

assignment.

At this time, despite

his family problems, he did not appear to let these

affect iris work. At

least from my position he seemed

to get his work done,

not to procrastinate, not to

take a

lot of time off. Fron the gossip I heard,

he was separated,

and was anxious to get any assignme.it

overseas. When the possibility of this Olympic job

opened up in Mexico he grabbed it. As I recall, C/Wf/1

was sympathetic toward

iim also, and was happy to be

able to help Phil at this particular time.

In Mexico when Files Houseirold effects arrived

he let me know; and

as I recall, ne brought them over

to my ilouse and we unloaded them into our apartnent.

We did not go and pick them up.

thanks,

invited him over to supper one evening. (Willard C.

URtIs had given permission for individual officers

to have Phil over to dinner if no outsiders were

present and prior permission was obtained. I think

I got permission from the Deos at that time. There

were only the

three of us (Phil, my husband, and

myself--no maid, no other invited guests) There was

no discussion of office. My husband knew Phil was with

BKTRUST and was working on the Olympics in Mexico.

Conversation was light. During dinner, as I recall,

we talked about business in Mexico, and he mentioned

his father was in the dry cleaning

business, and

he thought he might be interested in bringing into

Mexico some used dry cleaning equipment which is worth

nothing in the United States, and set up some dry

cleaning establishments in Mexico. The discussion

was merely in generalities--nothing specific as to

timetable or even if Phil were serious about this.

About a week later Phil brought his car over and

my husband helped him work on his car--adjusting it

to the altitude. This must have been around September

1907.

Shortly thereafter, when Laura B. UTSTINE was

in Mexico TDY (she worked in WH/l and also knew Phil

at Headquarters), Phil had my husband, me,

and UTSTINE

over to his apartment (on Insurgentes

sur just off the

Viaducto) for dinner. It was a huge.

apartment.,

sparsely

furnished. We had

an

enjoyable evening, very light

conversation. Talked mostiy

about Mexico. At this time

he showed us

he had several

bedrooms (forget how many)

and hopefully his sons would be able to visit him.

During his tour in Mexico! only saw Phil in the

Station occasionally--and then just in passingin the

halls.

Once after I heard about Phil's having kidna, ec

his boys,

I thought I saw them (can't remember why l

thought they were his) in front of the Embassy with

maid.

I never saw

Phil in the Embassy proper nor at

any Embassy

functions (1 was tourist and did not

circulate in the Embassy).

my

understanding

there was

problem about his

resignation, but did not know all the details.

(This was true as personnel matters in the Station

were kept

very close

by the front office.) I do

not know if, when, or now many times PROBERT might

have met witi Phil.

At this time Phil looked neat

and well kept, as

I recall.

EX-LIADLIB ever met socially in Mexico or not.

I am quite

certain their work paths never crossed.

LIADLIB IS

still in Mexico.

He has had a difficult

time since

his "resignation" getting a job,

keeping a job,

and making ends meet. It probably

would be to BKTRUST'S

disadvantage now for

the two to meet. For this reason,

and to assess

ex-LIADLiB-s present state of mind, Headquarters

sent someone to talk with LIADLIB-l. in the spring

of 1972.

At that time he still seemed bitter

against BKTRUST.

Other than wishing to make special mention of

EX-LIADLIB-), I know of no Agency personnel

other than those in WH/l and the Mexico City Statio

whom he knew.

5. OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT PERSONNEL

I know of none except the Olympic Attache in Mexico

under whom Agee worked fron

July 1967 until the

end of the Olympics.
