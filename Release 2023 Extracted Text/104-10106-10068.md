the information in paragraph 1 above. Mr. Hix asked me to submit

the information in writing as soon as I was settled in the Division.

un January 19/1, however, Special Agent Robert Fredericks

S/A Fredericks in Miami at Mr. Cohen's suggestion: S/A Fredericks was

not available. Mr. Cohen then advised me to return to my office and

he would contact me with further instructions. Mr. Cohen retained

the Form 879. Subsequently, Mr. Cohen advised me that I should travel

to Miami as requested and that CIA would reimburse me for expenses

connected with my activities in behalf of the U.S. Government.

further advised me that being in an overt cover status I should state,

if asked under oath, that I am currently a CIA employee.

On 10 January 1977 I traveled to Miami where I met and

conferred luf dusa laiun Ackinson and DEA S/A Robert Fredericks.

They informed me that Gerald P. Hemming's case had been severed and

AUSA Atkinson told me she

wanted me as a rebuttal witness if Gerald P. Hemming presented the

defense that he had been working at the direction of DEA.

She said

they would not call me until and unless that defense was presented.

She also said that she felt that any attempt to question me concerning

my current place of employment was irrelevent and she would object to

any such line of questioning.

She said she would only ask me where

I was employed at the time I interviewed. Hemming. I returned to

Washington D.C. the same day.

In August: 1974 HEMMING was approached by Armando BOLET.

Cuban veteran of the

2506 Brigade whom HEMMING had worked

with in anti-Castro activities, and by John VARESE infi),

to help them organize and run air snuggling operations

for

Thomas and. William O'DONNEL.

The O'DONNEL brothers, using

the cover of their construction firm in the ft. Lauderdale

area, (AMERICAN EASTERN DEVELOPMENT) were involved in maritime

smuggling of marijuana from Colombia to Florida.

During an

unspecified four years (probably 1970-74) the O'DONNEL's had

averaged approximately six-seven loads of marijuana per year

at three-four tons for each

loads snuggled into Florida.

of these. 24-28 loads of marijuana they had to jettison into

the sea only five loads for security reasons.

The rest of the

loads had been successfully delivered into Florida.

The source of the marijuana in Colombia is DI. Arturo

ROMANO-Fedullo of Barranquilla,

colombia.

Besides. running

the

smuggling for RoMaNo, William O'DONNEL handles the laundering

of the money accumulated by drug trafficking through banks

in. Grand Cayman, Switzerland, and Curacao.

¿Armando BOLET convinced the O'DONNEl's that they

add air smuggling to their narcotic trafficking nethods and

that they should also try cocaine in addition to marijuana.

BOLET told the O'DONNEL's that there were many experienced

men available in Florida who could be used to smuggle drugs

into. Florida üy aii. BOLET was especially interested in cargo

parachute drops and parachute jumps by individuals carryiny

loads of cocaine.

BOLET recruited HEMMING to help organize

these activities. A common technique used by BOLET and HEMMING

was to fly an aircraft into Florida legally, but to have a

parachutist jump onto a pre-selected drop zone in southern

Flörida prior to landing the aircraftst This way, police

authorities never found any contraband on the aircraft and the

dropped narcotics would not be-lost because. the parachutist

carried them on his person,: *If.he missed: the drop zone he could

simply fold up his parachute: and walk to the location of the

reception conmittee.! BOLET fuses. a DC-3*tail-number N1099 and

a Navajo Chieftain tail number N76781 in his snuggling operations.

HEMMING: had

a falling out with the O'DONNEL group and

decided to leave them: He is now associated with,carlos

CARABALLO who operates a chaiter fishing business

and traffics

in drugs.

HEMMING decided to inform on the O'DONNEL'S fOI

revenge and in order to try to eliminate the competition.
