According to the above files, no member of the CCS ever
met with Meier. A CIA employee was introduced to and had
discussions with Meier prior to his departure for Quito.
There is no evidence or indications when or whether Meier
was made witting of the CIA employee's CIA status. The basis of
the CIA employee's
statement to Mr. Ed Mullin of Intertel
" that Mr. Meier had been witting of the CIA employee's CIA
affiliation" (Tab F) cannot be established from CCS files.
2. Attached hereto are copies of 6 memoranda (Tabs A-F)
pertaining to Mr. Meier. It is recommended that both the CIA employee
who is now assigned to the Scandanavian Desk of EUR Division, and
the CIA employee who is again under contract to WH Division, be queried
