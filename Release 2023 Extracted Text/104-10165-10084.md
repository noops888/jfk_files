THIS IS UNEVALUATED iNFORMATION

The nes idlitary regize in Honduras currently is holding talks with

• Venezuela and hopes to siga an econosic agreement in the very near

future.

With that in wind, the Goverment of Honduras (GOH) recently

sent a high level conission to Venezuela headed b5 Captain Armando

San, Martiz, Secretar, of State for Sconomy and Comerce and ty Attorney

antonio jise Cuellu in wid discussions wich high ranking Venezuelen

Goveriment officials. Prior to the taiks, the GOB recently sold to

Venezuela-25 tillion linear feet of lumber at a total cost of US$S

allion. The CO bopes to reach an agreement by which Venezuela would

bury Honduran agricultural products for an unspecified nix of cash and

petroleum products.

In addition, Venezuela would support a new agri-

cultural production plan to be implenented in the very near future by

Fernando Yontes, Eonduran Secretary of State for Agriculture.

Despite reports that Chief Executive Colonel Juan Alberto Melgar Castro

bas unquestioned authority, Honduran military sources bave indicated

'that Mario Maldonado, Agrarian Reforz Chief; Lieutenant Colonel Mario

Ponseca, Director of the Military Academy, and Lieutenant Colonel Juan

Ramon Yolina Cisneros, Coumander of the First Artillery Battalion are

the real "pover behind the chrone."

These officers, who profess a

strong nationalist ideology, are interested simply

' In the general welfare

of the Honduran people, and

they are maintaining a

"watchdog" attitude

to Insure that no one, especially people in positions of power, uses

such positions for his om personal venefit.

These officers are nerbers

of the Sational Defense Council (ADC), which also includes the commanders

of all cajor military units in the country.

Naldonado, Fonseca, and

Bolina appear to be the "first asong equals" In the 15 member NDC.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

2. Businessuen in Honduras have reported that the escronic and political

situation in the country, currently inasad state of affairs, is bound

Ic become worse as a result of the indifference being exhibited by

President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano.

On the economic side,

the private

business sector is quite concerned about an experzed government move

to nationalize. the fishing industry. Some foreign fires already are

pulling out of the country and moving to nearby cuntries like

Nicaragua and El Salvador.

the policical side, Fresident Lopez

has fajled to name a permanent foreign minister since November 1974,

When Cesar Batres occupied that post.

Ricardo A Pineda is performing

those duties on an Interia basis. The President also has undermined

Honduran youth by giving in to the demands of the leftist-controlled

labor unions. He gives businessmen the impression that he does not

know such about governent; consequently, the sisation in the country

has become very unstable.

2i Appsiently, the regime in fonduras vants to emulate the current

Peruvian Government in failine to even consider elections at all.

In fact, the government, which 1s controlled by lse military, has

three pro-left ministers in the cabinet.

They are Manuel Acosta

Bonilla, Secretary of State for Finance; Guatama Fonseca Zuniga,

Secretary of State for Labor and Social Security, and Manlio Martinez

Cantor, Executive Secretary, Plännlug Board. At one time, Acosta was

the private secretary of the Mexican leftist leaser Vicente Lombardo

Toledano, so he has been thoroughly indoctrinated along Marxist lines.

position. In spite of his being a lawyer by profession, he is not astute,

1s caly of suerage intelligence, is far from decisive,

and freguently

vacillates when called upon to nake decisions. Be is, however, extrevely

anti-Cormnist. His deputy director is Roberto Oliva. He is no asset.

He has no outgoing personality whatsoever, and in ract, he is rather

innocuors. One thing that can be said in his favor is that he is reported

to be = feed engineer.

•2o: The previors Agrarian Reforu director was Rigoberto Sandoval. He is an

extremely capable lawyer, very sagacious, intelligent and he displayed

great foresight in that position.

his present and future course of life

be a caodidate-for an important political position la the not too distant

future.

date Sandoval has not sentioned which political position he

plans to seek. Another reason for observing his la that be is exceedingly

ants-03.

8. Il Sandoval does decide to seek a palitical office, it rould nost probably

be Cenexal Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who would sponsor his..

Early in Ottober 1972 a US laporter-exporter received a very pleasant

personal letter fron Rigoberto Sandoval.

By the tone of the letter obe

would Judge that a close relationship has existed between them for some

time: Sandoval stated that he was in Italy working for the Food and Agil-

culture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), and that for the present

his stay there was: fos an indefinite period... He enclosed a long list of

Items which he requested the US leporter-expurter to send to his lovediately

1f at all possible:

The list consisted nostly of furniture, household

furnishings, electrical appliances, etc.

Honduras/1972

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

(This report was developed by an Aruy representative assigned to the

affice of preparation.)

.. Honduran merchants, incustrialists and some of the people have been urging

the revival: of the Central American Cormon Market (CACi. To all intent

and purposes it has teen practically son-existent. Salvadorians and

Guatemalans have also expressed tie same insire.

In-early October 1972, these urgings were taken into consideration by the

Secretaryship of Central American Econonic Integration (SLEC)) (Secretaria

Permanente de Integracion Economica Centro Imericana). SIECA appointed a

president, and a board of directors was selected. Eduardo Ortes Colindres,

a Honduran inwyer was pance presirent.

Concral Soon of Nicaragua and

General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano aprroved the appointment of Eduardo Ortes

Colindres so nuch that they offered to aid him in revitalizing the CACH.

The board is composed of members from Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua,

• Costa Rica and Honduras. They are authorized to represent their countries

in all matters pertaining to the Clar.

до

It is intercsting to note that in spite of Honduras having informally re-

tired from the CACM, not only is the president a Honduran,

•but so is the

president. of the Central American dank of Economic Integration (BCIE),

with headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.

The fact that General Samoza

of Nicaragua and General Lopez drellano of Honduras have volunteered their

assistance to Eduardo Ortes Colindres has led most of the Central Americans

to believe thit the Caci can once again be made active.

If this does occur,

it would indeed be most beneficial to the Central American countries

concerned.

Labor is better organized in the northern part of Honduras than anywhere

else in that countay.. It has a headquarters in every city where adminis-

trative activities are conducted and where sectings of union lenders are

held. So far meetings have not taken place at work centers.

Transactions between Labox and the government are carried out by labor

delegates Celio Gorzalez, through the Ministry of Labor, never directly.

Labor, as such, does not subscribe. to any one particular political party.

The Marxist theories do not appear to appeal to Labor Unions.

many it their members do seem to be leaning towards the Liberal Party.

On the surface Labor Unions' actions in Honduras appear to be denagogic

at times.

They make demands on the governsent, industry and businesses

in spite of their knowing that their demands may prove to be harmful to

the economy of their country.

It would be rather unfair to always bold

the Honduran Union Leaders responsible for this demagogism, because

frequently the union members tenselves are guilty of pressuring their

leaders to execute sone specific demand, even though they had already

been kared of the possible baraful effects.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

(This report was developed by as Arny representative assigned to the office

of preparation.

1. Presideat Oshaido Lopez Arellano is interested in a seccoà term.

This opin-

fon is based on a growing corseasus arong Congressuen, Forduran business

leaders and the cilitary that Lopez desires to remain is office for another

tera. The thirking in these Micrduran circles is that tie lack of disclairers

by Lopez is, in itself, a strong indication of his "continuiseo" plans.

Ap

proxizately ten czys ago Herman rascua, zanager of the lational Railroad,

headquartered in San Pedro Suia, rad a Ciscussion witi me President during

which Pascua passed the remari that he would like to renain with the railroad

as long as licuez remained in sifice. Lopez sace no specific rejoinder to

this but Pascia left the President's office with the dissinct impression that

Lopez wouid rua for reelectian.

2. Lopez would probably be reelested with relative ease. Te opposition Liberal

Party is divided internally and lacks boti an effective ce fidate and the

capital necessary to offer a serious challerge.

3. The power and influence of Ricardo Zuniga has declined drastically in recent

conths.

This is not due to a-y s: ciffc act Sut sore to a growing realization

by Presidert Lopez of Zuniga's dishonesty, ambition for sover and his in-

ability to yet along with sose government oficials and promirent nilitary

officers. President Lopez was particularly distayed at Zuniga's hardling of

Honduras propaganda during the recent Honduran/el Salvacaran border war.

Lopez allegedly felt that the irvective agaiast El Salvador often nirrored

the type used by Cuban Cosmunisa.

Ao. Miguel indonte Ferrandez, a self-appointed presidential candidate, is an

honest, sincere and well respected ran. Tiere is a suail group of roughly

ten Arab and jewish businesssea in San Pedro. Sula known as the "econocic

nafia" because they control so such of Horduran business'activity, mis

group has taken rote of the candicacy of Femandez and Las been inpressed

by his honesty and sincerity.. Ley will not support him however, because

they feel he lacks the political experience and popular base for a successful

capaign.

[Inis report vas

developed by

an Army representative assigned

to the office of preparation.)

..I. For over five years I have been in close contact with Hondurans of

different backgrounds and social position.

Never before have i seen the

anti-American sentiment which is sweeping Honduras at the present time.

The feeling is not only evident among sudent and labor organizations,

,but arong sectors of what is considered to be the best informed and

educated individuals in the country.

Most of then are convinced

that the US has the influence to exert diplomatic pre:sures on El Sal-

vador in arder to settle the pending border dispute, but has failed

to do so. They see the US Government as favoring El Salvador.

During conversations with several government officials they emphatically

scared that Honduras was not going to open the Pan American Highway to

Salvadoran traffic.

This is the attitude of almost everybody that I

calked with. This single issue has served to unite the country like

never before.

There 18 a new feeling of pacriotion which was lacking

before the conflict with el salvador.

3. The campaign against Salvadoran products has resulted in an incentive

for Honduran Investors.

I bave had several inquirles from Honduran

businessmen who are interested in establishing production facilities for

coasumer articles which were normally Imported from El Salvador.

These Individuals are eager to Invest and establish factories in order

to f1ll the denmad for products uhich vere imported from El Selvador.

Honduras has been purchasing arms and armunition from Portuguese and

Belgian sources. Some of this armament has arrived in the country.

According to a ailitary informent noat of the aroament has not been

delfrered, but la expected in the country before the end of the year.

THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION

Ithis report was developed by an Army representative assigned to the office of

preparation.)

.]. During early August 1969 a close business associate net with Colonel (fnu)

Coreccoili (phonetic) and members of the Honduran Army General Staff. Colonel

coreccolli and members of the Saff were alarmed by the continuing reports of

arms and aumunition stockpiling by El Salvador.

These individuals were of the

opinion that the armament of the Honduran Armed Forces was inferior to that of

El Salvador.

12o "During the meeting Colonel Coreccolli inquired about the possibility of a legal

• or illegal purchase

of approxicately 2500 M-l rifles and an undetermined amount

of .30 caliber ammunition

from US sources. He. explained that the weapons were

needed to arm personnel with prior military service in case of a renewal of

hostilities with El Salvador.

These individuals were considered to be z re

-serve for the Honduran Armed Forces.

73.

My associate explained to Colonel Coreccolli that under the circumstances the

US Government would not issue an export permit for the armaments.

for il-

legal sources ny associate disclaimed knowledge of any. He also considered

the transportation problem.

Colonel Coreccolli stated that if acquired

the

weapons could be smuggled aboard a Honduran refrigeration ship which was an-

chored in the Miami River at that time. Following this Colonel Coreccolli

closed the beeting indicating that he was going to explore other possibilities.

Following the meeting my associate had a conversation with Rigoberto Sandoval,

a member of the Planification Board. Upon being informed of the meeting, Sandoval

warned ay associate to be careful in any dealings with Colonel Coreccolli, since

he was known as a corrupt government official, a "thief". Sandoval stated that:

thie was the opinion of President Oswaldo Lopez Arellano who distrusted Corec-

colli.

A few days later my associate learned that Ricardo Zuniga, Minister of

the Presidency, has been given the task of purchasing arms and amunition for

Honduras.

.

Havricio Hernandez, wealthy owner of a lumber mill in Honduras, visited the I's

during the firet. part of August 1969.

He told me that he was going to purchase:

tiro "coobat aircraft" for the Honduran Government.

He did not specify the type

nor the source of the aircraft.

About a week later I had a telephone conver-

sation with Hernandez, during which he told me that he had been

"guccesstul". in

"his purchasing mission. He did rot give any detailo.

office of preparat 101.)

-Jo The arded forces are doing a splendid job in their civic action projecte.

Their prisary interest seeus to be the construction and repair of roads

throughout the Republic. In conversation vith a liaison officer between

the aruy and other governent agencies he sentioned that the only diffi-

culties they are facing in their prograss 1s toe lack of adequate equipuent,

and the lack of cooperation by the Public loris Office. He told ne that

In sost instances the requests made by the arey for the use of additional

transportation or utilization of existing equient are disregarded by

oinor officials. This creates problems requiring the action of higher

officials, sho are given the impression that the aruy 1s the originator of

these problems.

..z.

3.

Considering the available resources and facilities of the country the

amed forces are vell trained and disciplined. During the latter pert of

1967 Presideat Anastacio Sonoza and a group of other Nicaraguan dignitaries

risited Honduras. Several groups under Coccunist Influence desonstrated

against the visit. I had the opportunity to observe the development of

the desonstration, from a meeting to a riot, trom a vantage point.. Despite

the fact that the aruy riot control troops vere stoned and abused they

vere disciplined enough to prevent toat could have been a serious incident.

They did not attack or five at the sob, as vould have been the destre of

the leaders, tbo incidentally allays resained behind the nob and utilized

other people to direct ard incite the desoastrators..

The troops and jualor

officers uho vere present during the desonstration vere highly praised by

the responsible elements of the society.

If a guerrilla movement started I believe the arned forces would act

iftly. A special counter-guerrilla unst 1s vell trained and equipped

to prevent developaent of suall units Into larga and organized guerrilla

bardo.

in October 1972 a government official and several young aray officers

events took place:

Zo During the same private conversation, General Oswaldo Lopez Arellano was

quoted as having stated that it wild be futile for him to lead a coup

d'etat undess there was hope of irproving the telfare of the sasses and

the general economy of the country as well; he fimly believes it would

be impossible to accomplish that goal until a charge in must of the above

conditions were met prior to any coup d'etat in which he would be interested.

Selected Honduran army officers hare attended special courses at an arms

facility in Peru since approximately 1967.

ac-ording to an army officer

the number of candidates sent sirce early 1972 has not only been increased

but also each has been ordered to specialize in any one of the br. .ches of

their choice. They previously attended the various courses given at that

The army zives an outward appearance of being in sympathy with the present

regime, but in reality not all the members sympathize with President Cruz.

In private conversations some speak of him in a derogatory, manner, espec-

jally young officers.

A nan who continues to wield a smat deal uf pover in llonduras is Ricardo

Zuniga Augustinus, Minister of Goverment

and Justice, also lcader of the

Nationalist Party.

zuniga's ability to continue wielding porer is due to

his being a very clever, astute, wealtny man.

He always knows exactly

what he vants, and does not hesitate to utilize his personal character-

istics and his wealth in obtaining his objectives.

Zuniga's present ambition for continued power has forced him to feign

that comitnents made between the goverment and political parties must

this because he really believes this to be a moral obligation, or because

he is a fervent democrat:

the recognized leader of the Nationalist Party, as well as having become

influential in the Liberal Party. He believes

Therefore, he calculates that through these two parties he can protract

the power he has today.

Today relations betwen General (swaldo Lopez Arellano and Zuniga are not

as cordial as they were previously. However, one must not be led to be

Hieve that

this situation is unrepairable because if Zuniga needed Lopez

Arellano's help, or vice versa, the former pleasant r "ationship would

be hastily nursed back to life.

It is just possible that if a coup d'etat

led by General Ostaldo Lopez Arellano should take place, and

be successful,

Zuniga would make a great effort to settle any differences existing between

them.

This might not please some of the army officers who dislike Zuniga

• due to his character and the procedures used by him to obtain power.

Bo

Up to the present time the Armed Forces do not appear to be leaning tokards

the "Left".

They are naturally desirous of improving their way of life.

The Air Force has recently organized a company whose entire net profits

will go tu the Air Force for the benefit

of its members. Ceneral Oswaldo

Lopez trellano is investing in various industries and small private

industries. He has very recentiy established a company called Empacadora

de Cames (meat packing firm) whose net profits will be for himself alone.

The Ared Forces hold Gencral Diwaldo Lupez Arellano in the highest

estees. This knowleuge

is based on his observationa and personal contact

with officers and enlisted men.

(1h1s report-tas developed by an Aruy representative assigned to the

office of preparation.)

Ja. My work takes me to the rural areas In Honduras where I have opportunity

to talk vith the peasants.

It is my considered opinion, based on

per-

sosal observations, that the peasants in the rural areas are bitter and

"disgusted with their lot.: They have little or no faita left in anyone.

Econonically, _

thet- condition is second only to Haiti, In comparison vith

"the countries in the Caribbean.

The prices of staples coupare with

ment Is a very grave problen.

"not need sore then 200.

We have had to rebuse hundreds who applied :

because ve had no need for them, h swall fraction of those turned back

"Will be sole to find vork, the rest will resain unemployed.

Jack.of Initiative and u/gor. Seldon is a ran found in Government or

Industry who 18 not afflicted ith the two major vices anong this recent

of the population:.. vine and wonen. The econonic inactivity at tines

appears to be the result of Indifference, other times the result of

Intentioaal delays by Comunist Infiltrators in Govercient. As an ex-

ample of this "lack of initiative" I will inke reference to the road in

the Olancho area..

The loan for this 110 ilometers of road was approved

In October 1963. The road is badly needed to nove agricultural products

from this region, to provide employient for hundreds of needy people,

and to provide the oaly access for the construction of a US$ 20 m1l10n

pulp and paner plast so the sarea.. Until the sunner of 1967, these funde

remalned idle. Prelintnary studtes were nöt even mede. With luck, '

construction may consence in 1963, but by this time paymenta on the

principal and interest are due to start.
