if any information you can give us about the Oswald situation.

a file on Lee Harvey Oswald?

Mr. Angleton. They have a file. They have, I think, more

than one. I think they have a subject file, and in that they

have

all the documentation that went to the Warren Commission

through Mr. Raymond Rocca, who is my deputy.

And then there is a lot of undigested material that was

brought out after the Warren Commission.

Senator Baker. Was there ever any inquiry? Or do you

have any opinion as to whether Oswald was a Soviet Agent?

Mr. Angleton. Yes, I have a very

strong opinion. I know

Senator Baker. John McCone, as I remember, was

queried once on whether we could establish the bona fides of

certain people, including oswald.

Mr. Angleton. And Nosenko.

Senator Baker. Was there any advice by you at that

time to MeCone or other wise that the bona fides of that

Soviet person or of Oswald ought not to be stated in cate-

gorical terms?

Mr. Angleton. During the period of the Warren Commission

we prevented as far as we could any information from Nosenko

going under the record, on a question of bona fides.

Senator Baker. Why?

Mr. Angleton.

Because we didn't regard him as bona fides.

Senator Baker. What did you regard him as?

Mr. Angleton. We thought he was a dispatch agent who

was sent to mutilated the leads. of very high grade Soviets

whom we had acquired prior to that.

Mr Angleton. Relating to assassination, XGB agents,

Senator Baker.

And did McCone accept your advice?

Mr. Angleton. He did, except that I understood that

a lot of it has been declassified. And when he gave this

scharr

Interview recently with Shor, I called his executive officer

Elder and I asked him, and he said, who in the Agency ever

alleged to McCone

that we

now had re-established the bona fides?

And I said, he is an old

well, et cetera, and don't give me that stuff.

And he said, well, I will give it to you.

And I never heard from him since. But McCone was a man

whowould not have made this statement. He has total recall.

Senator Baker. I am sure he does.

Do you have an opinion as to whether or not Oswald was

infact a Soviet agent?

MI. Angleton.

well, let me put it this way.

I don't think that the Oswald case is dead. There are too

many leads that were never followed up. There's too much in-

formation that has been developed later.

For example, in 1966, in a Soviet book on Cuba there is

a photograph of Khrushchev, a photograph of Castro, a photograph

Soviet Ambassador to Havana, and a man named Leontov, who was

the

Soviet KGB operational man in Mexico. When the Mexican

police arrested Castro as a student, they found in his note-

books the name of Leontov, KGB, Mexico.

Now, photographs 61, and so on, are in a KGB Journal for

Soviet citizens abroad. It is a bible, 75 percent KGB staff.

Photograph of Brezhnev, Castro, Alexiev, Leontov.

Now, we had a double agent after the assassination,

who made a number of allegations that he acquired from the

Chief of KGB, Mexico, Yatskov and he was

a superior of Leontov.

Now, after the assassination Khrushchev was in Cairo on a state

visit. And he pulled an American journlist aside, and totally!

out of context, expressed the view that there was a con-

spiracy, and it involved the Right ling of the u.s.

The thingwas totally out of context.

And he planted

this bug in this fellow's ear.

We had double agents who stated that the KGB put all of

their personnel for

six months on working on the assassina-

tion, and had concluded that

an American Right Wing business

under Johnson was to succeed in power.

And I am not talking

about petty informants. I am talking about men whowere ascer-

tained members of the KGB and part of the Soviet elite.

And I can multiply that. Those cases, those leads have

never been followed up. One is because of lack of manpower.

Mr. Angleton. It would

not be a pleasant one. I have

such a memorandum to the Commission. And I have submitted

a personal letter to the Vice Prsident. And my whole plea

was that my days were numbered, but regardless, that in and

beyond the life of that Commission, that in his position as

Vice President he had a rare opportunity the first time these

matters were ever aired, and that the disaster of Hoover's death,

and Gray, and the Watergate and

counter-intelligence forces.

months and what they did from one man who was very high in the !

Mr. Angleton. 1967, or thereabouts.

a KGB defector:

Senator Baker.

Mr. Schwarz.

You sald that Nosenko, one of the reasons

you suspected Nosenko was a double agent, or a planted agent,

rather, was because he was saying things that were contra-

dictory to some other high quality person who theretofore had

been giving you information before Nosenko came- to this

country?

Mr. Angleton. That is right.

MI. Schwarz. What was the nature of the information

relating to the Kennedy assassination that the high quality

person had given you?

MI. Schwarz. Let me say this so that it makes a little

more sense.

In December 1961 a member of the KGB in Helsinki defected

to us.

lis name is Golitzen. He has never been in service,

except Jack Anderson came out with an

erroneous account of it,

alleging that he had stated there was a plot to assassinate

Nixon. He did not make such a statement.

MI. Kirbow. Do you think this statement should be on

the record?

Mr. Angleton.. I don't mind it being on the record after

the Anderson

article. They have been looking for him.

Now, his is probably without any question the most major

defection since World War II as

far

as Soviet intentions,

Soviet

organization, and Soviet operations are concerned.

And the

reason,

among others, that it was so important wag

he had decided to defect many years prior to December of 1961,

if the opportunity ever arrived. And therefore he used those

many years breaking down the compartmentalization of the KGB

in order to acquire the kind of information which would be most

valuable to the US, and to our allies.

Therefore he refused many assignemtns abroad, but tried

to always remain

in headquarters and get himself appointed to

investigative commissiong and other things of

this sort which

would get into everybody elses's business. Among other things,

he

spent many years

in the training schools for people who

came back

for gix weeks

from

different parts of the world to

brag about their achievements. And he absorbed

all of this

information.

And

among other things, he stated that he gave the

crytograms

and

circumstantial

evidence

of

penetrations

throughout the west.

And then the Soviets rapidly transferred 300 of their

people after his defection. And as is normal in a case of

this kind, the big problem

is to write a damage report, which

means the whole service would come to a standstill. And the

objective would he to

review all paper files and everything that

showed his

initials.

And

you

usually would have three

categories of information: you would have information which

he definitely had knowledge of,

and information which he did

not have knowledge of, and

Now, when we did a similar operation on the Sergeant

Dunlop who was working in the National Security Agency and

committed suicide, if I am not mistaken we came to approxi-

mately 400,000 documents that he could have had access to,

although he may not have had. And it is interesting to note

that after his assassination, in a search of the quarters,

the Bureax, of whoever did the search, found six of my letters

syn

to NSA relating to information from Golitzen.

Senator Baker. Did you speak of the assassination?

Mr. Angleton. What did you say?

Mr. Miller. Did you say MI. Dunlop?

Mr. Angleton. After his suicide. I am sorry.

MI. Miller. You used the term assassination.

MI. Angleton. I meant suicide.

MI. Miller. The word is interesting, because it is

charged, as you know, that he was assassinated.

MI. Angleton. Maybe I was thinking out loud of something.

:pr.

In any event, the 1969 Golitzen reports to NSA were in

a plastic bag, as I recall, in the attic. And there

was a

question of whether he passed them before or after.

MI. Schwarz. Now, what we were on was, I was asking you,

those cases which were perishable, the French, the British,

and ourselves, et cetera. And we had never had a second Chief

Director, which means the FBI type of Soviet, defector in our

lives, and all of this out of the blue, and no contact as in

Geneva six months after the defection of colitzen.

Mr. Schwarz. And the date is when in relationg to the

Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Angleton.

Well, this was a contact, this was not a

defection. He came

to us once

for

information prior to

the

assassination.

And then in Moscow the Soviets --and I am not going

into a lot of names, a member of the Second Chief Directorate,

gave an American tourist a

stack of documents from

the Second

Chief Directorate, the FBI, relating.to

how

they got

, and others of our agents, which showed

they didn't get them through a two-headed source, but they got

it through a

on our

side.

So the leads rant into the thousands from Golitzón,

and thousands and thousands of pages of transcript, interro-

gation, exhibiting photographs, and identifications, which in

turn would refresh

his memory on other courses.

And out of

that cime the finalization of the case of philby, Burgess, and

all that, the Vassily case

in the British Admiralty, and

some

other cases, and many cases

in

France

and

so on.

ME. Angleton. No, not from Golltzen.

But when the assassination took place --

MI. Schwarz. The Kennedy assassination?

Mr. Angleton. When

the Kennedy assassination took place,

Golition called me inmediately and stated that the modus

operandi with any defector from anybody's army to the Soviet

Union required that he go through processing by the 13th

Department of the KGB.

MI. Schwarz. Which is their assassination department?

Mr. Angleton. Which is their assassination department,

which is called their Affairs for Executive Action.

And there are two reasons for it.

Number one was, to

find out what sophisticated

weaponry or training he might have

had that would be of use to them.. And number two, whether it

was more valuable to reinfiltrate him into the National Army

for future activity.

Mr. Schwarz. Of the nature of assassinations?

Mr. Angleton. Of anything. It could be sabotage, or

intelligence, or whatever.

AND THIS WAS THE

SOP

on the dealing with military

defectors.

Now. when

the Soviet Government turned over to

the US

all the documents that led

to the interest regarding Oswald

stay in the Soviet Union, there was nothing there indicating

processing by Department 13.

Nosenko, whom we hid once in Geneva, he went back to Moscow.

And in my view he would have never

come back on the scene

CHEREPANOU

because they brought this Cheraponov thing in to have the locus

shifted from where we would have controls, in Geneva, to

Moscow where they would have all the controls. And that would

be the Directorate. And therefore they would have the direct

means of counteracting and mutilating the leads and the

importance of Golitzen's defection.

But the tourist save

the documents to the American

Embassy. And we photographed them.

The Charge insisted on

giving

them back to the Soviets

on grounds that it would be

appropriate.

MI. Schwarz. These

are not the official documents deal-

in Switzerland?

MI. Angleton.

The Second Chief Directorate, he took all

of the documents out of the FBI Soviet section and gave them

to the tourist and we read how we got caught on

things..

So there is the

assassination. Cheraponov allegedly

was chased to the Turkish border and shot. And in my view

this is a myth, because in 1918 Cheraponov was stationed in

Belgrade, and he tried to defect to us. and

at

another time

tried to establish

liaison

and contact with the Birtish MI-6,

at a -time when Philby was Chief of Intelligence, meaning

-that the approach would have been under Philby in 1948, and

then he reappears in the early 1960'g as a member of the

Second Chief Directorate.

That is enough of Cherapanov. But it is important only

from the Soviet point of view, the best laid plans fall apart.

And then out of the blue, Nosenko, whom we would never have

seen again, reappears after the assassination in Geneva, and

tells us he wants to defect.

MI. Schwarz. And he provided information which was

inconsistent with Oswald being the Russian agent?

MI. Angleton. I am coming to that.

so immediately we tried to get the breadth of his career

so that we know where the priorities are. And the first thing

he tells us is that while he was in the Second Chief

Directorate in the American Section, Oswald's KGB dossier went

over his desk. And his first story, as I recall it, was that

it was two volumes or three volumes. And finally it went down

to one volume and a small

sheaf of papers.

Also he said that the dossier showed clearly that Oswald

was mentally unbalanced, and that he was a poor shot, and:

therefore couldn't get a hunting license, and

a lot of stuff

of this sort.

And then on all of these outstanding leads -- penetra-

tions, of the French, the Americans, the British codes, bugging

of the Embassy, all of these different sorts

-- Nosenko had

something to do which diverted us from Nosenko's leads. And

in the normal course of events, we might have put Golitzen in

contact with Nosenko, which may have meant the assassination

of Golitzen, because the whole approach of Nosenko was one

where logically you would bring them in and have two bodies,

one Exon the First Chièf Directorate, that 1s, Golltzén, the

CIA part of the system, and the other from the FBI part of the

system, and therefore you would have a very strong balance

against the KGB. But we didn't do that. Because there were

certain things, litmus papers, questions put to Nosento.. And

as far as I was concerned, if he was bona fide he would have

answered one way, and he did not answer that way. And they had

to do with some deeper

secrets regarding a meeting of the

2000 members of the KGB and the Soviet Government in May of

1959, presided over by Shelepin and attended by many members

of the Central Committee on

the reorientation of

the Soviet

Services and the return to Leninism wherever intelligence

oparations has a political objective. And this is a part of

the process of de-Stalinization. And so when we

took him

unwittingly chronologically through his career, he : omits

all of this phase. And we had three or four or five other test

things, where their damage report would not show that golitzen

had access, because

it

was

part of his way of getting in and

breaking compartmentation. And therefore they would have no

evidence that he had

sufficient knowledge.

MI. Schwarz. And so Nosenko looked funny to you, he

to you was that Oswald was a mental case

and was

a bad shot?

Mr. Angdeton. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. And you had also received from Nosenko --

Mr. Angleton. Golition -i from Golitzen -- information

that suggested the normal practice was for Department 13,

which had responsibility from the Russian KGB for assasgina-

tions, to interview military defectors. And we had observed

that when the Russians transferred

documents concerning

Oswald, that there was no reference in there to any such

debriefing by Department 13. And another important part of

it is that there was

a man who was handling George Blake from

London, who was Counselor of the Soviet Embassy. And when he

returned he became head of the 13 Department, General Rodin.

But he was

there under an

alias as a civilian. He was the

Chief of the KGB in London, and a very high grade man. Then

he took over the Department 13 and reinvigorated it.

Mr. Schwarz. And what was his connection with Oswald?

MI. Angleton. I am saying

that he was head

of Department

13, and was head of Department 13 at a time -- I mean, he had

Department 13 and this is a point I think I should make, that

the Agency, unlike the Soviets, does not have an

assassination

department. The Soviets have always had an asgassination

department, which is totally sealed off from the rest of the

organization. People from the outside kno very little about

what goes on in that.

People career-wise stay in there. And

they report to the Chairman

of the KGB, and drop off, who 'in

turn report to the politboro. And therefore it is an entirely

sealed organization which is capable of all forms of action,

whether it be sabotage -- an illegal sabotage or what, an

illegal directorate which is independent of the rest of the

KGB -- nuclear sabotage, and all this type of thing, and

infiltration of enemy forces in the event of war.

And of

course assassination, the assassination of Ukrainian leaders

in West Germany •

Mr. Schwarz. Do you recount that simply because it makes

more significant

the

absence of any reference to Oswald because

you are. giving evidence as to the vigor of department 13, or

did you recount it because

there is a more direct connection

with Oswald?

MI. Angleton.

This is

related to what I told Mr. Dulles,

I thought it was absolutely wrong

to close the door on the

life of the Commission, and instead there

should be

a statement

that we are not

a position -- that on the fact available to

us during the given

period, these are our conclusions. And

And Mr. Rocha, who was the point of record of the

simply because he was a great scholar and a great many other

therefore he had the most

catholic background to

handle something as eomplex as the Warren Commission, not in

exercising executive power, but working on behalf of the

Director and all the Directorates and everything pertaining

to the Warren Commission. He

is a tidy individual.

And in

fact Mr. Belin has made a great deal of use of him

in

the

commission's business, and he is the one that had done all the

digging for the commission, and so on, on a whole series of

matters that I

am not familiar

with.

But my point to you -- and this is very difficult to

explain -- is that the question of Nosenko created a very

great division in

the

life of all counterintelligence as to

bona fides, as in all questions of when you

are

dealing with

double Identification

agents, there is always dispute.

But let me just line up the order of battle here. Our

Chief of the Soviet Division accepted the fact that the man

was a provocation. His Chief of Counterintelligence accepted

the fact that the man was a provocation.

Mr. Schwarz. Do you mean provocation, or providing

false information?

Mr. Angleton. An Agent Provocateur.

I said he was false. My man said he was

false. And it

isn't a parrot affair, each one reads the same stuff and

analyzes and come to their own conclusion. And Golitzen,

who defected, based only on the Geneva, first encounter in

Geneva, not the defection, had predicted in advance that

because of the enormity of his defection they would send a

provocateur into the west to destroy and mutilate his leads.

So it was a question of

awaiting, you might say, who

knocks on the door. And here is Nosenko.

Now, since then the Chief of the soviet Division who is

no longer there, has recanted in a way -- the Inspector

General went into all this -- he is today the NIO dealing in

Soviet Affairs, the National Intelligence Officer on Soviet

Affairs. And his counterintelligence man, a fellow named

Pete Bagley, who is the brother

of the two Admirals Bagley,

and one of the best men we had, left the Agency

and is now

in Belgium

in private life. And I can go all the way through

these other people who have been dispersed.. But the record

will clearly reflect that the preponderance of all individuals

Now, 1s it

your current understanding that what was

provided to the Warren Commission was the raw infomration

brought by Nosenko, or was the Warren Commission also provided

with the opinion of persons such as yourself and others as you

have recounted that he was providing false information?

MI. Angleton. I don't think the Warren Commission was

ever faced with the issue of the Internal issues of colitzra

or Nosenko.

Mr. Schwarz.

You first said that the information was

suppressed from the Warren Commission, and then you said

по,

it is your understanding now --

Mr. Angleton. Well, the word suppression isn't the right

word, I said. One went to argue the matter and it was agreed

by higher authority that the information shouldn't be --

Senator Mathias. There was a value judgment made as

to

the usefulness of the material?

MI. Angleton. That is right -- and not to do what the

Soviet in our mind wanted us to do, which cas to give it

prominence and have it

come out as an official part of the

record and documents

and

articles,

and so

on .

MI. Schwarz.

But your current understanding is that the

information was provided?

MI. Angleton. That was classified, and never came out in

Commission?

Mr. Angleton. It was made known to them in some fashion.

Mr. Schwarz. Was it made known to them at the same time

that at leat certain experts withing the Agency thought it

was false information?

Mr. Angleton. I think, as

I understand it now, that in

spite of our feelings, either Helms or McCone made a

presentation of it.

MI. Schwarz.

But without mentioning your feelings,

certain experts thought that it was

false?

Mr. Angleton. I can't respond to that. I don't know.

MI. Schwarz.

What about the information derived from

Golitzen, which indicated in your expert opinion that the

documents provided by the Soviet Union were, I think you put

1t, funny, or strange, or misleading, because they did not

include any reference to debriefing by Department 13, was that

information provided to the Warren Commission?

MI. Angleton. I don't know. I don't think so. But all

I can say there is this, to be realistic.

No one would expect

the

Soviet Government, regardless, to provide documents,

secret documents, on Oswald, whether he was of was not their

agent.

Mr. Schwarz. So you say that as far as that matter goes

there is no possibility that anybody on the Warren Commission

MI. Angleton. I mean, I don't think anybody was. I

that were no longer germain to his position on the matter.

Mr. Schwarz. Was

there a connection between the fBI and

Oswald?

MI. Angleton. I don't know the full FBI story. I know

there was a tremendous

flap in the Bureau. And one of the best

men they had in my view is a professional a man called Burt

Turner, who

I understand just got his law degree. And Burt

Turner was one of the finest

men

on Soviet KGB activities in

the Us, one of the analyzts. And he was in the washington

Field Office. And it is my understanding -- and this is

basically hearsay, but from pretty good sources -- that Burt

Turner was handling the Oswald ore related matters at the time

the President made the trip down to Texas, and

that

there

was

some confusion that the Bureau had not turned over, or had

not taken enough initiative in turning over, all the informa-

tion on Oswald to the local police.

I had been told that

there was a black mark put against Turner's name, and that he

confronted MI. Hoover and stated he was not going to permit,

or have

it be known to his children, that his negligence was

responsible for the death of the President. And he was pretty

forceful about his position. And as a result, this was

expunged or something to that effect. And that is the reason

he went to the Washington Field Office instead of staying in

Headquarters.

And then he retired. And I think his retirement had

something to do with this fact.

But this is all by virtue of hindsight with the thousands

of cases. And I cannot see any Western intelligence service

seizing on facts that Oswald will return to the US, and then

going and saying, we will get all of this, and we will send

it to Texas.

What I am trying to say, is that the difference in their

system. With the manpower and the computers, which are mainly

ours, and whatnot, a situation of that sort is automatic. And

we know enought about the Second Chief Directorate

and the

controls, the total controls, to know that if a Soviet

returned

automatically, to any part of the Soviet Union he went, there

would be a dossier that would go, and there would be also an

operational directive to put him on tap, check his

mail, to

do the following, and so on and to put an agent near him.

There wouldn't be any

leaking anything in the air on that.

There would be total encapgulation of that individual until

it was ceratin beyond a shadow

of a doubt that he was not sent

back as

an agent.

MI. Schwarz. A moment ago in talking about the line-up.

I think you put it, of views on Nosenko, you recounted the

views of a number of people. And you said that one person

had changed his mind

report. What was that report?

Mr. Angleton. At one stage in all of this -- and it was

much later, after

all the dust settled -- Helms got the

Inspector General, who had come from the clandestine side of

our business, to institute -- I don't like to use the word

inspection, it is too authoritative -- to go into the Nosenko

matter and see if there

is

anything there

that he

should know,

because Helms is fully aware of the split on this whole

question of bona fides, and it bothered him, because I had

brought him in touch with Golitzen, and he was fully aware of

all my activities, and travels

and

so on.

And so this person who was chosen began to interview

everybody and reopen the whole thing. I mean, there were 21

safe leads of stuff if you really got into all of the Golitzen

and Nosenko and the other things that pertained, as I pointed

out. to the warren Commission, to the asininity of what has

happened. of

27 years of experience

of myself and my two

colleagues, that these are the facts, that there are 20 cases

MI. Schwarz. You said Warren Commission. You mean

There are 20 some odd cases that a counterintelligence

officer in our busienss should know before he even begins to

Now, when DI. Schlesinger came in, and I started hearing

all of these things of manaement by objectives, and synergistid

and a lot of other things, being applied to the art forms which

we had developed, I finally got so frustrated that I thought

I would take him up on his own thing. So I got statisticians

in to take all the safes and figure out the linear footage of

every safe drawer, all the way on through, and to computerize

how long it would take the normal case officer

to come up to

this elemental stage of being able to be launched.

That was sort of a preparatory business. And they

figured it out and they

said it would take 22 man years, we

meant that if we were 100 percent incorrect, it would be 11

man years.

And that was simply to apprise Schlesinger, and

Colby, who had never been in counterintelligence, of what all

this problem was about. They

had

the idea of transferring

people back and forth and all the rest of it. And I nver chose

anybody in that job as a rule who had either been in the FBI

or had not had very rich experience in counterintelligence.

And normally I kept outside leaks to anybody in the business

_- I had men who stayed with me for 11 years, Rocca was with

me for 31 years, even

though they went into operational situa-

tions abroad and returned, and so on.

Mr. Angleton. No, he was never brought. He was Gordon

Stewart -- and he is retired -- a very able man, and a fine

executive. And I mean this sincerely. He is one of the

really top-notch men.

• But he as to undertake this burden. And it was a farce

in terms -- so he would talk to people and get their views

and so on.

When I went to the former Chief of the Soviet Division,

who was then stationed in Paris - and this 1s only hearsay,

I never read the report -- the former Chief of the soviet

Division stated, when I look back it, perhaps I have

given

too much latitude to my subordinates. And he wouldn't say yea

or nay, but he withdrew his very firm statement of the past

that this man was an agent provocateur.

MI. Schwarz. Did

the review concern in any way the

handling of the matter with the Warren Commission?

MI. Angleton. No, not to my knowledge. I mean, this

may be something.

I don't think I have evern

seen the review

-- in fact, I don't know whether the review was ever put in

the paper. But I mention it simply so that you don't get the

idea that it was just the CIA staff that had this view. This

was a view that was

shared by numbers of people who had

dealings with Nosenko. And I think the greatest authority of

all is, colitien himself, who was in the KGB, and who knew

Clandestine Services activity into Cuba..

Now, what struck me,

not having had any part of the

differences with Bissell, was that it seemed to me that both

this I told him what I was going to do, and he agreed, and

And also I wanted a person, because there was a radio

going to be put into Havana, and let somebody say we need a

I get the radio to

So for many a long period of time this worked perfectly.

This individual established his cover. They only had two or

three people in the Embassy there.

He would go to a

Hungarian restaurant where the Soviet officers would also go.

And he would

spot one of the waiters or a headwater who was

of the FBI, who is now lead

of the Criminal Commission in.

10 o'clock at night. And the

at my house. They were

was the physical description of Bill to a teel. And they

what to do.

Mr. Schwarz. That was Mr. Roselll, was it?

MI. Angleton. I think it was.

MI. Kirbow. And the Bill you speak of here is Bill

Harvey?

MI. Angleton.

Bill Harvey:

So I could get the gist of Bill's questions to them. And

I told him -- I made a motion to put his hand over the phone

and not to let them discuss

1t. And I said, tell them not to

do anything until they hear from you.

And that is what he told them, he said, stand down on

this and I will be back in touch.

And then Bill told

me the whole story in detail of how

he had gone over from California and

followed him in this

thing, and how Harvey had put him in his car and he went off.

Mr. Schwarz. That was in 1973

shortly before Mr. Harvey

went to Rome?

Mr. Angleton. It wasn't shortly before, it was, I think

quite

a long time before.

so then I told Sam, I said, look, let's go very easy on

this -- because I didn't know anything about Bill's connection

So I called Bill's house, and I asked his wife, is Bill

around?

And she said, no, he is out to dinner tonight.

And I said, look, we have some very serious trouble.

Would you please tell me where I can locate him.

And she said, he is at Duke Zeibert's. And I called

Duke zeibert's and I managed to get him.

And I turned the

phone over to Papich, because

I did not want to be on the

record showing that this was Angleton, et cetera.

And Papich talked to Bill, and actually I didn't hear

the discussion. It was something about, I will see you

tomorrow.

And Sam told the surveillance and all the other people

to forget it, and the Headquarters would take over.

And that is my knowledge, direct knowledge of what

Anderson and everybody else has stated.

Mr. Kirbow. Mr. Angleton, to your specific knowledge

did Bill evet

attempt to use the excellent contact he had in

Havana to carry out the mission of eliminating the leader down

there, or try to get any help out of him in that regard?

MI. Angleton. He knows that I would

have cut his throat.

intelligence service in the US in regard to the efforts

acquire nuclear technology or material?

Mr. Angleton.

No.

Let me just state my own feeling about some

this.

After

talked to me about having all those great sources

which were better than Hirsch's, he said,

Isa'l so

have talked

to

JEK Act 5 (9) 12) (D)

Well, I knew

right away that that

they would have been

In other words, in 22 years

I have

never known them to withhold

anything germain to our

common

activity. So that for American

jounalists to go and try

pump things out of me regarding

the subject, he wouldn't have

got home before -- that is the

first thing. That is the fact. And he said this Israeli

fellow said something

about,

something I don't discuss, or

words to that effect, I can't remember

that part of it.

So there

Hisn't much

more to

say about that.

Senator Mathias. And that the implication certainly of

this was that Oswald was an ex-Marine, and had been through

this process, and that therefore at least that he might have

been

acting within the context of the Soviet plan, is that

right?

Mr. Angleton. That is the thrust of what he was trying

to say. His English is such that it is very difficult.

Senator Mathias. I understand. But then some years

later -- my recollection is that you said it was in 1967 or

1969 -- you learned that the KGB had spent six month of

employment of their top operators in the investigation of the

Kennedy assassination, and wouldn't this fact in your mind

negate the implication of the original Golitzen call or that

they were involved?

MI. Angleton. I want to congratulate you, because that

man is a man who is also a suspect of Nosenko.

Senator Mathias. You mean in 1967?

Mr. Angleton. Just to show you the ground you are

treading on, Golitzen gave

us information regarding

the

penetration of our own organization. And we worked down to an

identity. And the FBI disagreed with us. And I am

talking

about not a few minutes, but

several weeks and months of work.

And the Bureau's attitude was, you have got the wrong man, and

the allegation therefore does not affect the CIA, and we

advise that you send it to the Army.

And I might add, the man who wrote that memorandum was

the Burt Turner I mentioned who was one of the competent

FBI analysts. So it was in limbo. And we stated that "X"

was the penetration agent, and the Bureau refused to accept

that. And in 1967 a Soviet - on whom we had a dossier on

this

thing, because he was once stationed in India, and therefore

we knew who he was, and all the rest of it -- with an unknown

coming to us as Nosenko was, he was a real man, we had years

of surveillance on him, and

so on. And he came, and he

alleged -- and he was a. TDC, temporary duty in Washington

here -- and he established contact with the first Mrg. Helms.

• And eventually I was called to take the case. And he stated

that among his missions to the US was to effect the

redefection

of the return to the Soviet Union of a man, and that man was

the man whom we had identified as a Soviet agent. And he went

into the whole background, that this man was one of the

highest grade illegals that they had ever had, and he was in

our Agency.

So this had a tremendous impact on Burt Turner, because

he was one of the two interrogating officers. And I can't

talk to you about professional pride, but for a man of his

competence to have done it the wrong way, that hurt.

So I had a question injected, which was, what do you know

about George Blake?

And then his response was, he says, we thin

he is dead.

Now, hwere 1s a man who is supposed to be Special

Assistant to the Head of Counterintelligence in KGB, whose

mother was a secretary to Litvinov, and he comes therefore

from the aristocracy, as Nosenko does, because his father was

the Minister of Maritime Affairs. And there is a statue of

Nosenko's father.

And Golitzen had told us that men chosen

for very dangerous

missions of penetration and duplicity came

from the aristocracy. Everyone trusted them, and their fathers

and their families are heroes of the Soviet Union.

So here was this man who said as to Blake, we think he

ig

dead.

Two to three weeks later is when Blake escaped

from

Scrubb's woods to the Soviet Union. Now, if he had come to

the US to exfiltrate as the Special Assistant to the Head of

Counterintelligence, to exfiltrate a person who worked in

the West as an illegal from the end of world War II, and

gradually worked into us, why wouldn't he have known the

ria.

exfiltartion plans of George Blake, which would have been

simultaneous, because he was a Headquarters man here on TDC.

So we handled him for six or seven weeks.

And some of the most telling parts of the interrogation

was that when he went back to the Soviet Union he would have

access to archives. And what was on our mind, and what

cryptonym that we wanted him to work up -- and this would

relate to the third part of the damage part on Golitzen --

what did Golitzen know that they did not know he knew? What

agents in the West could be under our control as a result of

Golitzen's disclosures regarding those things?

And you can see the tremendous quallty this man had of

almost getting from

our man those four or five crytonyms,

which would have told them what they wanted to know, because

there are cases they are not sure whether he knows of doesn't

know, and

so on. And these are officials, and so on.

So he wasn't given that. He was given stuff that was

sort of medium low level stuff, you couldn't call it chicken

feed -- but we never told him we disbelieved in him. And he

said, if you do those things for me, I have an opportunity,

because of my mother and so on, to become Head of the American

Department of the KGB.

And the other thing he wanted, was, we took him to the

Soviet Agency and we came out later for contacts, and he stated

there was a telegram there, and he had been requested to

acquire all the information possible on the whereabouts of

Golitzen

and Nosenko. And I was actually in Wisconsin. And

I called my Deputy long distance and I said, if there is

any

proposal put up by that individual that would expose -- and I

use the crytonym name of Golitzen -- don't.

Coming back to what you stated, with our litmus paper and

with our analysis of him, we treated him as a walk-in, as a

part of the thing to confirm Nosenko's bona fides, and the

build-up. And he is the one who gave the full description of

the fact that for six months the place was immobilized for this

investigation, of all the high level all over the works, is

the way he put it.

Senator Mathias. You contrasted the way that the Russians

treat a returned defector, ahd

the way we treat

them.

And

in that connection, to your

knowledge was Oswald every

interrogated when he teturned from Russia?

Mr. Angleton. I don't know - I probably would know, but

I don't know whether the military -- normally that would fall

within the jurisdiciton of the military, since he was a

military man who defected. So I don't know' the answer to that.

Senator Mathias.

What

MI. Angleton. I can't

answer that.

Senator Mathias. Or at any time?

MI. Angleton. I think the Bureau interviewed him.

Senator Mathias. The Bureau, not the CIA?

MI. Angleton. I am

certain we never did, no.

Senator Mathias. But you think the FBI did?

MI. Angleton. That is just my sensation that they did.

Senator Mathias. We will follow that up.

Senator Baker. What would you do, Mr. Angleton, to

to rehabilitate the Agency in particular in counterintelli-

gence capability, since you feel that it is deteriorating,

what things in particular would you do?

MI. Angleton. My feeling is that the Agency has to go

through

the purgatory that -- these fires that no man would

put out --

and therefore let it be

shocking or whatever. And

let all the political repercussions

take place, and if you go

to purgatory, my

dew is, the bigger

the fires, the better.

So my view is, let ithall come

out.

And let people take the

consequences. I am notea believer that an agency can have

And I don't believe that the
