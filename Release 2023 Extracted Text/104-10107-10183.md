2. By 5 July 1956, the fourth flizht, the USSR was aware

purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.

one positive action was the standown of civil flights while the

=ission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action wich is

believed related is the moving of MIG-19 aircraît into Eest

terrany and Peland on 7 July 1956. Also MIG-19's were novsa

into Jungary at about this time.

3. The performance of the Soviet systen on the 5 July mission,

was indeed curious.

While the action evident iron COMI

is not clear an explanation which appears to lit the known facts

is offered as follows:

As a, result oi the previous nissions, the

Soviets had concluded the essential facts concerning the missions,

1.e., that they were for reconcaissance,

that they flew above 65,000

leet, and that a panetration as deep as loscow was possible. They

probably surnised that the 5 July mission was headed for boscow wher

te track appeared on a northeastarly heading. The loss of the

target when it entered Soviet territory was probably deliberate and

the "red herring" track returning to the wast was eitker a dodge

or a convenience to avoid brozacasting a track for all the system

to ses that a "hostile or intruder" was coning over Moscow with no

cans available to stop it.

This idea is supported by the use

of a raid nunber assigned in the region just beyond the point

were the track had been "lost".

In addition, the track tas not

Labeled "costile or intruder" when it ras broadcast ziter it

had sassed beyond Moscow. The reporting of the track when it did

appear was only by Moscow and it has been suggested that other

seations had been instructed not to broadcast the track. Further, it my

cr ay not be a coincidence that the heignt brcadcast was almost

exactly half of the true altitude of the mission aircraft, but on

tze sext missions, four days later, the altitude reporting vas

consistently above 50,000 feet.

4. By 9 July 1956, in addition to the evident recogrition of

ize great height of the mission flights,

tracking was better and

in general the performance of the warning system was much improved.

The next day, 10 July 1956, the Soviet air defense warning)

systal closed a 3000 mile track with only two short periods of

confusion or track loss.

Altitude reporting was over 60,000 feet

rth one plot passed 68,800 which was only 100 feet off target.

The first cight missions proved that the air defense warning

sisten is deplojed in depth.

This was evident fron both the continuity
