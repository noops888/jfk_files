In reference the Station indicated that unless reference

government,

the benefits to be derived from

the Cecil B. ARLISS-reference Identity B contact (i.e.. a

continuing

indirect connection with the Frente Civico and

Incidential information reports) would not be of sufficient

value to warrant continuation of the contact.

To date,

as far as the Station is aware, reference

Identity D has not been appointed to any Cabinet

position.

Further, there is no indication that former

President Aleman intends to

re activate the Frente Civico into

a movement which would be of MHSPAWN interest at this juncture.

3.

ARLISS has accordingly been instructed to phase out the

contact with

reference Identity B and the Frente Civico upon

his return from his U.S. trip

in January 1965.

"Before lis

departure ARLISS gave reference Identity B an advance of 4000
