ADMINISTRATIVE
One copy of this report is designated for Phila-
delphia for information inasmuch as there are outstanding
leads in this division.
During interview of Mr. KEITH WADE, subject ap-
peared and said he understood the FBI was investigating him.
He voluntarily furnished information set forth in instant
report.
Subject advised that KATHLEEN ANN BERNS was the
victim of a vicious rape attack on August 25, 1961, at
which time she was taken to a hospital, is in poor physical
condition, and is extremely nervous from this experience
and the following police interrogation.
:
In view of her physical condition, and the fact
that she is living with the subject, she was not interviewed.
The interview of subject on July 24, 1961, was
handled under the caption "GEORGE DAMAN, IMPERSONATION",
which was subsequently closed administratively. At that time
a search of the indices failed to reveal the existence of
the Neutrality Matter, Impersonation case under his correct
name.
