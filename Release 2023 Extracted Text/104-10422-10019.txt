SECTION II
In addition to specific action taken by the Agency as given
above, Headquarters components, Headquarters personnel on TDY, and
field units reacyed as shown below:
a. On 22 November, Mexico City Station directed Headquarters'
attention to previous traffic relating to Lee Harvey OSWALD and
asked for a photograph of OSWALD in order to compare it with avail-
able photographs in the Station which might be of the assassin. The
Station indicated that it was forwarding as soon as possible copies
of a photograph of the only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on 28 [sic
1] October who could (might) by identical with OSWALD. MEXI-
7014 (IN 66781)]
A subsequent cable sent the same day from Mexico City indica-
ted that the Station had photographs of the same unidentified Ameri-
can (referred to in the above cable) who is possibly OSWALD entering
the Cuban Embassy on 15 October. [MEXI-7019 (IN 66846)]
b. On 22 November, the Agency's Station in Miami reported
13-00000
18
that OSWALD of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee had participated in
a debate in August 1963 on the New Orleans radio station, WDSU.
OSWALD was a former Marine who had gone to Moscow in 1959 where he
renounced his American citizenship. [WAVE-8049 (IN 66782)]
c. On 23 November, the Chief, SR/CI forwarded a memorandum
to the Assistant Deputy Director, Plans, in which the latter's atten
tion was drawn to the fact that OSWALD had been in contact on 28
September 1963 with Soviet Consul Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV.
According to current information available to SR/CI, KOSTIKOV was a
known KGB officer and considred to be a member of the KGB's Thir-
(sabotage and assassination)
teenth Department/of the First Chief Directorate.
According to the
FBI liaison officer, the FBI had reason to believe that OSWALD'S
visit was to get Soviet support for a United States passport or visa
matter. Chief, SR/CI closed by saying that he had reported OSWALD'S
connections with a known member of the Thirteenth Department to the
FBI liaison officer at 1030 hours on 23 November 1963.
[Memorandum for ADDP, 23 November 1963 (file no. SX-25550)]
d. On 23 November, the Mexico City Station forwarded to Head-
quarters the names of three persons who had flown from Mexico to the
United States, during the first twelve days of November, who might
have been identical with Lee Harvey OSWALD. [ΜΕΧΙ-7020 (IN 66891)]
e. On 24 November, the Mexico City Station reported to Head-
quarters that the United States Consulate in Nuevo Laredo had infor-
mation that OSWALD had entered Mexico at Nuevo Laredo on 26 Septem-
ber traveling on Mexican Tourist Card no. 24085 and had left Mexico
by auto [sic] on 3 October 1963 at Nuevo Laredo. [MEXI-7040 (IN
-67261)]
f. On 24 November, the Chief, SR/CI, forwarded a memorandum
to the Assistant Depauty Director, Plans, in which he quoted a cable
sent by Chief, SR Division, who was, at that time, in Frankfurt.
The latter asked the question if OSWALD was not unwittingly or
wittingly a part of a plot to murder the President in Dallas as an
attempt to exacerbate further sectional strife and render the United
States Government less capable of dealing with Soviet initiatives

over the next year. The Chief of SR continued by suggesting that
if AELADLE's. (Anatoliy Mikhaylovich GOLITSYN) views on (Harold)
WILSON and the information noted in paragraph 1c below have any
substance (and they cannot be ignored), this suggests that we can
expect major Soviet pressures over the next several months, for w
which the Soviets have made careful, lon-range preparations.
Paragraph la:
"Within minutes of the first news, Moscow radio
statements as heard in London attributed the assassina-
tion to 'right-wing elements'. Only as the true iden-
tity of the believed assassin became known did Moscow
begin to complain that United States reactionnaries
were using OSWALD as a pawn."
Paragraph 1b:
"Should not the assignment of 13th Department officers
to the KGB Residency in the United Nations in New York
be considered in a new light?"
Paragraph 1c:
-"I discovered from Arthur MARTIN MI-5) during our
long and exceptionally valuable discussions, that
one of Harold WILSON's principal scientific advisers
is Captain Ian MAXWELL, who has a long Soviet intelli-
gence background. This may shed newlight on AELADLE's
report, i.e., that Harold WILSON may be a Soviet agent."
Chief, SR/CI, pointed out that the SR Chief's comments come
without benefit of traces passed earlier to the ADDP sowing that
OSWALD had contact with a 13th Department representative in Mexico-
City. Chief, SR/CI, ended by indicating that another recently ar-
rived cable suggests that OSWALD's business with the Soviet Consul
was connected with his own visa to the USSR and Cuba and may,
therefore, have been

g. On 24 November, the Agency's Station in Miami reported
information received from the local FBI representative.
The latter
13-00000

had received a request from his Headquarters to ascertain the vera-
city, including sources, of a statement made by DRE leader, Jose
LLANUSA Gobel, to the effect that Fidel CASTRO had threatened lives
of United States leaders in the event of United States aggression
against Cuba. LLANUSA attributed the above threats to Fidel CASTRO
who made these remarks during a reception in early September 1963
at the Brazilian Embassy in Havana. [WAVE-8133 (IN 67394)]
h. On 25 November 1963, the Mexico City Station also called
Headquarters' attention to an AP story datelined Havana, 7 September
1963. At a reception held at the Brazilian Embassy, CASTRO is
quoted as haveing said: "We are prepared to fight them and answer
in kind. United States leaders shouldthink [sic
consider?] that
if they are aiding terrorist plans to eleminate the Cuban leaders,
they themselves will not be safe." [MEXI-7055 JIN 67620)]
