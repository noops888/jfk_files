On occasion he utilizes sources in the vatican. Some of the men

under his control are on various foreign assignments in Europe and

are responsible only to him. Most of them are traveling under.

DuTing

the past several months Angleton has been very

cooperative with the Bureau.

He has volunteered voluminous infor

mation of interest to the Bureau and he has followed Bureau leads

in an effective manner.

Much of the information which Angleton

has furnished appears

in the raw form,

actual reports received from Angleton's sources. This has been of

advantage because the Bureau has been in a position to better evaluate

the information instead of waiting for the delay and processing through

normal channels in the CIA. In addition to information regarding

security matters furnished by Angleton, he has also been of valuable

assistance by keeping the Liaison Agent apprised of administrative

changes and reorganization within the CIA. Angleton is thoroughly

informed regarding the foreign intelligence activities of his agency

and he frequently clarifies motters which the CIA sometimes camouflages

For your information, Angleton was instructed by General

Walter Bedell smith, while he was still Director of the CIA, Lto

cooperate fully with the Liaison Agent and was told that he,

Angleton, could disseminate any information he saw fit. This policy

has continued under Allen Dulles.

Since the volume of information received from Angleton

hos increased the Liaison Agent has endeavored

to encourage Angleton

to establish some uniformity in the dissemination of information to
