MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

1. Iphoned Paul Burns, Special Assistant to the DDO, and

said that we had some leads that could be followed by whoever has

the action in the DDO in tracking down Hunt's activities during the

fall of 1964, when he was alleged to have been engaged in surveillance

activities of Barry Goldwater.

I said that our files shoed Hunt was in DO Division (Burns

was not familiar with that title, but recognired it as the predecessor

of FR Division) and in August 1964 was assigned to the Washington

field office. I suggested that Stan Gaines, who was Deputy Division

Chief of DO Division and now DCOS Bonn, might he in a position to

give a few groups on what Hunt was supposed to be doing then. I

suggested that he be queried by cable.

Burns said Gaines is staying

on under contract for a while, so would continue to be avallable,

3. I said that Fig Coleman ivas on the Iberian desk when the

Hunt assignment to Madrid was brought up in 1964 and when Hunt

went to the field in 1965;

He could give the background on the assign-

ment, which seems to have been through Karamessines ät Helms!

direction. His recollection would give leads. I told him that Coleman

became COS Madrid later, after Hunt left Spain, and could provide

information on what Hunt did not do for the Agency during that period.

I suggested that both Helms and Karamessines should be queried.

I gave as a possible press treatment that Hunt was engaged in

domestic operations (something Senator Baker is pursuing) and that,

his assignment to Spain after the election could be presented as giving

him time to cool off. I thought we had to pursue the matter to be

sure we know the facts.

4, lasked Burns to be sure that we are on information distribution

of cables to the field on this, given our assigned responsibility for

keeping files on Watergate.

He said we are on the PLMHPLAN for.

messages to Helms. He would advise the action officer. I said we are

available for any help we can give.

MEMORANDUM FOR: OPS/ RMO

SUBJECT

: Watergate File Research - Final Report

The files of the immediate office of the Chief, OPS/OSG

have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this

memorandum. The check included chronological files of communt-

cations of which I was

the author while assigned to Madrid, Spain

•in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.

2.

I have attempted to recollect any other details which

conceivably could be pertinent and which relate to the period

of my assignment to Madrid.

The only points which I recall but

on which I have no documentation are these:

There were. occasional joshing. inquiries made of me

by American residents of Madrid about the reported presence

in Spain of E. Howard Hunt in 1972. My standard reply was.

that I knew only what I had heard rumored:

For the record,

at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never known of his

having tried to contact any Station personnel in Spain during

the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain:

whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by

any Station member.

b.

A Station officer, possibly Richard Ouderkirk, now

assigned to Guatemala, was given some information by an

informant in 1972 concerning reported activities in Spain

by Robert Vesco.

I suggested that the information be given

informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John

Oliver: That officer was charged with keeping abreast of

developments related to Vesco.

The Station did. not pursue

that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of

reportable.

interest, according to requirements.of the period.

MENORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

SUBJECT

: Howard Hunt

1.

At the recent request of the Deputy Director for

Nanagement and Services, the Office of Finance has searched

its records to determine if we could find any payment to

Mr: Hunt in an anount of approximately $30,000 that required

no accounting.

2. We have searched the following records:

•&.

The expense runs for the period July 1964 to

June 1973 for the immediate Office of the DCI,

the immediate Office of the DD/P, FI Staff

CI Staff, CA Staff and the Office of Security.

We have checked various items that were re-

flected in these expense records but have

identified nothing relating to Mr. Hunt.

b.

The Madrid Station, JMWAVE and FR/Washington

Office accountings to determine if there were

funds passed by the Stations to Mr. Hunt during

the year he served under non-official cover in

Madrid. We could find no payment to Mr. Hunt

pseudonyms.

c..

Mr. Hunt's travel claims for the period

1960-1972 and have found nothing

in these

travel claims that were not consistent with

normal trável expenses, i.e., transportation,

per diem.

We made a specific analysis of Mr. Hunt's.

SUBJECT: Howard lunt

determined that $33,500 was advanced to him

for travel and transportation of household

goods to and from Madrid with one trip to

Paris for he and his family to renew their

Spanish visas.

All of this

advance was fully

accounted for.

However,

in his accounting,

one item appeared unusual.

It was

an

expenditure of $1,600 for a sensitive

operation which was approved foi write-off by Mr.

Desmond Fitzgerald on i June 1966 without

further accounting.

Also,

we confirmed that no other Agency advance accourts

wore established for Mr. Hunt during this period.

. 4.

At the beginning of his non-official cover toutine

it

was necessary to establish a bank account in his name.

EUR Division accordingly requested we open an account at the

Chase Manhattan Bank in Mr.

Hunt's name to receive all non-

salary payments.

(MT. Hunt had an account at Riggs National

Bank to receive

his

salary and allowance payments):

The

following deposits were made to the account during 1965 and

1966:

Account opened: 13 July 1965

All of the above have been accounted for by submission

of travel and transportation accounting$:

S.

We feel at this time hithout

specific guidelines that

further searching would be sonewhat

fruitless.

One

strange

aspect of the non-official cover assignment in Madrid is that

all the costs were charged to the support allotment of the

EUR Division which is not normal as non-official cover people

are usually assigned to a project.

It is unusual to have a

case officer abroad for one year on an operational assigment

without him incurring operational eapenditures.

SUBJECT: Howard Hunt

The Offico of Finance has not found operational

expenditures except for the $1,600 mentioned above.

Therefore, it is suggested that Mr. Karamessings be questioned

as to a project of projects to which Mr. Hunt's operational

expenditures if incurred would have been charged.

7. Another possible course of action is to request the

Dircctor to approve my

asking. a

at Chase

Manhattan Bank to provide a transcript of all entries into

Mr. Hunt's Chase Manhattan Bank account.

We are currently

reviewing records of all cashier's

MEMORANDUNG FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: E. Howard Hunt

1. I spoke with Fig Coleman about Hunt's assignment to Spain.

I had spoken with him back in August when we were inquiring into

roported activities involving Mrs. Hunt.

Coleman said that he got out of the War College in May 1964

(by which he fixed the time), and took over the Iberian desk. Bill

Ryan was C/EUR (or was it WE Division at the time). In early autumn

Ryan said that he had just been informed by the DDP (Karamegaines)

that Hunt was to be assigned to Madrid as DCOS, as a directed assign-

ment by Helms. A memo was prepared and sent to the COS, Jim Noel

(now rotired). There was nothing further for about a month when Ryan

called Colemar. in and showed him a RYBAT letter from Noel stating

that Ambassador Stanley J. Woodward would not have Hunt in the

Embassy.

3. Woodward had been the Ambassador to Uruguay when Hunt

wAs COS Montevideo. He had a low opinion of Hunt and was counting

tho days until Hunt left. The President of Uruguay visited President

Eisenhower in the States, at which time he requested a personal favor-.

that Hunt be reassigned to Montovideo. - So Hunt took another tour.

Woodward was outraged, and had his revenge in 1964 when Hunt was

to be sent as DCOS to Madrid.

4. Aíter a couple of months--early 1965--Ryan called Coleman

in and; observing that there was more than one way to skin a cat,

told him that Hunt was going to Spain under nonofficial cover., This

didn't require anything special, Ryan saying thät he didn't know

much about it. It carie to him from Karamessines on Helms' order:

Hunt was to have the telephone number of the COS, but he would do

nothing for the

station. Hunt was to submit administrative vouchers

for reimbursement of his expenses and they were to be paid. Coleman

said he never saw Hunt beiore he went out. He knows that there was

no operational reporting, to indicale that Hunt was doing anything.

---

## Page 10

14-00000

CONZDEMTIAL

The vouchers were not large, although the documentation was poor.

Coleman raised the question with Ryan about his signing off, and

Ryan said he could talk to Karamessines if he wished. Because

Coleman had a close personal association with Karamossines he

did just that. He was told by karamessinos that he didn't krow much

about it either--"Helms said send him out," He was instructed to go

ahead.

In carly. July 1966 (4 July) Coloman went to Madrid. He

had a ten day turnover ivith Jim Noel. Hunt had already gone and

he did not see him. Noel said ho didn't know what Hunt did, but

that Coleman need not worry because ho was gone.

Several months ago Noel was at a seminar at which

Ambassador Woodward was also present. At the time he asked

about. Hunt.

Woodward said it might still be dragged into the press.

Tad Szulc had been after Woodward about the Hunt assignment to

Spain. Coleman observed that Szule did have a long article on Hunt

in the New York Times, and the Spain assignment was mentioned,

but without any conclusions as to its significance.

7. Colemin said the RYBAT file of C/EUR may have something on

the event, but not much. A letter out and the reply, but not much more.

the subject of Mr.. E. Howard Hunt.

During the perioc

of NT. Hunt's

assignment as a Contract talke A arent

to Madrid between July 1965 and September 1966, Mr.

Ryan had been the Deputy Chief of the Western European

Division, Deputy Director for Plans.

The purpose of

the intervicw was to determine if Mr. Ryan had any

infornation bearing on the matter of the operational

assignment of Mr. Hu.t during this period.

2.

Mr.

Ryan stated that the assignment of Mr.

Hunt both to the European Division and to. Madrid was

handled without benefit of the routine processing

procedures through the Western European Division.

Mr. Hunt's assignment vas coordinated and directed

by Mr. Thomas Karamessines, the Assistant Deputy Director

for Plans:.

With regard to operational duties, Mr. Ryan

was unaware of any

specific project or target

for. Mr.

Hunt.

Ni. Ryan made the specific observation that if

Me. Hunt producca positive intelligence on the Iberian

target during this period the officials responsible

for this effort within.

the Western European Division

were totally unavare.of it.-

Mr. Ryan stated that most of his knowledge of

Mr. Munt's activity and the nature of his assignment

during this period came more. througl hearsay than

For example, he cited the

connent made by a mutual acquaintance of his and Mr.

Munt's to

the effect that dr.. Hunt stated that while

in Nadrid he was going to "play golf and trite books."

Mr. Ryan re:

sponded

that he was personally not dare of any such

He added as an expression of personal

opinion that Mr.. Hunt had no operational function and

was simply granted the opportunity to write books for

his own personal gain at Government expense during this

period.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Conversation with Sama Halpern

I. I met with Sam Halpern for about 20 minutes this morning

in GGl0; where he is cleaning up some details before he goes to

his new assignment as DC/DCD.: I told him generally about our

attempt to reconstruct Howard Hunt's assignments and financial

transactions,

and asked him particularly for recollections he may.

have of Hunt's assignment in Spain in mid-1965 to the fall of 1966.

2. Halpern said that he has no recollection about such an

assigament. In June 1965 he moved from WH Division with Des

FitzGerald when he became the DD/P.: At about that time

Halpern's father died and he was in New. York for the funeral

and ten days of religious observations followiny that. " He was back

in mid-June and in and out from then on as he got ready to attend

the National War College which began in August.. He did not return

to. that office until the end of June 1966.

3.

Halpern observed that daring this period Karamessines

was ADDP with Helms moving up to be DDCI. He thought it entirely

possible that Helms and Karamessines could have handled this

on their own.

Halpern said that Evan Parker had come into the office

of the DD/P shortly before Helms became DDCI, and had returned

from Honolulu for that purpose. He stayed on fo. FitzGerald until

Halpern returned from the National War College. He suggested

someone might talk to Evan Parker who may have known something

about it (although ha may noi). He aiso suggested talking to Georgia.

after the initial meeting, Mr. Mullen mentioned having

net Mr. Hunt some years previousl) in Paris, France.

organizations including Reader's Digest and the Kennecott

Copper Company.

Through the offices of the Mullen Company

an intervier was arranged with the General Foods Corpora-

tion, a Mullen client.

Mr. O'Nalley stated there was

disappointment that Mr. Hunt had been unsuccessful in

"selling himself" during any of these interviers and that

no job offers had resulted.

being

shown. in Mr. Hunt's post-employnent placement;

for possiule referral of other dyency retirees.

O'Nalley also understood that there vas Cover and Con-

mercial Siaff interest in the mullen Company, ard that

Mr, Hunt becane instrumental in discussing

screral.aspects

of the cover operations in his capacity as an officer of

the company.

Mr. O'Malley recalled referring various

Agency officers to Mr. Hunt for guidance when these indi-

viduals expressed an interest in entering the public

relations field.

Mr. O Malley did recall disappointent

in. feelirg Mr. Hunt had generally been less helpful on

these occasions.

5.

Mr. Hunt contacted Mr. O'Malle) on several occasions

requesting referral

of retiring Agency employees with

specific qualifications.

These instances occurred apparent-

lj after ir. Hunt had assuned his responsibilities with

the White House.

In one instance Nr. Hunt requested re-

ferral of a recently retired Agency secretary..

previous memoranda and discussions, Mr. O'Naile) Nas unable

to recall the name of this individual.

lle did, horever,

state that he is quite certain Mr. Hunt turnea down the

individual whom he referred. As a point of clarification,

hit. O'Malley said that this individual had not previously

been known

to. Ar. Hunt, nor had she previously vorked

for him in

any capacity. Mi. O'"alley also recalled a

request from Mr. Hunt for an individual having stilis in

the area of locks and surreptitious entry.

A resume of

Mi. Thomas C. Amato was provided to Nr. Hunt at that time.

It'is Mr. O'Malley's recollection that Mr.

Hunt specifically

stated that a person with Mr. Amato's qualifications was

nceded in connection with a requirement of the Howard

Hughes Organization in Las Vegas, Nevada. Mr. O'Malley

stated the opinion' that it was his impression that the

duties involved rould include the monitoring of a listening

device in an undisclosed location.

Mr.. O'Malley reiterated

his understanding that Mr. Anato did not accept Mr. Hurt's

iffer of employment.

Mr. 'Malley then recalled request from ir. Hunt

for a roconmendation of a

security service

to carry out an clectronic.counterneasures "sweep."

O'Malley recommended

the lackenhut Corporation.

O'alley recalled that tr. Hunt coprossed dissatisfaction

that suggestion in

vieved as that firm's political crientation.

Part hecause of what Mr. dient

dir. O'Nalley

did not claborate further on that romari.

Mr. O'Nalley

then suggested the use of Anderson Security Consultants,

incorporated, i commercial cover entity of the Office of

Security.

Mr. O'Malley stated that insofar as

organization vas advertised in the jollo

pages and that

Hr. Hunt could ba assured of the reliability of the ser-

vices, he felt this to be a reasonable suggestion.

'walle) stated that during a subsequent phone call when

.. O'Malley asked how his suggestion had worked out

"Yes, they had done a fine jou."'

his associations with Mr. Hunt he felt Mr. Hunt was in

the habit of making glib connents which were not neces-

sarily accurate in order to pass over a subject. Mr,

O'Nalley stated that this was categorically so.

He said

he was sure that Mr. Hunt had lied

to hin on a number of

occasions and that, therefore, he vas in no position to .

be sure that Mr. Hunt had actually, in fact, used

services of Anderson Security Consultants.

Mr. O'Malley

volunteered the opinion that he suspected the electronic

counterneasures "sweep" was to be carried out in the offices

of the Committce to Re-elect the President.

In response to a question as to whether lie had

over referred anyone to McCord Associates, Mr. O'Malley

replied that he remembered having referred Walter Brayden.

Mr.

Brayden for a time acted as bodyguard to Mrs. Martha

Mitchell.

As an aside Mr. O'Malley mentioned

that Mr.

Brayden had refused to carry a fircaim in spite of the :

fact that Mr.

NcCord told him he could do so on the author-

ity of the Attorney General. Asked specifically if he had

ever referred either Willian Shea or Teresa Shea to Mr.

NicCord, Mr. O'Malley stated that he did not recall spécif-

ically referring Teresa Shea and that he was sure that he

had not referred William Shea to hin.

So, contrary to

previous statements, it is now Mr. O'Malley's belief that

in all probability Mrs. Shea was not iefcrred by this

Agency to Mr. McCord:

1. On the morning of 14 February 1974 Messrs.

Frederick Evang and

Lawrence Howe interviewod Mr. Raymond

The puryose of the intorvior was to follo: up on infor-

nation

contained in Office of Security files which stated

the belief that individuals in the Counter Intolligenco

Operationg office had knowledgo of the writing acrivitios

of Mi. E. Howard Hunt.

This belief was a mattor of record

in the files of the former Security Research Staff and wag

sitributed to Mr. Paul Gaynor, now ratirod, and Mr. Edward

Sayla.

2.

During this interview Mr. Roces

was specifically

astad whather or not he had knowledge of tho existence of

any forn of official sponsorship or encouragement to Mt.

E. Howard Hunt to writo novals to inprove

tho image of

this Agency: Additionally, Mr. Rocca was asked whether

or not any assistarca was ever requasted of the Counter

Intelligence Operations offico to be provided to Mr. Hunt

or whether or not that staff had evor had any relationship

with Mr. Hunt whatsoever.

In response to these questions

Mi. Roccs rosponded "on the record! that he has no morledge

of any such arrangaments nor at any time was he party to any

assistance or any taquests for assistance to Mr. Hunt. Mr.

Rocca stated that

the particular section which he had been

nost actively concerned in the past yoars was responsible

for handiing a variety of tasks categorized under the area

of "sotting the record

straight."

In this senso,

the "image"

nission of the offica was to countor misinfornation: cur-.

rently in ¿he media or othervise believed to be part of an

effort to discredit the Agency. Mr: Rocca fauly that any

assumption that Nt. Hunt was engaged in any form of Agoncy

sponsored inags activity would have probably load to the

conclusion that it was done under the Counter Intolligence

Cperations.

• However, Mr. Rocca emphatically stated that

chis was not the

case.

of any Agency involvement in that effort.

2. Gen. Gaynor advised that his memory is not altogether clear

on the matter, and that he was "reaching," but stated that has he

reconstructs the matter:

He became aware that Hunt, while in WH, was accomplishing

a steady flow of spy books, and that security approval was not being re-

quested on the manuscripts before submission to publishers. He stated

that this actiricy Continued later, as he recalls it, in CI Staff, and

agreed with idca that the volume of writings was suíficient to indicate

that a great of time vas involved in Hunt's writing.) Gen. Gaynor advised

that he raised the issue "up front" on several occasions.. The icaction

he recieved to his raising the issue was that "leop your stinking nose out

of this business." He stated that he was lead to balieve that Mir. Helms

desired to improve the image of the intelligence.profession and the Agency

and that Huag's books were a part of the program to du so.

He stated that:

ke was never told outright that this was the case, but the responses he

recieved lead him to belice this was the case.

b. He suggested that tvo people might be able to assist in clearing

SUBJECT:

Terence S. CRABANAC - Retention of

Royalties by a Contract Employee

1. You have requested the opinion of this Office in regard to

the retention of future royalties which might be carned by Terence S.

CRABANAC as a result of his literary eloris. We believe that he is

entitled to retain such royalties withou. an offset against his Agency

salary.

We have been advised by Mi. Gee Stevens, WE/Support, that

CRABANAC!s cover does not include the role of a writer; CRABANAC'S

cover for status will only be a light ons of a retired Foreign Servica

Officer. Therefore, paragraph? of his contract dated 4 July 1965 may

remain as written.

Royalties from the fictional works, that he writes as

a profitable hobby will not be emoluments received from or through his

"cover activitios."
