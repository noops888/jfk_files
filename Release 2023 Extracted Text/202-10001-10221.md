PHASE I (CLA)

ACTIVITY

INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS

1. * Dispatch one intelligence

agent operation to key area

selected by ClA.

L. 15 March 1962

PURPOSE

CONSIDERATIONS

Collect and report intelligence on anti-

regime attitudes, on potential resist..

ance, and on vulnerabilities and

strengths of Communist security

system.

There is a risk that this action will disclose this U.S.

intelligence activity within Cuba.

Selected personnel

are being intensively trained.

This firet team has 2

agents.

An area in which resistance has been reported

has been selected.

Agent operations must stay alive.

make useful contacts, and report securely to CIA.

Physical risk to personnel is substantial, due to lack

of intelligence. First reports from first team are

expected by the end of March, while reports from the

second and third teams, dispatched in March, are ex-

pected to start in April.

Many of the agents infiltrated into Cuba will be trained

for paramilitary skille as well as intelligence collection,

with the thought that they will be in place inside Cuba

and ready to act whenever paramilitary operationa are

decided upon. However,. ClA has noted that, once the

agenta are inside Cuba, they cannot be controlled

effectively from outside Cuba, although every effort :

will be made to attempt such control.

These stall intelligence officere may also be used in the

future for communications of agent handling, if future

developments warrant.

2. 3 third-country intelligence

stall officers in place in

Havana.

To collect intelligence.

3. Z third-country trained intel-

ligence officere, readied to

travel in Cuba for temporary

periods.

To collect intelligence.

and to provide security against Com-

5, t

Periodic intelligence esti

mates, as required by progress

of operations.

To up-date NIE 85-62, 8o that current

estimates can be considered at national

policy levels,

CONSIDERATIONS

This operation, in response to early recommendation

as essential by the Chief of Operations, is moving at

utmost speed to become fully active by 15 March, with

a new building completed and occupied,

and with a

staff of 43 at work.

Operations commenced 15 February

and, as of 9 March, 33 people were active at the Center.

(ClA responsibility, with support by Defense, Justice,

State, USIA.)

As the operationa develop, there will be both increased

intelligence collection and a need for as current an In

telligence Estimate as the U.S. can produce meaningfully.

It is likely that a more informal method of producing an

Intelligence Estimate for use at the national level (than

now governing the issuance of NIE's) may have to be

CLA is now publishing daily intelligence aum-

maries on Cuba and is planning a bi monthly or weekly

report summing up intelligence for this purpose. (CLA

responsibility, with support of othere as required.)

OTHER OPERATIONS

* Continue negotiating for

British help in contaminating

locomotive lubricants.

To cripple Cuba's rail transportation.

British assistance is required to undertake a successful

sabotage of Cuban locomotives, through contaminating

lubricante. It is expected that a minimum of 3 montha

is required before locomotives in Cuba start breaking

down, once the contaminant is introduced.

ACTIVITY

Establish 2 additional third

Cuba.

%By 1 March, have 105 agents

selected and 50 agents trained.

PURPOSE

To collect intelligence.

CONSIDERATIONS

To ready agent operationa.

10. * Develop intelligence potential

of Cuban "colonies" in U.S.

'To exploit the intelligence possi-

bilities of former residente of

Cuba (including U.S. citizens) now

in the United States.

11. * Develop additional interroga-

tion centers in other areas by

31 March 1962.

To collect intelligence in a Latin

atmosphere, at dillerent levele thai

now seem possible in the continental

U.S., to spot additional intelligence

asseta and to provide security

against Communiat agent operationa.

Elfectiveness and numbers are dependent upon purpose

of recruitment, nature of training, and policy decisions

controlling these factors.

If the recruitment and train

ing are for resistance activities,

the task of recruit

ment and training will be much less diflicult than if

they are limited to intelligence-collection purposes

only.

There are "colonies" in Washington, D.C., and other

U.S. cities which are "little Cubas," Family, Church,

and business interests provoke unusual, personal ties

inside Cuba for some of these

residents; a real potential

exists for collection of intelligence not otherwise avail-

able. (FBI support and coordination in basic in thie

elfort.)

Ae Opa-Locka becomes fully activated, CLA will a

other interrogation centere as promptly as feasibl

center is being activated in Spain. Negotiationg w

local authorities are being undertaken to activate centers,

To provide current intelligence on

key security resources of the

regime.

To provide current intelligence on the

actions and intentions of the regime.

Number of agents in each team and selection of areas

will be determined by developments of the previous

actions and by conditions.

Numbers, areas, and supplies are completely dependent

upon conditions at the time, and upon policy approval of

methods to be used (that is, if air delivery can be used,

or if this activity muat depend upon maritime delivery).

This evidence will be used by ClA and USIA to neutralize

the influence of Castro and the Communists in the West-

ern Hemisphere.

This is conceived of as ground surveys, and the possible

recruitment of military and other official personnel as

intelligence agents.

This requires attempts to place trained agents inside

government organizationa, or to defect officials "in place.

PURPOSE

To overtly engage the U.S. preatige in aup..

port of a Cuban revolt to an extent that would

require the U.S, to become involved in assur

ing the ultimate victory of a Cuban revolution;

thie involvement must include the commitment

of U.S, military forces as necessary to achieve

such victory.

mum readiness to meet the immediate neede of

the revolutionary forces.

The hazard of viability

in preparing for these support activities makes

security a paramount consideration.

Consistent with security aspect, U.S. milil

forces are placed in a state of readinesa to

accomplish the assigned mission.

The military

forces must be prepared to assiet in the mainte

nance of order until the revolutionary government

PURPOSE

Activities in consonance with U.S, policy

established after the April 196l failure in Cuba.

CONSIDERATIONS

These activities will have some negative impact

on the Cuban people, who are part of the largel, but

are consistent with an overt policy of isolating Castro

and neutralizing his influence in the Western Hemis-

phere.

They are noted here,

To develop increased "hard" intelligence.

To add to the U.S. intelligence coverage

on Cuba and possibly to strengthen the

concern of latin American stales for

security.

To ensure optimum implementation of the

intelligence plan.

To overthrow the Communist government

of Cuba.

TOP SECRET SENSITIVE

CONSIDERATIONS

Use of cays near Cuba entail unacceptable security

riske when vulnerable to Guban landing parties.

(Defense, in collaboration with ClA.)

Sensitivity of using this multi-national organiza-

tion clearly restricts potential use by USA.

Visi

bility of operational interest is an acceptable riak

here.

The intelligence plan requires support by U.S.

military manpower and equipment.

The U.S, military intervention inust be conducted

as quickly as possible and with sufficient force

so that the Communist Bloc's ability to take

effective counter measures is reduced to a

minimum.
