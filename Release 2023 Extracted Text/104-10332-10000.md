2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

1 .

SECRET

SUBJECT: Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues

(S) (LITAMIL-9) was a CIA penetration of the Cuban)

Embassy.

Unfortunately, his identity was indirectly and

inadvertently released in 1993 and, as a result, he was

identified in true name as a CIA agent in John Newman's book,

Oswald and the CIA, As Of 1993, LITAMIL-9 was still alive and

living in Mexico City with family in Cuba. To date, the ARRB

Board has agreed to protect his identity and crypt and delay the

release of his 201 file until the Agency could make some

judgments about the potential damage created by the release on

additional documents with his name/crypt in them. That will now

occur at the May meeting of the Board. It is, however,-unlikely

that the Board would agree to delay release until 2017 although

there is precedent for delaying release of records on individuals

for shorter periods or until death.

ISSUE 6 -- Richard Gibson (CIA Asset)

§12:

(S) Richard Gibson, who presently lives in England, is

a left wing journalist who was associated with the Fair Play For

Cuba Committee (FPFCC), an entity to which Oswald wrote letters

and claimed to be a member. Gibson did not become an Agency I

asset until after the assassination; however, he had been of

Tinterest to the FBI when he headed the FPFCC. Unfortunately, a

combination of previous releases led to press reports in

1994/1995 about his relationship with the CIA.

At that time, CIA

officers were dispatched to advise him about the possible

compromise and promise him the very best attempt at protecting

the relationship.^

release of any additional information until the Agency and FBI

The issue is scheduled for ARRB action at the

the Agency; however, the FBI has a four volume file which covers

both FBI interest and Gibson's relationship with the Agency. We

ISSUE 7 -- Certain Files of CIA Officials

14. (S) This is a major request encompassing "

• .. the

office files of the individual occupying the following positions

during the period 1959-1964."

• The Office of Deputy Director of Central Intelligence

General Charles Cabell, 1953-1962

General Marshall Carter, 1962-1965

• The Office of the Deputy Director for Plans

• Richard Bissell, 1958-1965

• Richard Helms, 1962-1965

•! The chronological files of C. Iracy Barnes, 1959-1964

• Office of General Counsel, Lawrence Houston, 1959-1964

• Operational Diaries of William Harvey, 1962-1963.

This request will by its very breadth require significant time on

the part of the directorate (and DCI) IROs. While it may appear

overly broad, we have developed a methodology with the ARRB staff

which provides the access required by the Board but guarantees

that their review is focused.

In sum, we work from shelf lists

to narrow the selection and then conduct file review sessions

with the ARRB staff; if material requested is particularly

sensitive, access can be limited to the ARRB Executive Director

or members of the Board. This effort will continue for some

time.

Conclusion

15. (AIUO) At the present time, 32 persons are involved in

the JEK records review and we anticipate that this level of

effort will increase to 37 by May and to 40 thereafter as we near

the statutory end of the Board (30 September 1998). However,

even if the Board is not extended (and it has been extended

previously), there are statutory tasks for CIA which will extend

12-18 months beyond the end of the Board's existence. Your

continued support is critical.

ARRB Meeting 13 May 1998 - Results

REFERENCE:

Lotus note dated 8 May - ARRB Meeting 12-13 May 1998

The JFK Board addressed six Agency issues at the 13 May meeting. The Agency's proposals prevailed in four of the six issues

of one-and one issue was tabled for further discussion. The Board made the following determinations:

1) Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses:

accepted our proposal to postpone release of specific information until 2017 and use generic substitute language.

21 LITAMIL-9 ICIA penetration of Cuban Embassy in Mexico City/considered a "key player" in the Oswald-Mexico

City story):

agreed to continue to protect the full crypt and delay the release of additional documents (201 file) until his death.

They set an annual review date on the documents; the Agency will need to advise NARA annually on his status.

‹ 3) Richard Gibson ( member of Fair Play for Cuba Committee during early 60's/considered a "key player in

-' Oswald's story/Agency asset beginning in 1965]:

agreed protect Gibson's relationship with the Agency and designated Agency and FBI files and documents

outside the JFK collection window, 1960-64, as NBRs (not believed relevant).

4) AMTRUNK Assets (AMTRUNK was an early 1960's anti-Cuban operation; most of the details of the operation

including crypts have been previously released]:

agreed to protect true name and 201 file numbers of assets not previously released.

5) Mark Lane Item (extract from foreign document):

postponed until 4 June meeting; board would like have a member or its staff confirm the existence of the

document and ensure that it contains no other JFK assassination related information.

6) Carlos Tepedino [CIA asset/ key figure in AMLASH-Cubela plot to kill Castro/true name and role in story has

been publicly known for years):

voted to release his name in the 1967 IG Report on Plots Against Castro and other JFK collection docurents

The Stone/Golitsyn issue was pulled from the agened and will be addressed at the next meeting (4 June).

This was a very successful meeting from the Agency's perspective. The loss on Tepedino was not unexpected. Given what is

in the public domain, the Agency has not been able to make a persuasive argument to protect his name in the three years Tepedino has

been at issue. Thanks to all who assisted in preparing for the meeting, and especially fo/Steve White and Dick Kinsman, who prepared the

issue and talking point papers that carried the day.

been performed using only Agency personnel and with their full

knowledge.

Recommendation (27)

In accordance with its present guidelines, the CIA should not

again engage in the testing of drugs on unsuspecting persons.

Recommendation (28)

Testing of equipment for monitoring conservations should not

involve unsuspecting persons living within the United States.

B. Other Selected Activities of the Science and

Technology Directorate

1. The Manufacture and Use of Documents

The Agency maintains a capability for producing and providing to

its agents and operatives a wide range of "alias" credentials. Most such

documents purport to be of foreign origin. Some, however, are docu-

ments ordinarily issued by other branches of the U.S. government or

by private United States businesses and organizations.

Among the United States "alias" documents furnished from time

to time to Agency personnel and operatives are Social Security cards,

bank cards, professional cards, club cards, alumni association cards

and library cards. The Agency has recently stopped producing alias

driver's licenses, credit cards and birth certificates, unless needed in

a particularly sensitive operation and approved in advance by the

Deputy Director of Operations.

While the Agency does not produce false United States passports,

it has in the past altered a few by the addition of entries to evidence

travel which had not actually occurred.

The purpose of alias documents is to facilitate corer during CIA

operations.

These documents are not "backstopped," ie., manufac-

tured with the consent and knowledge of the company or organiza-

tion whose card is being manufactured. They are useful only as flash

identification. Only the Social Security Administration has been told

that the Agency is manufacturing its cards.

The Commission found no evidence that any Agency employee has

ever used false documentation of this kind to his personal advantage.

Conclusions

Alias credentials are necessary to facilitate CIA covert operations

overseas, but the strictest controls and accountability must be main-

Chief, Information Review Group/OIM

Pending ARRB (JFK Board) Issues

(AIUO) Per your request at our 1 April bi-weekly

meeting, we have summarized below the significant issues which

are under deliberation and negotiation with the JFK Board. Our

approach on protecting Agency equities is multi-step:

• First, with the staff, we argue relevance although the statute and

implementing regulations define "assassination records" very

broadly as including

• any records related to the assassination or Oswald,

• any records concerning the various conspiracy theories, and

• any records within the scope of previous investigations

including the Church Committee, Pike Committee,

Warren

Commission, or House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA) ,1

Second, with the staff, we argue that release would cause current

damage although the exemptions under the JEK statute are much

narrower than the corresponding exemptions under the FOIA, and

Third, if we fail to convince the staff, we must proceed to a more

detailed and formal presentation to the Board.

ISSUE 1 -- Unacknowledged Covert Actions

2. (S) Within records surfaced by the Ford Library is a

document -- a Helms Memorandum for the Record on a PFIAB meeting

-- which contains references to CIA

(unions in France and Italy."

3. (S) After much negotiation, the ARRB staff has agreed

to recommend to the Board that the information related to those

covert actions be considered non-related and the documents:

designated "Not Believed Related" (NBR) .

The document willi be

grouped with similar "NBR" documents and be presented to the

Board for final action at the 13 April or 12 May meeting.

ISSUE 2 -- Alias Documentation and Accommodation Addresses

4. (S) The CIA security file of former Agency employee,

David Morales (deceased -- true name already released), within

the sequestered collection contains documentation on five of his

alias.

We anticipate similar problems as we re-review other

security files within the sequestered collection.

We are

considering a compromise with the following elements:

• protect all references to official documents reflecting the alias

such as (social security cards, drivers licenses,

• release items designated as pocket litter such as club cards,

• protect elements of accommodation addresses to avoid identifying

specific locations, and

• lastly, make a decision to actually release or protect the alias

itself depending on the timeframe and its importance to the

JFK

story.

5. (S) However, disagreements on the actual implementation

accommodation address) have prevented a final resolution at this

time. We are also exploring with the DO senior management

whether the blanket release of pocket litter (whether lawfully

might present media or operational issues

today. Accordingly, we have requested that the issue be

postponed until the May meeting.

ISSUE 3 --

Organizational Materials

6. (S) This request lone of the earliest and known as CIA-

1) asked for organization charts on various Agency directorates

and/or components for the years 1958-1968. All Agency

directorates provided material responsive to the request and the

ARRB staff has selected items for inclusion in the JFK

collection. Remaining at issue are three DO charts -- a 1961

generic DDP organization, a 1963 generic DDP organization, and a

detailed JMWAVE organization. The DO has agreed to release the

first two and remain adamantly opposed to the release of the

JMWAVE chart given its similarity to current organizational

plans.

7.

(S) This issue will be presented by ARRB staff to the

Board at the 13 April meeting where they will recommend that the

DDP generic charts be accepted (good for CIA) and that the JMWAVE

chart be declared as an assassination record (bad for CIA); an

actual vote by the Board will not take place until the May

meeting.

ISSUE 4 - Mexico City Tapes

8. (S) This request asked for a thorough search of Agency

files

and documents for and CIA "... surveillance 'take' from

Cuban and Soviet facilities in Mexico City at the time of the

Oswald visit and in the immediate wake of

22 November 1963;

many others are dated 23 November 1963 through

December 1963.

(S) This is one of the most complex requests because of

the following facts:

at one time, there was a tape of Oswald in existence but it has

since been lost

erased;

the relevance of these tapes is argued even though they do

contain the Oswald conversation;®

this was not an unilateral operation but rather a joint operation

with the Mexican Government; /

there is a confidential request from the ARRBito the Mexican

Government for any Copies of the actual Oswald conversation they

may possess; and,

• quite obviously, the sensitivity is not so much the mere fact that

such tapes but our release of the extent and actual

conversations captured.

10.

(S) • The good news, at least at this time, is that the

ARRB staff has agreed to postpone Board consideration until May

and, in the interim, the Agency will have an opportunity to

review (i.e., listen and transcribe) and determine the

sensitivity

and provide detailed arguments in this regard.

ISSUE 5 -- Protection of LITAMIL-9

The scope of this request is quite significant; it includes five boxes

of 185 tapes from operations against both

the Cuban and Russian Embassy.

The ARRB staff position on the relevance of the tapes has three forms:

There could be conversations about Oswald and/or the assassination on the

.2 Nov + tapes which could give clues to Oswald's visit to Mexico City or

25 September - 3 October.

The absence of any conversation about Oswald or the

assassination would itself be of historical interest.

Or, there are

transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations that mention the

assassination in the collection and, thus, by definition, the tapes are

assassination records.
