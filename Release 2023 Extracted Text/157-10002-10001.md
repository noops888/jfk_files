get rid of Castro or the Castro regime

in Cuba; lets put it that way, and no

limitations were placed on the means:

inybody do

not do this, do not do that, do not do the other thing." (26) (The

above statements refer to Mougoose.)

Helms testified that "the prossure was very

intonse and I remember vividly it was very intense."

"very nutty schemes." (26)

Helms testified the pressure built up to

the Bay of Pig:

again toward the end of 1961 and

1962.

wards interest tapered off, although Helms recalled efforts in 1963 involving

"conomic warfare" such as

turning

off oil

doliveries and stopping bus deliveries

including an attempt to stop the sale by tholeyland Bus Company in Spainjof buses tr
