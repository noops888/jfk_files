MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

RETURN TO CIA

Background Use Only

Do Not Reproduce

1. After meeting with Mr. Warner, Mr. (Milligan) and others

from the (LPGLOBE staff, I telephoned Mr. Leonard Newman, Chief

of the Rackets Section, New York County District Attorney's office,

on Thursday, 6 February, and stated that I wanted to discuss a

matter not directly related to the Itkin case. I felt it was

necessary to explain to Mr. Newman that it was not the Itkin

case since we have been enjoined by the U.S. Attorney's office

from discussing the Itkin case with members of Mr. Hogan's office.

Mr. Newman's immediate question was, "Does this involveRobert?"?

I said it did and would look forward to

meeting with him at 10:30 °3

on Friday provided the weather permitted an on-time arrival in

New York.

2. At 10:30 on Friday, 7 February, I met with Mr. Newman

and Sergeant William Graf, a police investigator assigned to the

District Attorney's office to work on the Itkin case. It appears

for CIA. When Sergeant Graf first talked to Mr. Newman about

this possibility, Mr. Newman thought he was jumping to conclusions

with insufficient evidence.

However, Sergeant Graf continued his

investigation and more and more evidence pointed td (Roberts) CIA

relationship. I specifically asked Sergeant Graf if Itkin was awar

f Roberts'

affiliation with CIA, and Sergeant Graf replied that

Erom the'evidence he had seen of the Itkin-Boberts) felationshif

it was his opinion that Itkin does know

Of (Roberts) affiliation with

Mr. Newman commented that if Itkin knew of Roberts') 03

affiliation with CIA, we could be sure that this would be brought

out by Mr. F. Lee Bailey during the trial of Itkin.

3. At the present time the New York District Attorney is

not contemplating prosecution of Roberts as the information

uncovered to date relates lở (Roberts) contacts with Itkin and

apparently there are no specific criminal charges against

Sergeant Graf stated that Roberts) had corresponded

with Itkin, and it was assumed that Itkin and Roberts) have met

personally when(Roberts) has been in this country. 03

03 4. Mr. Newman stated that they had sent questions to bakar

for Roberts via Interpol which have been answered.

Mr. Newman

stated that the FBI had advised him that the FBI had previously

had an interest in Roberts) Mr. Newman did not state whether

the FBI had advised him of CIA's interest in Roberts) 3 Mr. Newman

asked me whether we would be willing to question Roberts on other

items that they had uncovered. I stated that this posed a

real

problem and I was not able to give them an answer at that time.

I was concerned about certain conflicts in the event (Roberts)03

answers involved information which could incriminate him. It

might be that Roberts would consider he had immunity from

prosecution when answering questions put forth by CIA.

5.

I did not describe Roberts' relationship to CIA other than

io state he had in fact received some training from us and did

report to us. I intended to infer that (Roberts was an informant

had intact re

in a similar capacity to that which Itkin'enjoyed earlier.

6. It should be noted that all parties to the Itkin case are

talking to each other. Mr. Newman said two days before I called

on the phone the FBI advised him that CIA would discuss our

relationship with(Roberts) with him. Later that day in Mr.

Morgenthau's office, where I met Itkin, FBI Agent Donovan

commented that he heard I had a good meeting with Newman.

It is not beyond belief that the FBI told Itkin that I had seen

Newman about (Boberts.)
