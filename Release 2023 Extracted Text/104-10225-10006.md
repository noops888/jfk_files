His overall performance

exceptional proficiency and

he has been rated by his most recent supervisor as "outstanding"

for his handling of a sensitive

case and his development:

and pursuit of Cuban opcrational leads. Mr. Flores has definite

growth potential and clearly mects or exceeds the criteria for

promotica to Grade GS-13, a promotion which is most strongly

recommended.

During the past year Mr: Flores was responsible for

opcrational programs were aggressive and imaginative.

Mr. Flores' supervisory talents combined with his excellent

professional skills portend a continuing and successful career

in this Agency.

4.

While assigned to LA/COG, Mr. Flores was involved

in the spotting, assessing, dovoloping access to,

and eventually

pitching a Cuban who was the head of Cubana Airlines in a

Latin American country.

The recruitment pitch was not successful

but the details of this operation were handled in the most

professional manner. Mr. Flores developed more leads to relatives

and friends of Cuban officials during this period than any other

LA/COG operations officer.

He has native fluency in Spanish and

While

During this last

ycar. he clcarly demonstrated his ability to function independently

and to assume responsibilities usually roserved for officers

much more senior in grade and experience.

5.

Mr. Flores was assigned in July 1976 to OTR on a

two-year rotational assignment as an operations instructor.

Upon completion of this assignment, Mr. Flores will return to

this Division to assume responsibilities, either at Headquarters

or in the field, commensurate with his demonstrated operational

and managerial talents.

In recognition of Mr. Flores' outstanding

agent handling skills, his overall professional competency, and

his obvious growth potential, it is strongly récommended that

Mr. Flores

be promoted to Grade GS-13.

9 Sopramber 1966

Notification of Non-ellelbillty for Denisnation

as 3

Participant in the

Cia Retfrement and Dianbility System

.. As you may knuw, we are in the procema of reviewing the employment

history and current career field of all employees in the Agency to identify

thoue who are cligible

for designation as a participant in the new CIA

Retirement and Disability System.

In this process, the initial revlew of

each case la made by the individual's Career Service, If the llead of his

Career Service nominates him for participation in the System,

this nomina-

ton 18 reviowed by the ClA Retirement Board which recommends final action

to me.

However, If the llead of the Career Service adulace that the employee

does not mect the basie requirements of Hk 20-30 for participation, I have

accopted this finding without further revier by the CIA Retirement Board.

Thia practice has been ndopted in the interest of expediting this screening

process so that those employces

who are elizible to partielpate in the Sys-

tem may be designated participants as soon as possible.

2. In your case, the lead of your Career service has advised me that

you do not meet the requirements of uR 29-50 for designation

pant and I have accordingly made the formal determination required by the

regulation that you are not cligible for designation. This. in no way affects

your current status under the Clull Service Hetirement System, nor does It

preclude reconsideration of your cligibility to participate in the CIA Sys-

Eem if you should muct the requirements for designation in the future.

Should you desire further Infornation concerning the requirements

for designation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I suggest that

your read paragraph e of lik 20-50 and parazraph 5 of the Employee Bullerin

dated 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Las 88-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement, Act of 1964 for Certain Employees."

4.

It 1a always possible that the records upon which the determination

made In your case may have been Incomplete or Inaccurate regarding your actual

employment history with the Agency.

If, after studying, the materials cited

above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not eligio

ble to participate in the CIA Retlrement System, please feel free to contact

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON 29. D.C.

Applicant Information

Sheet No. 1

To all persons applying for employment

with the Central Intelligence Agency:

This paper is the first step in upplying for employment or consultant

status with the Central Intelligence Ageney. No application my procced

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the condi-

tions stated below:

General Considerations:

1.

The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Publie Law 253, Both

Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

"to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Government departments and ngencies

as relate to the national security;

b.

"to make recommendations to the National Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

menta and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security;

"to correlate and evaliate intelligence relating to the

national secwity, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Government

...;

d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence

agencies, such additional services

of common concern as the National

Security

Council deteruines can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally;

"to perform such other functions and duties related to

Intelligence affecting

the national security as the National Security

Council may from time to time direct."

---

## Page 60

4-00000

The special charncter of thie national responsibility requires the Agen-

cy to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which nay be

different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Gov-

ernment departments and agencies which do not have the highly songitive

esponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency

It follows

hat the Investigation of applicants prerequisite to their scceptance 1

a time-consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security

checks, Includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitnese,

and

availnbility of a suitable position at such tine as employment may

be offered. This 18 called "clearance" of an applicant.

2.

Investigation of an applicant may reveal something, which prevents

his clearance - perhapo something of which the applicant la genuinely un-

aware, perhaps

something which only the special employment criteria of the

Agency make unacceptable.

In any event, adverse findings by the Agency

are conclusive and final

ment of specific reasons 1a made to the applicant.

Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency 1a not a right upon

which an applicant can insist.

Offer of employment which 1s subject to

full clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giv-

Ing an unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim aesinst thei Agency.

Acceptance of employment upon the condition of clearunce 13 at the appli-

cant's risk, taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage

of applicants are not cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-

If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those considera-

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.

During this ten-month

period under review, Mr. Flores served as a section chief bith responsibilitics for

East sian stations with a Cuban target (Tokyo,

Mr. Flores was the only CS-13 officer to hold section chief responsibility, yet his

matters pertaining to Cuban opcrations. His section was nanayed in a campetent

manner with Mr. Flores demonstrating his ability to delegate functional responsibilitios.

The Cuba Operations Group also functions in a direct case officer capacity, and

Mr. Flores frequently traveled TDY to handle cases..

He was the operations officer

for one particularly sensitive and productive

reporting case.

This required

him to travel on short notice and to arrange for secure mecting and debriefing

sessions of this reporting source.

Mr. Flores also traveled to Canada on various occasions to meet with liaison

contacts and participate in developmental operations.

cont.

movements of an operational target, and to devise a secure and timely method of

approach to the inuividual cuban.

In comaring Mr. Flores' performance as an operations officer and as a

supervisor,

I believe his performance is somewhat stronger in the former capacity.

Mr. Flores has all the attributes of an excellent case officer: he is aggressive,

thinks operationally, and is fast on his feet in an operational situation.

He is

fluency. in Spnish and has on more than one occasion successfully

During his TDY travels, he has

repeatedly demonstrated dedication to the job at hand, willingness to work long

hours, and a flexibility to handle all types of situations.

Mr. Flores is less enthusiastic when it comes to the paperwork and bureau..

cratic requinements of his position.

while he is a good writer, he tends to handle

his written tasks in a hurried manner and consequently, his work oftentimes requires

review.

He is also inclined to take the shorter and easier approach when handling

the paper flon requirements.

I mention these points not because they represent

basic shortcomings,

but simply to contrast them to his exceptionally high performarico

in his operations officer capacity.

Mr. Flores is an extremely experienced, competent and well motivated.

operations officer. His talent as a "street operator" with a keen sense for the

human target has been amply demonstrated.

Ite has now quite successfully been

intratuced to his first supervisory position and proven that he is competent for

assignnents of this nature.

I believe Mr. Flores is capable of handling positions

of increasing responsibility and should be given the opportunity to do so.

the target is good.

The project is, however, in need of good human

reporting assets

and it is expected

that as

Subject overcomes a

weakness mentioned in the next paragraph he

will be able to devote

more of his time to this important task.

The Subject has encountered some difficulty in the preparation

of written material -- dispatches, intelligence reports -- and

finds it necessary to spend an extended portion of his time on its

preparation.

The rater has discussed this with Subject on several:

occasions, and it is believed that his difficulty is due to a lack

of experience,

and that in time and with a continuing effort on his

part he will develop his writing

The Subject's overall attitude and response towards his pro-

fessional responsibilities during the first tour have been positivo.

He is interested in the kind of work he is doing, likes it and is

willing to put in the kind of long hours it sometimes demands

without complaint.

This rater's principal criticiam of this employee is his tendency

this weakness is more a function of his inexperience in the
