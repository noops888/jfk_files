HER, AS SHE WANTS IO KEEP ON GOODRICH GOOD SIDE DESPITE

DOUBIS ABOUT HIS INTLLIGENCE OR COMPETENCE, KINGMAN WOULD

TELL GOODRICH HE FOUND HER SOMEWHAI DISPLEASED AT KINGMAN'S

GOODRICH, AS SHE FEARED GOODRICH'S DISAPPROVAL. THIS SCRIPT

FOLLOWED OVER PHONE WITH GOODRICH WHO COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE

RELAXED AND UNDERSTANDING (TO POINT THAT SHE NOW CONVINCED

THAT HE NOT COMPETENT) OF KINGMAN'S PROCEDURE. GOODRICH

SEEMED HAPPY TO HEAR AGENCY LAWYER COMING AND WILL PRESUMABLY

SE OPEN AND COOPERATIVE...

1D. WE DISCUSSED AGAIN THE WASHINGION LAWYER AND SHE

WILL BE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THIS HELP AS SHE DISCLAIMS ANY

MONEY SENSE OR LEGAL JUDGMENT.

APPARENT THAT SHE DID NOT WANT MONEY THAT BADLY (ALTHOUGH

CLEAR SHE QUITE UNCERTAIN ABOUT HER FINANCIAL STATUS OR

FUTURE.) KINGMAN WARNED HER THAT CURTIS FRIENDS MAY FEEL

AGENCY HAS PULLED FAST ONE WITH MANUSCRIPT BUT THAT KINGMAN

PREPARED TO WEATHER THAT ONE. SHE MORE CONCERNED WITH •

BARRON'S UNTRUSTWORTHINESS AND THAT HE MAY HAVE KEPI A COPY

WHICH HE COULD PERSONALLY EXPLOIT.

D. SECURITY, OTHERWISE. IF WE HAVE RETRIEVED ALL

PAPERS OR WILL SOON HAVE DONE SO, THINK WORST HAS BEEN

AVOIDED, THROUGH ASHHEAD'S PERSUASIVENESS AND MRS CURTIS

GOOD SPIRII.

12. WHILE TRYING TO AVOID GOING FURTHER THAN WE SHOULD

C CAN POSSIBLY DO IN HELPING HER WITH SETTLEMENT, WOULD

SUGGEST THAT WE SHOULD BE READY TO GET LAWYER DOWN HERE

IN COMING WEEK. KINGMAN FEELS THAT SHE WILL TURN

TO US FOR ADVICE AND, AT LEASI, WILL USE US (NOI BENADUM)

AS CHAWNEL FOR THINGS CONCERNING AGENCY AND FOR WHAT HELP

SHE MAY NEED FROM MEXICAN GOVERNMENT. KINGMAN INTENDS CONTINUE

XEE? IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH HER TO BE HELPFUL AND TO BE NEAR

IN CASE SHE DOUBIS OR IS ADVISED AGAINST WISDOM OF HER ACTIONS

TODAY.
