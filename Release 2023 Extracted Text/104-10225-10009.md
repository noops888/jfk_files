own interpretation.

AMSTALK-I's reaction to the contents of the letter was

mild'and he did not appear too concerned about the threats to

his family (paragraphs 2 and 3): He stated that he did not

recognize the name at the botton.of the letter (Arturo PITA Rey)

and commented

that from talks with his cousin he believed the

real sender of the letter was Wanolo PINIFNO\"Barba Roja" (Director

of the. DGI), and that the name and address was probably an

accomodation addiess uscd by the Cuban Intelligence Service.

3. ANSTALK-1 Identified the nades in Paragraph 2 as follows:

Fernando - Fernando de ROJ.iS - husband of AMSTALK-I's

cousin,

Marta (the source of the message)

presently serving a 30 year jail sentence

in Havana.

by AMSTALK-1 as a fanatical Catholic.

A. During the period June-August 1966, AMSTALK/1 was

instrumontal in assisting in the preparation of the ANTRUNK

Oporational Team. consigting of AMAKA/1, AMTRUNK/21, and ANTRUNK/25

POr STEAMER IX and X, a two phaso oporation targettod at southern

Matandas and Havana.

During tho final planning stages, howover,

It was docided to omit for the present the portion of

dirocted at Havann, and AMTRUNK/7, a former AMTRUNK Team guide on

operations in the northern Matanzas area, was rehired specifically

for tho exfiltration phago of the STEAMER IX and X Oporation.

AISTALK/1 was responsiblo for convincing ANTRUNK/7 to rejoin his

former team,

and arranged the necessary cover details which would

explain AMTRUNK/7's absonce from tho JNWAVE arca

operation.

during the

B. During July 1966, AWSTALK/1 attended the majority

of tho three week communications instructors course,

result of the press of business in preparing for the STEAMER

but as the

Operation, was unable to complete the courso; it is believed,

that ANSTALK/l could perform as a qualifiod instructor

even though he did not recoive his "diploma"

c.

A part of AMSTALK/l's contribution to the STEAMER

Operation was the extensive and comprehensive debriefing of

refugees

to the JHAVE arca from the operational arca.. The

intormation obtained from these reports was of value to the

ANTRUNK Team in planning for the STEANER Operation.

1.

Durink late 1962 while still i menher of the

AMICE organization,

AMICE-11 received sone informal para-

military traininz,

from JAWAVE.

The cryptonym was asalenes

lo him at that time.

Subject resigned from AMICE in March 1963 at

which time he becane a fully-escruited asset of station

JAWAVE.

Sublect has been asseriated with the MHAPRON-

oriented AMTRUNK (STEAMER) project as Team Leader and

Principal Agent since his resiggation from AMICE.

Since Subject's activities

for the past three

years have been totally

unrelated to those of Allce, it 15

requested that his cryptonym

te changed to forestall any

further possible confusion between his current duties and

the activitles of his former parent organization.

4.

In anticipation of 2 favorable reply to this

request,

the cryptonym AMICE-IS will be cancelled effective

15 March 66 and the new cryptraju AMSTALK-1 assigned to the

Subject of 201-307337 as

that date.
