MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
SUBJECT : Glazunov: Declassification of Nosenko Reporting
REFERENCE: Chief, CI Memorandum for the Record, 2 July 1976,
Subject: Meeting with Mr. Donald Jameson
1. In accordance with paragraph 3 of reference, I
reviewed the original Nosenko transcripts and handwritten
notes regarding Ilya S. Glazunov for the purpose of declas-
sifying certain information to be used by Mr. Donald Jameson.
Nosenko's comments concerning Glazunov were summarized in a
blind memorandum attached to US/76/177, 3 July 1976, which
was prepared for passage to MI-6. Paragraph 1 of that
blind memorandum has been declassified on the authority of
Chief, Counterintelligence Staff. The substance of that
paragraph which has been declassified is marked by red
brackets. The specific identification of the source of
information as Nosenko has not been declassified, and thus
any use of it in accordance with the purpose outlined in
reference cannot identify Nosenko as the specific source.
A copy of the blind memorandum is attached to this memorandum
for the record.
2. For future reference, the declassification of para-
graph 1 of the blind memorandum cited above is limited only
to that portion of the paragraph so bracketed, and the
declassification does not extend to the original Nosenko
transcripts, handwritten notes, or other Nosenko-sourced
information upon which the blind memorandum was based.
