CONFIDENTIALA

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Ilona Marita Lorenz

The attached newspaper stories alleged that "Alex

Rorke, a wealthy adventurer who worked for both CIA and the

FBI" was involved with Frank Fiorini, a "CIA Agenty who recruited

the subject in an assassination plot

against Castro.

Alexander I. Rorke is a former FBI clerical employee who, during

• the time of the alleged plot in 1960, was a free lunce

photographer. He had been temporarily detained by the Cuban

Government in 1959 and for many years was active in anti-Castro

activities in the Florida area.

From time to time he contacted

the FBI and was dealt with at

arms length because of his

adventurer, personality and self-serving motives. He disappeared

on a plane flight in 1963 to Central America.

Frank Fiorini

also known as Frank Anthony Sturgis was well known to the FBI

for his anti-Castro activities in the U. S. following his:

defection from Cuba in 1958. He was also one of

the Watergate

break-in subjects.

Additional information in FBI files indicates that the

subject also furnished information concerning the July 26th

Movement in the U. S. This group was the original political and

military organization which Castro used to overthrow the Batista

Regime in Cuba.

The subject was also interviewed in 1962 in

Florida regarding a White Slavery Traffic Act (WSTA) case and

admitted being the mistress of Marcos Perez Jimenez, former

President of Venezuela, who fathered her daughter.

Investigation

failed to establish the subject was.

a victim in the above mentioned

WSTA case.

The subject is the present wife of NY 7511-IA who

furnishes

information on

Soviet and Soviet bloc matters. She

aware of her husbands cooperation with the New York office and

has, on occasion, volunteered information of value.

The subject"

is presently separated from her husband and in April, 1976, the

New York Office opened a potential criminal informant file on her

because of her contacts with a New York 'area crime figure,

Guiseppe Faggiano and a race horse trainer.

She furnished

information regarding gambling, shylocking and bank robbery matters.

However,

because of

the recent publicity set out in the attached

newspaper clippings, the fact that she is planning to write a book

concerning her Cuban experiences and the fact that she terminated

her contact with criminal elements, her case was closed by the.

New York Office.

Denver, Colorado. He stated he is married and lives with his

wife.

Mr. Ely wished to explain his concern over being

surveilled and felt it was thework of the CIA.

When asked

what would prompt such surveillance, he stated that previously

he had been self-employed in an auto safety device firn.

Having had difficulties with patent infringements on his

devices in Europe, he had occasion to travel to Sweden and

Switzerland®

During 1961, Ely was in Sweden and as he was

having marital difficulties with his first wife, entered into

an affair with a Swedish citizen, Helena Johnson. Miss Johnson

was an agent for various art firms.

affair, Johnson urged Ely to purchase a moose hunting license

and a Swedish war surplus rifle fitted with a Zeiss scope so

that he could bag a moose and sell it for about $700. Sensing

something was amiss, Ely returned the rifle to Johnson and

While going with Miss Johnson he

learned she was a member of the Baltic League, a violently

anti-Russian organization.

After their split, he learned she

the CIA failod to produce information to him, he sent a letter

¿o the CIA, United Statos Departmont of State, Department of

cated he would toll all he know of the CIA unless they revealed

to him all they have on record concerning him.

This letter

seemed to result in the surveillances he suspects are directed

at him, and as a result he has consulted various lawyers, police

officials, and his employers for aid in determining what
