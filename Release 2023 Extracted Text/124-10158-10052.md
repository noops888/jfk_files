*on 3-24-64 FAMES LESTER of the local office of

Cigadvised that his office had received information

that 7(x)

BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed on an installation

of Bull office machines being used by the Frefecture of

Police in Paris.

This information has been furnished to the

Prefecture of police, and while their inguiry is continuing,

preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.

In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned

THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN JR. 9

which sets forth background

intornation concerning him

appearing in Bufiles, and which

was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to

Baltimore

3-19-64, was made available to the prefecture of Police.

it appears that the information contained in the memorandun

would be of

interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH of the

Jocal office o1 U.S.I.S, che Direction de la Surveillance

du Territoire (DST),

trench domestic counterespionage service,

tand the local office of CIA le

are theretore turnishing

copies of that memorandun to then.

As mentioned previously,

we will continue to

follow this matter closely and

promptly transmit to the

Bureau any pertinent information of interest.
