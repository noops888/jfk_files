JFK Work Files (also called Russ Holmes' Ancillary Files)

13 boxes containing 236 "folders" organized by subject. The

individual files are primarily based upon or related to

subjects and individuals in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 File. We

estimate, based on a survey of over half the boxes that at

least 2/3, and probably more, of the materials in the file

is duplicative of documents previously reviewed.

The collection is a combination of files set up for

background / reference purposes and responses to specific

requests.

Most files deal with requests from, and

responses, to the HSCA investigation (1976-79), but the file

includes folders related to the Rockefeller Commission

(1975) and Church Committee (1976) investigations and FOIA

requests.. The boxes also contain reference tools (index to

names requested by HSCA; inventory of Mexico City COS

Records) and work files from other components. Some of the

files were reviewed by HSCA staffers.

10/1/94

Holmes continued to add to the file after the end of the

HSCA investigation. For example Victor Marchetti 1984

deposition re E. Howard Hunt is in the file.

There are

several files on Authors who have written JFK Assassination

books and files of post-1979 newspaper clippings.

Based on our survey, there is no "new" Oswald or

assassination information in the file.

There are documents

which we can not locate in the Oswald/JFk collection, but

the information in these documents is contained in other

documents previously reviewed.

these documents are in the released collection, however,

There is the possibly that possibility

because of "unit" indexing we can not search the entire

file

at the document level.

There are "assassination" related memos and documents that

deal with

various requests and investigations that appear

to be unique.

These items generally reflect the Agency's

handling of requests or are items collected from other work

files or only part of the material was included in the

sequestered file.

There are also some non-related files in the collection.

These file usually resulted from a request (HSCA, etc.) but

contain no information related to the assassination or

Oswald.

The work files do not add new information or insight into

oswald or the assassination.. They do, however, show how the

Agency responded to various request and the HSCA

Proposed Handling of Work Files

The Ancillary files are not sequestered material and are not

part of the CIA JFK collection. They were created for

reference and background purposes in response to JFK

assassination requests and investigations. The contents are

primarily duplicates of previous reviewed material, but

there are some unique items that can be considered

subject

to the JFK Act.

HRG will review the 13 boxes of work files that were

organized and maintained as a separate file know as the

Ancillary File.

Unique items (not confirmed as being previously reviewed)

will be reviewed for addition to the JFK collection.

Items to ve added to the JEK collection:

memos, documents, reports, etc., that have not been

previously reviewed and that are related to the JEK/Oswald

story;

previously reviewed items that contain different marginalia,

(do not include transmittal memos and forms attached to

previously reviewed documents unless they contain

substantive information);

items created as a result of the investigations (examples:

card file index to names requested by HSCA; chrono of all

documents in which Silvia Duran is mentioned)

Items requiring further discussion:

Subject files containing previously reviewed documents

(useful to researchers; documents are from various folders

of Oswald 201)

Box Inventories prepared by Russ Holmes

Files reviewed by HSCA staffer (contains previously reviewed

documents)

Non-related files

Documents (State & CIA) /press reports containing references

to foreign reaction to Kennedy assassination (generally

brief non-substantive comments; not in the JEK collection) .

2000

Review of JFK Work Files

The JEK work files or "ancillary files" are not sequestered

material or permanent agency records.

They were maintained

working files, separate from the JFK collection, by an

agency staff employee(s) responsible for the JFK collection.

purposes in response to various JFK assassination inquiries

and investigations. Eighty to ninety percent of the files'

content are primarily duplicative of material in the Oswald

201 and the JFK sequestered collection, both of which have

been previously reviewed for release.

There are, however,

some unique items with in the files which can be considered

subject to the JFK Act.

Review Guidelines

HRG will conduct a document-by-document review of these 13

boxes of working files.

Unique items (i.e., those not identified as being previously

reviewed) that add to the understanding of the JFK

investigation or that may be of utility to researchers will

be reviewed for release to NARA. Most of the unique items

should fall in the following three categories:

1) Memos, documents, reports, etc., which contain

substantive information and are directly related to the

JFK/Oswald story or scope of one of the investigations;

2) Previously reviewed items that contain different

marginalia,

(do not include transmittal memos-and forms

attached to previously reviewed documents unless they

contain substantive information) ;

3)

Items created as a direct result of the investigations

(i.e., the card file index to names requested by HSCA; the

hrono of all documents in which Silvia Duran is mentioned)

his does not include inventories and similar tools based o

the working files and prepared for reference use.

Other items that do not fall into the above categories, but

which could be considered subject to the JFK Act, will

be

addressed on a case by case basis.

Guidelines on specific types of documents:

FOIA Reguest:

If a document was responsive to the 1976 FOIA request (i.e.,

has FOIA stamp with date and double number such as 706-431),

In folders/files on

specific FOIA requests, do not treat FOIA related

items/paperwork as unique documents. Do check the folders

for other substantive items. If the document was responsive

to another FOIA request, consult with the senior reviewer.

Open source/press clippings

Do not process open source items for release unless they

contain substantive marginalia, or are attached to

documents/memos being reviewed

for release.

Folders on Authors of books on assassinations:

Treat on case-by-case basis; generally would not

process/review folders created after the ISCA investigation

(1979) .

Inventories prepared by Russ Holmes:

Do not review for release unless created specifically for

the HSCA staff. Consult with senior reviewer if in doubt.

Files reviewed by HSCA staffer:

Review only substantive items that can not be identified as

previously reviewed documents.

3Id Agency documents:

If these can not be located in our on-line index; they must

be coordinated with the other agency.

Originals of Documents Released in JEK collection:

If a document was previously released in full, process the

original for release to NARA.

If document was sanitized or

denied, file in the appropriate HRG retention box.

Non-related material:

Do not review; use same guidelines as employed for

microfilm; this

determination will be reviewed by the senior

reviewer.

Handwritten notes/drafts of memo's/misc. routing slips:

Handle on a case-by-case basis; coordinate with the senior

reviewer.

Signature Sheets:

Do not review; (Note: this may change for the folders

containing only signature sheets) .

Other Items:

If items are found in the files that are not covered by the

above guidelines, consult with a senior reviewer.

DRAFI.

19 October 1994

Addendum to REVIEW OF JFK WORK FILES, Dated 10/18/94: Processing Details.

- All documents that are confirmed duplicates of items previously processed for release

will be identified with a post-it marked with the Oswald or JFK box number and folder

number.

- All documents stamped with an FOlA number are presumed duplicates of items

processed in the original Oswald or JFK boxes. They need no further marking; but do not

remove any notes regarding duplication that you might have made in your initial review.

- All newspaper articles and most other open source items will not be given any processing

and need not be flagged. An open source item that might not be widely available, was not

previously processed and seems significant may be processed for release.

- Non-relevant documents: the occasional non-relevant item should be checked as a

possible duplicate, since we were required by law to process the whole JFK file regardless

of relevancy. Larger groups of documents that are clearly justified as non-relevant should

be pink-banded with a brief statement of justification entered on the band.

- The documents selected for release to NARA should be accummulated in a folder

marked with the appropriate Holmes box number. The documents themselves should be

marked with the folder number.

Documents selected for sanitized release will require a copy for yellow sanitizing and

HRG retention and a final redacted copy for NARA; place the original file copy with the

sanitized copy in the HIRG retention file and another copy back in the Holmes box. The

original file copy of documents to be released in full should be provided to NARA, with a

copy placed in the HRG retention file and a copy placed in the Holmes box. For a lengthy

document to be released in full a copy of the cover or first page with a note indicating its

retention in HRG will be sufficient for the Holmes box. In the unlikely event of a unique,

relevant document that must be denied in full,white band it and place it in the HRG

retention file; place a copy in the Holmes file.

- True originals (not cables, dispatches, CSs, etc) of documents previously released in full

should be removed from the Holmes file and collected in a separate envelope for

forwarding to NARA. Use a post-it to mark the NARA copy with box and folder

numbers. Reproduce a copy for the Holmes file. True originals of documents released

sanitized should also be placed in the HIRG retention file with a copy in the Holmes file.

RELBASE IN FULL

2000

10 February 1995

• PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF WORKING FILES (SIX BOXES)

BOX 1. Contains 16 folders on Lucien Conein, former oss type

and long time Agency paramilitary officer (Viet Nam). All

folders contain only administrative papers from mid

concerning Conein's pay, awards, transfers, etc. -- nothing

even remotely connected

to JFK or the time period of the

assassination. Entire file, inexplicably, microfilmed for

HSCA and appears in microfilm print box 4, folders 11-26 (16

folders) all declared non-relevant. A 17th folder is in

microfilm box 57, folder 6. These files in ancillary box 1

of 6 were apparently the file copies that were microfilmed.

Three additional folders in box 1:

- Administratice memos and records re the JFK files and

related FOIA requests (1980-1992) •

- "HSCA

-77-178 memos"

• These are administrative memoranda

to and from HSCA, mostly concerning relations between CIA

and HSCA, as opposed to the numerous HSCA requests for

information and CIA responses found in the primary JFK

files.

- "Sequestered HSCA - CIA Documents. Correspondence". More

administratice

memos similar to those in the immediately

previous folder.

There is no justification for processing the 17 Conein

folders.

The last three folders contain nothing of direct

substantive value regarding the JFK assassination, but they

might be of some usefulness to researchers by enhancing

their understanding of the handling of the assassination

records.

Box 2. The entire box contains documents on Gerald Patrick

Hemming, anti-Castro soldier of fortune and long time pain

for CIA

with which he claimed affiliation (untrue except for

a few contact reports he volunteered). All of the documents

in twelve dated folders, one folder with a blank label, and

the loose documentstin the front of the box are duplicates

of documents processed in the primary JFK file. Each of

these documents is marked with the JFK box and folder

number, usually identified as "HSCA box #...". The last

folder, a red-brown portfolio, contains documents that

apparently are responsive to two Hemming Privacy Act

requests. Many of these are recognized duplicates but would

have to be checked in the index to be sure of all of them.

The rest of the box (i.e., the 13 folders. and the loose

documents) needs no further review.

Working Files, box 3 of 6: preliminary review

3/3/95

First fldr contains (1) a records retirement form titled

HSCA (DDO correspondence), essentially a listing of JFK

boxes 1-34 (the DO boxes); (2) a copy of the procedure to be

used to microfilm boxes 1-34.

Second fldr ("Allen vs CIA"), includes memos re FOIA

requests: statistical estimates regarding size of file, est

cost of filming; listing of box/folder contents. Release

Third flar (white), "HSCA Equities Material": two memos

relating to a conflict between a court order and House

instructions on release of HSCA material plus supporting

documentation. Rlease.

Fourth fldr, "Ancillary Files - LHO,etc."

', contains an

inventory of the 13-box ancillary file; two FBI memos and

one HSCA memo concerning the question of the Oswald's voice

on a tape. Relese.

Between the 4th & 5th folders:. A document list, "Description

of Document and Subject" in three parts. The list seems.to

• "leads investigated by CIA": 1)originators of the

subject, 2) disseminations made and 3) correspondence

developed.

Fifth fldr, "Index to CIA info held in boxes 1-34", a hand-
