a dIscussion with STANLEY S. SCHACHTER, Enforcement Agent,

U. No Customs, Miami, who is handling the MASFERRER case,

relative to the propriety of revealing complete information

regarding MASFERRER's plan to Cuba at this time.

SCHACHTER

advised he could foresee no difficulties or objections on the

part of Customs to the furnishing of full information regarding

MASFERRER's activities to the CIS by an informant of this of-

fice. SCHACHTER was also of the opinion that Cuba was no doubt

already aware of MASFERRER's activities inasmuch as most

active Cuban exiles in Miami know of his plan. SCHACHTER

said

he felt this procedure would in no way interfere with Customs

investigation in this case. @(d)
