WALTER C. BADENDICK MET FOR OVER TWO HOURS WITH SON

OF NUCLASSIC/B8 IN LOCAL RESTAURANT ON 9 OCT 7B.

MEETING WAS

EXTREMELY WARM AND FRIENDLY, WITH BOTH RECALLING VIGNETTES

AND ANECDOTES ABOUT WUCLASSIC/88 (C/88). SON WAS ENROUTE TO

AIRPORT TO FLY TO EAST COAST TO FINALIZE PURCHASE OF FARM

NEAR CHICO, CA., BUT WAS PLEASED TO TAKE TIME TO MEET BADENDICK

AND TALK ABOUT C/88.

SON RELATED THAT C/88, ALTHOUGH ENORMOUSLY

TALENTED AND AT ONE TIME YOUNGEST MAJOR IN U.S. ARMY, HAD

MARRIED SECOND WIFE UNACCEPTABLE TO ARMY AND GAVE UP HIS CAREER

BECAUSE OF HIS RESPONSIBILITIES TO HER AND HIS CHILDREN (SON

WAS ONLY OFFSPRING FROM FIRST MARRIAGES. THIS LED TO LENGTHY

PERIOD WHICH SON DESCRIBED AS "PURE HELL" FOR C/88, DURING

WHICH HE WAS POOR, IN ILL HEALTH AND UNABLE TO UTILIZE HIS CON-

SIDERABLE TALENTS

AS INTELLIGENCE OFFICER.

DURING LAST EIGHTEEN

MONTHS OF ASSOCIATION WITH RTACTION, C/88 WAS ONCE AGAIN IN HIS

ELEMENT, WAS DOING PURPOSEFUL AND IMPORTANT WORK AND WAS FULFILLED

AT END OF HIS LIFE.

SON IS VERY COGNIZANT OF THIS AND HAS VERY

GOOD FEELINGS TOWARD RTACTION BECAUSE OF IT.

SON WAS INTIMATE

CONFIDANT OF C/B&, WHO TOLD HIM HE HAD RACTION MISSION IN

1O MONTEREY BUT DID NOT REVEAL TARGETS EVEN IN GENERAL, SAID NOTHING

OF MODUS OPERANDI, AND DID NOT IDENTIFY BADENDICK BEYOND BEING

UNNAMED RACTION OFFICER POSING AS NEPHEW THIS LAST IN CASE C/88

SHOULD DIE, SO SON WOULD BE PREPARED TO BACKSTOP BADENDICK AS

RELATIVES.

2.

REGARDING C/B8'S PLAN TO ASSASSINATE CASTRO, SON SAID

IT WAS WRITTEN MANY YEARS AGO IN FLORIDA AT TIME WHEN SON IS

ABSOLUTELY SURE C/88 HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH RACTION.

IN FACT,

SAID SON, HE DOES NOT THINK PLAN WAS DRAWN UP AT ANYONE'S BEHEST,
