• SUBJECT:

Ann

L. GOODPASTURE

18 October 1970 - 31 October 1971.

lo the immense regret of this writer Ann Goodpasture

is retiring very soon.

It would be silly to rate. her

competitively against

any of her colleagues, mule or female,.

roung or merely well-preserved.

Concerning her fitness be

t recorded that she is very fit indeed to perform any of

the tasks listed as her current ones or almost any. others

I can think of at almost any grade.

I venture. to rate her

over-all performance,

thirty years of it,

as OUTSTANDING.

Ann is one

of the tough warp-threads on. which this organiza-

tion is woven, and when

she retires the fabric of this

organization will be weakened.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL:

Miss Goodpasture is indeed a fine officer who consistently

turns in a Strong performance when she is not doing in out-

standing job.

She is an excellent office and project manager

who is cost conscious and she is a careful thorough instructor

and briefer.

Her retirement will leave a great gap in CI/OPS

and, as Mr. Johnson has said, in the organization.

I hope

she

deserves for

many years she has made substantive contribution to the
