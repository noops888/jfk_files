Gibson advised that during the course of a normal
working day two or three men usually enter and work in the
sub-leased SCI space. They stay during the course of an
entire day without leaving the space and do not seem to
conduct business in a normal manner. An unidentified
friend of Gibson's overheard individuals in the space,
allegedly leased by DEA, discussing "tapes." Based on the
above information and based on Gibson's experience with
wiretapping while employed with the Cobb County, Georgia,
Sheriff's Office, Gibson believes a wiretapping operation
was being conducted in the space allegedly sub-leased by
DEA from SCI.

Since it appeared that an ongoing CIA operation
was being compromised and that the CIA should be aware,
our Atlanta Office contacted (Mr. Roy Green, Green, CIA, Atlanta
(Covert) and informed him of the above on 7/11/74
On 7/12/74, Gibson furnished the following:
Directly above Suite 1109, rented by SCI at
CU
1028 Connecticut Avenue, is a suite located on the
twelfth floor, which is utilized as an efficiency apartment.
It is connected to Suite 1109 on the floor below by stairway.
Gibson said the twelfth floor space is actually the space
sub-leased to Conein and that telephone number 785-4514 is
installed in that space. Conein sub-leased this apartment
in March, 1974, and was still being used by Conein as of
7/5/74.)
Regarding the information above concerning the
alleged overhearing of discussions concerning "tapes," by
alleged DEA employees, Gibson advised this information
was furnished to him by Mr. Steve Van Cleave, a personal
friend of Gibson's and a private investigator from
Atlanta, Georgia. Van Cleave told Gibson that he
visited SCI offices on a recent unrecalled date. Van Cleave
was told by Werbell that Van Cleave could not stay in the
offices at that time as Werbell was consulting with a
client. Van Cleave told Gibson he then went to the twelfth
floor entryway to SCI offices, the space sub-leased by
Conein, and overheard a conversation through the door
