Alert: May meeting issue

I will provide follow-up message for distribution - this is a DO team alert.

I have a meeting with Gunn and staff Monday am to address as many outstanding issues as possible including the following:

IXINLUCK)• Initial response to 12 April memo was "same old stuff". Bob, ARRB, wanted to know what happen to the proposal re

letting release stand in issue document and protect where needed in other documents? Did DO agree to letting ARRB staff see detailed

message from division?

2

liaison documents - will be scheduled for May meeting. Recommend we re-visit documents and plan to discuss with Bob S.

when he comes out next week. I have assigned these to Hal Bean; he will be in contact. If you have a file on these documents that will

help Hal come up to speed, please share it with him.

3l

Documents - ARRB member had questions (minor per Bob) on 5 of the documents. In addition, there are two documents

from the original 10 that we have a disagreement on. I need to get these document to Lee and lawyers tomorrow (Friday) so that I can

address on Monday.
