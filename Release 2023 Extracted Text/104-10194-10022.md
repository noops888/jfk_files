SECTION C Continued

Hidalgo, Balmes N.

sir. Hidalgo 1s a gregarious uncomplicated person, generally

pleasant, and generous in his instincts but not entircly without

his quixotic side. and one whose natural Latin emotionality has

been intensified bysa life of experiences outside the norm, eg:

years as a CP penetration, air crashes, war wounds, etc.

This officer is aware that lus intellectunl background and

nedical debtlities

are obstructions to his advance.

Understandably,

he has developed outside interests, apparently as compensation.

Expectedly, his attitudes at times so reflect.

In sum, Ar. Hidalgo serves a satisfactory function on the

Panama

Desk and no doubt could continue to perform so

Indefinitely,

but in view of his limitations in a desk-bound

situation and the medical restriction's, both of which will

continue to inhilit his advance in his present component, this

supcrvisor endorses dr. Hidalgo's desire to be considcred for

transfer to another component, namely OTR (specifically covert

training), where his attributes would likely come more directly

Into play.

le has the oncrational experience,

competeiicy in a

foreign language, an outgoing personality, and experieuce in

lecturing

and teaching * Finally,

regardless of the

in this evaluation,

shortcomings

the grading officer finds much to

in Mr. Hidalgo porsonally.

*Should a suitable oponing in that field be unavailable, it is

felt there would be merit also in considering Mr. Hidalgo's

other stated interests,

experience in DD/P Cuban operations, and his broad knowledge of Cuba

(people, geography, customs, etc.) made him a particularly usalihandr

versatile operations officer during his assigiment in the WH/SA

counterintelligence operations section.

As indicated in Section Bo

(epecific duties) he perfornied a wide variety of duties.

Mr. Hidalgo approached and performed his assigrunents with enthusiasm,

keeness, dedication, and promptness. He displayed a partioular talent for

conducting debriefings, and it was in this type activity that he performed best.

He also writes well which added to his debriefing capability as well as to

his performance as a Headquarters desk operations officer in writing cables,

Mr. Hidalgo performed most of his duties with a minimum of supervision.

In a few instances, however, he had a tendency (in his engerness and desire

to get the job done well) to become impatient with the slow and deliberate

pace of progress which is sometimes necessary in operational activities.

• In these few instances, Mr. Hidalgo's work required supervision by a

senior operations officer.

COMMENTS ON REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

Mr. Hidalgo is a sound operations officer with native fluency in Spanish. His

impatience is with administrative delays rather than with operational problems

which he understands fully and handles well. He has had problems with his

health but these largely have been overcome and in the past 9 months have not

impeded, his operational usefulness.

As of the date of this fitness report, he

appears fully capable of handling any Cl or Fl operation assigned to him.
