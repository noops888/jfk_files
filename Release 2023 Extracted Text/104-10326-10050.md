1. ACTION REQUIRED: PLEASE INCORPORATE THE FOLLOWING INTO THE

* ASSASSINATION>RECORDS REVIEW BOARD.

2.

AMBASSADOR MONDALE, THE EMBASSY

STRONGLY

OPPOSE RET.FASE TO THE PUBLIC OF ANY REFERENCE TO THE EXISTENCE OF A

SUCH ACTION COULD HAVE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES

FOR

RELATIONS AT A TIME WHEN A NUMBER OF DIFFICULT SECURITY

AND

ECONOMIC ISSUES REMAIN UNRESOLVED.

IT ALSO WOULD RISK REIGNITING

EARLIER CONTROVERSIES

PUBLIC CONFIRMATION WOULD, WITHOUT A DOUBT,

DISRUPT COOPERATION

_ ON IMPORTANT

COUNTERTERRORIST AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE CASES. BY MAKING THE

OBJECT OF GREATER PUBLIC AND POSSIBLY OFFICIAL SCRUTINY,

IT WOULD LOWER THE CONFIDENCE

IN OUR

ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR IDENTITY AND SECURITY:

3. IMPACT

GOVERNMENT DOES

NOT PUBLICLY ADMIT THAT IT COLLECTS INTELLIGENCE, AND AS A COROLLARY,

DOES NOT ADMIT TO HAVING LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES.

AVOIDS PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BECAUSE IT KNOWS THAT

IS ANATHEMA TO THE LEFT WING OF THE

POLITICAL SPECTRUM, AND ANY ADMISSION WOULD GIVE THE LEFT NEW

OPPORTUNITIES TO ATTACK

WHICH WAS THE

RULING PARTY

AND IS TODAY THE PARTY OF THE PRIME

MINISTER AND THE LEADING PARTY WITHIN THE RULING COALITION. ANY

OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT CONTRADICTED EARLIER

SECRET

DENIALS

WOULD BE USED AS A CLUB BY THE LEFT

TO ATTACK

FOR THE US-JAPAN MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY AND THE

PRESENCE OF US FORCES: IN JAPAN. WITH A STATE VISIT BY THE US

PRESIDENT FAST APPROACHING AND DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS OVER US BASES IN

OKINAWA LIKELY TO CONTINUE INTO 1997, THIS WOULD BE A PARTICULARLY

BAD TIME TO OPEN THE DOOR TO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT US ACTIVITIES

AND INTENTIONS

WOULD ALSO REVIVE OLD

CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE LARGELY RECEDED FROM THE HEADLINES. IN 1995,

THE PRESS MADE A MAJOR ISSUE

ANYTHING THAT LENT CREDIBILITY TO THE STORY WOULD

BE A SERIOUS POLITICAL LIABILITY

THEN FOREIGN MINISTER

PERSONALLY ASKED AMBASSADOR MONDALE THAT

THE US GOVERNMENT NOT RELEASE DOCUMENTS ON THIS SUBJECT.

EXPLAINED TO AMBASSADOR MONDALE

CAN DEAL WITH RUMORS AND

EVEN UNCONFIRMED LEAKS, BUT OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION

WOULD BE AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT AFFAIR, THREATENING TO DAMAGE

BOTH THE CONSERVATIVE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AS WELL AS THE

RELATIONSHIP.

EXPLICITLY IMPRESSED ON THE AMBASSADOR

THE NEED FOR THE US GOVERNMENT TO HOLD THE LINE AGAINST DISCLOSURE.

5. IN THE FALL OF 1995, A NEW YORK TIMES ARTICLE ALLEGED THAT

HAS SINCE BECOME PRIME

IN RESPONSE TO THE ENSUING PRESS QUERIES, JAPANESE

OFFICIALS OF THE CONCERNED MINISTRY DISMISSED THE STORY AS

IMPLAUSIBLE. IF THE US GOVERNMENT DECLASSIFIES A DOCUMENT THAT

CONFIRMS

IT WOULD HAND THE

PRESS NEW

OPPORTUNITIES TO REOPEN THE ISSUE OF ALLEGED ECONOMIC ESPIONAGE AND

ATTACK THE UNITED STATES AND ITS FRIENDS WITHIN THE

GOVERNMENT.

6. DISRUPTION OF LIAISON RELATIONSHIPS:

GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH US INTELLIGENCE

AGENCIES SECRET. â€¢ IN THE CASE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT OF THOSE

RELATIONSHIPS, ALL CONTACT COULD BE SEVERED IN THE EVENT OF

DISCLOSURE AND EMBARRASSMENT.

SUCH A RUPTURE IN THE RELATIONSHIP

DEFIES EASY REPAIR.

THE SOUTH KOREAN AGENCY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY

PLANNING, WHICH SERIOUSLY EMBARRASSED JAPANESE LIAISON WHEN IT

KIDNAPPED OPPOSITION POLITICIAN KIM DAE JUNG FROM TOKYO OVER TWO

DECADES AGO, IS STILL TREATED AS A PARIAH TODAY.

7. IMPACT ON CONTINUING OPERATIONS: OUR ONGOING COOPERATION

IN PURSUIT OF A MAJOR INTERNATIONAL

TERRORIST GROUP COULD BE TOTALLY DISRUPTED BY DISCLOSURE. EXTREMELY

IMPORTANT US LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INTELLIGENCE EQUITIES ARE AT STAKE

IN THIS COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR.

THE TERRORIST GROUP IS PROBABLY NOT

AWARE OF THE EXTENT OF US INVOLVEMENT IN THEIR PURSUIT. DISCLOSURE

THAT REMINDED THEM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

AGAINST THEM COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO OUR ABILITY TO COLLECT

INTELLIGENCE ON THE GROUP.

8.

IMPACT ON SOURCES: STATION'S RELATIONSHIP WITH AT LEAST ONE

PREDATES THE<JFK ASSASSINATION.> PUBLICITY ABOUT CIA PRESENCE

AND ACTIVITY, EVEN IN THE PAST, OFTEN CAUSES

TO WONDER ABOUT

SECRET
