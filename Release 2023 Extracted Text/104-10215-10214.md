SUBJECT:

Arthur G. VAIVADA - Request for Frosotion...

1. 'It is requested that Arthur G. Vaivada, a Career Agent, be promoted

fron GS-11 to grade GS-12 for his outstanding performance in carrying out a

precarious mission in line with the objectives of Project A PHODARCH, In

which he is the Principal igent.

2. In early January 1958, Vaivada volunteered to undertake a mission to

contact Cuban rebel leader Fidel Castro Ruz in the Sierra Maestra mountains

In south-eastern Cuba.

He arranged for his free passage into the Sierras

through contacts within the 26 July Movement which he and the Station.

developed earlier.

hiter the necessary arrangements, Vaivada left La Habana

on 5 April 1958 for Santiago de Cuba, from where he left for the Sierras

under the escort of rebel guides. In the course of approximately twenty

days! stay at the mountain hideout of Castro's headquarters, during which

time he was exposed to many hardships and great personal risks, he accompanied

Castro and a force of about 200 rebels on their dawn attack on the town of

Manzanillo on 26 March 1958. At Manzanillo, Vaivada broke off contact with

the Cuban rebels and returned to his base in Habana.

3. During his relatively shört stay in the Sierra Maestra mountains,

Valvada was able to gather considerable intelligence and operational

information of noteworthy value, together with an excellent photographic

coverage of his trip.

This exploit is another achievement to be added to the impressive

past performances of irthur G. Vairada, who has always shown a deep devotion.

to his work and to the Agency.

5. Valvada was born on 20 June 1922, and has been rdth CIA since 1949.

He has been a career agent since 1 June 1957, ana tas promoted to the grade

of GS-11 on 1 June 1957. His tour of duty in Cuba was from August 1954 until

31 March 1958.

SUBJECT:

Holleri

Veivarla

subject of our letter nuber 4025; interest in Assignment

1n U.s.

Pilinger

Sages

1.

In recent conversations with both JRr and RDS, Subject has

broached the prospect of a possible assignment within the U.s. follow-

ine completion of his Habana assignrent.

He says he would not want his

statenents

re reassignment which were recently forwarded to Headquartars

to be interprated to nean that he is not intarested in a u.S. tour.

ike

sajs that ne has been giving much thought to his future career, as well

as to the needs of his family.

He points out that he personally has now

spent approximately. Lo years, excepting

vacations and short training

perioas, living ma working

outside the U. So, that nis two chilaren

have never lived tnere, and that dotin be and his wile are concerned

that

too nuch tine will elapse before they can provide their children

with a perioi in the U.S. auring their forative years.

2.

It is the opinion of both kus and JkP that Subject is at a

point in his career development where a tour at Headquarters would

be extremely beneficial.

The Station lacks knowledge conceming the

specific Headquartars jobs to which a person of subject's status might

be assigned; but it is our understanding that OTR sonetimes employs

these persons as instructors. Ve believe that a lour with In would

not only renedy in great neasure deficiencies in Subjest's background

caused by lack of Headquarters experience, but would at the same time

afford Vil excellent instructor material.

3. In tien of Subject's own interest in such an assignment, and

our estimate of the potential value to him and to the Organization

that would accrue from it, we recormend inat Headquarters arrange such

an assignment 1f at all possible.

La In vien of the likelihood of Subject's transfer in the near

future, a prompt decision is requested.

the Station will take such measures as are feasible to cover the

activities of Subject and his wife while in Habana.

while the matter was not raferred to in the reference, Sucject's

projected one-year tour of duty will erd in june, 1950, at which time it

is VAIVADA's desire to leave Cuba for a reassimment in arcther area in

his present line of overational work and under similar unofficial cover

conditions.

A detailed dispatch on this subject will shortly be trans-

be open to VAIZAD during the Spring or Sunner of 1958.

3 Request for conversion of Arthur G. LATVADA FTON

Contract to Staff Status

REFERENCE

: HKH-A-2577

1.

Referenced dispatch fron the field recomends the conversion

of contract, agent Arthur Go FAIVADA to staff status,

and presents

& strong case for

such corversion.

VAIViDA has served CIA in a con-

tract capacity since 1949, witia a continuous high level of perfor-

nance; first in Costa Rica,

later in Guatenald and Cuba.

He is cur-

rently assigned to Cuba and is expectat to remain there indefinitely.

VAIVADA is 34 years old and was promoted recently to the equivalent

of a GS-10 rating.

His expressed career interests lie in contised

employment by CIh, more especially in the area ofunofficial cover

assignments, for which he is highly suited.

2.

Unfortunately Subject's spouse (since 1915) 1s a Costa Pican

citizen, a situation which complicates his proposed conversion some-

what.

and it has been determined that this can ba arranged within the sext

several months, barring unforeseen developments. She will be required

to spend nost of this period in the U.S. and is currently sariog

plans. to do so.

3. In view of TAllADA's oatstanding record as a contract agent,

his strong overall qualifications, and his expressed desire for a

career with CIA, it is recommended that he be granted staff status

at grade CS-11,

contingent upon his wife's first becowing a U.S.

citizen, and providing he can meet Security and other requirements.

There is available in iH Division a staff-position (BAF-409) to

which VAIVADA can be assigned.

4. Wa Division contemplates bringing VAIVADA to the U.S. for

covert training in the near future.

5. Approval for the conversion of VAIVADi Iron contract to

staff status, as indicated above, is hereby requested.

son.

Hyers stated that, while cases like this yere usually very

difficult, he felt this particular one might be justified In vow

of VAIVADA's long and excellent record with the Agency and the rela-

tively long time dwring which ha has boos married. Myers indicated

that the procedure would be as follows:

Presentation of a formal request for waiver on citizenship

requirements for spouse and granting of staff status to Subject.

The memorandun would bo prepared for Personnel,

would then go

to security, and subsequently, with recommendations of both,

to Deputy Director, who would have the final decision in this

Myers was to discuss the matter further with other elements of

Security and advise within the next several days as to what the next

stop should be.

2.

Considoring the possibility that such a request might be

turned down, the undersigned discassed with Pennington the proce-

duros for acquisition of citizonship for Mrs. VAIVADA, and doter-

mined that this should be relativaly simplo.

The requirements weres

forty-five days with some additional time to acquire passport.. So

long as we have nothing that would sake her Inadmissable to the U.S.,

the basic requirements would bos ability to speak Englisa and to

pass a relatively simple test based on pamphlet which would be given

to her for stody. Security would presumably handle her case when

she arrivos in the States.

8 Proposed Staff Status for Arthur. G. VAIVADA

HKH-5-2577, 17 April 1956

1. Referenced dispatch from the field recommends the conversion

of contract agent Arthur G. VAIVADA tO atall status, and presants a

good case for such conversion.

VAIVADA has served CIA in & contract

capacity since 1949 vita a continuous high level of parformance; first

1n Costs Rica, later in Guatenala and Cuba. He 18: 34 years old and

was promoted recently to the equivalent of a grade GS-iO. His ex-

proased career intarests lie in continued employment by CIA, mora

especially in the area of unofficial cover assignments; for which

ho is highly suitod.

2.

Unfortunately Sabject's spouse (since 1945) 1s a Costa:

Rican citizen.

Proliainary investigation at Hosdquarters has revealed

that subject's conversion to staff status is virtually out of the

question so long as his vife remains an alien... It has also bees de-

terminod, however, that the wife can acquire U.S. citisenship vithin

a span of 15 days 1f she so desires and is willing to cons to the

JoS. 105 thet pariod of timo.

This would renove the major stumbling

block to acquisition of stall status for vAlVADA.

3. In view of VAIVADA's outstanding record as a contract agout,

his strong overall qualifications and his expressed desire for a ca-

reer tita cIA, it is recommended that (a) VAIVADA's wife be encoursged

to seek U.S. citizenship under the terms outlined above (b) VAIVADA

be granted staif status, contingent upon his wife's first becoming

a U.S. citizen, and providing he can meet all other requiremento.

C, WH/III has endorsed the récomendation for staff status and a sug-

geation by C/WH/Adinin that BAP-409, a new position currently alloted

to san Jose, be transferred to Habana to be filled by VAIVADA.

L. It is further recosmended that ki Division consider bring-

1ng. VAIVADA to the U.S. for covert training to coincide vita bis vite's

& chance for additional Headquarters training.

Subject previously

received covert training at Headquarters fron 5 October through 25

Hovember 1953.

Memo on Cover Status - Arthur G. Vaivada

1.

Enclosed herewith is the outline of an idea in reering with the

nature of this notional

cover plan of a temporary rature.

Careful

consideration has been given to a number of ideas, all of which were

rejected because possible local conflicts.. This idea is still general

enough (and I hope convincing) to leate opportunity for changes ard/or

improvenent at Headquarters.

The idea, and the terrinology, was

Bleaned from the pages of "Investrent in Cuba", a July 1955 study

published by the U.S. Department of Coumerce,

As I understand this cover arrangement, the PSI should mail ne

a directive somewhat along the lines of the enclosed infornation.

This

should "hold us" for a couple of months, with possibly sone queries fron

me occasionally. Inen when our operational picture requires irvestigation

in some particular field, PSI can be notified through the Station to

request a survey or poll

in that field..

3. On the basis of the enclosed "directive" (plus stationary and

allied materials) I can consult a local lawyer as to the registration

of this "Agency" and then advise PSI as to the legal requirement.

an extended period, and he has worked hard in the CP penetration program

in Cuba since his arrival there.

3. It is believed that he would be an effective recruiter in various

countries in Latin America.

He stated that he was keenly interested in, and would like to

engage in, such operations, and would welcome being asked to hit a

well-chosen target in any (Spanish-speaking) Latin American country.

Mr. Crozier stated that he expects to return to Cuba shortly.

Il, after three months, there is no indication that his security has been

adversely affected by the recent segassination of one uí his agents, be

HENDRANDU FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Valvada

During the morning of 30 April Mr. Hillard of Cover taie-

phoned regarding Subject, citing IN 35508.

Ur. Millard said that

he would be meeting with Vairada at 1500 hours today and proposed

providing him with a temporary rather than permanent cover with

the new cover company which was being contemplated for long-range

development. Ir. Hillard's reasoning was that he did not wish

to place Vaivade under the new conpany with the chance that the

trial periou approved for the Station might cause Vaivada to be

pulled out from that.cover in short order.

Hr. Millard said that

the temporary cover he intended offering Vaivada would be adequate.

2. I concurred with the above proposal.
