to his conversion a suitable cover, consistent with his

legal background, must be arranged.

In infornal discussions with your office, a

possibility of arranging non-offielal cover with a local

law fire was discussed.

This law firn would ostensibly

have contracts with various goverment agencies.

Mr? Roborts will bo hired by the law tItIl to serve ao i

legal advisor to the goverment agencies thus enabling

him to be gone fron the olfice a great part of the time.

In vlew of his many contacts in goverment and private

circles, this typo of cover rould hold up since sone of
