OGC IN COORDINATION WITH EA/ALL AND

WILL ENUMERATE THE THE UNFAVORABLE REACTION THE

HAD TO RECENT DISCLOSURES AND AGENCY REQUESTS FOR PERMISSION TO

DISCLOSE INFORMATION PASSED TO US

EXAMPLES WE INTEND TO CITE INCLUDE THE DUTY TO WARN ISSUE WHERE

WERE ADAMANT ABOUT NOT GIVING PERMISSION TO

DISCLOSE THEIR INFORMATION BECAUSE OF SOURCE PROTECTION ISSUES

ABOUT THE BOOK PUBLISHED BY A FORMER AGENCY

EMPLOYEE THAT ALLUDES TO

THE RECENT (DEMARCHE EXPRESSING CONCERN THAT A FORMER

AGENCY OFFICER ALLEGEDLY DISCLOSED CLASSIFIED /

INFORMATION (AN ALLEGATION THE DDCI ASSURED

WOULD

(BE THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED), AND THE DEMARCHE)

RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT OUR U.S.

DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION AND WHETHER THE LEGISLATION PROVIDES

ADEQUATE GUARANTEES ABOUT NOT DISCLOSING INFORMATION PASSED TO US

WITHOUT EXPRESS AUTHORIZATION. FROM SUCH

" WE WILL ALSO MAKE REFERENCE TO A RECENT

APPROACH

| ASKING FOR OUR OKAY IN THEIR

DECLASSIFYING SOME OF OUR DOCUMENTS, AND OUR STRONGLY-WORDED

RESPONSE DENYING PERMISSION AND ARGUING THAT SUCH DISCLOSURE WOULD

BE A BREACH OF TRUST.

*

IN ORDER TO BOLSTER OUR POSITION WITH THE<JEK> BOARD,

REQUEST STATION OBTAIN A HARD COPY OF THE

DEMARCHE ON

THE DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION THAT CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE MEMO.

WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH HARD COPY EVIDENCE

WILL

BOLSTER OUR ARGUMENT SIGNIFICANTLY.

WE ARE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE

ACTUAL TEXT OF THIS (DEMARCHE) IN HOS.

5.

THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS THAT WE DO NOT WANT EVEN TO

/ ABOUT DECLASSIFYING. THE AFOREMENTIONED

DOCUMENTS. WE HOPE OUR

MEMO CONVINCES THE BOARD THAT, IN LIEU OF

RELEASING THE DOCUMENTS,

SUMMARIES THAT OMIT ALL REFERENCE

WILL SUFFICE.

FYI: OUR FALLBACK POSITION IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN THE

CONCEPT OF SUMMARIES, IS TO MAKE CLEAR THAT WE CANNOT RELEASE THE

DOCUMENT, EVEN IN REDACTED FORM, WITHOUT.

PERMISSION; FURTHER,

THAT IF WE SEEK AND ARE DENIED PERMISSION AND

THE BOARD NONETHELESS PROCEEDS WITH THE DECLASSIFICATION, IT WILL

HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

IN SUM, OUR GOING-IN POSITION IS WE WANT TO

AVOID RAISING THE SPECTER

THAT THE AGENCY MAY

HAVE TROUBLE PROTECTING THEIR SECRETS.

IF THE BOARD TURNS DOWN

OUR INITIAL PROPOSAL AND INSISTS WE SEEKL

PERMISSION TO

DECLASSIFY, WE WILL DO SO: IN SUCH AN EVENT. OUR LEGAL PEOPLE*

BELIEVE A STRONGLY-WORDED DOCUMENT FROM THEL

DETECTON WOULD PROBABLY PERSUADE THE BOARD NOT TO RELEASE THE

DOCUMENT.

WE WILL KEEP YOU ADVISED ON HOW THIS. IS

PROGRESSING AND WOULD APPRECIATE ANY FURTHER GRIST FOR THE MILL AS

WE CRAFT OUR MEMO TO THE BOARD AS WELL AS THE TEXT OF THE

DEMARCHE ON DECLASSIFICATION LEGISLATION.
