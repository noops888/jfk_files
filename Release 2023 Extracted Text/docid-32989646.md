SUBJECT: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

I WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

Mean

My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's

information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in

racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference mentioned above.

The following additional information received from the

Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's

consideration in connection with this luncheon.

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff,

Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in

Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the

FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's

staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dallas County Texas, on'•?

9/6/67. The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded

by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

UNRECORDED COFT FILLI

On

9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially

advised that after our representative had left the above meeting,

Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-

tion and said that the FBI 'is the white man's police and they

want nothing but "stool pigeons."

This individual further

alleged that all of Ratliff's 44 staff members were hand-picked

by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators. He

charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working

at creating racial incidents in order to stir up local Negro

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

RE:

LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

OFFICE OF ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving

force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County

and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and

antipolice. He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying

to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional

antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged

that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of

the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-

old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in

the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the

arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity

learned of his activity and told him to desist.' He stated that

in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),

staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were

in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.

He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming

the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov

cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in

preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.

Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb

an

"Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to

Mrs. Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shriver of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated

9/18/67.

ACTION:

Submitted for the Director's possible use.

On occasion it has proved important in connection with United States

interests in and relations with the other American Republics to obtain

intelligence information on activities taking place within the United

States. Specifically, it is important that the Department keep track of

¡ the movements and contacts of selected Latin Americans while in this

country when there are reasons to believe that subversive activities

directed at the other Governments of this Hemisphere are being planned

and coordinated here Such activities are against the national interests

of the United States in so far as they may result in developments which

could endanger United States lives, threaten United States business

interests and cause Iriction within the inter-American systeme

In the past the FBI has always cooperated in furnishing the Department

in specific Latin American cases with information available from estab-

lished sources, but it has shown understandable reluctance to become in-

volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in cases where

there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive activities

directed against the United States or violation of United States laws.

It Is felt that while this information is helpful, it does not completely

Ill the gap in the intelligence information important in the conduct of

foreign relations. It is understood that the CIA, while interested in

foreign intelligence, does not carry out surveillance operations within

the confines of the United States.

It would be most appreciated if you could express an opinion as to

how surveillance of selected Latin American visitors to this country might

be arranged on an indiviqual case basis.

An identical. letter is being sent to the CIA in the hope that

coordinated approach can be made.

By letter of 10/10/55 Mr. Robert Murphy,

Deputy Under-ll

secretary of state, noted that it is important that state keep track od

movements and contacts of selected Latin Americans while in US. when

there are reasons

to believe subversive activities directed at other

governments of this hemisphere are being planned and coordinated here.

The letter notes that the fBl has cooperated in furnishing information

from established sources but "hos shown understandable reluctance to

become involved to

the extent of conducting direct surveillance in

cases where there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subuersive

activities directed against the United states or violation of United

¡states laws."

Letter reguests opinion as to how surueillance of

selected Latin American visitors might be arranged on individual case

basis and notes thut identical letter being sent to CIA in the hope

a coordinated approach can be made.

JEK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

Attached is suggested letter to state advising Bureau in-

vestigates promptly cases

indicating subversive action against other

Governments in this nemisphere using investigative techniques appro-

priate; that full-time surveillances require tremendous expenditures

- of manpower and in most cases more information can be obtained through

other techniques but Bureau not reluctant to use physical surveillance

when circumstances warrant; that when state has creditable information i

of type of actiuity referred to, it should be referred to Bureau in i

order that prompt investigation

may be made; and that Bureau will con

sider physical surveillance when requested by state when agreed it

is wariranted..

Attached letter also notes it would be desirable,

appropriate and in accordance with U.S. lows that such individuals no

be allowed to enter U.s.

when reason

to relieue they would engage in

such activities•

You requested an opinion as to

how surveillances of solocted Latin American visitors to this

country might be arranged on in individual case basis.

When there is creditable information available indicating

that subversive sctivities directod at other governmenis of this

homisphore are being plumed and coordinated in the United States,

the FBI tales prompt investigative action in view of the probability

o: violations of the registration or neutrality provisions of

United States laws.

In conducting these investigations all logical

Investigative techniques

are used, including physical surveillances

where circumstances would warrant.

Full-time physical surveillances

roquire a tremendous expenditure of manpower, however, and are

practicable only in connection with some phases of highly important

cases is the security or criminal fields.

In the greater majority

of cases more actual intormation can be obtained through such

Tolson investigative techniques as spot-type surveillance, the use, of

Bad avallable sources of information and informants, the development

The Honorable Robert Murphy

Deputy Under Secretary for Political Affairs

Department of State

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mi. Murphy:

Reference is made to your letter of 10 October 1955, relative to

the problem of conducting surveillance of certain Latin American

nationals who might be suspected of carrying on subversive activities

in the United States, directed againsi Latin American countries. In

this regard you are correct in your understanding that the CIA dòes ."

not conduct such surveillances within the confines of the United States.

Mr. Hoover has furnished me a copy of his reply to your inquiry setting

forth the FBl's jurisdiction and responsibilities in this matter.

We have been furnishing to the Department and to the FBI such

intelligence information at we have obtained through our operations

abroad bearing upon possible subversive activities of the type of per-

son you describe, as such information became available to us. It

would also be helpful if we could receive from time to time from the

Department, leads which you may receive and which we could possibly

" follow up in the Latin American country against which subversive

activities are being cazried on.

In order to assist us in developing our coverage of this field, we

would suggest that you designate someone in the Department of State

who could confer with the appropriate persons in this Agency, and if

you will let me know whom you will designate for this purpose, I will

arrange to put him in touch with my representative. Also, if you see

no objection, I will mention this matter to the members of the IAC

as it is possible that the representatives in Latin America of the mem-

ber agencies of the IAC might also be able to furnish useful information

to the Department.

A copy of this reply is being sent to Mr. Hooves.

OBSERVATIONS (continued)

Since Januaru, 1954, CIA has indicated on four separate

potent allis

Certainly, there are dangers involved in any attempt to

cover official establishments of "friendly" foreign countries.

coverage would have to be most discreet.

We could not even

attempt to utilize the same type of extensive coverage we

haue on the souiet bloc.

*.

6.

If we went into a program of this nature, we would have to

have funds.

Regardless of how limited the coverage is, it

will take money.

A progrom of this nature should be run by and within the

control of the bureau: however.

it should have the blessings

of high officials ouiside the bureau and, particularly, the

endorsement of the state Department.

RECOLMENDATIONS:

That we institute a program designed to gather intelligence

from "friendly" foreign official esiablishments in this country,

starting on a highly restricted basis-namely buinstalling

wire tape on, where possible with jull security, microphone

coverage, on selected foreign establishments. Included in

these establishments would be embassies and consulates, and

delegations to the United Nations.

The selection of the

countries to be covered will be based on those indicated by

the state Department to be "problem children" or the most

fruitful potential sources of intelligence. Any further

coverage beyond technical and microphone coverage will depend

on what leads are developed through these sources and what

can be done on a most discreet basis. We will continue ou

Anagram Program and will continue our efforts to develop

informants within these establishments when such action can

be done discreetly. .

HEr. Sir

Dear No. Hoover:

I wish to thank you for your letter of October I, 1955 in

which you stated that there is no reluctance on the part of the

•FBI to conduct physical surveillance of selected Latin American

visitors to this country where the circumstances warrant such

action.

Your assurances that every effort will be made in these

cases to develop those aspects which may be of particular inter-

est to the Department of State and that consideration will be

by the Department of State where it is agreed that this type of

handling these cases in the future.

then the Department of State has reason to believe that visit

ing Latin Americans may be engaged in planning and coordinating

subversive activities directed at other governments of this

hemisphere, such information will be brought to the attention of

with an explanation of the Department's objectives and requirements s

the FBI through established channels as heretofore, together

SUBJECT: AFGHANISTAN

At the IAC meeting on November 29, 1955, Mr.

Dulles of CIA introduced

a CIA poper, not on the

agenda,

going into developments in Afghanistan, with particular

referenos to strong indloations that Afghanistan may be

going into the souret camp.

During the disoussion,

appeared to be the opinion of the IAc group that the souiet

governuent is able to offer considerable advantages to

afghaniston in the way of trade routes bypassing Pariaton,

with which afghaniston is having difficulties, and through

possible jinanctal and military support. As a result, it

was the leeling that there is a strong possibility Afghanistan

will gradually fall within the control of the soulets, although

ostenatoly remaining a sovereign state.

There were several changes suggested in the CIA

paper, and he. luhrts will get a copy of it for our benefit.

In Inne witi our rocent discussions, it is suggested

that a tenorandu be prepared, briefly posing

the problem that

Afghantaton may cons under soviet control and then refleoting

threat Afghanistan representativos or nationalist

groups in the United states would pose fron the internal

security standpoint.

result, it was felt there 18 strong posalbility Aighanistan will gradually

fall within Soviet control, although ostensibly remaining sovereign state.

Afghanistan maintains Embassy In Washington, D. Co, Consulate

In New York CIty, and honorary consul In San Francisco. No information

received Aíghan officials in US engaged 1n political or subversive

activities.

During last 4 years no information received any Alghan groups

In US engaged in subversive sctivities. No Alghan nationals on Security

Index. In event Soviet economic gains

in Aighanistan lead to political

control of country, we would have to consider giving comparable corerage

to Afghan diplomatic establiaments and official personnal as now given to

Il Alghanistan becomes openly pro-soviet, we would have to

consider dangerousness of Algkan sationals in US as regarde internal security

Inis intelligence information relates to the podicy unich

these foreign nations are pursuing or developing in

connection with various international matters:

With the development of the recent crises in

the Middle East and Eastern Hurppe we found that our efforts

in this field were especially rewarding.

Inrough numerous

sources which have been established during the past year we

secured voluminous intelligence data which were given within

the hour dissemination to other Governmental, departments and

officials.

Deputy Under secretary of state Robert Murphy has

addressed

a letter to me concerning some of the intelligence

countries by bribes. (Memorandum Roach to Belmont 8-8-58, re "Robert

WTO on 8-8-58 advised that since the revolution in

former political activities.

It has become apparent from daily news stories that

Venezuela is presently in a state of political upheaval. Although

the leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated

he has no

political aspirations it has been pointed out by correspondents that

he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and

"wooing" the support of the communists. This reportedly has been

done by statements attributed to Larrazabal that he could not conceive

of a venezuelan communist being controlled by the USSR since all

Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and loyal to venezuela. It has

also been pointed out that the communists of Venezuela are being

played up as the heroes of the recent revolution in that country.

Some correspondents have stated that it is felt there will possibly

be a military coup if the politicians of venezuela do not soon set up

a government acceptable to the military leaders. It is further

noted that the Vice President and Irs. Nixon experienced insults

during their tour of Latin America, the most vicious of which

occurred in Venezuela.

Irom the above, it appears that we should try to place

ourselves in a position to obtain current intelligence data

concerning the Venezuelan political situation. It is pointed out

that there appears to be a possibility of the Venezuelan communists

gazning more and more influence and power in that country and,

a strong interest in Latin America by the soviet Embassy.

WFO on 8-22-58 advised

that although Brazil's President

recently indicated a stronger stand in favor of the U.

so, various news

media have reported that politically powerful nationalist and leftist

groups do exist in Brazil and that until recently Brazil's President zad

avoided offending such groups.

Bratiets

Anti-T. s. feelings and demonstrations were exhibited in Brazil

during the south American trip of Vice President and Urs. Nixon and

although the demonstrations did not attain the violence exhibited in some

of the other south American countries, the demonstrations indicated the

work of well organized group or groups opposed to the U. s.

On 7-8-58, Wilson Velloso, Press Attache, Brazilian Embassy,

who admitted former membership in the Communist Party of Brazil, uoon

interuieu di his request, stated that ne nad attemptea to discuss mis

communist farty actiuities with Brazilian officials but they indicaced

indifference to such information in 1951.

Velloso supposed the reason for the indifference was thai Kis

information was common knowledge; however, another explanation would be

sanction of the communist Party on the part of Brazilian officials, even

though the communist Party has been outlawed there. Velloso stated he

Knew of no communist influence at the Brazilian Embassy but stated that

it was the tendency of Latin Americon countries at this time to play

¡communist countries against noncommunist countries in an effort to

obtain all they could in the nature of aid and assistance, inferring

that the Brazilian Embassy would also attempt this practice. Velloso

UNRECORDED COPY FILFD IN

commented that he did not believe that such negotiations on the part of

Latin American countries necessarily indicated that they were

procommunist.

Who noted a confidential sourlay da

đau sẻa that many

South American countries were aligned with Russia in apposing the

establishment of a European common market and that Brazil had indicated

a strong opposition to the market.

The source also advised that the

Russian Embassy had indicated a strong interest in Latin America

recently and hao indicated a desire to establish diplomatic or economic

relations with 3razil..

Memorandum Donahoe to Belmont

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

In view of the above information, it would appear that Brazil

could easily align itself with the soviet-bloc countries and therebys

create an international situation affecting the U.S.

While there

no apparent indication at this time of a political upheaval in Brazil,

Brazil's President's recent opposition to the nationalist and leftist

groups in Brazil might tend to develop internal strife in Brazil,

leading to such an upheaval.

Reference is made

the bureau by a highly sensitive source being handled by the

DE On.

Washington Field Office (WEO)

indicating that souiet and satillite

intelligence representatives haue a keen interest in assistance being

rendered by our "jriends." They were referring to attaches from

India, Indonesia, and United Arab

Republic who apparently have been

collecting certain types of information for the soviet and satellit.

representatives.

The foregoing again conjirms that the soviets and the

satellites realize. that representatives of noncommunist diplomatic

establishments can be of tremendous value to them. Naturally, a

representative of the Indion Embassy has access to U.s. institutions

and areas not usually accessiblè to the souiets and satellites.

Furthermore, a representative of such an embassy con mix in circles

and have access to Americans and others without being placed under

any particular suspicions.

If such an individual is recruited by

the soviets, he con operate with an excellent couera.:.

We previously

have seen instances where the soviets have taken an interest in

representatives of Latin American countries apparently for the purpose

of recruiting them as agents.

THAILAND ACTIVITIES IN THE UNITED STATES

The Bureau feels the avove program is essential

in view of the strategio location of Thailund and lis

proximity to cormunist Chine and Laos, the current area

of political unrest. It is felt sources developed within

diplomatic establishnents of Thailand could furnisi pertinent

information regarding political conditions and political

trends in southeust saia which would be of considerable

interest to other U.S. Gouernment agencies.

In regard io futh Nuomi Burney, FO should open

o separate 134 investigation on her to develop additional

backgroune information as required in section 107 of the

manual of Instructions to moke cartain she is type of person

we wont to contaot as a source. If the investigation is

favorable, submit vow requesi to the Bureau for state

Department cleuronce to intervied her. Bear in mind that

when Burney is of no further interest to us, the Burecu

should 30 advise CIA.

Bufiles foil to disclose any pertinent derogatory

information identifiable with Ruth Naot Burney.

NOTE:

Since State Department clearance has been received

for the Bureau to institute a program in developing live

sources within Ihailand diplomatic establishments in the U.S.,

WrO and New York being so advised. State Department also

furnished clearance for very discreet investigations of

potential sources which we will select.

In view of the

information received from CIA via liaison regarding Burney,

felt she is in a very

good position for possible development as

a source of pertinent information regarding Thailand

activities in the U.S. and in general.

$29,539

Of this total estimated monthly cost, $126 covers cost

of leased lines in New York City and the balance, $20, 413, the

prorated salaries of personnel working the plants.

of the estimated monthly expenditure covers technical surveillances

which the Bureau would desire to maintain for its own intelligence

and investigative requirements, even in the absence of requests by

State

Department for the coverage. The only two which do not qualify

in this respect are the French Chancery and German Embassy coverage.

During the past 'six months two technical surveillances

maintained under this phase of captioned program were discontinued.

The coverage of the cuban Consulate in Miami which was instituted

5/20/59 was discontinued 7/15/59 because it was not particularly

productive.

From 10/5/59 to 10/12/59 technical coverage was main-

tained on the Iranian Embassy in Washington to supplement special

coverage of General Timur Bakhtiar, head of Iranian Security Police,

at specific request of Mr. Robert Murphy of State Department.

Saturday September 13 at 6:45 P.M. the fascist pig

cops shot

Hoy (3314 W. Monroe St.) two times in the head while his

hands were up. James Hoy was

murdered by a pig who hides behind

badge #12611

and drives car #70-30. James Hoy, 17, is another

example of

murder,

brutalleys and torture of Black people in this

rascist capitalistic country.

Pig Mayor Daley, Pig Chief Conlisk,

and Hammerhead

states attorney Manrahan are directly responsible

for the subhuman actions of these mad maniacs who occupy our com-

munities.

There were witnesses who say the pigs shot James Hoy

with

his

hands up.

Charles cox, 20, was beaten to death by the

pigs in a cell at

• Fillmore Station; Linda Anderson, 17, was mur-

dered by a fool pig who shot blindly, threw her down for no rea-

fors

son or cause. James Johnson, 18, was murdered by Daley's mad

pigs at 15th

and Keeler, and Larry Roberson,

member of the Van-

guard, was killed as

he

was helping the people, but Larry Roberson

was a Panther and he shot two pigs before he ivas overcome!

We, the Black panther Pary, will stand by the deodle to re

move these mad beasts:

we

say

in #7 of the Ten Point Program:

"We want an immediate end to police brutality and

murder of black people."

The second ammendment of the consitution gives us a

recognize

this filthy

government

is killing off the black youth, and we will not go

STOP FASCISK

Fascism is the pover of finance capital itself-- the greedy

businessman, the demagogic politiciand one who Icads the people

by appealing to prejudices and passions), and the rucist dog cop.

Bach of which carries out the oppression and exploitation of the

working class people in the guise of acmocracy.

The BLACK PANTHER PARTY, THE VANGUARD PARTY, finds it our

duty to educate the poor and oppressca people to the form that

this capitalistic, racist system is taking-- FASCISM. COld

blooded fascism is exemplified in the assaination of Malcolm X,

the imprisonment of Huey P. Newton for his political beleifs,

the assauasion of Martin Luther King, the occupation of

Wilmington, Delaware for one year aftor the death of king, the

24,000 throops at the Chicago Democratic Convention, the necessity.

For the exile of Eldrigãe Cleaver, the national repression of the

Black Panther Party, the attack on the Republic of New Africa"s

Convention, the brutal attack on the people of Berkley by 7,000

national guardsmen, and the representatives of all progressive

elements that are struggling to wrest the power out of the hands

of the oppressor and return it to the people.

We, the masses of the people, must unite around this commo.

enemy of fascism toregain the power of the people. We, as a people,

have been stripped of our power as a result of oppression and ex-

ploitation.: Before we can regain that power and begin to control

our own destinies this system must suffer a revolutionary change •

Epi che good of all the people.

" Power cocedes nothing without demand". Without our dcmand

to neutralize or surpress the power of this system, we will in turn

suffer defeat under fascism and lose our move for liberation to return

the pover to the neople.

BAD HEALTH CARE is pa.. of the way of life in the black comunity

*The life expectancy of U:S. blacks 15? years loss than whites.

*The infant mortality of children in Chicago poverty areas is

among the highest in the country.

#*In public hospitals throughout the U,s., black and Latin women

are forced to submit to storilization following childbirths.

"health care" is a profit-making industry and nat

a human right for all people.

LACK OF GOOD DECENT HEALTH CARE 1s one of the many ways this racist

capitalist system oppresses the people, and tries to keep us too roak

WHY DO WE NEED THE PEOPLE'S FREE MEDICAL CARE CENTER?

The People's Free Medical Caré Center is the first step in getting

On September 18, 1969, issue of the

"Find Panthers Feed Only a Few Children

The Black Panther party's program to

feed breakfast to school children is almost non-

existent in Chicago, a Tribune investigation

disclosed yesterday.

Altho Fred Hampton, the party's Illinois

chairman, claims that 3,000 to 3,500 children are being

fed

at three locations each week, it was found that

on some days the centers were never opened and

on others only a handful of children showed up.

Solicit Food and Cash

Local and federal law enforcement

agencies

Panthers: which have

been

closely watching the

activities, have also discovered that

the Panthers continue to solicit food, milk, and

cash donations for the program from merchants and

other business men thruout the city.

One merchant, who regularly donates

large amounts of food for the program, recently told

investigators that when he visited

one of the

centers,

the few children present were being read excerpts from

what he said was the Communist Manifesto before the

breakfast was served.

List 3 Locations

The Panthers list their breakfast

centers

in the Trinity Lutheran church, 4837 State

Street, the Jackson Boulevard Christian church, 2412

Jackson

bivd., and the Better Boys Foundation

club,

1512 S. Pulaskiird.

All three of the feeding centers were

visited Tuesday and not one of then was open to

feed children.

At the Trinity church, two small boys

and six leun-ayers walled

outside for more than

an hour but nobody came with

the key to open the

building.

One of the boys linally went to marby

grocery and purchased a bay of potato chips which

he shared with

his companion..

Children Walk By

Altho the church is located near DuSable

High school, 4934 Wabash Av., the Farren Elementary

school, 5055 State st., and across the street from

the Taylor homes housing project, hundreds of youngsters

walked past without even bothering to stop.

Other youngsters made brief stops in

the nearby grocery and a restaurant before going

on to school.

No Breakfasts Lately

At the Jackson boulevard, church the

door was locked.

Investigators' reports noted that

the church has

been

opened

for the free breakfasts

only sporadically during the last month.

At 1512 S. Pulaski, there were no signs

of any feeding program

in progress. A teen-age

youth sweeping the stairway said that "they haven't

been feeding

kids here for several weeks."

He said

he had heard reports that the program would be

starting again soon.

resterday, 22 children of grade school

age were counted guing

into the Trinity church

for breakfast. On other occasions, investigators

noted children leaving the building with

half-eaten sandwiches and then throwing them in a

wastebasket on the sidewalk.

Since the program was

begun at the church

two months ago, detectives said

a high of 45 children (and on some days only four

or five were fed there.

The source further advised that the

about three days

move in to the clinic, it would be moved to a

different area in order to avoid a confrontation.

HAMPTON informed the individual at National

HILLIARD stated the name of REID was familiar and

the National BPP Headquarters had advised all

individuals

calling in with

requests that they

could establish a United Front Against

Fascism Organization and initiate organizations

in their communities.

Once these programs are

initiated, they were

instructed to report their

activities to the National Office of the BPP.

HILLIARD stated he did not rocall authorizing

any

one Iron st. Paul to initiate any program but as

long as they are doing it and not using the name

of the BPP, there was nothing the BPP could

do about it.

9/8/69)

On October 10, 1959, at about 11:00 a.m.,

CHARLENE MITCHELL, Field Secretary, National Black

Liberation Commission (NBLC), CP, USA, in company with

two leaders of the Illinois Communist

Party (CP),

met with several members of the BPP including

FRED HAMPTON, Deputy Chairman, Illinois BPP, at

BPP Headquarters, Chicago, Illinois, for the purpose

of exchanging ideas in the struggle

for black

liberation as well as

finalizing plans

for

MITCHELL to be the main speaker at the "End the

War Now' Rally on

October 12, 1969, in Chicago,

Illinois, which affair is being sponsored by the African-

Heritage Association (AAHA) (a characterization

i take Association e

of which is contained hereinafter). HAMPTON is also

to be one of the speakers at the above mentioned

rally.

General discussion at BPP Headquarters

in Chicago indicated that

the BPP and CP have

a concurrent theory toward the anti-riot law

trial currently in process in Chicago, Illinois,

in that

neither

want to become

involved

in

any

violence or possible arrest

situations.

FRED HAMPTON stated that the demonstrations

by the BPP at the Federal Building in Chicago during

the tilal are for the purpose of tolling the faits

He statud that BPp is somewhat allici

with the faction of MIKE KLONSKY, current member of

the National Interim Committee (NIC) of the

SDs and current leader of the revolutionary

Youth

Movement II (RYM II) faction of SDS, but that th

current leadership of SDS, called the Weatherman

faction, are a "bunch of damn fools".

HAMPTON claimed that the BPP is the

vanguard in this country whereupon CHARLENE MITCHELL

questioned this statement stating that actually

the vanguard are those who work on the basis of

Marxist-Leninist outlook.

Further discussion brought out that

preparations are being made by the BPP to circulate

petitions for community control of the local police

departments and that a survey indicates that the

people in the ghetto are very enthusiastic over

this idea.

Concerning the establishment of a National

Defense Organization, CHARLENE MITCHELL stated that

prospects are good for calling a national conference

of such an organization where possibly branches of

the organization can be established in the major

cities in this country. In this connection, MITCHELL

spoke of ANGELA DAVIS, 8 California CP professor at

the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA)

where attempts had been made to dismiss her, but

that people rallied to her support and that

broad defense support should also be established

for BOBBY SEALE, Chairman, National BPP, who is

one of the defendants

in the anti-riot trial in

Chicago.

HAMPTON felt that the BPP program should

appeal to the masses, including such projects as

breakfasts for school

schildren and work toward the

establishment of health centers since the communities

cannot absorb large quantities of ideology, but must

be assisted where personal

needs exist.

Another conclusion of this meeting is that

the CP and BPP

are not "sticking their necks out for

anybody", particularly in connection with the antiriot

trial in Chicago.

On October 12, 1969, an "End the War Now"

Rally, sponsored by the AAHA was held at the Joe

Louis Theater, 35th and State Streets, Chicago,

Illinois.

Approximately 225 people attended. CP

and non-CP people were in attendance.

CHARLENE MITCHELL introduced FRED HAMPTON

as one of the speakers.

HAMPTON stated that the government has

no right to have BOBBY SEALE in jail or to try

him.

The BPP is serving the people in the community

by feeding school children and soon plans to complete

a medical center.

HAMPTON stated that the Chicago Police

Department has raided the Illinois BPP Headquarters

in Chicago so often that now it is almost becoming

a museum. People want to see how the building has

The BPP, however, will continue to

grow since they are the vanguard.

HARPTON stated that we must stop the war

in Vietnam. Women and children are being killed in

Vietnam while here the "pigs" are doing the same thing.

CHARLENE MITCHELL, the main speaker, first

déscribed herself as the first black woman to ever

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its ufficial newspiper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December, lobo, in Orkland

California, to organize black people su they can take control

of the life, poldtics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GLURGE StALE, BPY Chairman, and HUtY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense. NEWTUN is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to und oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community irs urged to arm

thenselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" Issue of September T, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black nen. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere: Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite:

Black Power.

Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of

"The Black Panther" is the

statement,"

.....we will not dissent from American covernment.

He will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Charman MAO Tse-tung

of the

People's Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

•The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue,

advised on November 14, 190y,

he attended a political orientation class at the

Precious Blood Church, Hestern and Congress

•Streets, Chicago, on October 29, 1969. About

30 individuals were in attendance.

The major discussion centered on

arguments to counter the classic racist

doctrine that all whites are evil by nature

and cannot be

saved

l except by extermination.

The counter argument was that a multiplicity

of reasons are responsible for the white race's

technological advantage over the non-white race,

but the white man's system of economics makes

bim the monster he is.

It was also argued that

capitalism and imperialism by their very nature

causes the white man to act as he does.

The

race or color of his skin has nothing to do with

his actions.

Source was unable to identify

the leader of the above class.

said these things about JAKE WINTERS, because they are already

a fact. It's objective reality, proven by words and actions

in defending the Black community.

On November 13, 1969,

JAKE WINTERS stood

face to face and toe to

force. He defined political

power by blowing away racist dig

retired 8 other

also a proven

fact and reality that Daler's task force makes

dally and weakly raids on the Black community. They murdered

little John Soto, 16 years old.

They murdered Michael Soto,

20 years old, and shot wildly and unconcerned through every

window in one of the buildinas in the Henry Honer project, injurina

scores of children. They murdered Jimmy Tucker and untold others.

JAKE WINTERS understood that the only way. to stoo fascist dig

forces from invading and slaughterina Black people and people period

and that is by defendina yourself with arms in hand! He didn't

talk about Black Capitalism for surviving nor did he talk about

teachina

"Pork Chop" culture Nationalism for surviving like Ron

Karenga's US organization in L.A. JAKE WINTERS was 18 vears old

and he made a far greater commitment than most men will ever

make in their entire life time.

This brother was an

honor

student, a graduate of Engleworth High School who turned down

five scholarships to work for the people.

He helped

as much as

he possibly could at the Free Breakfast for Children Centers,

plus he worked 7 days a week at the Post Office to brina in

money to keep the centers operatina.

JAKE WINTERS is the highest personification of Huey P. Newton

and Malcolm X. The spirie of these revolutionaries is

manifested in

each member of the Black Panther Party and

will always remember JAKE WINTERS. Because of JAKE WINTERS

we will intenstay the struggle; because of JAKe WINTERs we will

At 5 a.m.,

brutally slaughtered

of the Black Panther Party, and a member of the Peoria

branch.

The pigs, with

their usual tactics, attacked an

apartment where 9 Panthers were sleeping.

the raid: Fred Hampton and Mark Clark dead, four others

critically wounded, and

three others arrested and charged

with attempted murder for defending themselves.

Chairman Fred was shot 7 times, Ronald "Doc" Sachel, Minister of Health and in charge of the

Free Medical Clinic, is in critical condition, shot 5 times.

Deboral Johnson, an 8 1/2-month

pregnant

sister, is in jail. The pigs won't let the lawyers see her or any of the other

political prisoners.

This is the second attack on a Panther apartment in 3 days. On December 2, 80 pigs attacked

and brutally beat 3 Panthers including another expectant mother, Lynn French.

Tony Harris

was beaten so badly that he was later unable to recognize his own wife. And

just three weeks,

ago, Panther Jake Winters was gunned down defending the black community.

These

murders show

clearly the fascist tactics that the gestapo Daleys, racist Hoffmans, war--

mongering Nixons and money-hungry Rochefellers use against the Black Panther Party, progress-

ive people, and the poor, oppressed masses who are demanding their basic neads:

land, bread,

housing, clothing, education, justice and poart.

The members of the Black Panther Parly were right in defending themselves.

Jake Winters' re-

volutionary actions were just and necessary.

Any people whose constitutional rights are

trampled upon by the oinking pig power strueture have a right to pick up the gun.

Be call upon all people to unite in stopping these monstrositios--the murders of Chairman

Fred,

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the students for a

Democratic Society (SDS), as it is known today, came into

being at a founding convention

held at Port Huron, Michigan,

in June, 1962. From an initial ideological posture of

"participatory democracy," the current line of the national

leadership reveals an adherence to Marxism-Leninism.

MICHAEL KLONSKY, National Secretary, in March, 1969, called

for the building of a revolutionary Marxist-Leninist movement.

The program of SDS has moved from involvement in civil rights

struggles to an anti-Vietnam

war position and finally to

Its present advocacy of an anti-imperialist line, linking

up the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa and

Latin America

with the black liberation movement in the United States.

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as countries which

leading the world-wide struggles against United States imperial-

ism.

On the other hand, SDS regards the Soviet Union as

imperialist power and does not support the polices of

that country.

SDS maintains a National Office in Room 206, 1608

Hest Madison Street,

Chicago, Illinois. Its official

paper

"'New Left Notes" reflects the line of the national leadership

and

program adopted at meetings of the National Council and

National Interim Committee (NIC) •

Three national officers

and a NIC of eleven members are elected each year during a

June National Convention.

SDS Regional Offices and university and college

• chapters elect delegates to National Council meetings wherein

progran and ideology are debated, but each Region and chapter

is autonomous in nature and is free to carry out independent

policy and programs reflective of

local conditions.

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itsell as the "Bluck Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people. Residents of the black community are urged to arm

themselves against the

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

"Black men, Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere. Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture.

Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" Is the

statement,"

.....we will not dissent from American Government.

He will overthrow it."

IssUes of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations irom the wiltings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the

JOAN GRAY (continued) :

so all of you out there who say, well I'll support the

Bop by supporting their programs, but I won't support the

app's program of picking up guns, you might as well not

support them at all because pioking up gund is the primary

objoctive, arming the people la the primary objective. The

breakfant progran is fine, the health clinic is fine, but

you all use it has a way out. You set back in your house

unarsed, then Hanrahan walks in there on you and shoots you

down in your bed. Its not Just Black Panthers that are

getting killed, and don't think FRED HAMPTON was killed

because he was a Panther, don't thing BOBBY SEAl was gagged

1n court because he was a Panther. Ha was a black man. He

was a black man and any person like him who understanda the

nature of these racist pigs that we're dealing with know that

he's out to ayatonatically wips out all black people. He is

systematically out herataulpe out all the black people. Next

he'll wipe out the oppreased paople. Then what will be left.

We 100% at the JoNes... He got a whole load of comedians here.

Lo reneated instances

of nolice violence in

the black community.

The

marty was laspired by

the Black Panther Party of Lowndes County Alabama (The Lowndes

County

Fraedom Orantzation) which araanized black neonle in the south to ob

tain basic riahts such as the right to vote.

The

symbol of the Lowndes

Counèy Freedom Organization was the Black Panther.

The black nancher, as exnlained bu Minister of Defense Huey P. New-

ton, is an animal who will not attack. If attacked, the black nanther

backs un undil he has no more room to

back.

Then, the black nanther

will. strike out at his assallant and wine him out. Newton says that the

Black Panther Pardy will

attack unless nushed un against the wall-

where nothing else is possible but to attack its assailants in order

to live.

This princinle of armed self-defense which is basic to the

Black Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black Panther

started by Huey Newcon and Bobby Seale

while students at Merryte college in Oakland, set out orlainally to le-

gally

natrol the police.

They carried weadons as nrovided by law and

stayed the lenal distance from the nolice whom they watched. The result

of this surveillance was a decrease in brutality against members of the

black community and increased harrassment of the Black Panther Party

•by the police.

The

leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black

Panther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not

make the uleimate decisions as

to whom they attacked and why.

The no-

3lce acted ag

the politi-

cal decisions.

Thus, the Black Panther Party evolved a nolitical

to deal with che tyne of political decisions which allowed the nolice

horrass the black communities

and which have resulted in the dreadfu.

livino conditions of black neonle in this country. (Details of thes

orgoran may be found in a

document below).

Huey Newton has said that

the Black Panther Party is

The black community has not yet beer

sutriciently educated

a meaninaru: way.

Bayto verbalize tis demands and to act unon them in

bacause they know the nature of the onnression

under which they suffer, they identiry with the Black Panther Party as

ano shokesman which articulates their demands.

The sunnort for the

hannens to those who sneak for them- the intense brutality and harrass

ment devied agalost the Black Panthers by the police- and the refusal

of tha nower stracture eyen to heed the demands of the black community.

POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

The Black Panther Party program and platform is a result of the an-

alysis that the Party, and esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made

of the nature of politics in America.

The way to political chande

is

through nower. This

is the nature

of the black nower movement exemnlified by Stokeley Carmichael in that

term.

What does this meadn?

Huev Newton has said that politics is

war without bloodshed and that war is an extension of nolitics with

bloodshed. The reason that the Reconstruction attemnt to nut blacks

into office from the South

failed was because the black legislators,

intelligent, well-aducated men, had no mowerful constituency behind

them. If you represent

a noverless aroun in the legislature, then you

wield no nower. What is a nowerfu? aroun?

According to Minister of

Defense, Newton, a noverful groun is one which, if it doesn't get

what it wants, can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in

which this kind of power is obtained.

one way is to own the land.

This is feudal power.

It is exercised by farmers who, when they do

not get what they want, can let the crops rot in the field. This is

the kind of consequence that rates attention and action.

The second

way of gaining

power is economic:

ownershin of the businesses.

America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's

Bureau, of forty acres and two mules.

Had this nromise been fulfilled, '

the black man would have had land power and the ability to inflict a

a consequence.

promise, of course, was never fulfilled:

What about businesses?

The businesses in the black community are

owned by

the white man.

Thus, even the economic boycott is difficult

because there are not sufficient black-owned businesses to serve as

and alternative center for nurchasing

basic needed goods.

ask the blacks

to redress their grievances by running for

office does not pose a realistic solution. It is true that members.

to have a forum to articulate the grievances of the black community.

Why? Because as stated above the black nolitician without a power-

ful constituency just warms a chair in

the leoislature.

If the black

community cannot rain economic or land-nower, how

they hone to have channes of their conditions?

Minister of

Defense Huey Hewton says that the only other source of nower left is

that of the ability to inflict destruction as

a consequence. , Thus,

the black peonle must arm in a political

fashion.

The black

people

must be

able to deal with the occunation police

forces in their

communities when they are attacked.

The alternative is to have

the

police chosen by the black community, live in the black community,

and serve the needs of the black community

as that community sees

them,

This would mean that the nolice

would no longer act merely to

defend the interests of the white businessman

and suumlord.

The fact that the colonial subjects are

to our disadvantage. It kept us running

around in circles. Today

we propose to turn

it to our advantage,

in the manner that we have

turned

into a rallying noint of

Huey

Newton

has said that the black man in America today is a

man of confusion. He is of the loger socio-economic background. He

has withdrawn from his hoscile enviroment which he daily faces and.

denies his own ability. He has been taught that he is inferior and

he blames

himself. He tries to change this image through his style

of life - his desire for flashy

material

nossessions.

He is asked

to resnect a

law which

does not resnect him.

Those

who believe in

culzural nationalism

try to answer his noblem by turning him back

to the time of the eleventh century in Africa. However, his

free-

dom cannot come from such an identification.

His freedom will come

from

identifying

with the revolutionary struggles. of neonle of color

all over the world, including Africa today.

The black man, accord-

ing to cleaver, has a common

culture and a common history. All the

lacks to be a nation is land.

what is the History of the Black Man in America?

The history of the present attitude of the whites toward blacks

in this country has deep psychological roots, according to Nauton.

It dates to the time, hundreds of years ago, when the white Europeans

first came into contact with black Africans. It relates

te cultural

differences.

The Europeans who came to Africa worshinged one god

a god who was all-good.

This was his absolucism.

Man was said to

have been created in the image of the all-good god and therefore could

do no evil.

Man's instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like

and were

repressed. Such

evil was deemed to come from cutsida man-

the resuit of demons, deyils, and witches - who were burned aü the

stake.

the other hard, the Africans below the Sahara, mostly black,

had a differant form of worshin.

Their dod was both good and bad.

They balieved in dualisn. Their nod hau two or more needs - one good

bad. The African had to avoid being like the bad head and

must get into the favor of the good head.

However, he did not deny

nart of his beino as comina from outside

himself.

Thus, his sexual

drives were nart of him - not evil demons from

the outside.

When the

Euroneans caine

to Africa they enslaved the blacks south

of the Sahara

who berieved in

dualism.

They were told by the church

that the "good" Africans north of the

Sahara, who believed in a single

10d, were more in line with the- Burenean belief and should not be

enslaved.

WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON?

The Political Reasons.

Huey P. Newton

is a nolitical prisoner.

He is in jail today, accused of killing an Dakland policeman, not

because he committed this

crime, which he did not, but because he is

the Minister of Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incep-.

tion of

the Party the Oaklard police have tried to harrass

it out

of existence. As the party became stronger,

the nolice tactics became

more vicious.

The police have long had the

license numbers and des-

criptions of all the cars driven by members of the Black Panther Party.

on the night of october 28, 196/, Police Officer frey stinned

an automobile which he knew to be a car on the lisi of those driven

Dy. Black panthers. He stopned the car for an alleged trattic violation,.

the nature of which has never been discloes.

In his testimony before

che Grand Jury, Officer leanes, the nolice officer who wast summoned

Frey to come to his assistance after he stonned the Panther car,

said that Newton DID NOT HAVE A GUN. Attorney Charles

Garry has in-

dicated that the evidence noints to

the real nossibility that both

officers fired at each other and the officer Heanes'

bullets killed

Officer Frey.

The

nolice have always,

in the black conmunity, claimed the right

to exercise indiscriminate viôlence.

It was for this reason that

the Black Panther Party was prininally formed.

Before October 28th

the Oakland

police

had harrassed Newton on numerous occasions

had threatened his life. On October 28 Newton was arrested and shot

in the

stomach because he stood for channe in the black community.

The blark community knows that Huey lawton and the Panthers

And

"Keaning the nigners in their nace"

than

they recognize the indictment of Huey

Newton as an attempt

not only to wine nut an heroic black resistance

leacer, but to also

intimidate and

crush the movement for self-

determination for all black neonle.

If black nolitical leaders

are

not actually assassinated,. as were Mednar Evers, Malcoim X, artin

Luther Kind - then

the government finds ways of confining and neut

tralizina them as in the cases of H. Ran Brown and Lakoi Jones. That

is why the black community stands behind the concent FREE HUEY. They

mean that Huey Newton was

harrassed and threatened and finally shot

because he is a nolitical leader: that he was

arrested and thrown

in jail

because he is

a nolitical leader, that he

faces

the gas chamber

because he is a nolitical laader.

These

are imnortant noints for the

white as well

as the black

community.

The same tyne of harrassment

has taken nace against whites who have

onnosed this

goverrment:

case of the Oakland 7 arrested on conspiracy to commit à misdemeanor:

a felony. It has happened to those who very neacefully tried to pro.

test the policies renresented by Dean Rusk, when he anneared at ahe

Fairmount Hotel - demonstrators who were kicked, beaten and HACED by

the s. F. police while they were RUNNING AWAY = trying

to follow orders

to disperse. The list could go on endlessly.

Protest the goverrment-

and risk your physical

safety that is the message to whites and

blacks alike.

11. The Legal Reasons. Huey Newton was indicted by the Alameda

County Grand Jury - a jury

chosen by the 20 judges on the Alameda

County Superior Court, arbitrarily:

admitted that this

system results in judges choosing

ludes teen a tethers hare

or solitical camnaign contributors to serve on this

"honorary"

position.

volumes of hearings taken by the Asserbly commirtee

on Governmental Efficiency last year (1967) have pages of testimony. •

to this effect.

The persons chosen to serve are, overwhelminaly,

white, over 50, retired, or siill-active business and professional men

and their wives.

This method of

selection is clearly contrary to many cases de-

cided by the United States Subreme Court, which cases indicated that-

a jury of one's neers had to consist of a CROSS-SECTION of the con-

munity and could not SySTEMATICALLY EXCLUDe black recole from serving.

The Grand Jury violaied boch of these fundamental principles. How-

ever, when Newion's attorneys resented this evidence to

o California, throunh the California sunreme court, they were

denied redress - WITHOUT EVEN SO MUCH AS A WRITTEN OPINION explaining

why.

Furthermore, the method of indictment denied Newton fundamental

and usually does.

The attorney may challenge the iudre

for bias;

may

The way of

nroceding - through the grand jury, or by way of

nreliminary hearing - is at the sole and arbitrary discretion of the

district

attorney.

There are no quidelines

set down either in the

California Constitution or in the Penal Code to quide his choice.

The district attorney

of Alameda County has used the grand

jury very rarely.

He used

it only in

alittle over l% of the

cases

in 1966.

He testified before the

ssembly Governmental Efficiency

Committee that he like to use

it in comnlicated

cases such

those

involving assessor frauds or in cases involvina child molestation.

Neither was

true in the ilewton case.

Others at that hearing testi-

fied that the arand jury was often used where the district attorney

had a npor case or didn't have enough

facts to withstand exnosure to

the nreliminary hearina. This was true in the Newton case. To

date the prosecution has released no information as to its version

of the ilewton events.

runds counter to its usual procedure

of seeking

serious criminal matter (of. the Hutton case).

HUEY NEWTON BIOGRAPHY

Huey P. Newton, Minister of

Defense of the Black Panther Party,

was born on February 17, 1942 in Louisiana. He came to california

attended the Santa

Fe and Lafayette elamentary schools in Dakland.

He went to woodrow

Wilson

Jr. High School and then attended Oakland! Technical High.

His childhood was the same as thai of

most black youths.

He was

never given the onnortunity to

do skilled work but worked very

diligently as a

seasonal cannery worker from his araduation from high

school onward.

• Huey Newton learned to read well at the ane of 16.

This was

when his high school

counselors told him he was not collece material..

He set out to show them that no white man could tell him what he was

canable of doing.

Huey went to

Oakland City College and not an AA degree with an

excellent gradenoint average.

He sment one

and one-half years

San Francisco Law School. He left law school to ornanize full-time

for black liberation.

While Huey and

Bobby Seales Chairman

of the Black Panther Party,

were at Merritt College they formed the Black Panther Party for

Self-Defense.

They natrolled the brack

comunity to keen

the nolice

from brutalizinn the black neonle..

Newton and Seale taught the blacks

on the block their lenal rinhts.

They felt that the Panther pro-

gram had to be imnlemented practically. This meant starting with

Point No. 7 of the Black

Panther Party proaram to work toward

immediBie end to nolice brutality and murder of black neonle."

Shortly thereafter young Bobby Hutton inquired about what Bobby

and Huey were doing.

They exnlained the idea of the Black Panther

Party and its onerations to Bobby Hutton, who then became the first.

black youth to join the Party.

He was anointed Party Treasurer.

He served the black community

faithfully until his murder at the

hands

of the pakland nolice on April 6, 1968.

WHY SELF DEFENSE?

The Black Panther Party has advocated that everyone in the black

community have a qun to defend himself.

It should be made very clear

that this does NOT

mean that black neonle should have guns in order

to come into the white community and "shoot it un".

In fact there

reported incidents of Black Panthers coming into ANY community

and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives.

The nolice forces in the black community are comnosed of men who

live in white communities. They are hired as occupation forces to

natrol the black community to protect white business and land

interests...

This is brought home very clearly by the fact that nolicemens in

from incidents in which only blacks are in-

volved.

The nosition of the Black Panther Party was pranhically il-

lustrated when after Martin Luther Kind's assassination, Bobby Seale,

chairman of the Party, went around nakland in a sound truck urning

black peonle to stay home and not become involved in violence.

Not bacause there was no reason

for revnlt, but bacause the Black

Panthers know that such spontanenus rebellion results in death for

black neonla and no channes in their conditions of life.

such vio-

lence is snoradic, short-lived, and costly.

However, it is also very

clear that non-violent tactics have rasulted in no channe either.

Peoffet,

before his

death, Martin Luther King indicated that the

Poor

March on Washinaton was his FINAL attemne to use non-violent

tactics to get what his neonle have been ceined for 400 ycaro. After

that, Dr. King indicated, all he could see was fascism. And he

could not urge neonle to

remain non-violent in the face of that.

The white community is prenared for nenocide.

Whites all over

nation are arming themselves to notect their community from an.

invasion of blacks.

This is so even thounn not one white community

has yet

been invaded or even threatened with such invasion. This is

true even though whites claim that even

if there were an invasion of

blacks they would be beaten almost immediately.

Why are they armed?

They have no more control over their rovernment than do black neople.

They do not choose who will run for office - that is a back-room

nolitical decision. They know that when they vote for a candidate

they must rely. not

on knowledne of his nosition, but on faith that

he will novern well.

THE SACRAMENTO INCIDENT

Because the Black Panther Party has exercised its constitutional

richt to bear arms, Assembluman Mufford decided that this riaht

would have to be curbed.

He introduced

a bill "nrohibiting instruc-

cion in the use of firearms for the nurnose of riotinn, and mrohibit

inn the carrying of loaded firearms on nublic streets and in nublic.

by all

excent neace officers, nuards, and members of the armed

forces." (S. F. Chronicle Story, 5/3/57). As most neonle know the

second

amencment to

the United States Constitution says that "A well

reaulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State,

the rinht of the neonle to keen and bear arms shall not be infrinoed."

The nurnose of this amendment was to nrevent the very thing that

Mulford"s bill iries to set un:

the reculation of the reonle's richt

to be free.

What is the nature of this rioht?

Huey Newton stated it

very clearty when he said that if the neonle are unarmed, and if the

novernment

has a resular nolice force and a millaary force, the neonie

are slaves

to the novernment of are sublect to slavery at anv time.

Newton's conclusion" so long as the nolice are armed, the black neonle

should be armed. As Newton said: "Ninety nercent of the reason we

carried nuns in

the first nlace was educational.

He set the examnle.

We made black neonle aware that they have the rinht to carry runs."

Mho so to Sacramento with runs?

There is some history to the sacramento incident of which most

neonle are unaware.

on Ioril 1, 1967, a vounn black man named

benzil vogell, ared

22 years, was killed by a member of the contra Costa

nartment. -Denzil Powell was

Denzil Dowell was unarmed.

Furchermore the sheriffs knew that he was sufferin from an unjured

hin which would prevent him from escanina from the scene of the crime.

WHY WAS HE KILLED?

As with the killinn of ranther Bobby llutton Asce

below there is no reason - other than that he was black.

instructed the Fanthers that if they wished channes made, the should

undersheriff

Pamsey went to the Assembly and sooke in

favor of the mulford bill -

and in

doing so referred srecifically to the need for the bill to

deal

with the Black Panthers.

Tr

resnonse to this conference and to the Mulford bill itseft,

Minister of Defense Huey Newton wrote a statement which Panther

Chairman Bobby Seale delivered on the

stens of the caritol in Sacra-

mento on May 2, 1967.

The statement is

as follows:

The Black Panther Party for Self Defense calls

unen tha (merican

reonle in neneral

and the black reonle in narticular to take

careful

note of

the racist California

Legislature which is now

considerina lenislation aimed at keerina the black neonle dis-

armed

and nowerless

at the very

same time that racist nolice

arencies throunhout the country are intensifyin the terror,

brutality, murder and renression of black neonle.

At the same time that the American novernment is wagina a racist

war of senocide in Vietnam, the

concentration camns in which

Jananese Americans were interned durina world Har two are being

renovated and exnanded. Since

merica

has historically reserved

the most barbaric treatment for

non-white neonle, we are; forced

to conclude that these concentration camos are beinn nrenared

for black neorle, who are determined to nain their freedom by

and means necessary.

The enslavement of black neonle from the

very beninning of this country,

the renocide nracticed on the

merican indians and the confinina of the survivors on resery-

ations, the savine lynchinn of thousands of black men and women,

Manax hexA ara sha of atomic bombs on Hireshima and Nagasaki,

and now the cowardly massacre

in

Vietnam, all testify to the fact

that towards neonle of color the racist nover structure of America

has but one nolicy: renression, renocide, terror and the big stick.

Black neonle have berged, "rayed, retitioned, demonstrated and

everythina

else to net the racist nower structure of merica to rinht

the wronos

which have historically been pernetrated arainst black

neonle.

Al1 of these efforts have been answered by more re-

i nression, deceit, and hynocrisy.

As the arression of the .

racis$ American novernment escalates in Vietnam, the nolice

anencies of America escalate the renression of black neonle

throunhout the chettos of america.

accidents when hunters carried

The Panthers did not resist

were numerous: "fter being

THE MURDER OF BOBBY-HUFFEN-AND-IHE-ARRESI-OF-FHE-PANFEER-8

On Sunday, Anril 7,

the Black Panther Party had planned a nicnic

were driving around bakland to collect food that the sisters had

Today, Eldridge Cleaver is behind bars, nossibly for life.

Bobby Hutton is dead - murdered by the bakland nins when he tried

to surrender from the ras-filled,

REC

FY THE FIRK'S SILLE OFY

The Party Schorl opens trday and I wish it evary success.

I would like to say something about the prublem of our Party's

oyle of work.

Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a rive-

ationary party because the world contains anomies who oppress the

sople and

the people want to throw off enemy oppression.

zIn the

ca oi capitalism and imperinlism, just such a revolutionary party

3 the Communist Party is needed,

Without such a party it is simply

mpsssiblo for the people to throw off enemy opyrission,

We are

emmunists, we want to lead the people in overthrowing the enemy, and

o we must

keep our ranks in good order, we must march in stey, our

roops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons.

¡thout these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.

What is the problem now facing our Party? The genera: iine of ti

the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party's

work has been fruitful.

The Party has several hundred thousand

mrinbers who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter

struggles against the enemy, This is plain to everybody and

beyond all doubt,

Then is there or is there not any problem still facing our

Party?

I say there is and, in a certin sense, the problem is

quite serious,

Sawhat is the problen? It is the fact that there is some-

thing in the minds af a number of our camraies which strikes ene

25

not quite right, not arite proper.

In other words, there is still something wrong with our style

of stuay, with our style in the Party's internal and external

of sectarianism, By something wrong with the style of writing

wes mean the malady of stereotyped Party writing.

All these ara

wrong, they are ill winds, but they are not like

the wintry north

winds

that sweer across the whole sky, Subjectivism, sectarianism

and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the d.ninant styles,

but merely gusts o1 contrary wind, ill winds fron the nir-raid

tunnels.

It is bad, however, that such winds should still be

blowing in the Party. We must seal off the passages which pro-

duce them. Our whole Party should undertake the job of senling

off these

passages, and so should the Party School, These three

i]] winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and stereo-typed Party

writing,

have their historical crigins. Although no longer

dominant in the whole Party, they still constantly create irouble

and

assail us,

Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to

study, analyse, and elucidate them,

Fight subjectivism in order tr rectify the style of study,

fight sectarianism in order to rectify the style in Party rela-

tions, and fight farty stereotypos in order to rectify the style

writing--such is the task before us.

To accomplish

the task sf overthrowing the enemy, we must

accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party,

The style of study and the style of writing are also the Party's

style of work,

Once our Party's style of work is put completely

right, the people all ever the country will learn from our exam-

ple, and saoxis thoe outside the Party who have the sonie kind of

bad

style will, if they are good and honest pecule. lein fron mn

REFORE OUR STUDI

May 3941

I cropose that we should reform the method arl the system of study throughout

e Party. The reasons are. as follows:

The trenty years of the Communist Party of China have been twenty years in which

he universal

truth of Marxism-Leninism has become more and more integrated with the

concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. If we recall how superficial and meagar

jur understanding of Marxism-Leninism and of the Chinese revolution was during our

arty's infancy,

we can see how much deeper and richer it is now. For a hundrud

ears, the finest sons and daughters of the disaster-ridden Chinese nation fought

nd sacrificed their lifes, one stepping Into the breach as another fell, in quest

i the truth that would save the country and the people. This moves us to song and

But it was only after World War I and the October Revolution in Russia that

e found Marxisn-Leninism, the best of truths, the best of weapons for liberaling

our nation

And the Communist Party of China has been the initiator, propagardist

ind erganizer in the wielding of this weapon.. As soon as it was linked with the

concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, the universal truth of Marxisn-leninism

jave an entirely new complexion to the Chinese revolution. Since the outbreak of

he kar of Pesistance Against Japan, our Party, hasing Itself on the universal truth

• Marxism-leninism, has taken a further step in its study of the concrete practice

it this war and in Its study of China and the world today, and has also nade a be~

jinning in the study of Chinese history. These are all very good signs.

iI.

However, we still have shortcomings, and very big ones too. Unless we correct

hese shortcomings, we shall not, in my opinion, be able to take another step forwar.

n our work and in our great cause of integrating the universal truth of Marxism-

eninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.

First, take the study of current conditions. We have achieved some success in

I study ui present donestic and international conditicns, but for such a large

'litical party as ours, the material we have collected is

fragmentary and our re-

earch work ünsystematic on each and every aspect of these subjects, whether it be

le political, military, econcmic or cultural aspect. Generally speaking, in the

ist twenty years, we have not done systematic and through work in collecting

udying material

on these aspects, and we are lacking in a climate of investigation

na study of objective reality.

To behave like "a blindfolded man chiching sparrows:

" a "blind man groping for fish," to be crude and careless, to indulge in verbiage,

- rest content with a smattering of knowledge-such is the extremaly bad sugie of

ork that stilt exists among many comrades in our Party, a syle utterly opposed to

he fundamental. spirit of Marxisn-Leninism.

Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin have

aught us that it is necessary to study conditions conscientiously and to priceed

zom objective reality and not from subjective wishes; but many of sur comrades act

"n direct vistation of this truth.

Second, take the study of history. Although a few Party membors and sympathiz-.

is have undertaken this work, it has not been done in an organized way. Many Party

embers are still. In a fog about Chinese history, wheüher of the las hundred years

or of ancient times. There are many Marxist-leninist scholars wau cannot open their

ouths without citing ancient Greece; but as for their own ancestors-sorry, they

inve been forgotten.

There is no climate of serious study either o current condi-

ions or of past history.

in order to explain this idaa furchur, i shudie lika to contrast tuo opposite

¿ibitudes.

Firste there is the.

subjecte vist attitude, wish tils autituas, a person does

not mike a systematic and thorough study of the environment, but works by sheer sub

jetire enthusiasm and has a blurred picture of the face of China today. Kith this

artitude, he chops up history, knows only ancient Greece but not China and is in a

fog arout the China of yesterday and the day before yesterday.

with this autitude

a person studies Marxist-Leninist theory in the abstract and without any aim.

Ho

goes to larx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin not to seek the stand, viewpoint and intied

with which to solve the theoratical and tactical problems of the Chinese rivaltion

but to study theory purely for theory's sake. He does not shoot the arrow at the

target but shoots at random. Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stälin have Eaught us that we

should proceed from objective realities and that we shoüld derive laws from them to

serve as our guide to action. For this purpose we should, as Mars. has said, aporo-

priate tha material in detail and subject it to scientific analysis and synchesis.3

Tiny of our people do not act in this way but do the opposite. A good number of their.

are doing research work but have no interest in studying either the China of today

or tho China of yesterday and confine their interest to the study of empty "theories'

divorced from reality. Many others are doing practical. work, but they too pay no

astertion to the study of objective conditions, often rely on sheer enthusiasm and

substitute their personal feelings for policy. Both kinds of people, relying on the

subjéctive, ignore the existance of objective realities. When making speeckes. they

indulge in a long string of headings, A, B, C, D, 1, 2, 3, 4g and when writing arti-

ales, they turn out a lot of verbiage.

They have no intention of seeking truth from

cacts, but onty a desire to curry favour by claptrap. They are flashy without sub

sance, brittle without solidity. They are always right, they are the Nurder One

anthority under Heaven, "imperial envoys" who rush everywhere. Such is the sigle of

work of some comrades in our ranks. To govern one's own conduct by this style is to.

hara cneself, to teach it to others is to harm others; and to use it to direct the

revolucion is to harm the revolution. Io sum up, this subjectivist method which is

contrary to science and Marsisn-leninism is a formidable enemy of the Conmunist

Partys the working class, the people and the nation; it is a manifestation rf impur-

riy in Party spirit. A formidable enemy stands before us, and we must overthrow

him.. Only when subjectivism is overthrown can the truth of Marxism-Leninion prevail.

can Party spirit be strongthened, can the revolution be victorious. We must assert

that the absence of a scientific attitude, that is, the absence of the Marxist

Leninist approach of uniting theory and practice, means that Party spirit is either

absent or deficient.

There is a couplet which portrays this type of person. It runs:

The reed growing on the wall--top-heavy, thin-stermed and shallow of root;

• The bamooo shoot in the hills--sharp-tongued, thick-skinned aud hollow

inside.

Is: this not an apt description of those who do not hate a scientific attitude, who

can only recite words and phrases from the works of larx, Engols, Lenin and Stalin

and no enjoy a reputation unwarrinted by say real. learning?

If anyone" really

wishes to cure himself of this malady. I arvise him to commit this couplet to memory

or to show still more courage ind paste it on the wall. uf his room.

Parxi sn-lenin-

isin 1s a science, and scierce meens honest, solid knowledge; there is no rocm for

playing tricks.

Let us, then, ba honest.

Secondly, there is the Marxist-leninist attitude. With this attitude, a person

applies the theory and method of Marxist-Leninism to the systenatic and

investigation and study of the envirenment. lie does no woris by extest aley

It is a question of the method cf thinking

the attitude of all Party comrades in their work. As such, it

is a question of extraordinary, indeed of primary, importance,

Certain muddled ideas find

currency among many perple.

There

are, for instance, muddled ideas about what is a theorist; what

intellectual and what is meant by linking theory and prac-

tice.

Iet us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high

or low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been translated

and more people have been reading them.

That is a very good

thing.

But can we therefore

• say that the theoretical level

Of

cur Party has been greatly raised? True, the level is now some-

what higher than before,

But our theoretical front is very much

out of harmony with the rich content of the Chinese revolutionary

movement, and a comparison of the twe shows that the theoretical

side is lagging far behina, Generally speaking,

our theory can-

not as yet keep pace with our revolutionary practice, let aluna

lead the way as it should, We have not yet raised our rich and

varied practice to the proper theoretical

plane.. We have not, yet

exmined ail the proplems of revolutionary practice--or even the

important ones--and raised them to a theoretical plane.

Just

think, how many of us have created theories worthy of the name

on China's economics, politics, military affairs or culture,

• theories which can be

regarded

as scientific and comprehensive,

and not crude and sketchy?

Eszecially in the field of economic

theory:

Chinese capitalism has had a century of development

since the opiun War, and yet not a single theoretical work had

been produced which

mise moment to instance the theoretical level is already

can we say that our Paity kus already has economie theori

ists werthy of the name?

Certainly not.

We have read a great

many Marxist-Lenist books, but can we claim, then, thet we have

theorists? We cannot. For Marxism-Leniaism is the theery created

• by Maçx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin on the basis of practice, their

general .conclusion drawn from historical and revolutionary reality.

• If we merely read their works but do not proceed to study the

•realities of China's history and revolution in the light if their

theory or do not make any effort th think through China's rev

lutionary practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be

so presumptuous as to call ourselves Marxist theorists.

Our ach-

¡everents in the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if.

as memoers of the communist Party of China, we close cur eyes to

China's problems and can only-memorize isolated conclusions or

principles from Marxist writings,

We want theorists

want:

be a theoris of this kind,

a person must have a true grasp of

the essence of Marxism-Leninism, of the Marxist-Leninist stand,

viewpoint. and method and of the

theories of Lenin and Stalin on

the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and he must be

able to apply them in a penetrating and scientific analysis of

China's practical problems and discover the laws of deveiopment

of these problens,

Such are the theorists we really need:

The Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision.

calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist

Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of

Chinas history, and of China's economics, politics, military

affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on

the basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclu-

sions.

This

the responsibility we must shoulder,

Our comrades in the Party School should not regard Marxist

theory as lifeless dogma,

It is necessary to master Marxist the-

ory and apply it, master

it for the sole purpose of applying it.

If you can apply

the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating

one or two practical problems, you shoule be commended and cre-

dited with some achievement.

The more problems you elucidate and

the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater

will be your achievement,

Our Party School should also lay down

yhr suxs rule to grade students good or poor accoring

to how

they look at China's problems after they have studied Marxism-

Leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clear-

Iy and whether or not they see them at all.

Next let us talk about the question of

the "intellectuals".

Since China is a semi-colonial,

semi-feudal country and her cult-

ure is not well developed,

intellectuals are particularly treasured

on this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of

the Party made the decision over two years ago that we should vin

over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they sue

revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Jayan,

welcome them one and all.

It is entirely right for us to esteem

intellectuals, for without revolutionary intellectuals the revo

lution cannot

triumph, But we all know there are many intellec-

tuals tix se who fancy themselves very learned and

assure airs of

erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmfui

and hinder their own progress.

They ought to be aware of the

trugh that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively

speaking, most ignorant ands the workers and

peasants sometimes

know more than they do. Here some will say,

"Ha! You are turning

things upside down and talking nonsense."

kany comrades

don't get excited; there is some sense

in what I am saying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came into being

The world has known only two kinds of knowledge, knowleuge of the

struggle for production and knowledge of the class

struggle,

Natural science and social science are the crystalizations of

these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the senaralization

and

summation of the knowledge of nature and the knowteige of

society. Is there. any other kind of knowledge?

No. Now let us

that abe completely cut off from the practical activities of

What about them?

A persor sues tirrugh a primary

But all 'he has is booklearning; he has not yet taken

Inraly so, in my opinion, becaus:

his mowledge is still incomplete,

What then is relatively

All relatively complete knowledge is i:mod

in two stages: The first stage is parceptual knowledgi, the sec.nô

is rational knowledge, the latter being the develorient of the

former to a higher level.

What sort of knowledge is thw student's

Even supposing all their knowleage is trut!: it

is still not knowledge acquired through thier own persuna: ax--

perience, but consists of theories set down by thier preci.ess.rs

in summarizing experience of the struggle for production and of

the class struggle. It is entirely necessary that students

should acquire this kind of knowledge, but it must be understood

that as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a sense s

still one sided, something which has been verified by others but

not yet by themselves.

What is most important is to be good at

applying this knowledge in life and in practice,

Therefore, I

advise those who have only booklearning but as vet no contact .:

with reality, and also those with little practical experience, to

realize their own short comings and become a little more

modest.

How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-

lectuals in the true sense?

The only way is to get them to take

part in practical work and become practical workers, to get those

engaged in theoretical work to study important practical probiems,

in this way our sax ain can be attained,

What I have said will probably make some people angry. They

will say,

"According to your

explanatin, even Marx would not be

regarded

as an intellcctual."

I say they are wrong.

Marx took

part in the practice of the revolutionary movement and als?

created rev-lutionary theory,

Beginning with the commodity,

simplest element of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the

economic stricture of capitalist society. Millions of peopig saw

and handled commodities every day but were so used to them that

they took no notice. Marx alone studied commodities scientifi-

cally.

He carried

out a tremendous work of research into their

actual development and derived a nature, history and proletarian

revolution and created dialectical materialisn,

hostorical mater-

ialism and the theory of proletarian revolution. Thus Marx became

a most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of

human wisdom; he was fundamentally different from those who have

only booh-learning,

Marx undertook detailed investigations and

studies in the course of practical struggles; formed generaliza-

tions and then verified his conclusions by testing them in prac

tical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work,

Party needs

a large number of conades who will learn now to do

sich work.

In our Party there are many comrades who can learn to

do this kind of theoretical rescarch, most of them are intelligent

ard promising

and we should

value them,

But they must follow

correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past.

They

to go astray. •

However,

of the two kinds of

subjectivism, dognatism is still

the greater danger in our Party. For dogmatists can easily assune

a Marxist guise to blufi,

capture and make

servitors of cadies

of

working-class and peasant origin who cannot easily see thrrugh

them; they can also bluff and ensnare the naive youth.

overcome dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will readily join

with those who have experience and will take to the study of

practical things, and then many good cadres who integrate theory

with experience,

as well as some real theorists, will emerge.

If

we overcome dogmatism, the comrades with practical experience

will have good teachers to helf them

raise their experience to the

level of theory and so avoid empiricist errors.

Besides muddled ideas about the

"theorist"

and the "intellect-

ual", there is a muddled idea among many comrades about "linking

theory and practice"; a phrase they have on their lips every day.

They talk constantly about "linking", but actually they mean

parating"

, because they make no effosi at linking.

How is &

Marxis'-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the

Chinese revolution?

To use a common expression, it is by "shoot-

ing the

arrow at the target"

As the arrow is to the target, so

is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution,

Some comrades,

however, are "shooting without a target"

shooting at random,

such people are liable to harm the revolution.

Others merely 5x

stroke the arrow fondly, exclaiming,

"What a fine arrow! What a

fine arrow!," but never want to shoot it.

These people are only

connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the

revolution,

The arrow of

Marxism-Leninism must be used to

at the target of the Chinese revolution.

Unless this point hoot

made clear, the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised

and the Chinese revoltuion can never be victorious.

Ons comrades must understand that we study Marxism-Leninism

not for aisplay, nor because there is any mystery about it, but

solely because lt 1s the science which leads the revolntionary

cause of the proletariat to victory,

Even now, there are not a

works as a ready-made panacea which, once acquired, ran easily

It is precisely such ignorant

people

who take Markism-Leninism

as a religious dogma,

To them we should

say bluntly,

"Your dogma

is worthless."

Marx,

Engels, Lenin and

Stalin have repeatedly stated that our theory is not a cogma but

a guide to action.

But such people prefer to forget this Ex

state

ment which is of the greatest, indeed the utmost, importance.

Chinese Communists can be regarded as linking theory with practice

only when they become good at applying the Marxist-Leninist stand,

viewpoint and method and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin con-

cerning the Chinese revolution and

when, furthermore, through ser-

ious research into the realities of China's history and revolution

they do creative theoretical work to meet China's needs in differ-

ent spheres.

Merely talking about linking theory and

RECTIFY THE

PARTY"S STYLE CH WORK

äg:?.

So much for today about combating subjectivism

in order to

rectiry the style of study throug hout the party.

me now speak about the question of sectarianism,

Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer

dominated by sectarianism.

Remnants of sectarianism, however,

are still found both in the Party's internal relations and in

external relations.

Sectarian tendencies in internal relations

lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder

inner-Party unity and solidarity, while sectarian tendencies in

external relations lead to exclusiveness towards

people outside

the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole

people,

Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can

the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity

among all Party comrades and

among all the people of

our country

What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are

mainly as follows:

First, the assertion of "independence", Some comrades see only

the interests of the part and not the whole; they always put un-

due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are

responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the

whole to the interests of their own part,

They do not understand

the Partys system of democratic centralism; they do not realize

that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs cen-

tralization even more.

They forget the system of democratic

centralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majority,

the lower level to the higher level, the part to the whole and

the entire membership to the Central Committee,

Chang Kuo-tao

asserted his "independence"

of the Central Committee of the

Party and as a result "asserted" himself into betraying the Party

and became a Kuomintang agent. Although the sectarianism we are

now discussing is not of this

extremely serious kind, it must

still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all

manifestations of disunity,

We should encourage comrades to

take the interests of the whole into account.

Every Party mem-

ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must

proceed from the interests of the whole Party; it is absolutely

impermissible to fiolate this principle.

Those who assert

this kind of "independence" are usually wedded

to the doctrine of

first" and are

generally wrong on the ques

tion of the relationship between the individual and the Party, Al

though

in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice

they out themselves first and the Party second.

What are these

people after?

They are after fame and position and want to be in

the limelight.

Whenever they are rut in charge of a branch of

work, they assert their "independence", With this aim, they draw

some people in, push others out and resort to boasting, flattery

and touting among the comrades, thus importing the vulgar style of

the bourgeois political parties into the Communist Pasty.

It is

their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe

we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is

absolutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world.

Which

are the honest Beople?

Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are honest,

men of science are honest. Which are the dishonest people?

Sky, Bukharin, Chen Tu-hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis

honest; and those who assert "independence" out of personal or

sectional interest are dishonest too. All sly people, all those

who do not have a scientificattitude in their work, fancy them-

Generally speaking, in places where ouüside cadres are in charge,

It is they who should bear the main responsibility if their relai

look down on the local cadre and ridicule them, saying "What do the

Another problem is the relation between old and new cadres.

since the beginning of the War of Resistance, our Party has grown

cnourmously, and large numbers of new cadres

have emergeds that is

a very good thing, In his report to the eighteenth Congress of the

Conmunist Party of the Soviet Union (B.) Comrade Stalin said,"

there are never enough old cidres, there are far less than i

required, and they are partly gollio out of commission owing to the

operation of the laws of nature." Here he was discussing the cadres

situation and not only the laws of nature. If our Party does not

have a great many new cadres working in unity and co-operation with

the old cadres, our couse will come to a stop. All oid cadres, there

fore, should welcome the new ones with the utmost enthusiasm and

them the warmest solicitude. True, new cadres have their short

comings. They have not been long in the revolution and lack experi

ence; and unazoidably some have broung with them vestiges of the

unwholesome ideology of the old society, remnants of the ideology

i petty-bourgeouls individualism. But sush shortcomings can be

gradually eliminated

through education and tempering in the sevo

Zutionk. The strong points of the new cadres, as stalin sala, is

that they are acutely sensitive to what is new and are therefore

enthusiastic and active to a high degree the very qualities that

some of the old canres lack,, Cadres, new and old, should respect

each other, learn fcom each other, and overcome their own shortcom

ings by learning from each others

strong points, so as to unite as

one in the common cause and guard against sectarian tendencies.

Generally speaking: In places where the old cadres are mainly in

charge, it is they who should bear the chief responsibility if rela

tions with the new cadres are not good.

All the above-relations between the part and the whole, rela

ilons between the individual and the

Party, relations between out-

side and local cadres; relations between army cadres and other cam

ares working in the locallty, relations between this and that army

unit, between this and that locally, between this and

that depart

ment and relations between old and new cadres--are relations withi

the Party. In all relaulons it is necessary to sunance she spirit si

communism and guard against sectarian tendencies, so that the ranks

of our Party will be in good order; march in suep, am theretore

fight well. This Is a very important probien wnich us rust solve tho

oughly in rectifying the Party's style of work, Sectarianiom is an

ezocession of subjectivism in organizationul relations; if we want

to get rid of subjectivisn and pronote the Marxist-Leninist spirit

of secking truth from facts, we must sweep the reman's of sectar

In fact, sectarian tendencies

There is no time today to talk about the question of stereo-

Ster-

eotyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form of expression

for subjectivism and sectarianism.

It does people harm and damages

the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completely.

To combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and dia-

lectics!

However, there are many comrades in our Party who lay

no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics

Some tolerate subjectivist propaganda and regard it with equanim-

They think they believe in Marxism, but make no effort to

propagate materialism and do not give it a thought or express any

opinion when they hear or read subjectivist stuff.

be commended and praised by them! An exaggeration? Not by any means, a

fact made painfully clear when we look at the pre-dawn assassination of -

Chairman Fred Hampton and Mark Clark: the vicious murder of Michael and

John Soto, Charkes Jackson and countless others.

- For the people to have control over these police and their functions

the political asylem given the police by the political forces such as

Daley and Hanrahan (remember shoot-to-kill and the war on gangs) must

designed to establish that kind of control through a complete reorganiza-

tion of the Police Department, All police officials will be elected

APPENDI

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to 1ts ufficial newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP)

was started during Derember, 1906, in Okland,

Californla,

to organize black people su

they can take control

•of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SkALk, BPP Chairman, and HUEY

• P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEHTON is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The olficial newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further,

describes itsoll as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

thenselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons ol America,

revolt everywhere! Arn yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

i3 a revolutionary custure.

Change. Freedon everywhere.

Dynamite:

Black Power.

Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the Introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement,"

.....we will not dissent from American Government.

will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations iros the

People!8

writings of Chairnan MAO Tse-tung of the

• Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political pover grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue,

Berkeley, California.

Bränches have been

established at various locations throughout the United States.

It's not bad. Miss ARLENE HUGIES (phonetic),

according to the man from the illinois Civil

Liberties Unton, he said that in his conversa-

denied, he said that it was Mr. JERRIS.

LEONARD's conversation with him where Mr.

LEONARD, I guess, said that they were going

to get the Black Panthers, hoodlums,

gangsters, or whatever he. called them.

Of course everything is out of context.

You tell me, would you please Mr. HILLIARD,

you're the Chief of Staff. of the Black

Government, its official arm, its law

Are you comparing your particular credo

country's form of socialism?

First you have to understand that the

ideology and the program of the Black

had in the dissemination of information from

tbe Black Panther Party is being able to tell

the truth. It's true that since MARK CLARK

Angeles police overstayed their police

authority that the press media has been

giving dissemination to

the things that the

community has been aware of

for a long long

time. The Black Panther Party has had a :

program for almost three years. They have

projected humanness, qualities, genuineness

and the only time that the media has ever

been interested is if some particular member

of the Black Panther Party did something

that shocked the white racist community.

Then the media would be interested. But

crime. Say he's charged with petty theft.

He's completely innocent of it. He goes to

a. lawyer. The lawyer says I will defend you

but it will take three days of a jury trial. .

I wouldn't trust a judge says the judge

because he has sot fixed opinion. I would

suggest you get a jury trial. The jury

trial will take three days. The attorney

will say I

will have to charge you at least

$300 a day. That's $900. He, the client,

has already put up $150 to $200 in bail

premiums. The three days in court will

cost him his-job. He says man I can't do

that. He says okay, he said, l'll tell you

what I can do. I know the District Attorney

pretty well. He's a pretty good guy. I can

on probation for six months and that 'll

end it. The guy said fine. Expediency,

compromise. Is the man guilty? Has the

man had

an opportunity for a fair trial?

Has he been properly represented? In the

HUEY NEWTON case, Minister of Defense of the

Black Panther Party, It took 13 weeks to

try that case. A battery of lawyers with

me as trial counsel worked day and night for

almost a year and a half in preparing that

case. Tremendous amount of investigation

was done. If the client was able to pay

Ior it, it would have cost

a little over a

illion dollars in legal time. Little over

a million dollars. And the verdict was a

compromise verdict. He was convicted of

manslaughter for killing a police officer.

If it costs a million dollars for a HUEY

NEWTON to get a fair trial, which is not

a good result because the man was completely

innocent, It was a compromise verdict, if

it costs a million dollars for a black

Now I would like to ask you BoBBy, were you

with

the group of Congressmen that were in

town? And, when they had the

heariog, of.

course, the Assistant United States Attorney

said that he couldn't lalk, and they were

after him pretty good, especially when he was

confronted by Congressman POWElL about the

fact that a statement was made to the

"Chicago Tribune", why couldn't it be made

to your group. But he made a very interesting

point. The Assistant Attorney said this

particular group was not empowered by

Congress to really be effective or to

be

•legal. And, if this is so, then l'd like to

know how, you know how, these Congressmen

got together to come in for the hearing in

the first place. Do you know?

well, I think that it would be, that what was

happening as far as the black people are

concerned, it goes that the feeling ah, ah,

the black people had expressed and they knew

it

The black people, they are the elected officials

of their constituancy. And the constituancy,

which is

primarily black, and they had moved

to

come and to find, to investiate matters,

to find out what was really going on, i

think. (Garbled)

MARTY FAYE

Do you think, ah, you know the whole thing

right now is almost like, if it weren't so

tragic, you soe, it would he ludicrously

funny, if it weren't so tragic. It's

almost like Keystone Cops, you know, there's

There's killings, the apartment is left open, and

now the coroner wants to close it, and now they reopen it.

And so many different groups are getting together trying

to

Investigate the thing. Mr. GARRY, do you know if anyone it

all is legally empowered to test this

out?

CHARLES GARRY

Ah, let me answer the question in this way.

• He

demanded a Congressional body to investigate what happened

in Chicago and in Los Angeles, and what's happening to the

Black Panther Party throughout the United States. We cherish...

there's a concerted effort, a conspiracy, to commit genocide

on the Black Panther Party and we said we demanded the hearing

by Congress, but we said that we wanted Congressmen and

Congresswomen who were not part of the House Committee on

Un-American Activities or the House Committee on Internal

Security or some other form of garbage that's been handout out

over a period of years. He said we wanted men of good-will,

women of good-will in Congress to do this. The black Congress-

men came to our. call. We also stated we intended to file a

petition in the United Nations charging the United States as

a nation within a nation of committing concerted genocide on

the. Black Panther Party and particularly in recent months, and

we intend to file that petition. We told the committee today,

- 23 -

## Page 362

this afternoon, that we intended to cooperate with them in

any way they wanted to. We've also indicated that we in-

tend to cooperate with the committee that

was formerl recently,

the Commission, they call themselves, where former Justice

GOLDBERG is at the head of it. With all of these

committees,

we intend to cooperate one hundred percent, but we also intend

to have a caveat.

we intend to have a cavent to this extent

so that there will not be a whitewash of what we know to be

the facts. And no one is going to change those farts.

MARTY FAYE

DAVE, do you think the Black Panthers would have

had any trouble at all if they hadn't said, ah, change the

system of government?

DAVE HILLIARD

I don't think that we would have had to suffer, ah,

the atrocities that have been needed out to our party thus

Par, I think that just like most of the black organizations

that have now become puppets, or other areas within the system,

we too, would have been endarked and possibly given some

grants, by the federal government. But the very fact that

we are opposed to the system of capitalism, because of this

explott of our nature, I think that this is the main reason

for all the repression against our party, and our ability to

organize across

the racial line.

- 24-

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 362

## Page 363

MARTY PAYE

Yes, but you see, the government doesn't to through

a considered effort to wipe out the Socialist

Party in the

United States.

DAVE HILLIARD

That is because the sortalist party in too new

United States is endorsed by the government of the United

States. To make a very distinct difference between people

that advocate socialism through theory and people that

practice it by the very example - our breakfast

program,

the free health clinic, our very program, so that our de-

mands are historical demands that have been felt out and

that have been yearned for by a people in this country since

their embarkation. That's why I say that ideological exper- .

ience of blacks in this country. Nothing more than that.

MARTY FAYE

MI. GARRY, what are you doing in Chicago?

CHARLES GARRY

I'm down here with Mr. HILLIARD to meet with the

members of the Central Committee of the Black Panther Party

this evening, which we've already met. Tomorrow morning we

intend to have a conference of warriors throughout the United

States, discussing this repression against the Black Panther

Party and also against white and brown people, and tomorrow

night DAVE and I MarIxyaxza are soing to be speaking at a mass

meeting in Cleveland, Ohio.

MARTY FAYE

Can I ask you sir, how your foes are paid?

...

CHARLES GARRY

our fees are paid by gratitude, being able to

make a contribution to a better world. Until I got in-

volved with the Black Panther Party I was bringing in between

$150 - 200,000 a year in fees to the firm I'm

with. Since

October 27, 1968, I've brought in $31, 000 ind our costs

alone in the HUEY NEWTON case were over $70,000. I'm not

talking about expenses and the cost of defending and repre-

senting members of the Black Panther Party, ELDRIDGE CLEAVER,

BOBBY SEALE and all others. The firm I'm with is financially

being horribly drained. !

But, we are getting the gratitude,

the gratitude of being able to do something within vourselves,

to make a contribution, for the responsibilities that the

white society has had for 400 years and has failed. And it

is our responsibility, and i hope my fellow white citizens of

America, will join us and make some contributions, financially.

The Black Panther Party needs money. Our firm needs some money

to be able to carry on. Other lawyers are in this fight. WILLIAM

KUNTSLER, LEONARD WEINGLASS, are in that courtroom before

Judge HOFFMAN day in and day out, and I'm satisfied that that

Judge, no matter what the verdict is, intends to send Billi

KUNTSLER and LEONARD WEINGLASS to jail for contempt of court.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during Licember, 1906, In Oukland,

California,

to organize black prople so

they can take control

of

the life, pollties, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SElLE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEYTON is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which furthe

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the

Bpp advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tacties

in its revolutionary

program to ind oppression of the black

people.

Residents of the black community are urged to arm

themselves against the polire who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pies" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" Issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

"Blark men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere.

Arm yourselves.

The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the october a, 19bo, edition oi

"The Black Panther" is the

statement,"

.....we will not dissent from American Government.

He will overthrow it,"

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the

• writings of Charman MAO Tse-tung of the

People's

Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power grous out of the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters oi the BPP is located at

3106 Shattuck Avenue, Berkeley, California:

Brunches

have been

established

at various, locations throughout the United

States.

III. INFORMATION REGARDING VIOLENT ACTS,

WEAPONS, PLANS AND AIMS OF BPP

At approximately 3:15 a.m., November 13,

1969, a spokesman

from the Deputy Superintendents

Office, Chicago PD, Chicago, Illinois, advised that

moments

earlier officers responding to a report of

a "man with a shotgun" at 5802 Calumet, Chicago,

located in a south side Negro ghetto, were met with

gunfire from at least two male Negroes.

The first three officers to arrive at the scene

were JOHN GILHOOLY, white male, age 21; MICHAEL BRADY,

the Chicago PD spokesman, before they

got their guns

out of their holsters..

. - 10 -

## Page 382

GILHOOLY and BRADY were approaching the building

from the front when a Negro male with a shotgun and a male

Negro with a carbine fired on them.

GILHOOLY subsequently

died on November 14, l96y, from his wounds and BRADY

received a head wound for

which he was treated at a

local hospital

and released. COFFMAN recelved

sunshot

wounds in the

leg, hand and chest and

is hospitalised.

Scores of policemen then responded and tiring

continued for almost one half hour. Six other Chicago

PD officers received wounds as a result of this gunfight:

FRANK RAPPAPORT, while male, age 3l, who

was

killed by a

shotgun blast in the lace;

DONALD MILEY, white male, age unavailable,

shot in face

and

arm by a shotgun blast

and lost his right eye; is hospitalized.

and his condition is serious;

PHILIP PREROST, white male, age 27, who

then called the Chicago PD. It was this call that

officers of the PD were responding to.

The area outside the scene of the shooting

remained calm and

no large crowds gathered.

A spokesman for the Deputy Superintendent's

Office, Chicago PD, advised that the Chicago PD is in

the process of attempting to determine how many

people actually took part in the shooting and is

looking for at least one and possibly two male

Negroes, details unknown, whom they believe took part

in this

shooting.

A source advised that BELL, although carried

as a membar of the Illinois Chapter of the BPP, is

not a trusted member of that Party inasmuch as

P Stone Rangers, a local Negro youth gang. BELL has

been inactive for several months, almost since joining

the Party, due to this suspicion.

This

source advised that WINTERS, also known

as JAKE WINTERS, was a close associate of the BPY, but

was not a member.

The Black Panther Party benan as a response to reneated Instances

of police violence in the black community.

The party was lospired by

the

Black Panther Party of Lowndes County

Alabama (The Lowndes County

Freedom pranization) which oraanized black neonle in the south to ob-

tain basic riohts such as the right to vote.

The symbol of the Lowndes

County Freedom Arnanization was the Black Panther.

The black nancher, as exnlained bu Minister of Defense Huey P. New-

con, is an animal who will not attack. If

Newton says that the

This princinle of armed self-defense which is basic to the

Black Panther Party, will be exnlained in a document below.

The Black Panther Party, started by Huey Nawton and Bobby Seale

while students at Merritt College in Oakland, set out originally to le-

They carried weanons as nrovided by law and

staved the lenal distanca from the nollce whom they watched.. The resuls

of this surveillance was a decrease in brutality against members of th.

black communitv and increased harrassment of

the Black Panther Party

by the police.

The leaders of the Black Panther Party (originally called the Black

Fanther Party for Self Defense) soon realized that the police did not

make the ultimate decisions as to whom they attacked and why.

The no-

lice acted as the law enforcement agency for those who made

the politi-

cal decisions.

Thus, the Black Panther Party evolved a nolitical prog

to deal with the tyne of political decisions which allowed the nolice

to harrass

the black communities and which have resulted in the dreadfu.

Tivino conditions of black neonle in this country. (Details of thès

program may be found in a document below).

Husy Newton has said that the Black

Panther Party is the vanouard

nardy of the mass of black peonle.

The black community has not yet beer

sufficently educated to verbalize

its demands and to act unon them in

a meaningful way.

Bat because they know the nature of the onnression

under which they

suffer, they identiry with the black panther party as

the snokesman which articulates their demands.

The sunnort for the

Black Panther Party increases dally as the black community witnesses

hannens to those who sneak for them the intense brutality and harrass

ment levied against the Black Panthers by the nolice- and the refusal

of the nower structure even to heed the demands of the black community.

In addition

to sunnore for the Black, Panther Party from the black

community locally, arouns have been set un all over the country. In-

ternationally, sunnore 1s evidonced by rallies in Tanzanta, Africa,

POLITICS AND THE BLACK COMMUNITY

The Black Panther Party program and platform is a result of the an-

• alysis that the Party,

esnecially its leader, Huey Newton, has made

of the nature of politics in America.

The way to political channe is

through nower. This is the nature

of the black nower movement exennlified by Stokeley Carmichael in that

term.

What does this meadn?

Huev

Newton has said that politics is

Har

• without bloodshed and

that war is an extension of molitics with

bloodshed.

The reason that the Reconstruction attemnt to put blacks

into office from the south failed was because

the black legislators,

intelligent, well-educated men,

had no nowerful constituency behind

chem.. If you represent a powerless aroun in the legislature, then you

wield no nower.

What is a nowerful aroun?

According to Minister of

Defense, Newton, a noverful groun

is one which, if it doesn't det

what it wants,

can deliver a consequence. There are several ways in

this kind of nower is obtained.

one way is to own the land.

This is feudal nower. It is exercised by farmers who, when they do

not get what they want, can let the crons rot in the field. This is

the kind of consequence that rates attention and action.

Yhe second

way of gaining power is economic: ownershin of the businesses.

In

America the slaves were freed with the promise, by the Freedmen's

Bureau, of forty acres and two mules.

Had this promise been fulfilled,

the black man would have had land power and the ability to inflict a

a consequence.

The promise, of course, was never fulfilled.

What about businesses?

The businesses in the black community are

owned by the white man.

Thus, even

the economic boycott is difficult

because there are not

sufficient black-owned businesses to

serve as

alternative center for purchasing

basic needed goods.

To ask the blacks to redress

their grievances by running for

office does not pose a realistic solution.

It is true that members

of the Black Panther Party - Huey

Newton

for Congress in

the Ith

Congressional District - Bobby Scale for Assembly in the 17th As-

sembly District in Mlameda County

-and Kathleen LCleaver for As

sembly in th 18th Assembly District in San Francisco - are running

for office on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket, but this is only

to have a forum to articulate the grievances of

the black community.

Why? Because as stated above the

black nolitician without a nower-

ful constituency just warms a chair in the leoislature.

If the black community cannot pain economic or land-nower, how

can they hone to have channes of their conditions? Minister of

Defense Huey Newton says that the only other source of nower left is

that of the ability to inflict destruction as

the black neonle must arm in a nolitical fashion.

peoble

must be able to deal with the occunation solice

forces in their

communities when they

are attacked.

The alternative is to have the

police chosen by the black community, live in the black community,

and. serve the needs of the black community as that community sees

them.

This would mean that the solice would no longer act merely to

defend the interests of the white businessman and suumlord.

However, the blacks do not limit themselves to discussion of nower

from the nun. The Black Panther Party has a nolitical program which

Te would like to sec

enacted for the benefit of black neonle. See

below for the program.

WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THE BLACK MAN IN AMERICA TODAY?

Eldridge Cleaver, Black. Panther Minister of Information has stated

that the black man is

a colonial subject and that black America is a

colony within white America.

The fact that the colonial subjects

disnersed throughout the country does not make their colonial

sub~

jugation any

the less real.

Cleaver has stated that:

"Black peonle

in North America have always been nlagues by a dual status. We were

boch slave and christian, we were both tree and segregated, we are

both integrated

and colonized. In the nast this duality has worked

¿o our disadvantage.

It kept us running around in circles. Today

we propose to turn it to our advantage,

in the manner that we have

turned our blackness

from a disadvantage into a rallying noint of

advantage."

man: Huey Newton has said that the black man in America today is a

of confusion.

He is of the lower socir economic background. He

withdrawn from his hostile enviroment which

he daily faces

denies his own ability.

He has been taught that he is inferior and

he blames himself.

He tries to change this imane through his style:

of life - his

desire for flashy material nossessions.

He is asked

to resnect a law which does not resnect him.

Those who believe in

cultural

nationalism

try to answer his nroblem by turning him back

to the time of the eleventh century in Africa.

However, his free-

dom cannot come from such an identification.

His freedom will come

from identifying with the revolutionary strungles.of

neonle of color

all over the world, includina Africa

today. The black man, accord

ina to Cleaver, has

a common culture and a common history. All she

lacks to be a nation is land.

What is the History of the Black Man in America?

The history of the nresent autitude of the whtras

toward blacks

in this country has deep psychological roots, according to Naviton.

lè dates to the time, hundreds of years

ano, when the white Euroneans

first came into contact with black Africans. It relates

to cultural

differences.

The Europeans who came to Africa worshiped one

.40d =

a god

who was all-good.

This was

his absolutism.

Man was said to

have been created in the image of

the all-good god and therefore could

do no evil.

Man's instinctual sexual drives were deemed ungod-like

stake:

"On the other hand, the Africans below the Sahara, mostly black,

had a differant form of worshin.

Their god was both good and bad.

They believed in dualism. Their

nod had two or more heeds - one good

and one bad.

The African had to avoid being like the had head and

must.net into the bavor of the good head.

However, he did not deny

nart of his beino as comino from outside himseif.

Thus, his sexual

drives were nart of him - not evil demons from

the outside.

When the Euroneans came to Africa they enslaved the blacks south

of the Sahara who beiieved

in dualisn.

They were told by the church

that the "nood" Africans north of the sahara, uno believed in a single

nod, were more in line with

What he was saying is that even with an

economic system that provided

for all the people, if there were still racism, the brack man would

be abla to live as a man.

The Euroneans raned Africa economically and took the black men as

slaves to America.

The black man has, to this day, not been

treated

as an equal to the white man • in any

way, As was

nointed out above,

the Emancination Proclamation the black man was not given

his economic and nolitical rights.

WHY FREE HUEY NEWTON?

1. The Political Reasons. Huey P. Newton

is a political prisoner.

He is in jail today, accused of killing an Dakland noliceman, not

because

he commited this crime, which he did not, but because he is

the Minister of

Defense of the Black Panther Party. Since the incap

tion of

the

Party the

oaklard police have tried to harrass it out

of existence. As the party became stronger,

the nolice tactics

more vicious. The police have long had the

Ticense numbers and became

des-

criptions of all the cars driven by members of the Black Panther Party,

on the night of October 28, 1967, Police Officer Frey stinned

an automobile which he knew to be a car on the list of those driven

by Black Panthers.

He stopned the car for an alleged traffic violation,,

the nature of which has never been discloes.

In his testimony. before

che Grand Jury, Officer Heanes, the police officer who was!

summoned

by Frey

• to come io his assistance after he stoned the Panther car,

said. that Mewton. DIC MoT HAVE A GUN. Attorney Charles

Garry has in

that both

Officer Frey.

The nolice have

always, in the black community, claimed the right

to exercise indiscriminate violence.

It was for this reason that

the Black Panther Party

was prininally formed.

Before October 28th

the Dakland nolice had harrassed Menton on numerous occasions and

had threatened his life.. On October 28 Newton was arrested and shot

in the stomach

because. he stood

for channe in the black community.

11.

The Legal Reasons. Huey Newion was indicted by the Alameda.

County

Grand Jury - a jury

chosen by the 20 judges on

the Alameda

County superior Court,

arbitrarily. Judge dieden, and others, naie

admitted that ahis

sysiem results in judges choosing their rrends,

or nolitical campaign contributors to serve on this "honorary"

position.

Three volumes

of hearinns taken by the Asserbly committee

on Governmental Efficiency last year (1967) have nages of estimony

to

this effect.

The nersons chosen to serve are, overwhelminaly,

white;

over 50, retired, of still-active business and professional mon

and

their wives.

This method

of

selection is clearly contrary to many cases de-

cided by the United States Subreme Court, Which cases indicated that..

a jury of one's neers had to consist of a CRosS-sEctIoN of the con-

munity and could not SYSTEMATICALLY EXCLUDE black neenle from serving. 1

The grand Jury violated boch of these fundamental

principles.

How-

ever, when Newton's attorneys presented this evidence to

the courts

óe California, through the California Supreme court, they were

denied redress - WITHOUT EVEN SO MUCH AS A WRITTEN

OPINiON explaining

why.

Furthermore, the method of indictment denied Newton fundamental

rights which the California supreme

Cours

has held are required in

criminal cases and which

The way of proceding - through the grand jury, or by way of

There are no quidelines

the penal Code to quide his choice.

He testified before

Committee that he like

as those

Neither was true in the lewton case. Others at that hearini testi-

He went to Hoodrow

Wilson Jr. Minh School and then attended Oakland Technical High.

His childhood was the same

as that of most black youths.

He was

never given the omnortunity to do skilled

work but worked very

dilinently as a seasonal cannery worker from his graduation from high

school onward.

Huey Newcon learned to read well at the ane of 16.

Shortly thereafter young Bobby Hutton. inquired about what Bobby

They explained the idea of the Black Panther.

black youth to join the Party.

He was annointed Party Treasurer.

He served the black community faithfully until his murder at the

hands

of the pakland nolice on April 6, 1968.

WHY SELF DEFENSE?

The Black Panther Party has

advocated that everyone in the black

community have a qun to defend himself.

It should be mace very clear

that this does NOT mean that black neonle should have nuns in order

to

come into the white

community and "shoot it un"

In fact there

are No reported incidents of Black Panthers coming into Any community

and using their weapons other than to defend their own lives.

The nolice forces

in the black community are composed of men who

five in white communities. They are hired as occupation forces to

natrol the black community to motect white business

and land

interests.

This is brounht home very clearly by the fact that nolicemens in che

nnecto

try

to stay away

from

incidents in which only black's

are in-

volved.

For examnle, if two black

nanda are

rumored

to be

nlanning

a rumble, the nolice

refuse to act

to ston it.

If black kids are

finhtinn amonn themselves, the nolice

stav away.

If a black woman

commlains to the nolice that her husband has threatened violence

the nolice tell her

to call a lawver.

When the lawyer

tries to & intervene, the nolice say they do not like to net involvad

in domestic disnutes.

The list noes on endlessiy. rurthermore, the

molice are often involved in

THE SACRAMENTO INCIDENT

Because the Black

Panther Pariy has exercised its

constitutional

rinne to bear arms; assemblyman Murfore decided that chis rian

anuld have to be curbed: He introduced a bill rohibiting instruc

dion in the usef firearms

ina che carrying of loaded firearms on nublic streets and in nublic

nlaces

by all excert neace officers, nuards, and membors of the armed

forces.

" (S.

F. Chronicle Story, 5/3/57). As most neonle know the

second

amencmeng.to

the United States Constitution says that "A well

reaulated militia, beind necessary to the security of

a free State,

the rinht of the

neonle to keen and bear arms shall not be infrinaed."

The nurnose of this amendment vas to. nrevent the very thing that

Mulfora"s bill tries to set un: the renulation of the peonle's riche

to be free.

What is the nature of this richt?

Huey Newion stated it

very clearty when lie said that if the neonle are unarmed, and if the

government has a renular nolice force and a milidaiy foice, the neonle

are slaves to the rovernment or are subicct to slavery at any time.

Newion's conclusion! se loni as the police are armed, the black neonle

should be armed:. As Newton

said:

"Minety mercent of the reason we

Minister of Defense Huey Newton wrote a statement which Panther

The statement is as follows:

THE MURDER OF BOBBY-HUTFAN-AND-THE-ARREST-OF-THE-PANTEER -8

On Sunday,

Anril 7, the STack Panther Party had Tanned a nichic

barbecue to raise money for the defense of luey P. Menton. Saturday

night Eldridne Cleaver, Bobby Hutton,

and a number of other Panthers

were driving around oakland to collect food that the sisters had

nrenared.

Their mission was interrunted when sereral squad.cars of

Oakland nolice intercented and ambushed the Panthers in their own

community. Today, Eldride Cleaver is behind bars, nossibly for life.

Bobby Hucton is dead - murdered by the bakland nins whon he tried

to surredder from the mas-filled, burning house. Seven other ranthers

nius Cleaver face Grand Jury indictments for attemnted murder, in-

dictments based on false information provided by the nins and

ex-

¿orced confessions from the imrisoned Panthers.

The followina. information came out in an interview a san Francisco

Chronicle renorter

had with Cleaver in jail:

told

Bobby Hutton, aned 17, was killed by nolice bullets - he was

squad car and, while his hands were raised and he

REUTLEY THE INNS SILE

wORK

The Party School

Up

ens orday and I wish it er:

success.

I mould like to say something about the problem of our Party's

style of work.

Why must there be a revolutionary party? There must be a reve-

lutionary party because the warld contains enomies who oppross the

people and the people want to throw off enemy oppression.

Rin the

éra

of cepitalism and imperinlism, just such a revolutionary party

as the communist Party is needed.

Without such a party it is simply

impossiblo for the poople to throw off enemy oppression,

comunists, we want to lead the penplo in overthrowing

the enemy, and

30 we must

keep our ranks in good order, we must march in stey, ous

troops must be picked troops and our weapons good weapons.

Without these conditions the enemy cannot be overthrown.

What is the problem now facing our Party? The genera: line of ti

the Party is correct and presents no problem, and the Party's

work has been fruitful. The Party has several hundred thousand

minberg who are leading the people in extremely hard and bitter

struggles against the enemy. This is plain to everybody and

' beyond all doubt,

Then is there

or is there not any problem still facing our

Priety? I say there is and, in a certain sense, the problem is

quite serious,

Shhat is the problem? It is the fact that there is some

thing in the minds of a number of our comraies which strikes one

as not quite right, not trite proper.

In other words, there is still' something wrong with our

style

Di study, with our style in the Party's internal and external

relations and with our style of writing. By something wrong with

the style oi study ve mean the malady of subjectivism. By aome-

thing wrong with cur style in Party relations we mean the maindy

of, sectarianism,

By sonething wrong with the style of writing

wen mean the mlady of stereotyped Party writing. All these are

wrong, they are ill winds, but they are not like

the wintry noith

that sweey across the whole sky: Subjectivism, sectarianism

and stereotyped Party writing are no longer the dominant styles,

but merely gusts of contrary wind, 1ll winds fron the nir-raid

tunnels,

It is bad, however, thut such winns should still be

blowing in the Party.

We must. seal off the passages which pro.

duce them,

our whole party should undertake the job of senling

"off. these

passages, and so should the Party School, These three

111: winds, subjectivism, sectarianism and stereo-typed Party

writing, have their historical crigins; Although no longer

dominant in the

whsle party,

they still constantly create trouble

and

assail U8.

Therefore, it is necessary to resist them and to

atudy, analyse, and elucidate them.

•right subjectivism in order t

rectify the style of study,

Iight sectarianism in order to rectily the style in Party rela-

• t13n8,

and fight Party stereotypos in order to rectify the style

writing--such is the task before us.

• To accomplish

the task si overthrowing the enemy, we must

accomplish the task of rectifying these styles within the Party.

The style of study and the style of writing are also the Party's

style of work,

Once our Party's style of work is put empletely

right, the people all over the country will learn from our exam-

ple, and excaux. Thee outside the Party who have the semie kind of

the essence of Narxism-Leninism, of the Marxist-Leninist stand,

viempoint and method and of the

theories of Lenin and Stalin on

the colonial revolution and the Chinese revolution, and

he must be

able to apply them in a penetrating and scientific analysis of

China's practical problems and discover the laws of devejoyment

of these problens,

such are the theorists we really need.

• Phe Central Committee of our Party has now made a decision.

calling upon our comrades to learn how to apply the Marxist

Leninist stand, viewpoint and method in the serious study of

Chinas history,

and of China's economics, politics, military

affairs and culture, and to analyse every problem concretely on

the basis of detailed material and then draw theoretical conclu-

sions.

This is the responsiblity we must shoulder,

Oux comcades in the Party School should not regard Marxist

theory as lifeless dogma,

It is necessary to master Marxist the-

oxy and apply it, master

•It for the sule purpose of applying it.

•If you can apply the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint in elucidating

The more problems you elucidate and

the more comprehensively and profuondly you do so, the greater

will be your achievement. Our Party School should also lay down

yho tuxs rule to grade students good or poor accoring to how

they look at China's problems after they have studied Marxism-

leninism, according to whether or not they see the problems clear

ly and whether of not they see them at all.

Next let us talk about the question of the "intellectuals".

Since China is a semi-colonial,

semi-feudal country and her cult

ure is not well developed, intellectuals are particularly treasured

On this question of the intellectuals, the Central Committee of

the. Party made the decision over two years ago that we should win

over the great numbers of intellectuals and, insofar as they are

revolutionary and willing to take part in the resistance to Japan,

welcome them one and all,

It is entirely right for us to esteem

intellectuale, for without revolutionary intellectuals the revo

dution cannot

triumph.

But we all know there are many intellec

suals sha as who fancy themselves very learned and assume airs of

erudition without realizing that such airs are bad and harmfui

and hinder their own progress,

They ought to be aware of the

trugh

that actually many so-called intellectuals are, relatively

Breaking, most ignorant ants the workers and peasants sometimes

know more than they do. Here some will say,

Ha: You are turning

things upside down and

talking nonsense,"

But, many concades

don't get excited: there is some sense in what I am saying.

What is Knowledge? Ever since class society came inio being

The world has known only two kinds of knowledge, knowleige of the

struggle for production and knowledge of the class strusgle,

Natural science and social science are the crystalizations of '

these two kinds of knowledge, and philosophy is the genaralization

and

summation of the knowledge of nature and the knowlege of

society, Is there any other kind of knowledge? No. Now let ua- 63-

me speak now about subjectivism.

Subjectivism is an

improper style of study, it is ouposed to

Marxism-Leninism and is incompatible with the Communist Party.

What we want is the Marxist-Leninist style of study.

What we

In the whold Party,

It is a question of the method ci thinking

of comrades in our leading bodies, of all cadres and faity nem

bers, a question oi our attitude towards Marxism-Leninism, ci

the attitude of all Party comrades in their work.

As such, It

is a question of extraordinary, indeed of primary, imuortance.

Certain muddled ideas find currency among many people.

TIe, ICE 1I18EanC€

is an intellectua. muddled ideas about what Is a theorist.

and what is meant by linking theory and

tice.

Let us first ask, is the theoretical level of our Party high

or low? Recently more Marxist Lenist works have been transiated

and more people have been reading them.

that is & very good

thing,

But can we therefore s say that the theoretical level of

1ur Party has been greatly raised? True,

the level is now some

what higher than before,

But our theoretical front is very much

out of harmony with the

rich content of the Chinese

revolutionary

mavenent, and a comparison of the twi shows that the theoretical

side is lagging far behind. Generally spoaking, our theory can

not as yet keep pace with our revolutionary practice, let alonò

lead the way as it should. He have not yet raised our rich and

raved practice to the proper theoretical plane.

We have not yet

axmined all the problema of rev lutionary practicen on even the

important ones--and raised them to a theoretical plane.

chink, how many of us have created theories worthy of the name

• on China's economics, politics, military ailairs or culture,

theories which can be regarded

as

scientilic and comprehensive,

and not crude and sietchy?

Especially in the field of economic

theory: Chinese capitalism has had a century of development

since the opium war, and yet not a single theoretical work har

been urcauced which

werthy of the name? Certainly not.

We have read a great

many Marxist-Lenist books, but can we claim, then, thet we have

theorists?

We cannot.

For Marxism-Leninism is the therry created

vy Marx, Engels, venin and stalin on the basis oi practice, their

general conclusion drawn trom nistorical and revolutionary reality..

II we merely read their works but do not priceed to study the

realities of China's history and revolution in the light if thoir

theory or. do not make any effort to think through china's rev

lutionary practice carefully in terms of theory, we should not be

so presumptuous as to call ourselves Marxist theorists.

Our ach-

¡everents on the theoretical front will be very poor indeed if,

as members of the Communist Party of China, we close cur eyes to

China's problems and can only memorize isolated conclusions or

principles from Marxist writings.

If all a person can do is to

cimmit Marxist econmics or philosophy to memory, reciting glibly.

from Chapter I to Chapter X, but is witerly unable to apply them,

can he be considered a Marxist theorist?

No! Ile cannot.

What about them?

A person does thirugh a primury

school of this kind all the way

through to a univarsity of

the same kind, graduates and is reckoned to have a stock of

learning, But all he has is booklearning; he has not yet taken

part in any practical activities or applied what he has lea.nod

to any field

of life.

Can such a person be regarded usa coi:,:-i-

• ely developed intellectual?

nis knowledge is still incomplete, What then is relatively

comflete knowledge?

All relativaly complete knowledge is f:rmed

in two stages. The first stage is perceptual knowledgi, the sec.nà

is rationa knowledge, the latter being the develorent of thi

former to 3 higher level.

What sort of knowledge is thw studint's

booklearning?

Even supposing all their knowledge is truti: it

is still not kmowledge acquired

through thier own persuna: ux-

the class struggle.

It is entirely necessary that students

should acquire this kind of knowledge, but it must be understood

that as far as they are concerned such knowledge is in a senses

still one sided, something which has yeen verified by others but

not yet by themselves,

What is most important is to be good at

applying this knowledge in life and in practice,

Therefore, I

advise those who have only booklearning but as yet no conjact .:

with

reality, and also those with little pinctical experience, to

realize their own short conings and become a little nore nodest.

How can those who have only booklaerning be turned into intel-

lectuals in the true sense?

The only way is to get them to take

part in practical work and become practical wirkers,

to get those

engaged in theoretical work to study important practical probloms.

In this way our sxy aim can be attained.

What I have said will probably make some people angry.

They

will say, "According to your explanatin, even warx would not be

regarded as an intellcctual."

I say they are wrong. Marx took

part in the practice of the

revolutionary movement and alss

created revolutionary theory,

Beginning with the commodity, the

simplest element of capitalism, he made a thorough study of the

economic stricture of capitalist society. Millions of peopic saw

and handled commodities every day but were so used to them that

they took no notice.

Marx alone studied comm.dities scientifi

• Cally, He carried

out a tremendous work of research into their

actual development and derived a nature, history and proletarian

revolution and created dialèctical materialisn, hostorical

mater-

ialism and the theory of proletarian revolution.

Thus liarx became

a most completely developed intellectual, representing the acme of

human wisdomy he was fundamentally different

from those who have

only booh-learning.

Marx undertook detailed investigations and

studies in the course of practical struggles, formed generaliza~

tions and

then verified his conclusions by testing them in prac

tical struggles--this is what we call theoretical work,

cur

Party needs

a large number of comrades who will learn how to do

sich work..

In our Party there are many contades who can learn to

do this kind of theoretical research, most of them are intelligent

ard promising and we should value them.

But they must follow

correct principles and not repeat the mistake of the past. They

must discard dignatisin and not confine themselves to regaiu-mada 85

- However, of the

two kinds of subjectivism, dognatism is still

the greater danger in our Party, For dogmatists can easily assune

a Marxist guide to bluff, capture and make servitors of cadres oi

working-class and peasant origin who cannot easily see ührrugh

them; they can also bluff and ensnare the naive youth. If we

overcome dogmatism, cadres with book-learning will readily join

with those who have experience and will take to the study of

practical things, and then meny good cadres who integrate theory

with experience, as well as some real theorists, will emerge,

we overcome dogmatism, the comrades with practical experienca

will have good teachers to help them raise their experience to the

level of theory and so avoid empiricist errors.

Besides muddled ideas about the "theorist"

and the "intellect-

ual", there is a muddled idea among many comrades about linking

theory and practice"

, a phrase they have on their lips every day.

They talk constantly about "linking"

, but actually they mean

"sen

parating"

', because they make no effor at linking.

How is &

Marxist,-Leninist theory to be linked with the practice of the

Chinese revolution? To use a common expression, it is by "shoot-

ing the arrow at the target"

As the arrow is to the target, so

is Marxism-Leninism to the Chinese revolution.

Some comrades,

however, are "shooting without a target"

, shooting at random,

such people are liable to harm the revolution.

Ochers merely s*

stroke the arrow

fondly, exclaiming,

"What a fine arrow! What a

Iine arrow!," but never

want to shoot it. These people are only

connoisseurs of curios and have virtually nothing to do with the

revolution,

The arrow of Marxism-Leninism must be used to shoot

at the target of the Chinese revolution,

Unless this point is

nade clear,

the theoretical level of our Party can never be raised

and the chinese revoltuion can never be victorious.

Onn comrades must understand that we suudy Markism-Leninism

not Ior aisplay, nor because there is any mystery about it, but

solely because it is the science which leads the revolntionary

cause of the proletariat to victory.

Even now, there are not a

few people who still regard odd quotations from Marxist-leninist

works as a ready made panacea which, once acquired, ran easily

cure all maladies,

These people show childish ignorance, and

we should enlighten them. It is precisely such ignorant people

who take Marxism-Leninism as a religious dogma..

To them we should

gay. bluntly, "Your dogma is worthless," Marx,

Engels, Lenin and

Stalin have repeatedly stated that our theory is not a cogna but

a guide to action.

But such

people prefer to forget this su

state

ment which is of the greatest, indeed the utmost, importance.

Chines: Communists can be regarded as linking theory with practice

only when they become good at applying the Marxist-Leninist stand,

method and the teachings of Lenin and Stalin con-

cening the Chinese revolution and when, furthermore, through ser-

ious research into the realities of China's history and revolution

they do creative theoretical work to meet china's needs in differ-

ent spheres.

Let me now speak about the question of sectarianism,

Having been steeled for twenty years, our Party is no longer

dominated by sectarianism,

Remnants of

sectarianism, however,

are still lound both in the Party's internal relations end

•in

its

external relations,

Sectarian tendencies in internal relations

lead to exclusiveness towards people outside the Party and hinder

inner-Party unity and solidarity,

while sectarian tendencies

external relations lead to exclusiveness towards people outside

the Party and hinder the Party in its task of uniting the whole

people,

Only by uprooting this evil in both its aspects can

the Party advance unimpeded in its great task of achieving unity

among all Party comrades and among all the people of our country.

What are the remnants of inner-Party sectarianism? They are

mainly as follows:

First, the assertion of "independence".

Some comrades see only

the interests of the part and not the wholes they always put un

due stress on that part of the work for which they themselves are

responsible and always wish to subordinate the interests of the

whole to the interests of their own part.

They do not understand

the Partys system of democratic centralism, they do not realize

that the Communist Party not only needs democracy but needs cen-

tralization even more,

They forget the system of democratic.

centralism in which the minority is subordinate to the majority,

he Lower Leved to the nigner level, the part to the whole and

the entire membershio to the Central Committee,

Chang Kuo-tao

asserted his "independence" of the Central Committee of the

Party and as a result "asserted" himself into betraying the Party

became a Kuomintang agent.

Although the sectarianism we are

now discussing is not of this extremely serious kind, it must

still be guarded against and we must do away completely with all

manifestations of disunity. We should encourage comrades to

take the interests of the whole imto account.

Every Party mem-

ber, every. branch of work, every statement and every action must

proceed from the interests of the whole Party, it is absolutely

impermissible to fiolate chis principle,

Those who assert this kind of "independence" ara usually wedded

to the doctrine of "me first" and are

generally wrong on the ques-

zion of the relationship between the individual and the party.

AL

though in words they profess respect for the Party, in practice

they out themselves first and the Party second.

What are these

people after?

They are after fame and position and want to be in

the limelight. Whenever they are rut in charge of a branch of

work, they assert their "independence", With this aim, they draw

gome

and touting among the comrades,

thus importing the vulgar style of

che

bourgeois political parties into the Communist Party.

It is

their dishonesty that causes them to come to grief. I believe

we should do things honestly, for without an honest attitude it is

absnlutely impossible to accomplish anything in this world.

Which

are the honest Beople? Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin are

honest,

Which are the dishonest people? Trot-

Sky, Buknarin, Chen Tu-hsiu and Chang Kuo-tao are extremely dis-

honest, and those who assert "independence" out of personal or

sectional interest are dishonest too.

There is no time

Ster-

eotyped Party writing is a vehicle for filth, a form oi expression

for subjectivism and sectarianism.

It does people harm and

damages

the revolution, and we must get rid of it. completely.

To combat subjectivism we must propagate materialism and dia-

lectics:

However, there are many comrader in our Party. who lay

no stress on the propaganda either of materialism or of dialectics

Some tolerate

subjectivist propaganda and regard it with equanim-

ity. They think they believe in Narxism, but make no effort to

propagate materialism and do not give it

a thought or express any

opinion

This is not

the attitude of a Communist.

It allows many of our comrades to

He should therefore launch a campäign of enlightenment withing

the Party to free the minds of our comrades from the fog of sub-

jectivism and dogmatism and should call upon them to buycott sub-

jectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped Party writing.

Such evils

are like Japanese goods, for only our enemy wishes us to preserve

them and continue to befuddle ourselves with them; so we should

advocate a boycott against them, just as we boycott Japanese

We shauld boycott all the wares of subjectivism,

ianiem, and stereotyped Party writing, make their sale cifficult,

and not allow their purveyors to ply their trade by exploiting the

low theoretical level in the Party. Our comrades must develop

a good nose for this purpose, they should take a sniff at everthing

and disiinguish the good from the bad before they decide whether

to welcome it or boycott it.

whys and wherefores of anything, use their own heads and carefully

think over whether or not it corresponds to reality and is rcally

well founded; on no account should they follow blindly and encour- •

age slavishness.

Finally, in opposing subjectivism, sectarianism and stereotyped

Party writing we must have in mind two purposes:

first, "learn

from past mistakes to avoid future ones"

, and second, "cure the

sickness to save the patient"

The mistakes of the past must te

exposed without sparing anyone's sensitilities, it is necessary to

analyse and criticize what was bad in the past with a scientisic

attitude so that work in the future will be done more carefully

and done better..

This is what is meant by "learn from past mis-

takes to avoid future ones"

But our aim in exposing errors and

critizing shortcomings, like that of a doctor curing a sickness,

is solely to save the

not to doctor him to death.

We who li

an increasingly evident truth: we have no control over the

the survival of our fraedoms, we must now demand control

of these forces, particularly that one which we confront

daily in our communities and which niten makes the final

decision regarding our lives... or coaths: the POLICE

i. DEPARTHIENT.

These racist nolice have been used as forces working

against the necole and in cahoots with the corrunt political

figures. Those lying politicians and murdering, brutalizing

police, joined by the greedy businessmen like Hunt and

Dupont, are in control of our destinies. It is become an

"AMERICAN TRADITION" for police to nrevent the American neople

from protesting

these intolerable conditions. This

"AMERICAN TRADITION" is reaching astronomical heights and

becoming an "AMERICAN NIGHTIARE" because the 'three-in one'

described above neeis to sunress the ever-rowing activity

of enoressed menole to be froc once their ayes are onened to

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther

Party (BPP) was started during December,

1966, In Okland,

Callfornia, to organize black people so they can take control

of the life, politics, and the destiny of the black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY

P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON Is presently serving

a sentence of 2 to 15 years on a conviction of manslaughter in

connection with the killing of an

oakland police officer.

The official newspaper,

"The Black Panther," which furth

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states

that the BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics

..in its revolutionary program to end oppression of the black

people. • Residents of the black community are urged to arm

themselves against the police who are consistently referred to

in the publication as "pigs"

who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" Issue of September 7, 1968, contains

an editorial by BPP Minister of Education, GEORGE MASON MURRAY,

which ends with the following:

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY

A source has advised that the Students for a Demoritie

Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into being at a

founding convention held June,

1962, at Port Huron, Michigan.

From an initial posture of "partiripatory dumocriry". the line

of the national

leadership has

revonlod i growing Marxist-

Leninist adherence which currently calls for the building of

a revolutionary youth movement. Concurrently, the program

of SDS has evolved from civil rights struggles to an inti-

Vietnam war stance to an advocacy of a militant anti-imporialist

China, Vietnam and Cuba are regarded as the leaders

the Soviet Union 1s held to be rovisionist and also imperialist.

At the June, 1969, SDS National Convention, Progressive •

Labor Party (PLD) forces in

the organization were expelled.

As a result,

the National Office (NO) group maintained its

National Headquarters at 1608 Hest Madison Street, Chicago,

and the PLe jaction set up headquarters in Cambridge,

Massachusetts. This headquarters subsequently moved

to

Boston.

Each group elected its own national vificers, which

include three national secretaries and a National Interim

Committee of eight.

Both the NO forces and the PLY forces

claim to be

the true SDS.

Both groups also print their

versions of "New Left Notes" which sets forth the line and the

program of the

particular faction.

The NO version of "New

Left Notos" was recently printed

under the title "The Fire

Next Time" to achieve a broader mass appeal.

Two major factions have developed internally within

the No group,

nomely,

the Weatherman or Revolutionary Youth

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT

ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the

86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective

July 1, 1960.

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,

annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from

four health plans with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the

Government will contribute 50% of the premium cost of the plan selected, subject

to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBl of these new

benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups

to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the

desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of

approximately $1, 000, 000 per year to the FBI as the employer's cost of these

new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its

present health coverage plan.

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute

minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in

arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible

for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal

Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959.

2. ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAN, FISCAL YEAR 1960

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated September 21, 1959, to

the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the continued

cooperation of the Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-

ment. The letter pointed out that during the fiscal year 1959 executive agencies

effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the resident would like to effect

a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to

give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 491

---

## Page 492

it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans

for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested

2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the

October financial plan.

In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal

year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that it would be impossible

to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "strict

austerity" basis.

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,

reducing it from $117, 500, 000 to $117, 100, 000, thereby eliminating 45 employees

for the field (30 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in personnel

during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy

with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,

specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, will

further bolster our work volumes for which funds have not been provided and to

attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's

ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3. SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees

demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position

for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by

requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paid more than

permanent employees who are doing identical work. By memorandum dated

July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend legislation so as to change

this situation at the earliest possible time. To date no legislation has been

introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

1. Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law

86-257)

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing

by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of

Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained

in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter

into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,

1959, has held conferences with officials of the Department of Labor for the

purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice

and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the

prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a

labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the

following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau:

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine

imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and

convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;

deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by

FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations

Act of 1947.

The finalizing of the agreement between the Departments of Justice

and Labor has not been effected. Until it is, we are not initiating investi-

gations without a specific request from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific requests from the Criminal

Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at

this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly

labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and

Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.

These were highly placed Teamster officials and trustees. We are not

processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with

further identifying data as to the individuals.

FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIVINAL INFORMATION

Various proposals have been brought forth in the past

by individuals such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of

the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,

and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal

clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York

State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has proposed a clearing-

house of information concerning frauds on the consumer and

investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there

is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and

desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already

being accomplished within the framework of existing law enforcement

structures.

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed

clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of

the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility

that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the

dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip

and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented

with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail

or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such

a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already

existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a "black

list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of

information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a daily basis

innumerable items of information to local, county, state and

Federal agencies. This information may not only relate to matters

over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may

be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of

information are already established and the use of these channels by

all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing-

house of information.

## Page 495

3. NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items

of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of

racketeers. The most recent communication to the Department in this regard

was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 2,

1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session."

These legislative suggestions are as follows:

I There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the

interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number

slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate

transportation of slot machines.

2 It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling

information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling

information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.

Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to

the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.

The inability to have current race results would discourage the operations of

bookmaking establishments.

3. Inasmuch as under the present provisions of the Internal

Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling:

constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as

legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were

taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.

nasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might

be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for

the failure to pay such taxes.

4 It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the

White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted.

There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood

and who go from state to state in order to ply their träde.

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it

may be desirable to afford consideration to the enactment of a Federal habitual

criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission

of offenses within Federal jurisdiction.

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's

theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or

explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee

has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H. R. 8601) which would

probibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 495

## Page 496

It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational

and religious facilities only. This was called to the Department's attention

by the afore-mentioned memorandum dated September 2, 1959, captioned

"Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session. "

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney

General's office in connection with current security programs and matters

collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs

had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that

other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and

offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice

had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of

some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts. The

Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs.

While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and

are set forth below for the Director's information.

(l) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it

was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the

Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated

that there was not proper authority for an Industrial Security Program flowing

from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that

even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses

at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation

and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two drafts of which

have been examined by the Department and the Bureau.

The proposed Order

appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised

us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as

drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General

Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By

letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney saneral, copies to Walsh and

reagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to

any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department

and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn

down numerous requests to produce informants and sources for testimony or

interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in

the interests of national security. This might open the Department and the

Bureau up to criticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive

Order.

From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on

October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-

gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 497

---

## Page 498

Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up in

a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up

by placing the investigative agencies in an untenable position because they

cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security

Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed

legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of

witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings.

Treasury has indicated this

bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the

Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such

legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap

the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses

who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;

namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead

of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as

in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue

to be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial

Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(3) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening

Program is a program proposed by ICIS to screen crews of United States planes

engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.

The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening

Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.

To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the

March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General. While the FBI originally

concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,

believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position

should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should

be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that

they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,

security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending

judicial decisions.

(4) Persannel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed

the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation

to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

-8-

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 498

## Page 499

Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills

have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive

and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene

decision in the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation

is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation

in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should

meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision.

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,

1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,

which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills

were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been

completed as to any of them.

(a) It is desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be

amended to extend the jurisdiction of the

Federal courts over acts of espionage

against the United States wherever committed.

(b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify

and make more specific the definition of a "Foreign Principal" and to further

clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of

State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,

appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources

in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum

to Walsh dated May 26, 1959; regarding H. R. 7006.

(d) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of

1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy." A definition

of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 and as S. 1300. S. 1305 attempts

to define "advoçacy."

(e) Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government

employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information

obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to

provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate

sources for transmittal to foreign governments.

Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,

as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate

decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme

Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,

historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling it is a far better

course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our

national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so

so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to

carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.

insisted upon prosecution of all four for Theft of

U.S. Attorney John Strickler at Roanoke, Governmeat

Property.

Strickler in addition leaked the facts concerning

this case to the local press indicating that arrests would be

forthcoming.

In view of this matter being a potential source of

embarrassment to both the Bureau and the Department, the facts

were brought to the attention of the Criminal Division on

January 12, 1960.

The Criminal Division subsequently advised that

they had discussed this matter by telephone with U.S. Attorney

Strickler who reluctantly agreed to proceed against subjects by

Grand Jury.

The Department indicated they were upset with the

manner in which Strickler released this information to the newspapers

and that Mr. Hayden Crawford of the Department was to separately

take up this matter with him.

The Proctor at Washington and Lee University has indicated

that University officials are holding any action against subjects

in abeyance and would await final action by the Grand Jury. All

four subjects remain enrolled at Washington and lee at this time.

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George

Ledes,

a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph

Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in

New York and have interviewed numerous persons in and out of

SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms.

We determined

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. We are now engaged

in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent

knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing

financial transactions through bank, realty and other

records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes

relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams'

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus

bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of

Interest Statutes.

It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and

DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE "NAUTILUS," NUCLEAR

CRUISER "LONG BEACH" AND GUIDED MISSILE FRIGATE "LUCE" •

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving

possible sabotage in connection with the three captioned vessels of :

the United States Navy.

Between 9-28-59 and 10-19-59 numerous cuts were found in

the electrical cables of the nuclear submarine "Nautilus," which was

being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

On 11-12-59 foreign

material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston Office

has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500 ship-

yárd employees, submitted numerous cut cables for Laboratory examination

and used the polygraph in connection with pertinent interviews.

On 1-5-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser

"Long Beach" which is being constructed at Quincy,

Massachusetts.

These cuts contain no identiiying marks for Laboratory comparison

with tools.

As of 1-14-60, 2,144 of over 5,000 employees

having

access to this vessel had been interviewed.

On 12-28-59, 21 cuts were

found in the fire control wiring

of the guided missile

frigate

"Luce," which is also being constructed

at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This damage was not reported to us or to

the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the damage was

originally considered probably inadvertent. In view of the other

two cases involving cut. cables, the Boston Office has opened an

investigation on this matter also.

The type of damage involved or the lack of any attempt to

hide or aisguise the damage may be indicative ai employees attempting

to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel.

The Boston

Office has been instructed to afford these

cases vigorous intensive

investigation.

BERNARD J. GOLDFINE

Although we are not involved in the Goldjine matter,

Ithis case is currently the subject of a great deal of

"discussion

between the lax Division and the Treasury Department.

The Goldfine tax fraud investigation, according to

our treasury sources, is scheduled to go before grand jury in

Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New England componies

owe the Government approximately eight

million dollars.

This,

of course, includes interest, 6; delinquency penalties, 25%;

and fraud penalty, 50%. You will recall that the approximate

jigure appeared in the newspapers and

the Goldfine defense

charged that this was an attempt on the part of the Government

to try its case in the neuspapers.

No action was taken by

Treasury to look into this alleged leak of information on the

request of the lox Division of Justice since the total figure of

Goldfine's delinquency had been discussed with Goldfine and his

tax autorneys. It was felt that they could have planted the

story in the press. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also

established a tax case on Goldfine's son, Horace, which approcinates

so, 000 delinquency, and a similar case nas been made on mildrea

Paperman, Goldfine's conjidential assistant.

Of course, as previously reported, IPS has established

a failure to file criminal violation on Goldfine jor tie years

1955, 1956, and 195%

However, since this is a misdemeanor,

Justice nod waited until the tax fraud investigation was developed

in order to go ahead with its prosecution. The one weakness in

the tax fraud case is prouing knowledge and culpability directly

to Gondfine.

Ins feels that he will argue that his tax ajjairs

were handled by a competent tax firm and he had every right to

jeel that his tax affairs were being hondled with in the law.

In addition to the tax fraud investigation, the Inspection

Service of IRs laoked into the Goldfine natter to determine the

extent of any irregularities or misconduct on the part of Revenue

enproyees.ron the part of IRs erployees.

The investigation has not developed any criminal

Ine report does rejlect

gross administrative jailures and irregularities in the handling

of work in the Boston Region. Much of this was due to the jact

that Goldjine assigned all of his tar matters in tie New England

area to Lawrence P. Harrington, a jormer IRs employee. Harrington

which might detect Goldfine's delinquencies.

In addition, ne

investigators whenever an inquiry was made concerning Goldfine's

tax ajjairs.

You will recall, the Is investigation has developed

Massachusetts, as well as

New England local and state political figures.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

Following the supreme Court decision in the Greene

case: on June 29, 1959, prolonged ejjorts to prepare a

Presidential Directive to establish a progran under which

private contractors may be granted access to classified data

have culminated in a draft order dated January 7, 1960.

Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.

The more recent bureau comments concerning this matter were

forwarded by memorandum to AAG Yeagley, December 30, 1959;

by memorandum to the Attorney General,

messrs. walsh and leagley, January 6, 1960; by memorandum,

January Il, 1960, to ki. leagley; and by memorandum oj

January 14, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with

copy to ur. Yeagley. The last two of

these communications

both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated

by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order

agencies may consider all of the

pertinent information available

regardless of source. Under section 1 A 1 protection is

afforded to regular confidential informants.

Under Section 4 A 2

information from persons other than current

informants may be

considered if they cannot appear que to death, severe illness,

or some such other good and sufficient cause.

It is apparent

that information from casual informants who refuse to testify

cannot be used under this section.

section o B, according to Mr. leagley, would allow

use of data from wire

taps, microphones, and other sensitive

techniques.

Mr. Leagley has indicated,

however, that such

data would have to be produced in the form of actual quotations

from the conversations rather than the paraphrased form in

which we disseminate this information.

We believe it will not

be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information

in most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting

our sources.

•Even though data from casual informants and sensitive

techniques may not be used as indicated above, section 9 of the

Order grants and affirms the department head

concerned authority

62-77133

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 512

---

## Page 513

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense

secrets and nothing in the rest of the order is deemed to

Limit or afject his responsibility and powers in this regara.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department

head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is

available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established

in the balance of the order.

We have observed to the Department

that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it

turn out that it is necessary to use this summary power in a

majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI wi11

respect the confidence placed in it by both regular informants

or other persons and will not disclose their identity without

their specific permission.

We have summarized by stating

chat from our standpoint

the order as drafted, will permit

is to furnish all available data to appropriate agencies as in

the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential

informants.

Data from any casual informants and from highly

sensitive techniques will largely be usable only under section 9.

He have stated that the Bureau does not object to the proposed

Order from an operational standpoint.

On January 11, John Doherty of the Department informed

us of a very minor addition, proposed by Philip Areeda of the

White House, which was discussed in memorandum of January 15.

This addition would not affect the comments we have previously

made concerning this Order.

PROTECTING IDENTITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFOMANTS

CONFRONTATION ISSUE

Hannah us. slawson.

Solicitor General Rankin will argue the cases

for the Government.

The cases involve the President's Civil Rights Commission

which was

established by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1957

to investigate charges of citizens being discriminatorily deprived

of the right to vote.

The question raised for the supreme Court

is whether the Civil Rights Act of 1957 authorizes the Civil Rights

Commission to conduct hearings wherein state registrars and

private citizens accused of depriving others of the right to vote

are denied notice of charges against them and confrontation

Although the hearings held by the civil Rights

Commission are investigative rather than judicial or puritive

such as the normal Government hearing, the argument and the

supreme court decision in these cases could shed some light

on the issue of confrontation as

well as the investigative agency's

right to protect the identity of conjidential informants. This

is particularly true in view of the current negotiations

produce an Executave Order in relation to the Industrial security

program.

These are the two cases which the "Hashington Post"

commented upon editorially on December 14, 1959, supporting the

civil Rights Commission's hearing procedures in

that it was

necessary

that the commission protect their conjidential informants

from reprisals by segregationists.

This was to be accomplished through the 1ssuance

of an

On November 19, 1959, the Attorney General

concerning the current status of this matter, Assistant

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12-31-59. It relates to the association between Ledes,

former legal adviser to Securities

and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Commissioner James C. Sargent and Abrams, a New York promoter of

unsavory reputation.

Ledes resigned from Reynolds and Company,

Now York brokers, on 1-28-60.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files throughout

the country and have interviewed numerous

persons in and out

of SEC who handled cases involving Abrams' firms. we determined

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams

made loans to

Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes.

These

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus

bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest

Statutes.

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge

as to any connection between Ledes and Abrams, has since improved

his memory considerably and now feels he may have been taken

advantage of by Ledes.

Sargent finally furnished a signed state-

ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2-5-60..

Sargent

told us that Ledes had been in touch with Tony Russo who had

arranged for former Attorney General Brownell to talk to Attornes

teneral Rogers in July, 1950, about Sargent's ambition at the time

to become U.S. Attorney for

the Southern District of New York.

We have been told that both Ledes and Abrams were associated with

Russo, ex-confidential assistant to Brownell. Russo has not been

alleged to be involved in any irregularities

in this matter.

Arrangements are now being made to interview subject

DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS AT WOODNER HOTEL

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

Hucks, chief telephone operator at the Woodner

Hotel, was indicted December 2, 1959; along with her

assistant, Davis, for having obstructed justice by

destroying records of the Woodner Hotel (telephone toll'

tickets concerning calls to and from Teamster officials)

which had been subpoenaed by the McClellan Committee.

The grand jury here in the District, which was hearing

this case, has been recessed for several days and it is

not expected to resume hearings until later this month.

Upon resumption of the hearings, it is expected that

additionai testimony will be taken from co-defendant Davis,

who appeared briefly at her own request before the grand

jury during the week beginning February 1, 1950.

The additional hearings are aimed at developing

further information showing that subject Hucks committed

perjury before the McClellan Committee in denying ownership

of a fur stole we located in falls Church, Virginia.

This

stole allegedly

was received by Hucks from James Hoffa

and/or the Teamsters Union.

lampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Only ten of the

victins were identified and the other bodies have not been

recovered.

On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-scale

investigation in this matter.

It had

been alleged that

DI. Robert V. Spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal •

record who had been reported as a passenger on the plane, hac

induced his friend

anc!

former partner in crime, William Allen

Taylor of Tamed $100,000

Florida, to board the plane in his place.

Spears had over

worth of insurance with his wife

as

beneticlary and laylor purchased sor, 500 worth of flight

insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, our investigation was directed at

finding Spears or Taylor since this appeared to be a key point

• in our investigation.

Spears was located by Bureau Agents in

thoenix, Arizona, on danuary 20, 1460,

and. charged with the

Interstate transportation of a stolen

Motor Vehicle (IlaiV).

Spears admitted Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane

and that following

the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his

identity: He took Taylor's car, with his alleged permission,

but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and

that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the

identification number from it and tried to

get a fraudulent

title for the car.

Spears, with Turska, contacted Mrs. Spears

in ballas, texas, about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears

admitted that her husband persuaded her not. to reveal the

fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could

be paid to her as beneficiary.

On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in

Phoenix,

Arizona, he was charged with the Interstate Transportation

of a Stolen Motor Vehicle for taking Taylor's car fron Florida to

Arizona.

He was taken to the U.s.

Commissioner in Phoenix on

that date and held on $35,00€ bond.

On February 1, 1960, Spears

was brought before the U.r. District Judge in Phoenix and

charged by information with the interstate transportaion of Taylor's automobile.

Spears waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty.. His bond was continued

at $35,000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the

examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an

explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could

be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might

reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly

if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun:

by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object

which was thought to be the plane. On February 5, 1960, however, the Navy

discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircraft.

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who

formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami Office advanced the theory

that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 13 to 15, 1959, for

the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves

the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have

prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears'

place. The explosion, if there was one, might have resulted from an

accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered

this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of

nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,

during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not

volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge

of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being

pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws

which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been

at Boliuia, North Carolina, killing all 34 occupants.

Investigation at the scene of the cras smock up,

including examination

conducted by Civil Aerorautics Board investigators. They

have been

unable to reach a dejinite conclusion as to the cause of the crash.

Frank's body, which was found near lure Beach, Norh Carolina,

bore only remnants of clothing.

The body was mangled and the lower

portion of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,

which reportedly consisted of a zipper-type blue flight bag and a

brown leather atiache case, has not been located.

IBI Laboratory examination of Frank's right hand and part

of his right arm, foreign material removed from his hand and arm and

portions of clothing jound on his body revealed no explosive residue.

Pathologists who examined frank's body have advised that his body

had the appearance of having been subjected to a severe force of unusual

nature and they believe his injuries resembled blast damage but they

cannot dejinitely identify them as such.

According to the pathologists,

similar wounds have jeen observed on victims of land mine explosions.

II Laboratory examination of a life jacket jound at Kure Beach

on January 2s, 1980, disclosed sone nitrate present in a dirty smeared

deposit in an area of the jacket in which were imbedded metal fragments

¿rom a sipper and pieces of blue material. Numerous small blue fragments

jrom the lije jacket and from unidentified clothing found at the crash

scene were determined to de similar and appear to correspona to the

material which composes blue flight bags sold oy various airlines.

These findings are consisient with what would se expected as a result

of a detonation of a high-order type of explosive.

These findings

are not conclusive and additional material from the scene of the crash

will be examined as received by the FBI Laboratory in an efjort to

reach a definite conclusion.

Extensive investigation of the activities of Frank. has failed

to develop any direct evidence to date that he was responsible jor

the crash.

The investigation of his activities and of the

activities

of his associdies is continuing. Thirty-two investigative reports have

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving

Office has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500

shipyard employees.

As many of the damaged cables as could 3e made

available by the Nauy have been submitted for laboratory examination

and additional specimens are being submitted when they can be made

available by the Nauy. The polygraph has beer used in connection with

On 1-15-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser

"Iong beach," which is being constructed at quincy, Massachusetts.

These cuts contain no identifying marks for labcratory comparison

with suspect tools.

An average of 2,700 employees worked on this

vessel daily and a total of approcimately 5,000 employees hod access

to it.

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R. 8121,

introduced by Mr. Walter, which would authorize the secretary

of Defense to establish a program for screening employees

• of private contractors for access to classified information.

The bill states that procedures prescribed by Defense shall

be designed to protect from disclosure all information which,

in the opinion of the secretary of Defense, would affect the

national security, sajety, or public interest of would tend

to compromise investigative sources or investigative metroos.

The bill has been regerred to the senate Committee on the

Judiciary and, if passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute

the same program which was in effect at the time of the

supreme court decision in the Greene case..

Defense could,

however, institute a new program offering a maximum of con-

frontation while protecting sources or techniques in accordance

with the terms of the bill.

On February 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General leagley

forwarded a new draft of the proposed Executive Order in this

matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the. Attorney

General and the white house and that he hoped that it would

be the final draft. This draft introduced four major changes:

The first of these would permit use of information

from a so-called "casual" informant without confrontation if the

informant could not appear que to death, sèvere illness, or

some other cause determined bu the head of the depariment to

be good and sufficient.

The underlined words have been added

and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which

information from such a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when

an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death

or severe illness, as indicated above, the identity of the

This requirement would

apply only in the case of death or severe illness and would not

apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.

We have repeatedly told the Department that we must respect the

confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us information

and that we will not disclose their identities without their

permission.

In the case of death or severe illness,

we will

be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand

why this requirement has been added.

A third change makes it possible for either the

Attorney General or the Director to certify that an indiviaval

is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure

would be detrimental to the national security. The previous

draft required that this certification be made. by the Attorney

General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the

investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data

and, at the same time, to decide whether the applicant is to

have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this

procedure may be criticized both by the public and the courts.

This matter was discussed with the department by Mir. Belmont

at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on

81222

August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical

standpoint and the standpoint of the supreme Court,

identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case

REQUEST TO RIVICW SOCIAL SECURITY RECORDS IN

Irom our experience gained in cases involving Soviet "illegal"

agents, we know that the soviet intelligence services instruct their

"illegals" to apply for social security cards as a step in establishing

a so-called "legal" identity.

Examination of social security applicatiors

filed by several souiet "illegal" agents known to us revealed certain

Joreign characteristnes, such as style of handuriting and punctuation,

and other items which would be susceptible of identification.

In view of the above, we explored with social security officials

a program involving the

screening of social security applications

at its Federal repository in Baltimore. After some negotiation,

Commissioner witchell adused he could not comply with our request.

He felt social Security must protect its records and our proposed

program. opened up social security records on too broad a basis.

Since that time, the Conmunist Farty, USA, has been

either through parole,

executive clemency or amnesty. Pecently,

this campaign was accelerated because Winston was alleged to be

suffering from a brain tumor.

Castro with basis for renewed attacks against U.s. for allowing

illegal flights to Cuba. On March 23, 1960, this hoax was exposed

substantial evidence showing that Rundquist-Shergalis flight was,

in fact, instigated by Castro agents. Miami reports of April 1, April 6,

furnished to Department and other interested agencies.

1960, Federal Grand Jury at Miami, which was

convened on April 1960, returned indictments against shergalis

and Hector Garcia Soto (Cuban Air Force employee at Miami uno served

as intermediary between shergalis and Cuban intelligence officials

charging them with violations of Foreign Agents Registration Act of

1938, as amended. Indictments were also returned against shergalis

and Fundquist charging violations of federal Aviation Act, administered

by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plan.

Shergalis is still in custody of Cuban officials in that country,

Cuban Government having rejected U.S. request that shergalis and

Rundguist be extradited to face charges in this country.

At time

indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore,

indictments were sealed and bench warrants were issued for arrest

Garcia returned to Miami on afternoon of May 4, 1960, and

was arrested by our Miami Office at Miami International Airport.

Press release was issued SAC, Miami, concerning arrest and subsequently

on same date Department issued press release concerning indictments

of shergalis, Garcia and runaquist.

Arraignment of Garcia was

originally scheduled for May 6, 1960, but was postponed until

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR

MOTOR VEHICLES - FALSE REPORTS

SUMMARY OF PROSECUTIONS

The following is a summary of the prosecutions

under the false report section of the destruction of Aircraft

or Motor Vehicles statute.

Attached hereto is a thumbnail sketch of each

of the cases which are pending prosecution at this time.

Since the U. S. Attorneys', conference early in

April, 1960, prosecution has been authorized in 16 of these

cases. Arrests were made in 15 of these cases and in one

case,

the subject Vincent Joseph Micel, Boston, Massachusetts,

was permitted to surrender following the return of a true

bill of indictment.

The Micel violation actually occurred

on January 26, 1960, and he was arrested by local authorities.

The Assistant U. S. Attorney, Boston, Massachusetts, deferred

his prosecutive opinion pending the outcome of local charges.

When local prosecution was subsequently discontinued, the

case was presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Boston;

Massachusetts, on May 19, 1960.

cases pending in which

On May 19, 1960, Donald David Kitch, Portland,

Oregon,

District Manager for Western Oil Company, who, on

May 12,

1960, made a false report while seeing his boss off

on a United Air Lines flight in Portland, Oregon, entered

a plea of guilty in U. S. District Court. Sentence was not

imposed pending the completion of a presentence investigation

and subject was released on his own recognizance. This

conviction brings the total number of coavictions to 17 since

the effective date of this statute, July 14, 1956. These

convictions, with the exception of the Kitch conviction, in

which sentence is not yet imposed, have resulted in 6 years

actual sentences, 10 years probationary sentences and $2,750

in fines.

In summary, it is noted that convictions have been

obtained in 17 cases and prosecution is pending in 19 cases.

VOTER REGISTRATION CASES

UNDER CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1960

The Civil Rights Division has requested the

delivery of demand letters to registration officials and

subsequent inspections and copying of voter registration

records in eight counties and parishes in Alabama, Georgia,

| South Carolina and Louisiana.

The desired records were

made available in South Carolina and Georgia.

In Louisiana a suit

has been filed in Federal

Court against the Attorney General, Mr. Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr.,

and the Director of the FBI alleging Titles 3 and 6 of the

Civil

Rights Act of 1960 are unconstitutional and requests

an injunction enjoining the Attorney General and the FBI

from proceeding under the Act.

United States District

Judge Ben C. Dawkins, Shreveport, Louisiana, signed an

order

on May 25, 1960, directing the Attorney General, Acting

Assistant

Attorney General Ryan and the Director to show

cause at 9:30 a.m., June 20, 1960, why preliminary inter-

locutory injunction should not be granted. Judge Dawkins also

signed a temporary restraining order to be effective until

June 20, 1960.

In Alabama, in one instance, an injunction has been

issued by Judge James A. Hare of the Fourth Judicial Circuit

which covers Wilcox County, Alabama. This requires clarification

of the Act before granting permission to inspect and copy

I voter registration recods. The Attorney General, Mr. Ryan,

plus the Special Agent in Charge of the Mobile Office and

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge, are named in the

injunction.

No reply has been received to the demand letter

New York and son of Federal Judge Irving Kaufman, who

presided during the trial of the Apalachin hoodlums

AUSA Kenneth Ray of the Northern District of New York,

has indicated letters coupled with previous phone calls

constituted a violation oi

the Federal Ixtortion Statute and

his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960.

Ixtensive investigation has been conducted by our

Albany Office in an effort to identify and locate the extortion-

ist. To date, no positive information has been obtained, and

no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the • •

fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty

members, and advisors of the victim that he prepared

the

communications in question.

While no direct evidence cor-

roborating these rumors

has been uncovered, writing paper and

envelopes similar to that used in one of the communications

found in the victim's room.

The Department has requested copies of all investiga-

tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the

facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will

be disseminated to the Depärtment.

Joseph Corbett, Jr., the prime suspect in this case who is carried

as one of our ten most wanted fugitives, and the development of

evidence to positively identify Corbett as Coors' abductor.

In our program acquainting the public with our interest

which will be furnished to all newspapers in the United States. In

our specialized circularization of persons and businesses with whom

Corbett would most likely have contact, we have sent letters and

ANTITRUST AND MONOPOLY SUBCOMMITTEE

COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY

ESTES KEFAUVER, CHAIRMAN

Recently Senator Kefauver's Committee requested

the Bureau to conduct name checks on 304 individuals

reportedly associated with the boxing industry.

Several

of these names were duplicated on a prior request for a

name check by Senator Kefauver's Committee. It appeared

that the Committee might be conducting a fishing expedition

by submitting such an extensive list.. Accordingly, the

matter was referred to the Department to answer the Committee's

request.

On May 25, 1960, William G. Hundley, Chief,

Organized Crime and

Racketeering section,

Criminal

Division, teLephonically advised that jollowing a contact

with the Kefauver Committee on

request for name checks on 304 individuals had been

30g

that date the original

reduced to a request for name checks on 30 individuals.

Of these 30, Mr. Hundley pointed out that where any

individual was the subject of pending prosecution, such

as Frankie Carbo, it would be unnecessary for the Bureau

to search its files concerning that individual.

Mr. Hundley

also advised the Committee representatives that it would not

be possible in every instance to make nane checks on an

expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted

inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would

depend upon the number of references involved. Mr. Hundley

is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate •

future listing the names which the Committee has now

requested be checked.

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing

the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries

prepared.

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will

provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142

clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year

employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)

are for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy

volume of civil rights work. (This is the second increment of a

total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and

equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights

work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents

a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for

assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the

tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of

$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current

fiscal

year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated

and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about

by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll

costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation increasing the costs we

must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service

($1,610,000) .

Most careful consideration was given to our request for

additional personnel in 1968.

We are absorbing much work and will

endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted with a

one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in

name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we

have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower if we are to

meet our responsibilities in these areas.

The Bureau's growing.work is not limited to these particular

areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new

all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-

cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal

security of the country has continued to increase. We are going to

do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our

existing staff. In addition, new items of legislation continue to be

passed adding to our work.

Indicative of our heavy volume of work is the fact that as

of January 1, 1967, pending investigative matters throughout the

field totaled 150,189, with 5% in a delinquent status. At that time,

the average individual assignment in the field was nearly 26 matters as

compared with 20 at that time in 1961.

"SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has

launched into a program of review of past, current, and

contemplated prosecutions to determine if such cases have

been materially affected by the use of electronic listening

devices.

This has required the establishment of special

microphone indices at Bureau Headquarters and voluminous

correspondence with various field divisions to determine if

individuals listed in the Department's inquiries were covered

by IBI microphones. With regard to listed individuals on

whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so

advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in

some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained

from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a

review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the

supreme court by the solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani

case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances

regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to

date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts

regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of

pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodlum and a member of

La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years

come Theo

imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax

laws for the years 1956 through 1960. In response to the

Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting

those instances where Schipani was covered by an

electronic

surveillance.

This electronic surveillance was not directly

on Schipani but was in an office frequented by top La Cosa

Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor

General requested the

Supreme Court to vacate the judgment

regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remana the

case to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,

1966, the Supreme Court complied with the request of the

Solicitor General. This was installed under the general

authority ot the Attorney General, as were all of the

following unless otherwise specified.

Louis j. Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion

to remand in the United States Court of

Appeals for the First

Circuit in the Louis J. Taglianetti appeal from the judgment

of the United States District Court for the District of

Rhode Island. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca •

"family" of La Cosa Nostra, was indicted on February

: 26, 1963,

for income tax evasion lor

'the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti

appealed but no brief had

yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's

conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance

at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)

where Taglianetti andothers met and that this establishment

was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.

On various occasions between March, 1962, when this microphone

was installed with trespass under

general

authority of the

Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations

related to his income tax indictment. None of the information

was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence

in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti!s

case was within the ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in

the Black case, decided November 7, 1966. The distinguishing

reature between the two is the intrusion upon attorney-client

conversations

in the Black case, for which the Supreme Court

vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's

reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the

limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the

facts and to determine whether Taglianetti's conviction should

stand

or a new trial be ordered.

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial

claiming that, "The Government, having tasted the forbidder

fruit of its illegal bugging and having withheld all knowledge

thereof from the defendant, his counsel and the trial judge,

cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such

forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings

on these motions have not yet been scheduled.

In response to the

of this surveillance to them by letter 10/18/66, and made

available for review the surveillance logs. No information

from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau.

The Department subsequently disclosed to the

Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our

microphone surveillance.

Considerable reluctance was

displayed by the Department to including in this

memorandum our general authority for installation of

electronic surveillances.

They did not clearly record the

dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested

and was advised of our coverage.

Our protests were clearly

outlined in correspondence to the Department before this

memorandum was filed. Ultimately our authority was recorded

as a footnote.

This microphone was installed under the

general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa

Nostra "family," and as such the leader of organized crime

in that area, was brought to trial in United States District

court, springfield, lllinois, during October, 1966, or

the basis of an Indictment

charging evasion of Federal

income taxes.

An early issue in this action was our

microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his

associates.

Microphone coverage had been established on

Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his

paramour, and in the

office of hoodlum attorney Dominic Frinzi,

all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965.

These installations were all made in line with general

departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's

memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black case.

The defense has made a motion to suppress, based

on this electronic coverage. After hearing testimony

regarding these installations, including testimony of

Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in

question, the judge instructed that the trial should be

commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its

mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented

warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66

Ronald David Carabbia

Carabbia was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of

wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of

Appeals, Sixth Circuit. The Cleveland Office conducted a

microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and

Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.

Carabbia and his brothers operated a gambling game at this

location.

Activities covered by this surveillance included

gambling with numerous participants.

The voices of the

individuals covered were never identified. It could not be

determined if the appellant was or was not present during

the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we

disclosed to them by letter dated 11/1/66 the circumstances

of this surveillance and made available for review all

surveillance logs.

By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department

indicated its intention

to disclose

• this microphone

surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,

Sixth Circuit. In three

• letters we

have advised the Department

of the brief operation of this source and that the individuals

covered were never identified.

The Department's proposed

memorandum to the court notes,

"There is a substantial

question whether any conversations in which appellant

participated were even monitored."

In spite of

this, the

Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.

The Department failed to include our general authorization for

installation of

electronic surveillances over our protests.

We feel that at the very least the general authorization of

the

Department should be in all briefs going to courts so there can

be no accusation that the Bureau was operating in an uncontrolled

and unrestrained manner.

Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T. Rainwater has conducted a large-scale

numbers operation in the Miami, Florida area.

He and six

associates were convicted of state gambling violations in

Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the

Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue

Service agents.

In response to the Department's request they

were provided with logs reporting those instances where

Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted

in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.

Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an

electronic surveillance.

On January 11, 196%, the Solicitor General

disclosed to the Supreme Court that an electronic device

had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under

general authority of the Attorney General. Information from

this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who

in turn disseminated to local authorities.

Charles Joseph Battaglia, JI.

Battaglia is a Tucson, Arizona, La Cosa Nostra

member who was closely affiliated

with Joseph Bonanno a

former La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member. A microphone

for criminal intelligence purposes had been maintained on

him under general Departmental authority. He was arrested by

Bureau Agents for violation of the Hobbs Act in March, 1965,

as a result of making threats in an effortrto force a Tucson

firm to utilize his vending machires. Following the granting

of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District

Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning

of January 11, 1967%

The Department advised that they intended

to inform the judge

that Battaglia had been covered by microphone

surveillances, but that the coverage had no bearing on the

evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal

charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

-7-

## Page 559

they were going to recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial

and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary,

a hearing will be held to determine the validity

of the Department's claim

regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled for Monday,

January 16, 1967, in Tucson, Arizona.

Edward L. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

On December 10, 1965, Edward Levinson, at that time

filed a $6,000, 000 damage suit (later

against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy and

asking injunctive relief

against further invasion by use of

electronic listening devices. Levinson filed a similar suit

against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain

of its employees.

The case has recently been taken over personally by

Assistant Attorney

General Barefoot Sanders who is presently

reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing

a response to plaintiff's motions. No date has been set for

trial in matter.

The Bureau has been pressing the Department

to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as

Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in

the Fremont Hotel.

Fred B. Black, JI.

Fred B. Black, Jr., named as being hired by front

men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,

D. Co, Where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted

•on May 5, 1965, of evading income taxes for the period of

1956 through 1959.

After a number of appears he petitioned the

Supreme Court for issuance

of a writ of certiorari which was

denied on May 4, 1966.

on May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall

filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting à listening

device had*been placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 559

---

## Page 560

none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as

a result of the listening device.

The Supreme Court on

June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to

questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial

memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on

July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum.

This memorandum indicated the listening device,

installed with trespass under general Departmental authori-

zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November

• 7,

1966, vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new

trial, which will not be

set until

after the Robert Baker trial.

/ 69

To date, the Bureau

has received over 1,000 names

of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination

if such subjects have been covered by FBI microphones.

number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and

which can be expected to be even more serious in

the future,

is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of

individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these

matters.

for example, one list recently received included

475 names, in some cases with a minimum of identifying data

and in others with no identifying data at all. In order that

an accurate determination can be made whether an individual

in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones,

it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate

identifying data when submitting these names for review.

-9 -

NW 65360-Docld:32989646-Page-560-

---

## Page 561

An attendant problem has arisen in certain

inquiries in which the Department has made unreasonable

requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of

these involved a request for the results of the review later

the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, .of

absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid

checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the

Department has made disclosures to the various courts,

continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to

inform the court of the fact that the installation in question

has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority

from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental

authority which was granted. The Department has been repeatedly

reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

The volume involved in this project has caused

a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous

inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when

the enormity of the entire project is assessed, in view of

indications by the Department that the full review may

encompass as many as 30,000 names.

Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing

champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year Illed a

claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has

applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, for

a ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim

religion. After a very extensive investigation by the

Bureau, Clay's draft board

denied his claim as a

conscientious objector and placed him in a l-a classification.

Since

the board's vote was unanimous, he has no further

appeal as a conscientious objector.

His ministerial

deferment request will now have to be considered by his

local board which our sources indicate will meet in the

next few days. If the local board denies this request,

Clay has the right to appeal.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used

in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.

We set up a staff of ten Agents.

In August, 1966, at White

House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache

office there, staffed with three Agents.

The six-month-old government under Joaquin Balaguer

has brought about a degree of stability.

Nevertheless, there

continue to be strong undercurrents of dissension. The

rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,.

has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo

Domingo, which began January 9, 1967, has attracted strong

communist support and has served as a rallying point for the

extreme leftists.

Within two days, seventy percent of the

students in secondary schools had joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset

Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one

head on.

JUAN MART BRAS

Juan Mari Bras, a San Juan attorney and Security

Index subject, is the founder and current Secretary General

of the Movimiento Pro-Independencia de Puerto Rico, which is

the principal militant group seeking independence for

Puerto Rico.

He is involved in a cuban intelligence network from

operating in Puerto Rico.

A telephone surveillance on Mari Bras was initially

authorized by Attorney General Kennedy on October 4, 1963.

By letter dated May 31, 1966, Attorney General Katzenbach

was

advised that Mari Bras was the attorney for a Selective

Service violator. He authorized the continuance of the

coverage on Mari Bras on June 1, 1966, and at that time

requested that he be immediately informed of any interceptions

of conversations involving the individuals who are parties

or attorneys in the case. Acting Attorney General Clark

approved the continuance of this surveillance on December 29,

1966. By letter dated January 9, 1967, Clark questioned the

continued necessity for this surveillance since it had beer

necessary to dismiss or decline prosecution of some ten or

twelve selective Service violators. The Acting Attorney

General was advised by letter dated January 10, 1967, that

the telephone surveillance had been discontinued even though

it had continued to provide valuable intelligence information.

Learly 1966 our lophat iniormant, who is a detector

In-place to the soviet Military Intelligence Service, identitzed-

Boeckenhaupt as an important Soviet intelligence agent. The

Identity of this source must be protected under all circumstances.

Boeckenhaupt, a Staff Sergeant, United States

Air Force, entered military service in 1960. He is a crypto-

graphic systems maintenance and repairman and possessed "Top

Secret" clearance.

On April 20, 1966, he was detected by fBI.

Agents in a clandestine meeting

in suburban Virginia with

Aleksey R. Malinin,

Soviet Embassy employee and reportedly a

Colonel of Soviet Military Intelligence.

On October 24, 1966, Boeckenhaupt was arrested by

Air Force representatives at

March Air Force Base, Riverside,

California,

for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice

in that he failed to report his contacts with representative of

a foreign government (Malinin).

On October 31, 1966, a complaint was filed before the

United States Commissioner, Los Angeles, charging Boeckenhaupt

with conspiracy to commit espionage.

He was indicted by a Federal

Grand Jury, Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria, Virginia,

on December 16, 1966, for conspiracy to

commit espionage and for

conspiracy to act as

an agent of a foreign government without

prior notification to the Department of State.

On January 9,

1967, his court-appointed attorney submitied data to the Clerk

of the United States District Court, Alexandria, Virginia,

requesting that Boeckenhaupt's trial be kept in the Central

District of California,

and that Boeckenhaupt not be removed to

the Eastern District of Virginia to stand trial in this matter.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Martin Luther King, JI., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference, is

currently writing a book to be entitled

"Where Do We Go From Here" to be published in the spring.

This

book allegedly will deal with the resurgence of the

"white back-

lash' "black power," and propose a course of action the Federal

Government should take concerning the civil rights movement.

King has been counseled by Stanley Levison, his principal advisor

and long-time communist, to run for President of the United States

in 1968.

He has this suggestion under consideration and

reportedly has made no decision.

We maintain a wire tap on

ROBERT G. BAKER

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The most recent development relative to the trial

of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The

Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the

Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case.

It

is reported that this installation relates to the Department's

admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone

and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,

in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,

at the beverly wilshire hotel, Los angeles, carlornia, which

was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley. The

article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the

Department to cover this meeting.

It also points out that

according to Edward Bennett Williams, Baker's attorney, that

in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes

and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received

indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the

meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on 3/25/65,

between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were

monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of

the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action

was legal and with the written consent of Bromley. A complete

transcript of these recordings was made available to the

Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65, request that

we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.

Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting

was monitored, Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark was questioned

as to who performed this monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-

tained that upon the FBI'S

refusal to comply with the departmental

request, the Department had then turned to rither the Imnigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) or the Bureau of Narcotics.

He was certain that it was

was accidental in nature and resulted from installations which

had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the

Florida, (all in connection with organized crime matters) and

the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters).

Details concerning these installations were set forth in a

summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the

prosecution of Baker, dated 1/10/67.

Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on

Black, the F remont Hotel and Siegelbaum were furnished to

the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge

who ordered that they be made available to the defense.

These

Logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,

following which the judge ruled that there was no causal

relationship between the information in the logs and the

charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted

on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished

to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a

protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis-

cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.

Information as to the existence of these logs has been

leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams

to cause some action

• favorable to his client. His reporting

to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak

is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

James Riddle Hoffa and three others

were convicted

in Chattanooga federal Court, 3/4/04, O1 ObStruCtion OI

justice related to their efforts to tamper with certain

members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa.

These

convictions were upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court on 12/12/66.

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney

General Fred M. Vinson, or.:

we furnished a letter to the

Acting Attorney General on 12/29/66, of instances in whici

the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were

overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoffa, his

office, and his home were not the direct targets of

any

electronic devices in the development of this case, and the

Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of

12/29/66. The instances in which he appeared to have been

present at conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,

Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1961 and 1962 our Detroit office overheard

three conversations of Hoffa®

These conversations were

broadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles

operated by Teamsters Union personnel in the detroit area.

This was accomplished through the use of a tunable

commercial-type FM radio receiver which was in operation in

our Detroit office. No trespass was involved in this

connection.

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa

appears to have participated in four telephone

conversations

with two Las Vegas hoodlum figures who were being covered by

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and

former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 5/29/64, in

Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice arising

from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-

coming trial of Hoffa.. In this investigation, a miniature

recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness

during a meeting with Osborn.

at the request of the Department and with the prior approval

of the two Federal judges in Nashville.

No trespass was

involved, and the use of this installation was brought out

fully during Osborn's trial.

His conviction was affirmed by

the Supreme Court 12/12/66. The Department is fully aware of

this installation and details of same were included in our

letter to the Acting Attorney General 12/29/66.

At the specific request of former Attorney General

Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was

conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James E.

Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during

period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61.

This coverage was for the

specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of

Hoffa's in the Justice Department, whom Kennedy thought

Haggerty would meet in Washington.

Information concerning

this coverage was included in our

letter to the Acting

Attorney General dated 12/29/66.

In addition, in response

to a letter from Vinson dated 12/29/66, we furnished the

Acting Attorney General copies of logs prepared in connection

with this coverage by memorandum dated

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to

the Acting Attorney General

advising him that in view of

the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal

Government into the rights of defendants in criminal

trials and in order to assure that future requests for

jury panel investigations would be made only in truly

exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should

not be undertaken by the Bureau except upon the specific

written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy

Attorney General

and that our field offices were being so

instructed.

CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

Two major civil rights cases are awaiting

prosecutive action in Mississippi. One of these cases

involves the murder of three civil rights workers near

Philadelphia, Mississippi, in dune, 1964, In Which case

eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civil rights

charges by a federal Grand Jury.

The other case involves

the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand

Dahmer, past president of the NAAC?, near Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of

Dahmer.

A Federal Grand Jury

indicted fifteen members of

the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi

relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights

Statute.

In view of a court decision subsequent to the

above indictments, it was determined by the Government that

all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because

certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded

from the grand jury.

The Department has been pushing for

early representations to a properly composed grand jury and

had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to

a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/67.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised

SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U. S. Attorney to

use the January grand jury

for the purpose of checking into

possible misuse of funds in the Headstart project sponsored

by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The

Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government

was providing additional money for this project although

it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars

of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox

said that he felt "first things come first" and therefore

decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible

fraud in connection with the failure to account for these

funds.

He stated he would advise SAC Moore

When he convenes

another grand jury to hear the civil rights

cases. Judge Cox

added that this will be done sometime in the near

future

but that no specific date has been set.

It has been

speculated in the press that if Judge Cox fails to promptly

call a

grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the

Government will seek mandamus from the U. S. Circuit Court

of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox

to call a

grand

jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES

AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called

attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and

recommended the Department propose legislation which would require

bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements

for all banks under Federal Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on

3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,

that a legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was

submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,

recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the

Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the

Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were

advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis-

lation would be included on program for 90th Congress.

By letter

11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the

Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions.. On

1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current

figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to

1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar

year 1965.

WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.

CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year

Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette, Michigan, furnished

information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"

of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the

1963 bombing of the Canadian freighter,- "Howard L. Shaw"

in Chicago, Illinois.

..

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was

immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose

of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence

relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an

electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-

versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be

obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be

forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on

1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the

Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping

is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney

General called Mr. De Loach relative to this case, indicating he

felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it

should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney

General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,

since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then

on the other hand be directed by the Department to enter into such

procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's

reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he

probably would not put this request in writing and perhaps would

inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to

request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no

such request from the Acting Attorney General.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE

MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that

Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-

committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for

50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year

to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-

ment and corrective systems. Clark said that a successful war on

crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions

but on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence

that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered

efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action

reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be

offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has

followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts

have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very

high average of convictions, showing "what excellence in training and

standards can do, " Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far

on too little" until more evidence is in on the effect of the Supreme

Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI

investigations are not normally hot pursult, on-the-street situations.

When the FBI interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable

investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have

been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation.

On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,

developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for

the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation.

Congress is currently investigating the effect of the

Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator

Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around

the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received

has been conflicting Generally law enforcement officials testify

that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-

tarians take the opposite view. As of this time, neither side has

demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions. The

absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that

Miranda is a new decision being handed down on June 13, 1966.

As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial

courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 1967

ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"

ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, 1967, a group of 21 generally liberal

Republican Congressmen, members of the "Wednesday Club, " issued

a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's

organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the

House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation

to examine this aspect of the war on crime. The gist of their argument

is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative

agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The

press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-

cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which

is hindering the war against crime and that this can be eliminated only

through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the "Wednesday Club" is based on

a false premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this

country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000

arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police

make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic

offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional

control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in

the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law

enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem. The

real problem is at the local level Where there are 40, 000 investigative

agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem

of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint

of the FBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all

Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important

cooperative services are made available to all law enforcement agencies,

both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor-

mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law

enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the "Wednesday Club" states that

the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 601

## Page 602

regulations, although organizationally responsible to the Department

of Justice, and cites as an example recent debates over wiretapping

procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's

testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-

tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly

shows that the FBI's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge

and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled

conditions. There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever by the FBI

in this field.

The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement

in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,

could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection

functions. This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents.

were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of the

President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning

solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during

this period have been at their highest levels.

The action of the "Wednesday Club" was an obvious

attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have

found in the question of Federal organization.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program

"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV, at

12:30 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program

was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents

George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the "Washington Post."

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the

Attorney General were: 1. The New Orleans investigation into the

assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The

Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell;

and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI

during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the

Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, that assassin

Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He

commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New

Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence

that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment

on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans

authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

Clark commented that there were 38 wiretaps presently

authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national

security-type cases. He emphasized that procedares for his authority

in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied

that none would nos be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early

to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement

performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable effect

on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of

their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning

possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.

However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any

further action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the

death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS

1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's

preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence

were up 11/. There was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase

in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, and a 14%

increase in robbery.

As a group, crimes against property increased

11% during 1966.

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of

cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants. Crime in these cities

rose 14%. Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average

increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in

the suburbs rose 13%.

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated

the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that there.was a

23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used. The

Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders

were committed with the use of a firearm. 71% of these murders

were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles

or other type firearm.

police arrests is aims or at relense also i exced th tran 1966

criminal acts (excluding traffic

offenses) dropped 1%; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of

age increased 9%.

Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,

police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that

police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65% of

forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with

respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled

"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967." This Act has its

basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-

mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.

The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime

in a Free Society" was released February 18, 1967. The pro-

posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid

program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the

purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and

research. It would also establish in the Department of Justice

an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Assistance. Depending

on how this new legislation would be administered within the

Department of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict

with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law

enforcement.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

General requested FBI participation in a national conference

of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held

in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.

This conference was called by the President and has as its

purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed

crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime

legislation would affect directly the long-standing FB1 coopera-

tive services to local law enforcement,

Assistant to the Director

DeLoach, Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.

Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is

being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a

computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and

criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,

196% At the present time the following police agencies are directly

on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and

N Denver FBI Field Office

These agencies are entering records on wanted

persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.

They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds.

For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through

the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI

computer here in Washington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California

Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled

to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967. The system has had a

steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the

computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is

"on the air" and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN E. KENNEDY

BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES C. GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans

District Attorney James C. Garrison was conducting an investigation

of the assassination of the late President Kennedy. Garrison reported-

Iy was attempting to develop evidence showing that

David William

Ferrie, a homosexual who was a former airlines pilot, and Lee Harvey

Oswald conspired with anti-Castro Cubans to assassinate President

Kennedy•

We were informed by several sources that Garrison was basing

much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack S.

Martin and David Lewis.

Martin is a private investigator in

New Orleans and Lewis is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus

station.

Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases.

During

our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated

allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found

• no evidence to show this was true.

Garrison has made one arrest in his case - Clay L. Shaw,

a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart

In New Orleans. Shaw's name did not come up during our investigation

of the assassination. Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one

Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews.

We never located Bertrand and Andrews' acquaintance with Bertrand

highly doubted. We developed no information indicating Oswald knew

Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-

leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery Witness Perry Raymond

Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,

David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President

Kennedy. Russo identified Leon Oswald as identical to lee Harvey

Oswald.

Russo admitted receiving psychiatric treatment since 1959

and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory

to information he previously furnished to news media.

Russo appears

to be lying and during our

investigation of the assassination, we

developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo.

James C. Garrison is an egomaniac, is politically ambitious

and it appears his whole investigation was

triggered by his desire

for publicity.

The Director has instructed that we have no contact

with Garrison

or any member of his staff and that we stay meticulously

out of Garrison's inestigation.

It appears Garrison is looking for

an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director

has instructed that we should avoid such possibility

"like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major

target of the Communist Party. The communists' emphasis

on students in the recent past was best expressed by

the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated

"Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.

You've got to play the ball game where the players are and

the really good players are in college."

Today there is

considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses

throughout the Nation.

Subversive agitators constitute the

major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range

viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously

damaging to our national security. In light of this, the

FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,

whether they be on the

college campus or elsewhere, while

at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on

which our college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the

United States today are the communist-inspired W. I. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of

425 members, and the Students for a Democratic Society, with

approximately 5,000 members. The Students for a Democratic

Society has been described by Gus Hall as a new left group

which the Party has "going for us."

Today there is a concerted effort on the part of

student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government

agencies off the college campuses and to prevent such

agencies from carrying out their assigned duties. for

example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for

a Democratic Society members at Duke University, Durham,

North Carolina, alleged that the fBI in conducting investi-

gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom

by securing in oat ino esponse campus oin

and students.

While we have interviewed

officials and students

at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the

charges that the FBI was infringing on academic freedom are

baseless:

i Another

example involves allegations made by a

group of "liberal" faculty members at State University College,

Brockport, New York.

This group alleged that the FBI was

having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again

raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom.

These

charges

also were

baseless and without foundation.

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative

•of this Bureau

recently traveled to Uruguay

and participated

in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to

be provided for the President when he attends the Summit

Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta

Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/67. The same

Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a

White House group

• in the implementation of security measures

prior to the President's arrival. A general assessment of

the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that

adequate security can be provided to the President if he

restricts his travel to Punta Del Este:

If he travels to

Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of

a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting

its protests to the

President's visit.

The Communist Party

in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and

potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such as

light, gas, water, and street transportation.

Furthermore,

there is a good potential for committing sabotage and inciting

riots.

Under the present plan, the President will not

go

into Montevideo proper.

Security problems at Punta Del Este

are greatly minimized because the geographic location and

the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious

obstacles for instituting good security.

The police and

security services in Montevideo are not efficient by our

standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make

certain that the necessary security measures are carried

The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is

There is a new Government which is shaky and is

suffering economic problems. There have been a series of

strikes during the last several weeks.

We have been told

that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who

will attend the conference.

There may be some commotion

among them because of inadequate housing and communication

facilities. Newspaper reporters may also find it disappointing

to find any news of real significance at Punta Del Este if

there are no disturbing incidents.

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security

field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our

investigative responsibilities.

Their number varies and

as

of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation. In addition,

JEK Act 5

(9) (2) (0)

The

importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal

security field. cannot be overemphasized in view of the dangers

that exist in the internal security of the United States.

The

intelligence data obtained

from such .coverage makes it possible

to keep

appropriate officials of our Government currently

aware of the activities, plans, strategy, and tactics of

subversive organizations and individuals.

Also, information

gathered from

sources is of immediate interest to the

United States intelligence agencies and officials of the Govern-

ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field.

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,

mail covers, or trash covers in connection with our investiga-

tions.

We are utilizing security informants and confidential

sources to provide us necessary coverage.

Currently, we have

326 security informants who are members of the Communist Party

and some of these are operating

at the highest level. In view

of the valuable coverage these

informants provide us, we place

great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be

interesting to note that during 1965, 15 lof our security infor-

mants became members of the Communist Party and this was

increased to 30 informants becoming members of the Party in 1966.

In this connection, we noted that during those two years while

[45 informants became members of the Party, [391 discontinued

their association with the Party primarily due to personal

reasons, thus leaving us a total gain of[sixinformants in the

Party.

COUNTERESPIONAGE WORK AGAINST THE SOVIETS.

The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR)

and its intelligence organs constitute the major counter-

espionage problem confronting the FBI. The United States

is the major target against which the Soviet espionage

apparatus is directed. All information received from

sources in a position to know confirms this.

At this

time

529 Soviet officials with 643 dependents are in the

United States. Of these officials, 225 are known and

suspected Soviet intelligence officers.

There has been

a steady annual increase in Soviet intelligence officers

to this country.

We have achieved substantial success in pene

trating the Soviet espionage apparatus. We are currently

operating two Soviet intelligence oificers as defectors-

in-place (FEDORA and SHAMROCK) •

They are furnishing

detailed information on Soviet intelligence operations and

on Soviet policies pertaining to this country.

Another Soviet intelligence officer (TOPHAT) who

was successfully operated by us, and who subsequently went

home, was posted to a country in the Far East (Burma)•

Contact has been re-established with him and he continues

to furnish information on soviet moves and operations.

Three Soviet officials who were successfully

operated by us during their duty tour in the United States

are presently out of touch in the soviet Union (NICKNACK,

MITER, and KITTY HAWK). They constitute excellent potential

for future exploitation if their government subsequently

sends them on an assignment to another country:

CHINESE COMMUNIST INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES

Communist China today has no diplomatic establishment in

the United States and its major intelligence efforts directed

against this country emanate from two major sources, [the United Nations

and the New China News Agency office in Ottawa,, Canada.

We have identified two ethnic Chinese employees of the

United Nations Secretariat in New York as Chinese communist intelli-

gence agents. The first, Paul You, is a Senior Interpreter engaged

in collecting sensitive United Nations documents which are transmitted

to Communist China through an accommodation address in Switzerland.

FAN Chia-ching, also employed as Interpreter at United Nations, has

been in close contact with the Chinese Communist Consulate in

Geneva, Switzerland, and during recent months with a member of the

U.S. military who has a "Top Secret" clearance and is knowledgeable

in the field of ballistic missiles. FAN has been positively identified

as a Chinese communist intelligence agent.

Through our liaison with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,

we have learned that the Chinese communists are building a base in

Canada for intelligence operations directed against this country.

The New China News Agency (which is used as an arm of Chinese

intelligence) in mid 1966 sent an agent to New York City and

Washington, D. C., with the specific

assignment of establishing a

cover for a

resident illegal agent.

A Bureau informant who has been directed against the

Chinese communists since 1964 returned to the United States March 13,

1967, following a mission to mainland China in behalf of the FBI.

This informant had a series of conferences with Chinese communist

intelligence officials, has been recruited to operate in the

United States in behalf of the Chinese communists, and was furnished

a clandestine communications address in Canton, China. We,

of course, will use this informant to uncover other Chinese communist

illegal activities in this country.

In anticipation of Red China's admission to the United

Nations; we have greatly stepped up our efforts in the past two

years to build a solid base of quality informants to operate

against the Chinese communists.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

The Communist Party, USA, is operating in an

atmosphere of optimism as a result of the March 3, 1967,

decision of the United States Court of Appeals, Washington, D.C.,

which stated that the Party could not be forced to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

The feeling throughout the Party is that it has won its fight

for existence and now must move to capitalize on this victory

by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs

newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to

the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights

groups into a new political party which

would nominate a

candidate for President of the United States in 1968. Now,

the Communist Party is seriously considering running

its own

candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of

the United States in 1968.

May 1, 196%, is to mark the institution of a

massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of

the favorable Court decision and each Party district is being

instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive

now.

In addition, Party leaders have called for more infil-

tration by Party members into the trade union movement in

an attempt to regain the power the Party had in this movement

in the 1940's.

The Party believes that youth must be the central

concentration for its work in the future.

In order to have

the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits

quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth.

Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against

United States policy in Vietnam,

instituting resistance to

the military drait, and encouraging all types of demonstrations

by youth.

The Party also will start a movement to have Congress

pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for all youth.

"The Party considers recruiting of youth its most

important project in 1967. Current plans call for doubling

the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,

and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully

indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of

Marxism.

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES

INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM

Since United States aircraft attacked selected

targets in North Vietnam Tolloyang torpedo-boat assaults

against destroyers in the Gulf/ Tonkin in early August,

1964, there have been in the United States almost daily

demonstrations to protest United States intervention in

Vietnam. Many of these demonstrations have reached major

proportions.

The Communist Party and other subversive groups

such as the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America,

a communist-

inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers

Party, which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney

General, and its youth affiliate,

the Young Socialist Alliance;

the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its

youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the

Progressive Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist

group, have

actively supported and participated in demonstrations along

with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth

group which has been described by Gus Hall, General Secretary

of the Communist Party, USA, as a group which the Party has

"going for us."

Pacifist groups such as Women

Strike for

Peace, Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,

the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also taken a leading role in

sponsoring such demonstrations.

Summaries showing the

highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the

White House and other Government officials two or three times

a week.

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student

Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the

Communist Party and other subversive groups in their

membership, are sponsoring demonstrations

throughout the

United States April 8-15, 1967.

The focal point of the

week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at

New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15.

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee. Bevel is an official of the

Southern Christian Leadership

• Conference, a civil rights

group which is headed by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Student Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

at Berkeley and a member of the Communist Party, USA, National

Committee. An attempt is being made to have 500 individuals

burn their draft cards at New York City during the demonstration

on April 15, 1967, as a mass protest against the war and the

draft.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be

used in preventing communists from gaining control in that

country.

At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had

a staff of 14 Agents.

In August, 1966, at White House

instructions, we established

a permanent Legal Attache office

there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican

President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of

stability, however, there continues

to be strong undercurrents

of dissension. . The rightists reportedly have considered

plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, the

loser in the June, 1966,

election, has been most vocal in

its opposition to Balaguer's programs and only recently

published a document which appears intended to set the

stage for a

, vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. They possibly would be willing

to let Bosch's political

party provide the overt leadership.

made these admissions has testified at the grand jury; the other is not

and a pattern of long distance telephone calls between the suspects at

pertinent times.

Presentation to a Federal Grand Jury, Washington, D. C.,

commenced 3/10/67 but the grand jury is available to hear this case

only on Fridays. Additional witnesses are appearing 3/17/67 and it

is anticipated further testimony will be given the grand jury 3/24/67

and possibly 3/31/67.

Brandon Alvey, the trial attorney handling this case, has

described the Bureau's investigation as outstanding and said he has

never before seen so much good information gathered in such a short

time. Alvey states that if there was a statute making it a violation to

bomb diplomatic establishments in the United States, the evidence now

available would support a conspiracy conviction. There is no such

statute; however, the statute the Department considers most applicable

(Section 956, Title 18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States

to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be

proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation

would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent

discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. It is

unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession is obtained

from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop

the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the

grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony

from one or more prime suspects by offering immunity coupled with

a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is

enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional

evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian

establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously

pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by

continuing investigation.

ROBERT EARL BARNES

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTAION OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with

an extensive arrest.record who was the main witness at the

trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery

and conspiracy. Trial, which ended March 11, 1967, resulted

in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia police officers

and the acquittal of the other 2.

Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on

June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at

$120,000) from Mrs. Jóhn R. McLean, a guest at the

Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas

Island. The diamond ring

was

transported by

Barnes and an associate to New York City

where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented

to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of

Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial

of the police officers.

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S. Attorney Harold T.

Sullivan, who is handling this matter, advised that it was the

specific instruction of U.S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution

of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be

pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the

BOMBING DEATH OF

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967

CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-

ment's request concerning the death of Wharlest Jackson at Natchez,

Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as

he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Company in Natchez

shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967.

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company

since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he began training for a new

job as a cement mixer, a type of position previously held only by white

men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.

Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is

survived by his wite and five children. George Metcalf, a Negro fellow

employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement

of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with

Jackson, was seriously injured in a similar type explosion in 1965.

On the scene examination by Laboratory experts

indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion

of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver. Fragments of wire

recovered at the scene appear to be wire from an electric blasting

cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and

activated by the electric wiring system of the truck. Portionsof the

wires to the brake light, tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,

which were originally located on the inside of the left frame, are

missing as a result of the explosion. No additional physical evidence

has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene

supervision of Inspector Joseph A. Sullivan indicates that a group known

as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver

Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana

Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member

of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of

persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being

made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of

detonate the explosive.

CLIFFORD A. JONES

Clifford A. Jones, former Lieutenant Governor of .

as a result of his having testified talsely beiore the

Bobby Baker grand jury. This testimony concerned payments

Jones arranged through

one of his companies of $10,000 to

Baker through Wayne Bromley, a close associate oi Baker.

U. S. District Court Judge Gasch presently has taken under

advisement pretrial motions of Jones for continuance of

trial and change of venue.

On March 25, 1965, in response to request of

Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls

from

Bromley to Jones and Baker.

Bromley and his attorney had

asked that this be done.

Department held such nonitoring

would be legal.

On March 26, 1965, Department requested

we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and

Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles.

Purpose of meeting was

to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his

testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given.

Bureau

declined to monitor this meeting because of lack of security

of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure

of the coverage.

Department then got Bureau of Narcotics

to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request

regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones.

Such coverage

involved twenty conversations over four Las Vegas and one

Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential

and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones. This

coverage will be subject matter of future pretrial proceedings.

27-22, 19640

On October 2, 1964, a Federal Grand Jury indicted

18 persons for Civil Rights violations pertaining to these

murders. These indictments were dismissed October 7, 1966,

on legal grounds on the basis that certain

Negroes, were excluded from the grand jury panel.

This case

was re-presented to the Federal Grand Jury at Jackson,

Mississippi, and on February 27, 1967, indictments were

returned against 19 persons. They are presently free on

bond. No trial date has been set.

Of the 19 persons indicted, 1t are identical to those

previously indicted in this case. Jimmy Lee Townsend, who

was 17 years old at the time of the murders, was the one

who was previously indicted but not indicted at this time.

In addition to those previously indicted, this grand jury

indicted Ethel Glen "Hop" Barnett, former sheriff and present

candidate for sheriff of

Neshoba

County, Mississippi,

and Sam Holloway Bowers, JI., Imperial Wizard, White Knights

of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi.

The following law enforcement officers were among

those indicted: Lawrence Andrew Rainey, Sheriff of Neshoba

County; Cecil Ray Price, Deputy Sheriff, Neshoba County,

and Richard Andrew Willis, Patrolman, Philadelphia,

SHORTAGES OF U. S. DISTRICT JUDGES

AND

SHORTAGES IN THE U. S. ATTORNEYS' OFFICES

We have, on a number of occasions, instructed the

field to advise us of any shortage of U. S. Attorneys or Federal

Judges, which is attecting our prosecutions.

In this connection, since September 1, 1966, we have

written to the Department, pointing out a shortage of a Federal Judge

or a U. S. Attorney in the Southern District of Ohio, the Middle

District of Florida, the Eastern and Southern Districts of Illinois,

the Eastern District of Louisiana, the District of Puerto Rico, the

District of New Jersey, the Eastern District and Western District

of Wisconsin, the Middle District of Tennessee, the tastern and

Southern Districts of New York, the Eastern District of Michigan,

REQUEST OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,

INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jro,

Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary

crime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana. He asked

for intormation on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,

shoplifting and other such matters. By letter to the Attorney General

on March 16, 1967, we pointed out we no longer make such reports

and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study. This

is apparently a "fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and

Petersen's Task Force. We advised them they have reports in

gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where

recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force

Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal

investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are

inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-

pating in it. We have, however, advised the Department that if

matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,

we will handle such upon referral of these matters to us. We have

also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel

in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in

operation in that area.

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police

official that the FBI was participating in a "buy back" of United States

Postal Money Orders and we directed a letter to the Attorney General

on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the

Canadian authorities on our participation.

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary

Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping

were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United

States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to

legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a

letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation

proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and

use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-

tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would

be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and

would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being

followed in connection with use of such devices in national security

matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining

La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves,

and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-

tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa

Nostra sources of income.

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior

microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals

courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such

cases which were actually brought to trial. In several cases, notably,

Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washington,

D. C. ; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles

Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,

Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each

instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our

position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in

the Schipani case in New York, the Supreme Court has remanded for

retrial and these are still under consideration.

GAMBLING CASES

In our gambling cases, we have already recorded a total

of 78 convictions thus far this fiscal year, which represents 30 more

convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we have in

excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial

for violations of these statutes. As a result of our dissemination

policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed

telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by

virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities.

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823

items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase

of 50, 000 items over this same period last year.

SENATOR THOMAS J. DODD

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

ELECTION LAWS

In early 1966 we conducted detailed investigations

concerning six items of possible irregularities (Conflict

of Interest) on the part of Senator Dodd. These investi-

gations were conducted at the specific request of the

Department following its

revier of voluminous documents

made available by columnist Jack Anderson (Drew Pearson's

leg man). These matters have been under consideration

by the Department since May of 1966

when our investigations

were completed.

Today (3/16/67) we received a letter from

Assistant Attorney General Vinson requesting investigation

concerning possible election laws violations based on

testimony given before the Senate Select Committee on

Standards and Conduct which is now holding hearings con-

cerning Senator Dodd. Vinson's letter is being analyzed

and appropriate recommendations will be submitted..

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY

LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins

Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement

officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from

5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and

Thailand). (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the

graduating class of the 75th Session of the National Academy on

May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General.)

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum

to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National

Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement

Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance

in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI

National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence

on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that

indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act. The Director pointed out that while

we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this

Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the

allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act.

It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,

that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus

the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates

it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-

sistence aid.

It was estimated that approximately $80, 000 for

subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and

that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting

Attorney General approved this concept; the Director stated a

request for a grant would be submitted on proper documents to

the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

## Page 635

We have never received a reply to this memorandum

even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct

of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance

of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the

FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the

man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted

a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do

not submit applications to the National Academy because they

do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers.

while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the

most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year

1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies

in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163, 302 people. Over 1200 Special

Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they

contributed 45, 383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police

training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,

special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,

search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal

interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and .

preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and

police-community relations.

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the

Attorney General for the building of a new FBI Academy on the

Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was

immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.

The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead

of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI

National Academy. we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law

enforcement officers in specialized courses. The Congress has •

appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in

progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction

of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 1967. It

is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during

fiscal year 1969.

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive

Assignment System for filling positions in Grades 16, 17, and

• 18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded.

The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-

grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of

employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through

18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill

vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this

inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI. This

would make our executives available for consideration by other

agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider

employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The

Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,

1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-

ing exclusion of FBI executives from the proposea inventory as

retention by the FBI of its executives is considered essential. We

have been following with the Department but the matter has not yet

been acted upon by the Attorney General.

LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 8, 1967

wash all sitte

SYNOPSIS:

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation

for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion

at luncheon include:

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning

FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he

had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to

meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter

of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised

FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use

surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic

intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time

to bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the

AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests.

Regarding above, Mr. DeLoach noted it would be premature to

talk with Rostow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they

could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially

obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67--

the subject of which probably was electronic surveillances.

EX. ION REG 62-90285714I

FBI has 31 telephone surveillances in FBI cases:

JFK Act 5(9) (9)121(D)

(2) On 7-19-67, the House passed H.R. 441, Which provides regeran

penalties for interstate travel with intent to incite a riot. Many persons question

its practical and legal usefulness due to difficulty in proving intent Qur sources

on the Hill indicate there is a hope the bill may be bottled up in committee --but**

that it will pass the Senate if it reaches the floor. We took no stand on the bill

with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

Listrite developed. The bill could increase our investigative responsibilities

substantially.

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(3) On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and .

Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act'} -but with considerable changes. One amend-

ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police

training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter

has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.

Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine

their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and

add this to H.R. 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized

crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individuals in

this field were awaiting Federal prosecution. By letter of i-2-61, we called the

AG's attention to a Situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling.

law violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action. To date, no

freply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,

former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well

as their political affiliations, and the need for electronic surveillances to cope

with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying

him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons

as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime

Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section Of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker

Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs

Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's

activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys

and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over"

¡entire investigation. "Task force" was so inept that it "blew" the case against

Reinhart, and "task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and

associates. Although Reinhart's gambling activities were across state lines from

New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were

brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force"

be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

M. A. Jones To Bishop Memo

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month (July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions

decreased 189, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage ot

judges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)

policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal

prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent

letter Instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age

21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates

about 65 percent of violators are under 21 and where FBI convictions

decreased 109 in July. 1967, compared with July, 1966. For sometime,

we have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages

in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist.

For information in connection with the Director's luncheon

The Coordinator of

U. S. Attorneys,

John W. Kern, III, stopped DeLoach in the

Attorney General's Office on 'he morning of 9/7/67 and posed two

questions: (1) Should u. S. Attorneys attend meetings of Federal

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the

Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this

memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of

interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special

Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient

information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. De Loach regarding

the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He

said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the

White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security

Agency (NSA) regarding this matter.

The Attorney General said Clifford and

Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that

the FBI had so little such coverage. He said that Clifford and Rostow, without

saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances,

it might

be a good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea. He

said it would take a little time to bring Clifford and Rostow around but that he

believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions

and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in

approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted

that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but

after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on

a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations.' It was also noted that it

did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his

discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard

Helms, Director of the CIA, had a meeting scheduled with the Attorney General

at 5 p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 196%, and that the subject of the

meeting was probably electronic surveillances.

INTERSTATE TRAVEL TO INCITE RIOTS:

7 Genitne fougs intelege operations

JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for

Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite

a riot. Its practical and legal usefulness has heen mestioned by a number of

people, including many Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining

evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the

Bill could be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it

more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without

difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it

politically unwise to vote against it.

We took no stand on the Bill with the

Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes

and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,

could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of

course, on the policy established by the Department.

H. R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE

ACT OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by

Republican-sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on

8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R. -I.)

which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to

engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive

police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local

and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on

the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and

stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill

sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D. -Ark.) and Senator Roman

Hruska (R. -Neb. ) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of

wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H. R. 5037 in Committee.

They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will

have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME :

As of September 7, 1967, there were a total of 382 individuals,

involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,

or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of

various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention

of the Attorney General a situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York

for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive

action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive

action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals

would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime

field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney

General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of

achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in

organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already

awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily

available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the

earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

"Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on

La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith, former crime

reporter for the "Chicago Tribune "* Smith has done an excellent job in these

articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as

their political affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order

to cope with the menace of organized crime.

Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a

wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.

He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence

agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained

considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre

Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

*and "Chicago Sun-Times.".

connection with this article. He also has used the information disclosed

Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime

and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force" was organized

as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to

which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative

agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force" conducted

investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,

New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be

making trips dally to Nagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts

and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New

York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of

Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service

to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling

statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"

representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and

immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police

Department, attorneys and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the

police department and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch of our Buffalo Office has since determined

from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs

Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the

case against Reinhart was "blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force

utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that

they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were

watching: that people were inside the truck.) Surveillances conducted by the

"task force, " including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by

Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the

border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

• Although Reinhart's gambling activities were being carried on

between Canada and the United States, that is across state lines, in apparent

violation of the Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Statute, the

FBI Office at Buffalo was not notified. The FBI has a substantial investigative

responsibility in the investigation of violations of this statute. In this

instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local

Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative

responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to

the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,

with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force"

personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to

our Buffalo Office.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-

victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal year.

This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two

factors: (1) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-

crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal

Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating

to juvenile offenders.

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction

statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by

Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give

primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to

local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of

U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately

65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we

recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month

in the previous fiscal year.

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising

the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys

or their assistants exist.

For example, we recently sent the following letters

to the Attorney General bring to his attention shortages of judges or U. S.

Attorneys in the indicated areas:

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;

8-16-67, Eastern District of Michigan;

8-7-67; District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;

7-31-67, Western District of New York.

M. A. Jones to Bishop

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of

New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on

3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment

has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity

has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District

of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's

attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information

indicating these judgeships have been filled.

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently

advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue

to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the

Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in

the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,

there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121

defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-

cution for more than six months.

It is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of

July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-

cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office

has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874

subjects.

The following data concerning the antipoverty workers'

involvement in racial disturbances has been prepared for the

Director's information and possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference which will include the Attorney General and

: Mr. Shriver of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO).

ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLVEMENT OF ANTIPOVERTY EMPLOYEES

There have been a number of allegations regarding the

9

involvement of antipoverty employees in racial disturbances and

involving the misuse of antipoverty funds in connection therewith.

Allegations with respect to the misuse of these funds are

exceptionally difficult to substantiate because the funds provided

to local antipovertyagencies by 0EO or other Federal agencies area

usually furnished on a grant basis with the grants becoming the

property of the local group at which time the Federal character

Lof the funds is lost.

.

However, there have been instances wherein certain

officials and employees of local agencies receiving Federal anti-

poverty grants have reportedly not conducted themselves in a

manner conducive to law and order.

Examples follow.

New York City

NEG-S / 2.

"The largest privately-operated antipoverty program

receiving Federal funds issaid to be Haryou - Act in the Harlem

area of New York City. Several of its employees are known 'to have

subversive backgrounds or to have engaged in improper activities.

Action Movement, a clandestine all-Negro revolutionary group

that calls for the overthrow of the U. S. Government by violence

and which is procommunist Chinese-oriented, were suspended as

employees of Haryou - Act following their arrest last June along

with a number of members of the Jamaica Rifle and Pistol Club,

a Revolutionary Action Movement front group, on charges including

conspiracy to advocate anarchy. Another member of this rifle

club who was arrested, Arthur Harris, was also suspended as an

employee of an antipoverty organization in Jamaica, New York City,

which is funded by OEO.

Newark, New Jersey

In Newark, antipoverty funds were reputedly utilized

by the United Community Corporation to rent two station wagons

used to transport people who had been encouraged to appear at

meetings at the city hall to protest action of a city planning

board. Reportedly, one of the vehicles was equiped with a loud-

speaker and was used to make inflammatory remarks regarding the

incumbent city administration. Also, it is reported that

inflammatory posters prepared by the United Community Corporation

had been circulated.

Syracuse, New York

Employees of the Crusade for Opportunity, an antipoverty

agency funded by ObO, are alleged to have been involved in the

racial disturbances which occurred in Syracuse, New York,

8/16-18/67. An officer of the Syracuse Police Department advised

that a Crusade for Opportunity automobile bearing U. S. Government

license plates was used by two Negro males and two Negro females

to cruise through Negro neighborhoods in Syracuse on 8/15/67.

They utilized a loudspeaker to advertise a meeting on 8/16/67

regarding the alleged rape of an 11-year-old Negro girl by a

white man.

A field worker of this organization, Leroy. Glenn Wright,

was arrested during the first night's disturbance ön 8/16/67 and

charged with inciting to riot and résisting arrest.

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

Washington, D. C.

Individuals affiliated with two organizations funded

in part by OEO were involved in the disturbance which occurred

in the House of Representatives on 8/7/67 in protest of the

shelving of the so-called "Rat Bill." The leader, Jesse Gray,

a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black

nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-

porated, which was the recipient of DEO funds.

Such funds have

since been suspended. Gray and at least one other member of the

above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance.

Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey

Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)

Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67

that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special

Training in Reading" for children 8 to 10 years of age contained

numerous hate slogans.

Examples of the signs noted thereon were

"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution

not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing

sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and

Harlem, '64." There was also a picture of President Johnson's

face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned

"Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder."

The committee

l'handling this particular

program was funded

in part by OEO.

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,

Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has

been in operation teaching 10 and 11-year-olds. Antipoverty

funds from OEO had been earmarked for the school; however, the

funds were withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning

this matter. Meantime, however, certain services including the

(rental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky

authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the

Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph I. Mulloy, an

employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state

sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press

a report prepared by an 0EO investigator which contained state-

ments attributed to the FBI. An article concerning this matter

appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous

protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing

in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening

Star." In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they

can't or won't give us the necessary assurances

against leaks,

we will cut off all investigative services to OEO."

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with

Mr. Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised

that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur

in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's

attention of outright seditious statements on the part of anti-

poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

against established law and order and of statements tending to

incite the people. Examples follow:

Marion S. Barry, Jr., former Washington Director of

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United

Planning Organization, Washington, D. C., as a $50-a-day consultant

on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OE0. On 6/30/67 Barry

reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th

Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he

¡denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained

properly in how to deal with Negroes.

Captain Al Prezio of the

Iroy, New York, Police Department, advised on 8/25/67 that

Freeman Robinson, an employee of an antipoverty organization

funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization

as a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to

recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community

on any issue that would create racial unrest.

Willie Wright, a duly-elected board member of the

United Community Corporation, Newark, New

Jersey, is alleged

to have made statements concerning Negro rioting such as "To

hell with President Johnson when he says something about not

tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more

than 400 years."

He is also quoted as having said: "It is my

firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete

human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,

we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions

that are being perpetrated against us by the white man.

I most

emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers

and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions

to protect themselves against the most brutal atrocities to be

seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the

Newark and State Police in the recent rebellion in the City of

Newark." The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its

investigation of statements attributed towright.

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 contained an article

by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs

Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide

survey conducted by 0EO in 64 cities, half of which had riots

this summer. In citing OEO figures he pointed out that of 30,000

Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course

of the riots and none were convicted. Poverty programs had 244

buildings in the hearts of the riot areas with none being burned

or destroyed.

)

My memorandum of 9/14/67 set forth for the Director's

information data concerning antipoverty workers' involvement in

racial disturbances for his possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference mentioned above.

The following additional information received from the

Dallas Office today is being submitted for the Director's

consideration in connection with this luncheon.'

In response to a request from Mr. Randolf Ratliff,

Director of the Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty in

Dallas, Texas, a representative of this Bureau explained the

FBI's jurisdiction in racial matters to members of Ratliff's

staff, who work in the poverty areas in Dallas County Texas, on '':

9/6/67. The Neighborhood Organization War on Poverty is funded

by the Office of Economic Opportunity.

UNRECORDED COFY FILLD

On 9/13/67 one of Ratliff's staff workers confidentially

advised that after our representative had left the above meeting,

Ratliff instructed his staff members to give the FBI no informa-

tion and said that the FBI'is the white man's police and they

want nothing but "stool pigeons."

This individual further

alleged that all of Ratliff's 44 staff members were hand-picked

by Ratliff and that most of them are racial agitators. He

Charged that Ratliff and most of the staff members are working

at creating racial incidents in order to stir up local Negro

communities. He further alleged that Ratliff is the driving

force behind a program of racial agitation in Dallas County

and that his statements to staff members are antiwhite and

antipolice. He said it is his belief that Ratliff is trying

to create a crisis in Dallas in order to receive additional

antipoverty funds.

The source of the above information also alleged

that in April of this year Ratliff was vigorously critical of

the Dallas Police Department regarding the arrest of a 15-year-

old Negro female on a charge of disturbing the peace and was in

the process of organizing a march on city hall to protest the

arrest when officials of the Office of Economic Opportunity

learned of his activity and told him to desist.

He stated that

in another instance several months ago, Albert Lipscomb (phonetic),

staff member, learned of a plot by a group of Negro men who were

in possession of rifles and Molotov cocktails to initiate a riot.

He claimed that Lipscomb personally prevented the riot by calming

the Negro group and personally collecting the rifles and Molotov

cocktails but that when Ratliff learned of Lipscomb's role in

preventing the riot, he officially took credit for the action.

Our source stated that Ratliff unofficially considers Lipscomb

an "Uncle Tom."

The above information is being made available to

Mrs. Stegall at the White House, Mr. Shriver of the Office of

Economic Opportunity, and the Attorney General by letters dated

9/18/67.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) Since the Bureau

of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) was formed under the

jurisdiction of the Department, the FBI has been conducting back-

ground investigations on its applicants and employees. This was

done pursuant to Departmental Order #175-59, dated 4-1-59.

However, the BNDD was discovered to be conducting some dupli-

cate investigation of their clerical applicants. We objected to this

wasted effort and expressed our views to the Department which

countered with a proposal advanced by Associate BNDD Director

Giordano, that we share parts of these investigations with them.

By letter of 2-6-69, in reply to this proposal, we informed the

Department that no additional requests for BNDD applicant investiga-

tions would be accepted, except those submitted under the

provisions of the Federal Employee Security Program.

Martin Edward Underwood Underwood, an employee of the

Department of Commerce, who was detailed to the White House in

1966 to serve as an advance man for former President Johnson,

was removed from his office at the White House on 2-6-69, and the

Department of Commerce has been instructed to inform him that

his services are no longer required. Our investigation of Underwooa,

which was furnished

I the White House on 2-12-69, disclose that he

had severe drinking problem until at least 1964.

Virginia Stanfill Savell We conducted a discreet inquiry of Savell

in September, 1966, at the request of former Senator Kuchel (R)

of Califernia, for whom she then worked in his Los Angeles office.

It had been alleged she was operating a bookie joint out of the

Senator's office but our inquiry developed no information to sub-

stantiate this. However, it was reported that she was an alcoholic.

Current investigation revealed Savel attempted to commit suicide

in July, 1967, by overdose of sleeping pills.

Donald Edward Ganoung We have investigated Ganoung as a

Departmental applicant for the position of consultant with the Law

Enforcement Administration at Washington, D. C., the position

he now holds. He has a degree in criminology and is a former

Episcopalian priest who has worked among deviate elements. He

has also been active in civil rights and antidraft demonstrations

and twice was arrested in this connection. Divorced by his wife

in 1967 after he had an affair with another woman, Ganoung also

JFK Law 11(a)

The results of our investigation of him

were furnished to the Attorney General on 2/11/69.

William Henry Rentschler Rentschler, a candy company operator,

has been extremely active in Illinois Republican Party politics. He

carried on a notorious adulterous relationship which led to a divorce

from a former wife. Our investigation of him revealed many

prominent persons who would not recommend Rentschler for a

position with the Government in view of his moral weaknesses and

reported lack of business acumen. Our investigation not yet com-

plete but summary memo furnished the White House on 2/10/69.

Special Inquiry Investigations for the White House Security officers

of various Government agencies have expressed shock at the lack

of knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the Federal

Employee Security Program by the White House staff responsible

for filling top-level positions with the new Administration. Most

requests for investigation have been of persons already firmly estab-

lished in their new jobs. When derogatory data is developed it is

simply requested that the investigation be continued. Only one person

is known to have been discharged as a result of derogatory information

developed during investigation. Don Virdin, Internal Revenue Service

(IRS), called Bureau 2/13/69 and indicated Bureau had checked through

IRS only o of last 25 publicly announced Presidential appointees.

Bureau has run checks of IRS on all requests received from White

House on Presidential appointees and it would appear White House

only asked for 8 of last 25 to be checked.

Selective Service

These cases in recent years have broadened in

scope with recurring schemes to obstruct the draft. We have 14, 000

pending investigations, up 5, 000 from a year ago. Fiscal year 1968

produced 809 convictions and the first seven months of this fiscal

period have recorded 380 convictions, an increase over this period

a year ago. An interesting case is summarized which involves an

18-year-old Californian whose mother, following his arraignment

for failure to register for the draft, attempted to get a Restraining

Order by contending that she was responsible for her son's actions

e

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 669

## Page 670

and therefore should be punished rather than him. The Juage

rejected her appeal and her son's trial is scheduled for March,

1969.

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime While our

organized crime investigations are aimed at key members in the

power structure, they have also struck hard in the lower echelons

with progressively greater penetration into the heart of hoodlum

activities - gambling operations. Fiscal year 1968 capped four

consecutive record years in convictions of organized crime figures

with 281. There are now 789 other hoodlum figures awaiting trial

in Federal court thus indicating a continuance of the upward trend

in convictions in fiscal year 1969. Recent major accomplishments

in the organized crime field include the arrest or conviction at

many top La Cosa Nostra leaders across the country. Our dissem-

ination of criminal intelligence data to other Federal and local law

enforcement agencies has broken the million mark in number of

items in the past five years. This shared FBI data enabled other

law enforcement agencies to conduct hundreds of raids, execute

thousands of arrests, and recover millions of dollars in gambling

funds or stolen property each year.

Department Task Force

Operations (also called Strike Force) have been formed in Detroit,

Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;

Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey; since

the original group at Buffalo, New York. We now maintain liaison

with these Task Force groups and it has been recommended that

we expand our liaison arrangements with Task Force. There have

been La Cosa Nostra leadership changes in New York and Chicago.

surveillance coverage under court supervision for the purpose of

obtaining admissible evidence against the leadership of organized

crime and in other major investigative categories. Included would

be requirements for review of an application for a court order at a

number of levels within the Department, and by the Attorney General,

before the application reached the judge, involving delay and the

spreading of information about our use of this technique among a

comparatively wide range of authorities. Included in our views

was our belief that for the Government's ultimate success in making

use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions must not apply

which will create more limitations on law enforcement than the statute

itself prescribes.

BUREAU STATISTICS

FBI Personnel

As of 2/13/69 there were 6, 929 Special Agents and

9,052 clerical employees for a total of 15, 981 employees on the

rolls of the FBI.

Overtime Services

The overtime service by our investigative staff

averages more than two and one-half hours each workday and

during the fiscal year 1968 totaled 3, 845, 461 hours, the equiva-

lent of 1, 849 additional employees on a full-year basis. Taking

into consideration the limited extent to which this overtime was

compensated under fringe benefits regulations of the Civil Service

Commission, there was a cost-free saving to the Government of

over $14 million when compared to the value of the total overtime

performed. This is a tremendous voluntary contribution by our

investigative stati.

National Crime

While preliminary crime figures for calendar year

1968 are not yet available, for the period January through

September, 1968, over the same period in 1967, the Crime Index

nationwide recorded a 19 percent increase. The largest increases

were noted in cities 250, 000 to 1 million population where a 22

percent rise was recorded. Nationally, the violent crimes of

murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault as a group

increased 21 percent and the more voluminous property crimes of

burglary, larceny $50 and over and auto theft rose 19 percent. There

were an estimated 4. 6 million serious crimes in the United States

in 1968 compared to 3. 8 million in 1967.

District of Columbia Crime

For calendar year 1967, Washington, D. C., had the

sixth highest crime rate among the 56 cities 250, 000 population and

above. Crime figures for calendar year 1968 indicate that

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 672

Washington, D. C., recorded an over-all gain of 25 percent in the

number of serious offenses.

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

NCIC is a nationwide index of documented law

enforcement information on crime and criminals. Its objective

is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement through the

more efficient handling and exchange of information. In January,

1967, a pilot operation was begun with terminals in 15 local and

state law enforcement agencies. NCIC now has 78 control termi-

nals in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. North

Carolina and Wyoming will be added in the near future; however,

Alaska will be delayed due to very high communication circuit

costs. The files consist of stolen motor vehicles, license plates,

firearms, other identifiable stolen property including securities,

and wanted persons. Over 780, 000 records are in the system and

more than 33, 000 messages are handled each day. Positive

responses to inquiries wherein a record is furnished now exceed

220 each 24 hours. NCIC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a

week.

Racial Unrest on College Campuses

Campuses throughout the United States have been

marked by racial unrest as exemplified by the current disrup-

tions at san francisco state College, San Francisco, California;

and the University of California, Berkeley, California. Such

groups as the Third World Liberation Front, a coalition of

minority groups,

and the Black Student Union are becoming

increasingly militant and violence prone in presenting their

demands to college authorities.

Demands made by such groups

include the establishment of a separate college for minority

groups, particularly Negroes; the establishment of black

courses; the hiring of minority group professors and adminis-

trators; and the control of hiring and firing of faculty mem-

bers by, students.

At San Francisco State College over 400

individuals have been arrested during a current wave of dis-

ruption and attempts are being made to force the College to

close.

Students for a Democratic Society and other militant

groups have joined in

these demonstrations and offer full

support to minority groups.

Black Panther Party

The Black Panther Party is the most active,

notorious, violence-prone black extremist organization. In

the past nine months it has established branches in 25 cities

across the country with a hard-core membership of at least 1,200.

The latest development is the order from national

headquarters to stop recruiting for a time in order to weed

out informants and undesirables and concentrate on political

indoctrination based on the writings of MAO Tse-tung of Com-

munist China. There is also increasing discussion of the

necessity for going underground.

The Black Panther Party Minister of Education

reorge Mason murray, a suspended instructor at san Francisco

State College, holds a position on the Central Committee o1

the Black Student Union at that College. The Black Student

Union instigated the campus unrest which has plagued this

institution during the current school year.

target of the soviet Union and its European satellites

(bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Romania).

The Intelligence operations of these satellites are coordinated

This represents since February, 1959, a 210%

Increase in Soviet intelligence personnel and a 100% increase

in satellite intelligence personnel.

and

the Soviet Union became effective July 13, 1968.

This

would grant diplomatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction

The FBI currently has under investigation Dr. Zalman

Mordecat Shapiro, head of Nuclear Materials and Equipment

Corporation (NUMEC), Apollo, Pennsylvania. NUMEC processes

uranium-235 for nuclear reactors and has Atomic Erergy

Commission (AEC) contracts. Shapiro has an AEC-approved

clearance which entitles him to access to "Top Secret"

atomic energy information.

During May, 1968, we instituted investigation of

Shapiro following a request made by the Central Intelligence

Agency of the Attorney General.

vur purpose was to ascertain

his connections with Israeli officials and, in particular,

whether he is in contact with Israeli intelligence agents

in

this country: He learned that Shapiro actually is in contact

with at least one Israeli intelligence agent assigned to the

Israeli Embassy, Washington, D. C., as well as with one senior

official of Israeli military intelligence; with individuals

associated with the Israeli Atomic Energy Commission; and

with a number of United States citizens sympathetic towards

Israel. We have definitely shown Shapiro's loyalty toward

Israel

and, in fact, he has considered whether to move to

• to assist Israel. Shapiro has commented

that he will fight, for Israel and frequently travels there

and meets with Israell Atomic Energy Commission officials

as well as

with/other Israeli Government leaders.

will be completed in the very near future, lat which time we

•Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy

The essence of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans

Lies in the connection New Orleans District Attorney James C.

Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee harvey Oswald,

David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw.

The principal

witness has been Perry Russo who has said Oswald, Ferrie,

and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at a

meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September,

1963.

Immediately following the assassination of President

Kennedy, the FBI received allegations of a connection between

Ferrie and Oswald.

These allegations were thoroughly and

exhaustively investigated.

No evidence was ever developed

that Oswald and ferrie were acquainted.

Clay Shaw's name

never came up in the investigation and

the FBI never

investigated him.

The FBI has held to a "hands-off" policy regarding

Garrison's investigation.

Although we are closely following

Shaw's trial, we have no observers in the courtroom. It is

noted that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice

has an unofficial observer in the courtroom.

Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He

received a medical aischarge in october, 150t, Irom the u. s.

Army for an emotional problem.

He admitted to Army authorities

that he had received psychiatric treatment. Garrison was a

Special Agent of the FBI for four months, resigning to

re-enter military service in July, 1951.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE

REDUCTION OF CRIME IN

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

In connection with the juvenile problem in the District of

Columbia, it is suggested that an Enabling Statute be passed which

would allow juveniles to be handled in the District of Columbia as they

are throughout the United States; publicize the names of the juveniles

involved in serious crimes and maintain and make available juvenile

records to law enforcement agencies. In areas of high crime,

improved street lighting should be installed..

Mandatory sentences are recommended for crimes

committed with the use of firearms or involving threats, and a

habitual criminal statute might be effective. Consideration could be

given to the registration of all convicted felons in the District, as

well as a law requiring registration of firearms.

Authorities responsible for allowing prisoners to be

released under the "Work Release Program" should thorcughly

consider their prior records so that vicious felons will not be returned

to the streets. In addition, prosecutors should not accept guilty pleas

on one count while dismissing other counts; and abolition of capital

punishment should be opposed until a life sentence means "life."

As a deterrent to bank robberies, District banks should

on a voluntary basis accelerate the implementation of the provisions

of the Bank Protection Act of 1968, and consideration should be given

to the deployment of one police officer and a bank guard to selected

institutions.

More stringent penalties should be invoked for violations

of gambling laws, and sentences should be made stiffer for second

offenders.

ASSASSINATION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

The entire

facilities of the FBI were committed

to the investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther

King, JI., in Memphis, Tennessée, on 4-4-68, and within

Iive days the man then known as Eric S. Galt was developed

as a prime suspect.

From a check of latent fingerprints

against those of white male fugitives for whom "wanted"

notices had been placed in the files of the FBI Identification

Division, James Earl Ray was determined to be the true

identity

of Eric S. Galt.

At the request of the FBI

Canadian

authorities determined that a Canadian passport had been

issued to Ray in the name of Ramon George Sneyd, and on

June 8, 1968, Ray was arrested by Scotland Yard

when he

presented the Sneyd passport to travel from London to

Brussels. At the conclusion of extradition proceedings,

Ray was returned to the United States in custody of FBI Agents

and was turned over to local authorities in Memphis, Tennessee,

for state prosecution. Local trial is scheduled for April 7,

1969.

GARY STEVEN KRIST;

RUTH EISEMANN-SCHIER;

BARBARA JANE MACKLE - VICTIM

KIDNAPING

On December 17, 1968, 20-year-old Barbara Jane Mackle

was abducted from an Atlanta, Georgia, area motel. A $500, 000

ransom demand was subsequently made of her father, Robert Mackie,

a Coral Gables, Florida, resident and business official. FBI

investigation resulted in the safe return of Miss Mackle, who had

been buried in a coffin-like box northeast of Atlanta, Georgia; the

recovery of most of the ransom money; and the apprehension of one

of the subjects, identified as Gary Steven Krist. An all-out investi-

gation continues to locate Ruth Eisemann-Schier, the other subject

in this case. Federal charges were filed in Miami, Florida, against

subjects for violation of Extortion Statute, Interstate Transportation

in Aid of Racketeering Statute, and the Aiding and Abetting Statute.

The subjects were indicted in DeKalb County, Georgia, for kidnaping

on January 13, 1969. The Bureau has furnished results of its

investigations to local authorities and is cooperating in the state

trial which will be held in this matter. Krist was brought before the

circuit court in DeKalb County, Georgia, on February 7, 1969, at

which time the court appointed two attorneys to represent him. One

of the attorneys is James R. Venable, who has been for many years

Imperial Wizard for the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.

A three-week delay was requested by the attorneys, and the judge set

the next appearance for February 28, 1969.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

DISCONTINUANCE OF BACKGROUND

INVESTIGATIONS ON CLERICAL

APPLICANTS FOR THE BUREAU OF

NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

(BNDD)

The Bureau has been conducting background

investigations on applicants and employees of the BNDD

since that agency came under the jurisdiction of the

Department.

These investigations were .conducted pursuant

to Departmental Order #175-59 dated April 1, 1959.

Our Chicago Division learned that BNDD had been

conducting preemployment checks to include credit and

criminal investigation, interviews with former employers,

supervisors, and references.

On January 21, 1969, both

Assistant Attorney General for Administration Pellerzi

and Associate Director Giordano, BNDD, agreed with the

Bureau's position that conducting duplicate investigations

of clerical applicants for BNDD was a waste of time and

money; however, on February 4, 1969, Mr. Giordano reversed

his position and stated he wanted to run credit and

criminal checks and contact the last two employers to

see if they had any further interest in the clerical applicant.

The Bureau would then be asked to complete the investigation.

Mr. Giordano was told that BNDD should do their own clerical

applicant investigations entirely or the FBI should do

them entirely.

The Director noted that he wanted no part

of divided responsibility and this position was confirmed

in our letter to Mr. Pellerzi dated February 6, 1969,

copy attached. This letter advised that effective

immediately we would not accept any additional requests for

investigations of clerical applicants and that, if during

the course of investigations of these people by BNDD,

they should find subversive derogatory information,

then

the case should be referred to the Bureau for a full field

investigation under the provisions of the Federal Employee

Security Program.

Since February 6, 1969; we have not accepted

any requests for investigation of clerical people for BNDD.

MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD

Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of

years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he

has been employed by the United States Government, for the

greater period by the Department of Commerce, and

the Small

Business Administration.

He was detailed to

the White House

in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of

former President Johnson.

We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the

White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking

problem prior to the investigation and was considered an

alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces,

Several

people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recom-

Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in

1964.

After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued

to hold an office on the first floor of the Executive Office

Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew:

On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office

and his White

House

pass has been taken. The White House

has been in contact with the Department of Commerce, on whose

payroll Underwood has been while working at the White House,

and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood

his services are no longer required.

Persons intervieved during our current investigation

state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no

longer has the drinking problem. Results of current investigation

were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969.

Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled.

VIRGINIA STANFILL SAVELL

She was employed by former United States

Senator

Thomas H. Kuchel of California in his Los Angeles, California,

office from August, 1961, to September, 1968.

She is pres-

ently an assistant to Herbert G. Klein at the White House.

In September, 1966, at the request of

Senator Kuchel, a very discreet inquiry was conducted

into an allegation Senator Kuchel had received that

Mrs. Savell was possibly operating a bookie joint out

of the Senator's Los Angeles, California, office. The

inquiry developed no information to substantiate

the

allegation.

The investigation did develop information

that Mrs. Savell reportedly was an alcoholic.

The current investigation to date has ascertained

that the South Pasadena, California, Police Department

records indicate Mrs. Savell attempted suicide on July 23,

1967. She reportedly took an overdose of sleeping capsules.

Ganoung, aged 43, has B.A. degree in criminology

and Bachelor of Divinity degree.

He is former Episcopalian

priest and has been active in attempting to rehabilitate

sexual deviates and narcotics addicts in San Francisco;

however, no one questioned his character in these connections.

He is presently working as a consultant for the Law Enforce-

ment Assistance Administration with duty. station in

Washington, D. C.

Ganoung has also been active in civil rights and

antidraft demonstrations and twice was arrested in this

connection.

He has worked with dissident groups and has

grown a beard and worn beads in this connection. As a

result of running around with another woman, his wife

divorced him in 1967.

The expenses of this

affair,

including alimony, forced him to file bankruptcy.

A number

of police ofticers in san Francisco area acquainted with

Ganoung would not recommend him.

Ganoung is a protege. of lesley A. Pomeroy, Asso-

ciate Administrator, Law Enforcement Assistance Administration.

Pomeroy has been regarded as immature and insincere by former

police acquaintances.

The results of our investigation of Ganoung were

called to the attention of the Attorney General and the

Deputy Attorney General by letter dated February 11, 1969.

WILLIAM HENRY RENTSCHLER

William Henry Rentschler, aged 43, former news-

paper reporter, has been co-owner and/or President of a

candy company since 1956. He has been extremely active in

Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several

years: He was involved in adulterous relationship with a

woman other than his wife for approximately three years and

later married that woman.

This was a well known fact by

those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement

in notorious divorce action presents serious question of

his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator

Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told

him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass

the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the

investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an

intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of

politics.

Several persons pointed out he lacks business

ability,

fails to follow through on details and does not have

a feeling for finances.

Some individuals did not recommend

him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser-

vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum

containing the results of investigation to date was furnished

to the White House on February 10, 1969. Outstanding investi-

gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H.

Stans, Secre-

tary of Commerce, and several other individuals who have

been unavailable

for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter-

viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un-

favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial

irresponsibility and his moral life. Additional investigation

is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary stans.

SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

Conscientious security officers in various

governmental agencies, many of whom are former Special

Agents of the Bureau, have been shocked at the lack of

knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the

Federal Employee. Security Program by the eight or nive

individuals at the White House responsible for filling

top-level positions in the new Administration.

first came to our attention shortly after November 6,

1968, when Franklin Benjamin Lincoln, Jr., and

William Rittenhouse Harman moved into the Pentagon

as the vanguard of the transition team. They had no

clearance for highly classified information and when

no request was forthcoming for a full field investiga-

tion of these persons, the

security officer at the

Pentagon requested the investigation.

This matter came to a head on February 10, 1969,

when the Secretary of Commerce was told by the White House

to write a letter certifying that prospective Assistant

Secretaries were cleared politically and from a security

standpoint. When the Department of Commerce was told we

had received no request for a full field investigation,

that Department was informed by the White House the FBI

had done a "24-hour check."

The Department of Commerce

would not accept this since the Federal Employee Security

Program requires that no critical sensitive jobs should be

filled unless a full field investigation is first conducted.

Most of the requests for investigations received

thus far from the White House are in connection with persons

who have been publicly announced and are already firmly

established in their jobs.. As a result, instead of dis-

continuing investigation upon the development of derogatory

data the White House requests the investigation be continued

and at the present time we know of only one person the

Administration has discharged.

This was a stenographer

in Mr. Ehrlichman's office by

the name of Helen Galanoplos,

who had two brothers and a sister-in-law who were members

of the Communist Party.

In connection with White House investigations Don Virdin

of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) called the Bureau on February. 13,

1969. Virdin stated that IRS had checked their files in connection with

19

-AV-52.160-Docld:32489646-Page 692

---

## Page 693

the last 25 persons publicly announced and confirmed by the Senate.

He stated that this check revealed that the Bureau had only asked for

IRS information in connection with about 8 of these 25 people. He

stated he felt this was strange because there was some rather inter-

esting information in connection with some of these people, such as

the fact that one of these individuals, whom he did not identify, had

not filed an income tax return for the past three years. (We have

run checks on all requests received from the White House on

Presidential appointees and it would appear from the above that the

White House only asked for us to conduct investigations on 8 of the

last 25 publicly announced appointees. )

SELECTIVE SERVICE

Selective Service investigations conducted by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have

broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the

draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000

pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago.

In fiscal year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded

as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year.

For the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions

were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a

similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears

that such a trend will continue during

the current fiscal

year

There follows a brief summary of an investigation

of interest concerning a Selective Service matter.

At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned

Erik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with

Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn,

had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,

Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968.

Following arraignment and release on his own

recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and

Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the

draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person

under 21 years of age cannot vote, control or dispose of

his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate,

then he cannot register for the draft without his parents'

consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son

principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his

own conseience, bears the main responsibility and should

be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this

case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing to

register for the draft and rejected the mother's appeals.

A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been

scheduled for March 19, 1969.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

AND ORGANIZED CRIME

The main thrust of our investigations of organized

crime has been aimed at the key members in the power structure

of La Cosa Nostra in order to secure their imprisonment and

to disrupt leadership. We have also struck hard at the lower

working level who are the money producing figures for the

top echelon leaders.

With progressively greater success, we

have made deeper penetration into the heart of the hoodlum

syndicate, the illegal gambling operations from which it

draws much of its vast resources.

Prosecutions of hoodlums, gamblers, and vice figures

for violating the laws within the Bureau's jurisdiction

have been steadily increasing. For the fourth consecutive

year, convictions have reached new highs, as evidenced by the

fact

that during Fiscal Year 1968, our drive against organized

crime resulted in the conviction of 281 organized crime and

gambling figures, compared with the 197 convictions during

the preceding year.

individuals awaiting trial in Federal court. The substantial

backlog of individuals awaiting further prosecution indicates

that the upward trend of convictions will continue during

Fiscal Year 1969.

However, it is apparent that if we are to

continue to be effective in our drive against the hoodlum

element, prosecutions of these matters must necessarily receive.

nigh priority.

Recent Major Accomplishments

Among our most recent major accomplishments are:

the conviction of Ernest Sansone, Chicago hoodlum, and five

associates on february 12, 1969, in connection with a wide-

spread race wire dissemination service; the arrest of John

Philip Cerone, current top leader of

Chicago area, along with two accomplices on February 7, 1969,

in connection with the operation of a large-scale gambling

organization; the conviction of West Coast hoodlum figure,

John Roselli, on February 3, 1969, for running an interstate

gambling operation; the conviction

of William Daddano, des-

cribed as the 5th ranking mobster in Chicago, and four

and the conviction on March 8, 1968, of New England area

La Cosa Nostra chieftain Raymond Patriarca and one of his

"captains" Henry Tameleo, for violating the Anti-Racketeering

statute in connection with a gambling-murder case.

Dissemination Program

As a result of our dissemination program, 287, 004

items of criminal intelligence "type" informationwere dissem-

inated to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement

agencies during Fiscal

st t9, 3,

Year 1967, 300,244 such items were

disseminated in Fiscal Year 1968,

and

during the first six

months of the present Fiscal Year we have disseminated 153,214

items. Over one million such items have been disseminated

during the past five years.

With respect to dissemination of information

concerning local gambling operations to other Federal,

State,

and local law enforcement agencies throughout the

United

States for Fiscal Year 1968, a total of 721 raids

took place; 3751 individuals were arrested of whom 1170 were

convicted;

paraphernalia seized amounted to $ 1, 395,069 and

United States currency confiscated amounted to $624,028. In

the first six months of the present Fiscal Year 329 raids

have taken place, 1787 individuals have been arrested, "of

whom 771 have been convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted

to $221,021, and United States currency confiscated amounted

to $273,701.

Department of Justice Task Forces on Organized Crime

In the Fall of 1966, the Criminal Division of the

Department initiated the Task

Force Operation (also called

Strike Force) and the first one began operation in Buffalo,

New York. These Task Forces consisted of a group comprised

22

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 696

---

## Page 697

of Departmental attorneys and investigative personnel from

several different Federal investigative agencies. The FBI

was invited to assign personnel but declined because of its

overall commitments requiring utilization of all of its

Agents. However, we have extended complete cooperation in

the form of information in investigative reports and have

promptly handled all cases within our investigative juris-

diction that were referred to us from the Task Forces.

Since the initial Task Force at Buffalo, the Depart-

ment has formed such groups in Detroit, Michigan;

Brooklyn,

New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;

Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey.

We now maintain liaison with the various Task

Forces but not on a full-time basis.

It has been recommended that (1) we continue to

cooperate on a full-time basis, from the standpoint of

furnishing information to the various Task Forces, (2) that

the Director indicate to the new Attorney General

that we

will be happy to assign an FBI Inspector to serve as liaison

with the Department Task Force office in Washington, D. Co,

(3) that a supervisory employee would be assigned by each

SAC to a specific Task Force when such Task Force is established

within a given area where one of our field offices is located,

for liaison purposes.

La Cosa Nostra Leadership Changes

In the New York City area where La Cosa Nostra

"Commission" member Thomas Luchese died during 1967, no

successor has been named to date, primarily because

the FBI

was responsible for the arrest and/or conviction of the four

leading contenders, all "captains" or ranking members of the

Luchese "family."

In Chicago, John Philip Cerone, who was being groomed

as the top leader of la Cosa Nostra group in the Chicago area,

was arrested on February 7,1969, for Interstate Gambling

Activities.

Cerone was the interim Chicago leader for Sam

Giancana, who fled to Latin America following his release from

Federal prison and his successor, Sam Battaglia, who is in

Federal prison for violating the

Anti-Racketeering Act.

aIn New York,

veteran New York hoodlum Paul Sciacca

presently is the "boss" of a New York City La Cosa Nostra

"family" once headed by the notorious, controversial Joseph

Bonanno.

DEPARTMENT'S MANUAL FOR USE OF ELECTRONIC

SURVEILLANCE UNDER TITLE III OF OMNIBUS

CRIME CONTROL BILL

The Attorney General has been furnished our views

with regard to the Department's draft manual for use of electronic

surveillance pursuant to Title III. The general provisions of

this. lengthy manual, much of which

concerned administrative

regulations not specifically required by the statute itself,

would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions

on the iBl and other rederal agencies to the point that strict

compliance might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining

discreet electronic surveillance coverage under court supervision

for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence against the

leadership of organized crime and in other major investigative

categories.

These requirements involve an investigative agent's

application for intercept authority to be reviewed by a

comparatively wide range of authorities including the Organized

of thoroty

Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department, in many cases

the United States Attorney, the Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, and finally the Attorney General before

request even reached the court which, according to the provisions

of this statute, is the ultimate authority and control in the

use of this procedure. This process would, of necessity, be

time-consuming, cumbersome, and, at certain points, repetitious,

and would spread the knowledge of the use of this technique

among a number of different governmental offices.

We noted that the draft manual made repeated reference

to the problem of probable cause becoming

• "stale" and observed

that the sheer weight of the deliberative process at various

approving levels before it even reached the judge could alone

result in

the probable cause becoming "stale."

We also noted

that requirements involving daily memoranda to the United States

• Attorney concerning the progress of a court authorized surveillance

and other similar administrative requirements would tend to place

burdens on investigating agents which could detract from the

ultimate purpose of our use of this technique.

In connection with the manual's requirement that

an authorized surveillance be terminated when the subject of

the surveillance departed the premises covered, we questioned

that such a requirement was called for in the statute and whether

- 24 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 698

---

## Page 699

Congress, in providing this important added tool in the

evidence

gathering process, intended

that such a restriction

applied. We also noted that the draft suggested that in all

cases when an application for an order is denied, those named

in the application would be informed that the Government

intended to subject them to electronic surveillance. With

regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice

requirement pertains only to those situations where emergency .

intercepts nave been made without court order, and thereaiter

the court has denied the application and not to all applications

which might be denied in the normal course of business pursuant

to the main body of regulations in Title III.

We concluded our observations to the Attorney

General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of

guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems,

it was believed that for the Government's ultimate

success in

making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions

must not apply which will create more limitations on law

enforcement than the statute itself prescribes.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

Re: Director's Meeting with

Assistant Attorney General

Will R. Wilson

A number of case writeups are set forth which are believed

to be of interest to the Department, particularly AAG Wilson. Included

are fraud cases against the Universal Fibreglass Corporation (thirteen

million dollar contract to produce mail delivery trucks); Youth Pride,

Inc., Washington, D. C. (payroll padding); Chromcraft Corporation

("paper" corporations formed to act as subcontractors in connection

with production of rocket launchers for United States Navy).

Writeups are also submitted concerning financier Louis

Wolfson and his alleged dealings with Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas

based upon information furnished by the Internal Revenus Service;

the bribery case involving Congressman George H. Fallon (allegations

received that payoffs totaling $200, 000 were made to Congressman

Fallon and Lawson B. Knott, Jr., former General Services administrator,

in return for obtaining commitments for Government occupancy of

office buildings). Our New York Office developed information that a

theft ring existed at John F. Kennedy Airport, New York City, and

it is anticipated Federal Grand Jury will indict 15 to 17 individuals.

Attorney General Mitchell has reportedly expressed interest in this

case (Sidney Steinschreiber; And Others, Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property).

ACTION:

This is submitted for information, and attached are more

detailed writeups concerning the above matters.

and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buffalo area on

behalf of Joseph Fino, the "underboss" of the Magaddino family.

On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for

microphone

and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's

key locations where this illegal activity is carried on.

The

Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle

the filing of affidavits with the Federal court in Buffalo,

New York, to obtain the necessary court order for the

electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to title s of the

Omnibus Crime Bill.

The Department Attorney, in conjunction

with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

on 4/28/69, the necessary affidavits to be filed by a Bureau

Agent.

This is the first such application we have made

pursuant to the provisions of Title 3.

MANHATTAN JOINT STRIRE FORCE

The Department has proposed a strike force with the

stated objective of making a concentrated drive against

organized crime in the borough of Manhattan in New York City.

This apparently has been enlarged to include the Bronx in

view of the inclusion of the Bronx County District Attorney

on the Strike Force Council. This strike force is to be

composed of Department Attorneys, members of the staffs of

the District Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, members

of the New York City Police Department and investigators from

the various Federal investigative agencies, including the FBI.

The Federal Government is to provide the office space and office

ont as to prog

equipment.

A supervisory council has been named to make

decisions of strategy and timing and approve all planning. The

members of the councid have been named as assistant Director

in Charge John F. Malone of our New York office, the DistriCt

Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, Police Commissioner

of New York City, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson, the

Assistant Secretary for Law Enforcement of the Treasury

Department, the Chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering

Section of the Department, and the U. S. Attorney of the

Southern District of New York.

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,

Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations; returned

indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader

of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with

Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances

at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Trial has been

set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced

grand jury proceedings on April 23, 1969, at San Francisco in

connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by

three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms

and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot

Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held

in Philadelphia in August and September, 1960. Approximately 3, 000

to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference

during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms

and explosives for a closed meeting of approximately 70 persons.

Inauguration Disturbances

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of

fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration

day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being

conducted on an expedite basis.

Campus Disorders

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws

investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,

most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San

Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the

Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,

Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic

Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in

seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION

OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his

staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA)

here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned

of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's

views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle

(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring

cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the

opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered

for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated

circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider each

case on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,

through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney

General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution

of these cases. In a letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,

we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in Federal

court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,

but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.

None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the

present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among

USAS. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his

views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received

to date.

UNIVERSAL FIBREGLASS CORPORATION

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Following a partial audit by General Services

Administration, we instituted an investigation, at Depart-

ment's request, of alleged overcharges to the Government by

Universal Fibreglass Corporation (Universal) on a $13 million

contract to produce mail

delivery trucks. All logical investi-

gation has been completed and reported except the review of the

Universal records.

Access

to the pertinent records was recently

achieved through court action and an extensive audit is now

being pressed.

Criminal prosecution of several subjects is

now indicated.

Congressman H. R. Gross (R-Iowa) has publicized

this matter.

Press items have indicated that the office of

then Senator Hubert H. Humphries may have been instrumental

in having the contract awarded to Universal.

In January, 1969, following administrative investi-

gations by General Accounting Office and Department of Labor,

the Department requested we review subpoenaed records of

and four individuals, including Francis Rosenbaum, a lashington,

D. C., tax attorney, were indicted in Washington, D. C., on

charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of more than

$4 million. Trial date is set for September 8, 1969. On

January 29, 1969, civil suits were filed in Federal courts in

Washington, D. C., and St. Louis, Missouri, demanding judgment

for double damages arising from the fraud charges in the criminal

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at

presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments

anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the

Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber

and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of

drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo

supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with

pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100,000, as well as a series of

general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms

probably in excess of $250, 000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond

Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been

interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised

of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of

thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at

John F. Kennedy International Airport. Special Agents of this Bureau are

assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations

of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy

close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with

the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to

cope with these problems.

BRIEF FOR DIRECTOR'S USE IN

OCONNECTION WITH ATTORNEY

GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAYS, 5:00 P.M.

Reference is made to my memorandum of 3/13/70, submitting

a brief for the Director's use in connection with captioned conference. You

were advised this material would be edited each week to insure that it was in

a current status.

soul

There are attached amended pages 11, 12, 16, and 26 which

should be inserted in the brief.

The change on page 1l is under the subheading "Stock and

Bond Thefts," and the last sentence has been changed to reflect that the

amount recovered is now $8, 026, 000 and that 29 individuals have been

charged. The change on page 12 is the fact that the last sentence on the page

has been added to show that the United States Attorney in Baltimore, with

the approval of the Attorney General, plans to seek the indictment of

Congressman Dowdy and two others on 3/31/70. The change on page 16 is

in the tirst paragraph, reflecting that the Identification Division made an

identification in connection with the Wilkerson bombing in New York. It

also points out that Cathlyn Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin are among six other

fugitives being sought by the FBI after they failed to appear to answer local

felony charges in Chicago on 3/16/70 growing out of the October demonstra-

tions. The change on page 26 was made to include additional Laboratory

findings in regard to the Bel Air explosions. E

SUBJECT:

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1970, 5:00 P.M.

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the

captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by the Attorney General who

introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the

work of the FBI. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each

individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's

presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this staff

meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's presentation as indicated by

the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was

providing the conference with the number of Negroes employed by the FBI, including

Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to

receive a telephone call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General

Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's

return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General

returned.

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the

volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-

tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied

in the affirmative.

Mr. Kleindienst then referred to the number of organized crime type

cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all

organized crime individuals. The Director replied they all have some connection

with the many facets of organized crime.

The Director went on to say many of

these cases are"pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and

substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of

organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented that he felt that some of the

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's

attorneys. The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical

trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney

Kuntsler does the same thing in his field.

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,

took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more

Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor General added that

Federal judges were also needed.

Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied

these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen

stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongue but he had a survey

made and, as he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months

or more. The others were delayed because of some court motion or

action. The

Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and

Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen

how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen

said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of

Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least

and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan

centers.

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put

the FBI, if passed, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill

our responsibility, will probably have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He

pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate

guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities

to also investigate local gambling.

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst

advised the conterence that the Attorney General was called to the White House

and requested the Director/proceed with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m.,

the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney

General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for

questions.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned

Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory

examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that

that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took

this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available

when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to

the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about

the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance.

The Director explained that in such

places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only use

our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as

to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained

that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring

in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-

tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last

week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had

developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in

that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants

we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every

100 applicants 90 of them are turned down.

He said that we carefully interview

these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-

tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference

that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or

clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge

is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he

would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into

Federal court looking like hippies.

The Director pointed out that many of our young clerical employees

are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of

these young people.

He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our

facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director said with a smile that he would like to declare

open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot

them.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindienst was also interested in the scope of our work and in

this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the

FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb

legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal

Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of.

these major cities have very excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to

handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by

competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have

no people qualified, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these

cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification

facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state

leads.

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director

if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable

future. The Director said in the organized crime field, if the steps he has

recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the

disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said

this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one of the subjects in the

Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter

going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these

university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-

graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American

University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went

out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa

Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited

the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon

the Solicitor General commented that the judge who is going to try that case was his

law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and

it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director

pointed out that we have appropriately advised all local authorities of this possibility.

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman

in Chicago had in handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some

of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the

attorneys. The Director said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

tried the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually

broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment that his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are

going to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or

whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose

name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice

representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action

to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials

in South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped

the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be

promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walters question, the Director also pointed

out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take

drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,

and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people.

The Solicitor

General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/contributing

factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these

student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental

responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told

him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and

their parents don't even know, and in some, instances, care where they are. The

Director told them of the incident of where four of our Identification people were

held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had

a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the

Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.

The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges

and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. MM

hr 4/8/70

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover

as to the extent of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,

Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.

The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will

further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He

said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others

it is only one of participation but, he pointed out, they are always the most

vocal and, consequently, are very influential in those groups that they participate

in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international

revolutionary Communists. The Director then cited the incident of the young

girl who blew up her father's home in New York which she had turned into a

bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr

she joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to

Canada and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover

for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge

of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and

crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conference

was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.

Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to

autograph the FBI exhibit folder which had been passed out to each participant.

I feel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought

great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act as an incentive

to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job

in fulfilling their dusies in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

Submitted for information.

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S TESTIMONY

HOUSE JUDICIARY SUBCOMMITTEE

MARCH 15, 1967

The "Washington Post" reported on March 16, 1967, that

Attorney General Clark opened hearings before a House Judiciary sub-

committee on March 15th relative to the Administration's request for

50 million dollars next year and 300 million dollars the following year

to assist state and local governments in modernizing their law enforce-

ment and corrective systems. Clark said that a successful war on

crime depends not on making it easier for police to seek confessions

but on improving their training and methods.

The Attorney General also said he had seen no evidence

that court decisions limiting admission of confessions had hampered

efficient law enforcement. Clark is reported to have opposed action

reversing court orders that suspects be told of their rights and be

offered counsel before being questioned.

Attorney General Clark said that since 1948 the FBI has

followed generally the same interrogation procedures which the courts

have now ordered the states to follow. The FBI has maintained a very

high average of convictions, showing "what excellence in training and

standards can do," Clark said.

Clark also said he hoped Congress would not go "too far

on too little" until more evidence is in on the effect of the Supreme

Court's decisions.

COMMENT

The Attorney General failed to consider the fact that FBI

investigations are not normally hot pursuit, on-the-street situations.

When the FBI interrogates a suspect or subject, usually considerable

investigation has already been conducted and corroborative facts have

been developed which greatly assist the course of the interrogation.

On the contrary, police are frequently faced with fast-moving,

developing situations on the street where there is no opportunity for

the orderly accumulation of facts to supplement interrogation.

Congress is currently investigating the effect of the

Miranda decision on law enforcement and public safety. Senator

Birch Bayh (Democrat - Indiana) has been holding hearings around

the country regarding Miranda; however, testimony he has received

has been conflicting. Generally law enforcement officials testify

that they have been handcuffed and defense lawyers and civil liber-

tarians take the opposite view. As of this time, neither side has

demonstrable statistical proof to substantiate its contentions.

The

absence of clear proof is due, at least partially, to the fact that

Miranda is a new decision being handed down on June 13, 1966.

As of now there are few reported court decisions showing how trial

courts will interpret the requirements laid down in Miranda.

PRESS RELEASE OF MARCH 15, 196%

ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN'S "WEDNESDAY CLUB"

ENTITLED "ARE WE ORGANIZED TO FIGHT CRIME?"

On March 15, 1967, a group of 21 generally liberal

Republican Congressmen, members of the "Wednesday Club, " issued

a press release challenging the adequacy of the Federal Government's

organization to fight crime effectively and called for expansion of the

House Judiciary Committee's hearings considering crime legislation

to examine this aspect of the war on crime. The gist of their argument

is that a reorganization of Federal law enforcement and investigative

agencies is needed to effectively carry on the war against crime. The

press release suggests that there is "confusion, competition and dupli-

cation" among Federal law enforcement and investigative agencies which

is hindering the war against crime and that

this can be eliminated only

through a complete reorganization of these agencies.

The entire argument of the "Wednesday Club" is based on

a false premise. Traditionally and historically, law enforcement in this

country has been the responsibility of local governments and states.

The Federal law enforcement agencies make only approximately 50, 000

arrests per year for Federal violations, while local and state police

make over six million arrests for criminal acts, not including traffic

offenses. Federal investigative agencies have very little jurisdictional

control over the more than three million serious crimes committed in

the United States in 1966. Reorganization of the Federal law

enforcement agencies is not the answer to the crime problem. The

real problem is at the local levei where there are 40, 000 investigative

agencies, ranging from city constables to state police, and the problem

of multiplicity of jurisdiction is within the state. From the standpoint

of the FBI, there is daily liaison and exchange of information with all

Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies; our important

cooperative services are made available to all law enforcement agencies,

both on the state and Federal lével; and the FBI's National Crime Infor-

mation Center is an example of the cooperation which exists among law

enforcement agencies on all levels.

The press release of the "Wednesday Club" states that

the FBI maintains an informal semi-autonomy from Administration

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 762

## Page 763

regulations, although organizationally responsible to the Department

of Justice, and cites as an example recent debates over wiretapping

procedures. This statement is without any basis in fact. The Director's

testimony before various legislative committees, as well as documenta-

tion produced by him in the recent "wiretapping" controversy, clearly.

shows that the FBI's use of wiretaps was done with the specific knowledge

and approval of the Attorneys General and under strictly controlled

conditions. There is no exercise of autonomy whatsoever by the FBI

in this field.

The press release also charges that the FBI's involvement

in the foreign intelligence field, such as the Dominican crisis in 1965,

could detract from its domestic law enforcement and crime detection

functions. This allegation also is factually unsupportable. FBI Agents

were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1965 at the specific order of the

President; only three Special Agents are presently there, functioning

solely in a liaison capacity; statistical accomplishments by the FBI during

this period have been at their highest levels.

The action of the "Wednesday Club" was an obvious

attempt to secure a headline, which they incorrectly feel they have

found in the question of Federal organization.

MARCH 12, 1967

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

Attorney General Ramsey Clark was the guest of CBS program

"Face the Nation" which was telecast in Washington over WTOP-TV, at

12:30 p.m., Eastern Standara Time, Sunday, March 12, 1967. This program

was moderated by CBS newscaster Martin Agronsky assisted by correspondents

George Herman of CBS and James Clayton of the "Washington Post."

The principal topics discussed during this interview of the

Attorney General were:

1. The New Orleans investigation into the

assassination of former President Kennedy; 2. Wiretapping; 3. The

Supreme Court "Miranda" decision; 4. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell;

and 5. The death penalty.

Several references were made to the Director and the FBI

during this interview and all were favorable.

NEW ORLEANS INVESTIGATION

The Attorney General expressed his confidence in the

Warren Commission conclusion, based on FBI investigation, that assassin

Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in killing former President Kennedy. He

commented that most--if not all--of the individuals mentioned in the New

Orleans investigation were known to the FBI, which developed no evidence

that they were involved in the assassination. Clark declined to comment

on the mysterious individual known as "Bertrand" since New Orleans

authorities were then holding court proceedings to determine his identity.

WIRETAPPING

Clark commented that there were 38 wiretaps presently

authorized by his department, and that all of these were in national

security-type cases. He emphasized that procedares for his authority

in the use of all such devices have been improved, and he was satisfied

that none would sat be used without his approval.

"MIRANDA" DECISION

The Attorney General remarked that it was still too early

to determine what effect this decision would have on law enforcement

performance. He noted, however, that it has had no appreciable effect

on FBI investigations which have for many years informed suspects of

their constitutional rights prior to interrogation.

TELEVISION INTERVIEW

OF ATTORNEY GENERAL

POWELL

No decision has been reached by the Department concerning

possible Federal violations committed by Powell, according to Clark.

However, he expressed the hope that their determination might await any

urther action against Powell by Congress.

DEATH PENALTY

The Attorney General stated he would recommend the

death penalty be abolished for certain Federal violations.

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS

1966 PRELIMINARY ANNUAL RELEASE

On Wednesday, p.m., March 15, 1967, the FBI's

preliminary crime reports for 1966 were released to the press.

This report highlighted the fact that crimes of violence

were up 11%. There was a 9% increase in murder, a 10% increase

in aggravated assault, a 10% increase in forcible rape, and a 14%

increase in robbery. As a group, crimes against property increased

11% during 1966.

The sharpest crime increase was noted in the group of

cities having less than 10, 000 inhabitants. Crime in these cities

rose 14%. Large cities with over 100, 000 inhabitants had an average

increase of 10%, while crime in rural areas was up 7% and crime in

the suburbs rose 13%.

In the release dated March 15th the Director reiterated

the need for adequate firearms legislation, noting that. there was a

23% increase in 1966 in serious assaults where guns were used. The

Director also highlighted the fact that six out of every ten murders

were committed with the use of a firearm. 71% of these murders

were committed with handguns, 17% with shotguns and 12% with rifles

or other type firearm.

This crime report release also indicated that in 1966

police arrests of adults for all'

criminal acts (excluding trattic

offenses) dropped 1%; however, arrests of persons under 18 years of

age increased 9%.

Our preliminary annual release also noted that nationally,

police solutions of crime index offenses averaged 25% and noted that

police solved 89% of murders, 72% of aggravated assaults, 65% of

forcible rapes, 35% of robberies and 21% of property offenses.

CRIME LEGISLATION

The Congress is presently holding hearings with

respect to the President's request for crime legislation entitled

"Safe Streets and Crime Control Act of 1967."

This Act has its

basis in many of the recommendations of the President's Com-

mission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice.

The report of the Commission entitled "The Challenge of Crime

in a Free Society" was released February 18, 1967. The pro-

posed legislation would provide for a substantial financial aid

program to local and state law enforcement agencies for the

purpose of purchase of equipment, training, education and

research. It would also establish in the Department of Justice

an agency to administer the program headed by a Director of

Law Enforcement and Criminal Justice Assistance. Depending

on how this new legislation would be administered within the

Department of Justice, it will have an impact and could conflict

with the FBI's long-standing cooperative services for local law

enforcement.

NATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LAW ENFORCEMENT

AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE

By letter dated March 10, 1967, the Attorney

General requested FBI participation in a national conference

of local and state law enforcement administrators to be held

in the State Department Auditorium on March 28-29, 1967.

This conference was called by the President and has as its

purpose a discussion on how to implement the proposed

crime legislation. Since this conference and any new crime

legislation would affect directly the long-standing FBI coopera-

• tive services to local law enforcement, Assistant to the Director

DeLoach, Assistant Director Casper and Inspector Jerome J.

Daunt have been designated to attend. The Attorney General is

being advised by letter dated March 17, 1967.

NATIONAL CRIME INFORMATION CENTER (NCIC)

The National Crime Information Center (NCIC), a

computerized index of law enforcement information on crime and

criminals, successfully began its pilot test operation on January 27,

1967. At the present time the following police agencies are directly

on-line to the FBI computer:

Boston Police Department

Philadelphia Police Department

New York City Police Department

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department

Chicago Police Department

St. Louis Police Department

New Orleans Police Department

Maryland State Police

Virginia State Police

Georgia State Patrol

Texas Department of Public Safety, and

, Denver FBI Field Office

These agencies are entering records on wanted

persons, stolen motor vehicles, and identifiable stolen property.

They are receiving replies to inquiries in a matter of seconds.

For example, a police officer on the street in New Orleans through

the use of his car radio is able to get information from the FBI

computer here in Washington within 1 1/2 minutes. The California

Department of Justice and the New York State Police are scheduled

to join the NCIC system on March 20, 1967. The system has had a

steady growth in building up the information that is stored in the

computer, increasing the number of hours that the computer is

"on the air" and in adding new participating police agencies.

INVESTIGATION OF THE ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

BY NEW ORLEANS DISTRICT ATTORNEY JAMES CO GARRISON

In December, 1966, we received information that New Orleans

District Attorney James C. Garrison was conducting an investigation

of the assassination of the late President Kennedy. Garrison réported-

ly was attempting to develop evidence showing that David Hilliam

Ferrie, a homosexual who was a former airlines pilot, and Lee Harvey

Oswald conspired with anti-Castro Cubans to assassinate President

Kennedy•

We were informed by several sources that Garrison was basing

much of his investigation upon information furnished to him by Jack S.

Martin and David Lewis. Martin is a private investigator in

New Orleans and Lewis

is a baggage handler at a New Orleans bus

station.

Both Martin and Lewis appear to be mental cases. During

our investigation of the assassination, we thoroughly investigated

allegations that Ferrie and Oswald were acquainted but we found

no evidence to show this was true.

Garrison has made one arrest in his case - Clay L. Shaw,

a homosexual who was former Director of the International Trade Mart

In New Orleans.

Shaw's name did not come up

during our investigation

of the assassination.

Garrison claims Shaw is identical with one

Clay Bertrand, an alleged contact of New Orleans attorney Dean Andrews.

We never located Bertrand and Andrews? acquaintance with Bertrand

highly doubted. We developed no information indicating Oswald knew

Clay Shaw.

On March 14, 1967, during a preliminary hearing in New Or-

leans for Shaw, Garrison produced a mystery witness Perry Raymond

Russo who alleged that he was present at a meeting when Leon Oswald,

David Ferrie and Clay Shaw planned the assassination of President

and his testimony at the preliminary hearing was highly contradictory

to information he previously-furnished to news media.

Russo appears

to be lying and during our investigation of the assassination, we

developed no information indicating Oswald ever knew Russo.

and it appears his whole investigation was triggered by his desire

for publicity.

The Director has instructed that we have no contact

with Garrison

out of Garrison's investigation. It appears Garrison is looking for

an attempt to dump his investigation on this Bureau and the Director

has instructed that we should avoid such possibility "like a plague."

SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES

The field of education has long been a major

target of the Communist Party. The communists'

emphasis

on students in the recent past was best expressed by

the Party's General Secretary, Gus Hall, when he stated

"Communism is big, really big, on college campuses now.

You've got to play the ball game where the players are and

the really good players are in college." Today there is

considerable unrest and agitation on college campuses

throughout the Nation.

Subversive agitators constitute the

major source behind this unrest and, from a long-range

viewpoint, these campus subversives may well become seriously

damaging to our national security. In light of this, the

FBI will continue to carry out its defined responsibilities,

whether they be on the college campus or elsewhere, while

at the same time respect the spirit of academic freedom on

which our college system is based.

The two major student and campus groups in the

United States today are the communist-inspired W. E. B.

DuBois Clubs of America, with an approximate membership of

125 members, and the students for a Democratic Society, with

The Students for a Democratic

Society has been described by tus Hall as a new left group

which the Party has "going for us."

Today there is a concerted effort on the part of

student groups to "knock" the FBI and other Government

agencies off the college campuses and to prevent such

agencies from carrying out their assigned duties.

For

example, in early March, 1967, a handful of Students for

a Democratic Society members at Duke University, Durbam,

North Carolina, alleged that the FBi in conducting investi-

gations on that campus was infringing on academic freedom

by securing information

from responsible campus officials

and students. While we have interviewed

officials and students

at the University in matters within our jurisdiction the

charges that the FBI was infringing on academic freedom are

baseless

¿ Another example involves allegations made by a

group of "liberal" faculty members at State University College,

Brockport, New York. This group alleged that the FBI was

having faculty members "spy" on other faculty members, again

raising the cry of infringement of academic freedom.

These

charges also were baseless and without foundation.

TRAVEL OF THE PRESIDENT TO URUGUAY

At the request of the White House, a representative

of this Bureau

recently traveled to Uruguay and participated

in briefings, surveys, and discussions relating to security to

be provided for the President when he attends the Summit

Conference of heads of American States to be held in Punta

Del Este, Uruguay, during the period 4/12-14/67. The same

Bureau representative is returning to Uruguay to assist a

White House group in the implementation of security measures

prior to the President's arrival. A general assessment of

the situation in Uruguay at the present time indicates that

adequate security can be provided to the President if he

restricts his travel to Punta Del Este. If he travels to

Montevideo proper, security problems could arise because of

a very militant Communist Party which already is manifesting

its protests to the President's visit.

The Communist Party

in Uruguay practically controls the labor movement and

potentially is in a position to paralyze facilities such as

light, gas, water, and street transportation.

Furthermore,

there is a

good potential for committing sabotage and inciting

riots.

Under the present plan, the President will not go

into Montevideo proper:

Security problems at Punta Del Este

are greatly minimized because the geographic location and

the resort-type atmosphere do not present any serious

obstacles for instituting good security.

The police and

security services in Montevideo are

not efficient by our

standards, and it will take continuing prodding to make

certain that the necessary security measures are carried

out.

The political stability of the Uruguayan Government is

not good. There is a new Government which is shaky and is

suffering economic problems.

There have been a series of

strikes during the last several weeks. We have been told

that there will be between 1500 and 2500 newspapermen who

will attend the conference.

There may be some commotion

among them because of inadequate housing and communication

facilities. Newspaper reporters may alsofind it disappointing

to find any news of real significance at Punta Del Este if

there are no disturbing incidents..

WIRE TAPS AND OTHER COVERAGE UTILIZED IN THE

INTERNAL SECURITY FIELD

Wire taps are utilized only in the internal security

field and when absolutely essential to carrying out our

investigative responsibilities.

Their number varies and

of this date we have 42 wire taps in operation. In addition,

JEK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

The importance of utilizing wire taps in the internal

security .field. cannot be overemphasized in view of the dangers

that exist in the internal security of the United States.

The

intelligence data obtained from such coverage makes it possible

to keep appropriate officials of our Government currently

aware of the activities, plans, strategy, and tactics of

and

individuals.

Also, intormation

gathered from these sources is of immediate interest to the

United States intelligence agencies and officials of the Govern-

ment in the formulation of plans in the foreign policy field.

We are not utilizing any microphone surveillances,

mail covers, or trash

covers in connection with our investiga-

tions. We are utilizing security informants and confidential

sources to provide

necessary coverage.

Currently, we

have

das security informants who are members of the Communist Party

and some of these are operating at the highest level. In view

of the valuable coverage these informants provide us, we place

great deal of emphasis on their utilization. It may be

interesting to note that during Mashed of our security infor

mants became members of the Communist Party and this was

increased to us informants becoming members of the Party in

In this connection, we noted that during those two years while

informants became members of the Party, # discontinued

their association with the Party primarily due to personal

reasons, thus leaving us a total gain of du informants in the

Party.

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

The Connunist Party, USA, is operating in an

atmosphere of optimism as a result

ot the March 8, 1504,

decision of the United States Court oi Appeals, Washington, D.C.,

which stated that the Party could not be forced to register

under the provisions of the Internal Security Act of 1950.

The feeling throughout the Party is that it has won its fight

for existence and now must move to capitalize on this victory

by becoming an effective force on the American scene.

Within this week the Party adopted various programs

in an effort to move out of its isolation from the American

people. It is working toward the establishment of a daily

newspaper which is expected to be in operation in time to

have an effect on the national elections in 1968. Originally,

the Party planned to merge peace, labor, and civil rights

groups into a new political party which

would nominate a

candidate for President of the United States in 1968.

NOW,

the Communist Party is seriously considering running

its own

candidates for the offices of President and Vice President of

the United States in 1968.

May 1, 1967, is to mark the institution of a

massive recruiting drive by the Party to take advantage of

the favorable Court decision and each Party district is being

instructed to start making plans for this recruiting drive

now.

In addition, Party leaders have called for more infil

tration by Party members into the trade union movement in

an attempt to regain the power the Party had in this movement

in the 1940's.

The Party believes that youth must be the central

concentration for its work in the future.

In order to have

the most impact on the young generation and to gain recruits

quickly, the Party must make an effective appeal to youth.

Therefore, it is instituting a massive campaign against

United States policy in Vietnam,

instituting resistance to

the military draft, and encouraging all types of demonstrations

by youth.

The Party also will start a movement to have Congress

pass a bill guaranteeing full employment for all youth.

" The Party considers recruiting of youth its most

important project in 196% Current plans call for doubling

the number of youth in the Party during the Summer of 1967,

and the nationwide establishment of Party schools to fully

indoctrinate these youth recruits in the principles of

DEMONSTRATIONS PROTESTING UNITED STATES

INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM

Since United States aircraft attacked selected

cargets in North Vietnam tollowing torpedo-boat assaults

against destroyers in the Gulf/Tonkin in early August,

1964, there have been in the United States almost daily

demonstrations to protest United States intervention in

Vietnam.

Many of these demonstrations have reached major

proportions.

The Communist Party and other subversive groups

such as the W.E.B. DuBois Clubs of America, a communist-

inspired Marxist-oriented youth group; the Socialist Workers

Party, which has been designated as subversive by the Attorney

General, and its youth alIlliate,

the Young Socialist Alliance;

the Workers World Party, a communist splinter group and its

youth affiliate, Youth Against War and Fascism; and the

Progressive. Labor Party, a pro-Chinese Marxist

group, have

actively supported and

participated in demonstrations along

with the Students for a Democratic Society, a militant youth

group which has been described by Gus Hall, General secretary

of the Communist Party, USA, as a group which the Party has

"going for us."

Pacifist groups such as Women Strike for

peace,

Women's International League for Peace and Freedom,

the Committee for Nonviolent Action, and the National Committee

for a Sane Nuclear Policy have also

taken a leading role in

sponsoring such demonstrations.

Summaries showing the

highlights of these demonstrations are furnished to the

White House and other Government officials two or three times

a week.

The Spring Mobilization Committee and the Student

Mobilization Committee, both of which include members of the

Communist Party and other subversive groups in their

membership, are sponsoring demonstrations throughout the

United States April 8-15, 1967.

The focal point of the

week-long activity will be massive demonstrations at

New York City and San Francisco, California, on April 15.

The Reverend James Bevel is the National Director of the

Spring Mobilization Committee. Bevel is an official of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, a civil rights

group which

is headed by the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.

The Student

Mobilization Committee is the brainchild of

Bettina Aptheker, a student at the University of California

at Berkeley

and a member of the Communist Party, USA, Nationa!

committee. An attempt is being made to have 500 individuals

burn their draft cards at New York City during the demonstration

on April 15, 1967, as a mass protest against the war and the

draft.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican

Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be

used in preventing communists from gaining control in that

country.

At the height of the Dominican Revolution, we had

a staff of 14 Agents. In August, 1966, at White House

instructions, we established

• permanent Legal Attache office

there staffed with three Agents.

Since his inauguration July 1, 1966, Dominican

President Joaquin Balaguer has brought about a degree of

stability, however, there continues to be strong undercurrents

of dissension. • The

rightists reportedly have considered

plots to remove Balaguer.

Juan Bosch's political party, the

loser in the June, 1966,

election, has been most vocal in

its opposition to

Balaguer's programs and only recently

published a document which appears intended to set the

stage for a vast movement of resistance against Balaguer.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to establish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have

in the past. They possibly would be willing

to let

Bosch's political party provide the overt leadership.

• Borislav Kornic has admitted to two different individuals

that Kornic, Milan Nikolic, and Desimir Marjanovic bombed the

San Francisco Consulate with explosives Marjanovic transported to

Los Angeles from Cleveland, Ohio. One of the persons to whom Kornic

made these admissions has testified at the grand jury; the other is not

willing to testify at this time.

Other evidence includes proof that Stojilko Kajevic's

automobile was used prior to the bombings in an attempt to buy dynamite

and a pattern of long distance telephone calls between the suspects at

pertinent times.

Presentation to a Federal Grand Jury, Washington, D. C.,

commenced 3/10/67 but the grand jury is available to hear this case

only on Fridays. Additional witnesses are appearing 3/17/67 and it

is anticipated further testimony will be given the grand jury 3/24/67

and possibly 3/31/67.

Brandon Alvey, the trial attorney handling this case, has

described the Bureau's investigation as outstanding and said he has

never before seen so much good information gathered in such a short

time. Alvey states that if there was a statute making it a violation to

bomb diplomatic establishments in the United States, the evidence now

available would support a conspiracy conviction. There is no such

statute; however, the statute the Department considers. most applicable

(Section 956, Title 18) makes it a violation to conspire in the United States

to damage property owned by a foreign government in a foreign country.

To successfully prosecute under Section 956, it must be

proven that the conspiracy originated in the United States. No violation

would exist if the conspiracy originated in Canada even if subsequent

discussions and other overt acts occurred in the United States. It is

unlikely that this point can be established unless a confession is obtained

from one of the conspirators. Alvey is making every effort to develop

the necessary evidence on this point in examining witnesses before the

grand jury and has laid the groundwork for possibly forcing testimony

from one or more prime suspects by offering immunity coupled with

a threat of contempt proceedings if testimony is withheld.

Trial attorney Alvey has indicated the grand jury is

enthusiastic but he does not expect to obtain a true bill unless additional

evidence is developed to prove the conspiracy to bomb the Canadian

establishments originated in the United States. We are vigorously

• pursuing all logical possibilities to develop such information by

continuing investigation.

ROBERT EARL BARNES

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTALON OF STOLEN PROPERTY

Robert Earl Barnes is the notorious burglar with

an extensive arrest record who was the main witness at the

trial in District Court of 5 policemen charged with bribery

and conspiracy.

Trial, which ended March 11, 1967, resulted

in the conviction of 3 District of Columbia

police officers

and the acquittal of the other 2.

Barnes has admitted to our Agents the theft on

June 12, 1964, of a 34.10 carat diamond ring (appraised at

$120,000) from Mrs. John R. McLean, a guest at the

Lucayan Beach Hotel, Grand Bahamas Island. The diamond ring

was transported by Barnes and an associate to New York City

where it was sold. Some of the evidence has been presented

to a Special Federal Grand Jury, however, prosecution of

Barnes for the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property

violation was held in abeyance pending completion of the trial

of the police officers.

On March 13, 1967, Assistant U. S. Attorney Harold I.

Sullivan,

who is handling this matter, advised that it was the

specific instruction of U. S. Attorney David Bress that prosecution

of Barnes in connection with the McLean diamond should be

pursued and pertinent witnesses are to be called before the

Grand Jury.

This is being followed most closely.

BOMBING DEATH OF

WHARLEST JACKSON

AT NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1967

CIVIL RIGHTS

BOMBING MATTERS

A full investigation is being conducted at the Depart-

ment's request concerning the death of Wharlest Jackson at Natchez,

Mississippi, as a result of a bomb exploding in his pickup truck as

he left work at the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Company in Natchez

shortly after 8 p.m. on February 27, 1967.

Jackson had been employed by the Armstrong Company

since June, 1955. On February 20, 1967, he bagan training for a new

job as a cement mixer, a type of position

previously held only by white

men. His particular job was a new position and was based on seniority.

Jackson had held the position of treasurer in the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People in the Natchez branch and is

survived by his wife and five children. George Metcalf, a Negro fellow

employee, also active in the National Assocation for the Advancement

of Colored People, who previously customarily rode to work with

Jackson, was seriously injured in a similar type explosion in 1965.

• On the scene examination by Laboratory experts

indicates that a high-order explosive was detonated under the cab portion

of Jackson's truck directly beneath the driver. Fragments of wire

recovered at the scene appear to be wire from an electric blasting

cap, indicating that such a cap may have been connected to and

activated by the electric wiring system of the truck. Portionsof the

wires to the brake light; tail light, and left rear turn indicator light,

which were originally located on the inside of the left frame, are

missing as a result of the explosion. No additional physical evidence

has been disclosed to date.

Extensive investigation conducted under the on-the-scene

supervision of Inspector Joseph A. Sillivan indicates that a group known

as the Silver Dollar group is responsible for the bombing. The Silver

Dollar group is reportedly a secret group of Mississippi and Louisiana

Klansmen founded in June, 1965. One informant is presently a member

of the group but to date has been unable to establish the identity of

2.44

persons responsible for the bombing. Intensive efforts are being

made to develop additional sources to furnish further penetration of

the group and to trace the electric blasting cap probably used to

detonate the explosive.

On March 25, 1965, in response to request of

Criminal Division, Bureau monitored telephone calls from

Bromley to Jones

and Baker. Bromley and his attorney had

asked that this be done.

Department held such monitoring

would be legal.

On March 26, 1965, Department requested

we monitor meeting to be attended by Jones, Bromley, and

Baker at a hotel in Los Angeles.

Purpose of meeting was

to get Bromley, a Government witness, to tailor his

testimony to agree with testimony Jones had given.

Bureau

declined

to monitor this meeting because of lack of security

of the premises involved which presented a risk of disclosure

of the coverage.

Department then got Bureau of Narcotics

to assist in monitoring of the meeting.

Recently we have responded to Department's request

regarding Bureau electronic coverage of Jones.

Such coverage

involved twenty conversations over four las Vegas and one

Miami electronic device. All conversations were inconsequential

and have no bearing on perjury charges against Jones.

This

coverage will be subject matter of

future pretrial proceedings.

REQUEST OF ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL

VINSON, MARCH 14, 1967, RE LAKE COUNTY,

INDIANA, CRIME CONDITIONS

Assistant Attorney General Fred M. Vinson, Jro,

Criminal Division, requested preparation of an extensive summary

crime condition report concerning Lake County, Indiana. He asked

for information on gambling, racketeering, counterfeiting, narcotics,

shoplifting and other such matters. By letter to the Attorney General

on March 16, 1967, we pointed out

we no longer make such reports

and our commitments preclude the preparation of such a study. This

is apparently a 'fishing expedition" type request for Vinson's and

Petersen's Task Force. We advised them they have reports in

gambling and racketeering-type cases in Lake County, Indiana, where

recent prosecutive action has been taken against hoodlums.

The Department has embarked on a Crime Task Force

Program which solicits the active participation of the various Federal

investigative agencies. We informed the Department that there are

inherent drawbacks to such a program and are not actively partici-

pating in it. We have, however, advised the Department that if

matters within our jurisdiction arise during the Task Force Program,

we will handle such upon referral of these matters to us. We have

also agreed to conduct an indices and credit check of grand jury panel

in the Buffalo area, which is to be convened for the Task Force in

operation in that area.

Department attorney Peloquin advised a Canadian police

official that the FBI was participating in a 'buy back'' of United States

Postal Money Orders and we directed a letter to the Attorney General

on March 8, 1967, pointing out that Peloquin had misinformed the

Canadian authorities on our participation.

WIRETAPPING

The Attorney General testified before the House Judiciary

Subcommittee on March 15, 1967, that microphone and wiretapping

were unnecessary in connection with control of crime in the United

States. Various bills to outlaw wiretapping and eavesdropping or to

legalize such practices are pending in the Congress. We directed a

letter to the Department dated March 6, 1967, concerning legislation

proposed by Senator Eastland which would authorize wiretapping and

use of microphones with court approval in organized crime investiga-

tions. We informed the Attorney General that such legislation would

be very beneficial to our efforts in the field of organized crime and

would appear to provide a statutory basis for practices now being .

followed in connection with use of such devices in national security

matters. Microphones were of inestimable value in determining

La Cosa Nostra weaknesses and day-to-day organizational moves,

and enabled us to develop excellent informants, disseminate informa-

tion to local authorities and to make counter moves to dry up La Cosa

Nostra sources of income.

In connection with Departmental disclosures of our prior

microphone coverage in cases presently before the trial and appeals

courts, there has been to date no complete reversal of any of such

cases which were actually brought to trial. In several cases, notably,

Kolod-Alderisio in Denver, Colorado; Robert G. Baker in Washingtong

D. C. ; Frank Peter Balistrieri in Springfield, Illinois; Charles

Battaglia in Tucson, Arizona; and Gilbert Lee Beckley in Miami,

Florida, disclosures were made and hearings held, and in each

instance the court has ruled against the defendants and in favor of our

position that these cases were not tainted. In the Black case and in

the Schipani case in New York, the Supreme Court has remanded for

retrial and these are still under consideration. r

convictions than at a similar time last year. In addition, we nave in

excess of 350 individuals arrested and/or indicted and awaiting trial

for violations of these statutes. As a result of our dissemination

policies of gambling information to local authorities, we have directed

telling blows against La Cosa Nostra members active in this field by

virtue of numerous arrests made by local authorities.

During this fiscal year we have disseminated 159, 823

items of criminal information to local authorities, which is an increase

of 50, 000 items over this same period last year.

FBI NATIONAL ACADEMY

LAW ENFORCEMENT ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1965

The 79th Session of the FBI National Academy begins

Monday, March 20, 1967. There will be 100 law enforcement

officers in attendance with representatives from 45 states, the

District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and 7 foreign officers from

5 foreign countries (Australia, Canada, Colombia, Malaysia and

Thailand). (The Attorney General presented diplomas to the

graduating class of the 75th Session of the National Academy on

May 26, 1965, when he was Deputy Attorney General.)

On January 25, 1967, the Director sent a memorandum

to then Acting Attorney General Clark requesting that National

Academy representatives be included under the Law Enforcement

Assistance Act of 1965 as soon as possible for financial assistance

in helping to defray living expenses while attending the FBI

National Academy. We referred Mr. Clark to previous correspondence

on this same matter and a reply dated August 24, 1966, that

indicated that such support would be appropriate under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act.

The Director pointed out that while

we anticipate having a continuing demand and desire to attend this

Academy, we do not feel this factor should have a bearing on the

allocation of funds under the Law Enforcement Assistance Act.

It was assumed in the Attorney General's reply in August, 1966,

that in view of the current limited capacity of the Academy plus

the ample demand and desire of local agencies to send candidates

it would be unnecessary at this time to be concerned about sub-

sistence aid.

It was estimated that approximately $80, 000 for

subsistence and travel would be needed for the March class and

that it would vary somewhat for each class and that if the Acting

Attorney General approved this concept, the Director stated a

request for a grant would be submitted on proper documents to

the Office of Law Enforcement Assistance.

We have never received a reply to this memorandum

even though we pointed out that several grants under the Law

Enforcement Assistance Act have been awarded for the conduct

of police seminars and have included funds for financial assistance

of the attendees. The Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General that we are not asking for this money for the

FBI but that the funds would be helpful to the agency sending the

man to the National Academy. Although we have not conducted

a nation-wide survey, we are aware that many departments do

not submit applications to the National Academy because they

do not have the funds to pay the living expenses of their officers

while they would be in Washington.

POLICE TRAINING

Assistance in training matters continues to be one of the

most sought after cooperative functions of the FBI. During calendar year

1966, the FBI assisted municipal, county and state law enforcement agencies

in 5478 training endeavors, attended by 163, 302 people. Over 1200 Special

Agents of the FBI are trained as police instructors, and during 1966, they

contributed 45, 383 hours of instruction time, free of charge, at police

training schools. Assistance is rendered in all types of schools, however,

special emphasis is being placed on police administration and management,

search and seizure, probable cause for arrest, due process in criminal

interrogation, laboratory matters, crime scene search, collection and

preservation of evidence, human relations in police management, and

police-community relations.

NEW FBI ACADEMY

In May, 1965, the Director submitted a proposal to the

Attorney General for the building of a new FBI Academy on the

Marine Corps Base at Quantico, Virginia. This suggestion was

immediately endorsed by the President and the Attorney General.

The Director's proposal outlined that with the new facility, instead

of training 200 local law enforcement officers annually at the FBI

National Academy, we could train 1, 200 and up to 1, 000 local law

enforcement officers in specialized courses.

The Congress has

appropriated funds for the construction of this new facility.

The planning and engineering work on the site is in

progress and it is anticipated that the contract for the construction

of the Academy will be let sometime during the summer of 1967. It

is believed that the new Academy will be ready for occupancy during

fiscal year 1969.

EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM

Executive Order 11315 established an Executive

Assignment System for filling positions in Grades 16, 17, and

18 of the General Schedule. The FBI was specifically excluded.

The Director by statute has the authority to fill the 110 Super-

grade positions allotted to the FBI. An inventory of skills of

employees throughout the Government in Grades GS-15 through

18 is being established by the Civil Service Commission to fill

vacancies in other agencies and it proposes to include in this

inventory all such employees, including those in the FBI. This

would make our executives available for consideration by other

agencies although we are still exempt from having to consider •

employees of other agencies in filling our vacancies. The

Department, therefore, was requested by letter dated December 21,

1966, to approve a letter to the Civil Service Commission request-

The case involves

Jo so plane piloted by two americans,

Rundquist and shergalis, which was shot down sarch 21, 1900, while

trying to smuggle four cubans out of that country with resulting

arrest of Runaquist and Shergalis.

EBl source in miami advised

March 22,

1960,

that incident was staged by Castro agents to provide

Castro with. basis for renewed attacks against l.s. for allowing

illegal flights to Cudd.

On warch 23, 1900, this hoax was exposed.

when shergalis gave statement to U. S. Embassy camitting role as

Castro agent and

implicating various Cubans in U.S. and Cuba.

We

conducted intensive investigation in this matter and developed

substantial evidence shoving that hundquist-Shergalis flight was,

in fact, instigated by castro agents.

Miami reports of April 1, April 6,

April 15, and lay 6, 1960, covering our investigation, have been

19389 ing them with violations of foreign Agents Registration Act of

as amended. Indictments were also returned against shergalis

and Rundquist charging violations of Federal Aviation Act, administered

by Federal Aviation Agency, for failure to file proper flight plan.

Shergalis is still in custody of cuban officials in that country,

cuban Government naving rejected U.s. request that shergalis and

Rundquist be extradited to jace charges in this country. At time

indictments were returned, Garcia was in Cuba and, therefore,

indictments were sealed and bench warrants were issued for arrest

of shergalis and Garcia.

Garcia returned to Miami on afternoon of May 4,

1960,

and

was arrested by our Miami. Office at Miami International airport.

Press release was issued SAl, diami, concerning arrest und subsequently

prior to indictments, Departmental Attorney William

had recommended that, in addition to indictments against

orgalis and Carcia, indictments also be sought against four

other individuals involved in this matter; namely,

Carlos Hernandez

nir Force purchasing agent in Miami), Armando Jose Asencio

(american citizen of cuban extraction who camittedly met with

Shergalis on Garcia's behalf on several occasions prior to

March 21 flight), Roberto Millares (Cuban national who was present

at several meetings betwzen shergalis and cuban representatives),

and Roberto Fernandez Rodriguez (Cuban Army intelligence representative

who accompanied shergalis to cuba in February, 1960, and

introduced him to cuban intelligence officials).

No information has been received by Bureau indicating

that state Department exerted any influence on Justice Department

to limit prosecutive action to shergalis and Garcia.

supears Department concluded that evidence was insufficient to

support prosecution of Hernandez Lopez, willares and Fernandez

Rodriguez. It appears there would be some substantial evidence

concerning asencio's involvement, including his own admissions;

however, Department may have decided not to seen indictment against

Asencio on basis he will be utilized as Government witness

at any future trial held in this case.

his opinion was concurred in by the Department on April 8, 1960.

Extensive investigation has been conducted by our

Albany Oifice in an effort to identify and locate the extortion-

ist.

To date, no positive information has been obtained, and

no suspects have been developed. Of interest, however, is the

fact that the rumors pervails among fellow students, faculty

members, and advisors of the victim that he prepared the

communications in question. While no direct evidence cor-

roborating these rumors has been uncovered, writing paper and

envelopes similar to that used in one of the communications

found in the victim's room.

The Department has requested copies of all investiga-

tive reports. Judge Kaufman will be confidentially advised of the

facts developed by our investigation, after which the reports will

be disseminated to the Department.

also advised the Committee representatives that it would not

be possible in every instance to make name checks on an

expeditious basis while the hearings were being conducted

inasmuch as the time factor in making the name checks would

• depend upon the number of references involved. Mr. Hundley

is sending a memorandum to the Bureau in the immediate •

future listing the names which the Conmittee has now

requested be checked.

Upon receipt of Mr. Hundley's memorandum listing

the names, the names will be checked and appropriate summaries

prepared.

ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

1. FEDERAL EMPLOYEES HEALTH BENEFITS ACT OF 1959 - FBI CANNOT

ABSORB ANY COSTS INCIDENT THERETO

The provisions of this new legislation, which was enacted by the

86th Congress, First Session, and approved by the President, become effective

July 1, 1960.

Its purpose is to provide health insurance for Federal employees,

annuitants, and their families. Employees will have the option of selecting from

four health plans with a wide range of benefits. The legislation provides that the

Government will contribute 50% of the premium cost of the plan selected, subject

to stated minimum and maximum ranges.

We cannot accurately estimate the cost to the FBI of these new

benefits until the Civil Service Commission has dealt with the insuring groups

to determine the cost of the plans and until the employees have selected the

desired coverage. Preliminary estimates, however, indicate an added cost of

approximately $1, 000, 000 per year to the

FBI as the employer's cost of these

new benefits, based on the Bureau's experience derived from the operation of its

present health coverage plan.

The appropriation request of this Bureau represents an absolute

minimum figure. All avenues of possible savings were thoroughly explored in

arriving at the minimum figure requested. As a result, it will be impossible

for the FBI to absorb any part of the added cost resulting from the Federal

Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959.

2. ADMINISTRATION'S 2% SAVINGS PROGRAM, FISCAL YEAR 1960

Budget Director Stans, in a letter dated September 21, 1959, to

the Attorney General, stated the President had asked him to request the continued

cooperation of the Attorney General in reducing civilian employment in the Govern-

ment.

The letter pointed out that during the fiscal year 195y executive agencies

effected a 2% reduction in employment and that the President would like to effect

a similar reduction in the fiscal year 1960, and requests the Attorney General to

give personal direction to the program and to plan his operations so as to accomplish

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 819

---

## Page 820

it. The reduction would be effected by not filling vacancies as they occur and

by not establishing new positions. The letter further directs that agency plans

for personnel reductions or facts as to why an agency head believes the requested

2% reduction is impracticable be presented to the Budget Bureau with the

October financial plan.

In connection with the 2% savings program in effect during the fiscal

year 1959, the Bureau advised the Attorney General that it would be impossible

to make any such reduction as the Bureau's operations were already on a "strict

austerity" basis.

The Department cut our fiscal year 1961 budget request by $400, 000,

reducing it from $117, 500, 000 to $117, 100, 000, thereby eliminating so employees

for the field (30 Special Agents and 15 clerks).

The Bureau is in no position to effect a 2% reduction in personnel

during fiscal year 1960. Our work loads in all categories continue to be heavy

with no sign of any abatement. Legislation enacted in the closing days of Congress,

specifically the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure. Act of 1959, will

further bolster our work volumes for which funds have not been provided and to

attempt to reduce our personnel by 2% would seriously impair this Bureau's

ability to discharge its responsibilities in all fields of work.

3. SALARY RETENTION ACT, PUBLIC LAW 85-737

This act provides a two-year period of salary retention for employees

demoted through no fault of their own if they have occupied a higher paying position

for two years or longer. This act has caused a most inequitable situation by

requiring employees who accepted temporary promotions to be paid more than

permanent employees who are doing identical work. By memorandum dated

July 17, 1959, we urged the Department to recommend legislation so as to change

this situation at the earliest possible time. To date no legislation has been

introduced which would effect the desired correction of this inequitable situation.

INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

86-20r-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (Public Law

The new labor law, as above, became effective upon its signing

by the President on September 14, 1959.

The language in the Act conferred authority upon the Secretary of

Labor to conduct investigations of the majority of the provisions contained

in the law. Authority was also granted to the Secretary of Labor to enter

into agreements with other agencies to handle investigations.

The Criminal Division of the Department of Justice during September,

1959, has held conferences with officials of the Department of Labor for the

purpose of arriving at an agreement to be signed by the Departments of Justice

and Labor specifying those criminal provisions of the law, as well as the

prohibition against a member of the Communist Party holding office in a

labor union, which the FBI will investigate.

Preliminary conferences indicate investigative jurisdiction of the

following violations will be conferred upon the Bureau:

Embezzlement of union funds; payment by an employer of a fine

imposed upon a labor union officer; prohibition against communists and

convicted felons holding union office; picketing for extortion purposes;

deprivation by force or violence of rights of union members; and retention by

FBI of an amendment in the Act broadening the Labor-Management Relations

Act of 1947•

The finalizing of the agreement between the Departments of Justice

and Labor has not been effected. Until it is, we are not initiating investi-

gations without a specific request from the Department of Justice.

We have, however, received 85 specific requests from the Criminal

Division to determine whether certain convicted felons are holding office at

this time in labor unions in violation of that section of the Act (Section 504).

We have also received 52 names of individuals who are reportedly

labor union officials, from the Department, requesting a check of Bureau and

Identification Division files. Eighteen such name checks have been completed.

These were highly placed Teamster officials and trustees. We are not

processing the remaining 34 names until the Department provides us with

further identifying data as to the individuals.

2. FEDERAL CLEARINGHOUSE OF CRIMINAL INFORMATION

Various proposals have been brought forth in the past

by individuals such as Senator Kefauver, Chief William Parker of

the Los Angeles Police Department, Milton Wessel of the Department,

and Senator McClellan for the establishment of a central Federal

clearinghouse of information on crime. More recently New York

State Attorney General Louis J. Lefkowitz has proposed a clearing-

house of information concerning frauds on the consumer and

investor public.

Our position in the past has consistently been that there

is no need for such a clearinghouse and that the necessary and

desirable dissemination of criminal-type information is already

being accomplished within the framework, of existing law enforcement

structures.

Some of the serious objections to such a proposed

clearinghouse are that it would be an unwarranted intrusion of

the Federal Government into local affairs. There is the possibility

that such a clearinghouse would provide an official medium for the

dissemination of unverified data consisting of rumor and gossip

and that corrupt and irresponsible individuals would be presented

with the opportunity to use such information for purposes of blackmail

or extortion. In addition to the foregoing, the establishment of such

a clearinghouse would constitute a costly superstructure on already

existing facilities and could result in the establishment of a "black

list" characterizing certain individuals as violators on the basis of

information not completely verified or authenticated.

The Bureau already disseminates on a dally basis

innumerable items of information to local, county, state and

Federal agencies. This information may not only relate to matters

over which we have jurisdiction but extends to any items which may

be of interest to other agencies. The channels for dissemination of

information are already established and the use of these channels by

all agencies would appear to obviate the need for any central clearing-

house of information.

3. NEED FOR CRIMINAL-TYPE LEGISLATION

Since April 30, 1958, the Bureau has suggested certain items

of legislation relative to establishing some effective curbs on the activities of

racketeers. The most recent communication to the Department in this regard

was a memorandum to Deputy Attorney General Walsh dated September 2g

1959, captioned "Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session."

These legislative suggestions are as follows:

I. There appears to be a need for legislation to prohibit the

interstate transportation of certain gambling paraphernalia, such as number

slips and punch boards in addition to the present prohibition of interstate

transportation of slot machines.

2. It also appears the interstate transmission of gambling

information should be restricted to prohibit the transmission of gambling

information in interstate or foreign commerce by any communication facility.

Such legislation should also encompass the transmission of information as to

the results of horse racing events until after a specified time had elapsed.

The inability to have current race results would discourage the operations of

bookmaking establishments.

3. Inasmuch as under the present provisions of the Internal

Revenue Code income derived from illegal businesses and from gambling

constitutes income which is taxable and assessed in the same manner as

legitimate income, it appears that if the income from such illicit sources were

taxed at vastly higher rates it might make such activities financially prohibitive.

Inasmuch as certain individuals would attempt to avoid such taxes, it might

be desirable to initiate legislation to provide substantial criminal penalties for

the failure to pay such taxes.

4 It also appears legislation may be desirable to amend the

White Slave Traffic Act in order that the prostitute herself could be prosecuted.

There is considerable activity among those who are engaged in this livelihood

and who go from state to state in order to ply their träde.

5. As an added weapon against organized crime, it appears it

may be desirable to afford consideration to the enactment of a Federal habitual

criminal act which would provide for mandatory sentences upon the commission

of offenses within Federal jurisdiction.

In addition, the Bureau is in agreement with the Administration's

theory of amending the Fugitive Felon Act to include damage by fire or

explosives to religious or educational facilities. The House Judiciary Committee

has failed to approve this proposal and has adopted a bill (H. R. 8601) which would

prohibit damage to any building, structure, facility, vehicle or dwelling house.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 823

## Page 824

• .

It is our view that such legislation should be restricted to cover educational

and religious tacilities only. This was called to the Department's attention

by the afore-mentioned memorandum dated September 2, 1959, captioned

"Legislative Program, Eighty-sixth Congress, Second Session. "

DOMESTIC INTELLIGENCE DIVISION

On March 12, 1959, the Director attended a conference in the Attorney

General's office in connection with current security programs and matters

collateral thereto. The Director expressed the view that security programs

had been held in abeyance in the Department of Justice with the result that

other agencies of the Government were taking advantage of such delays and

offering as excuses for nonaction the fact that the Department of Justice

had not yet indicated what should be done or should not be done in view of

some decisions of the courts and anticipated decisions of the courts. The

Director urged that basic action should be taken on certain of these programs.

While some of these matters have been acted upon, others are still pending and

are set forth below for the Director's information.

(1) Industrial Security Program - At the time of the March conference it

was decided to wait until the Greene and Taylor cases had gone through the

Supreme Court. This has now occurred and the Supreme Court has indicated

that there was not proper authority for an Industrial Security Program flowing

from the President or the Congress. The Court also strongly indicated that

even with such authority that there was a need for confrontation of witnesses

at such hearings. To meet this, the Administration is discouraging legislation

and approaching the matter through an Executive Order, two drafts of which

have been examined by the Department and the Bureau.

The proposed Order

appears impractical in some respects and Yeagley of the Department has advised

us that the Attorney General and the Solicitor General do not like the Order as

drafted, particularly the "special counsel" concept and Deputy Attorney General

Walsh is being instructed to "bounce the Order back to the White House." By

letter dated September 30, 1959, to the Attorney Ceral, copies to Walsh and

Yeagley, the Bureau went on record that while we would attempt to live up to

any Order, the Department should carefully consider the position of the Department

and the Bureau under the proposed Order in that we would be forced to turn

down numerous requests to produce informants and sources for testimony or

interview in view of our overriding responsibility to protect their identities in

the interests of national security. This might open the Department and the

Bureau up to criticism that we were not living up to the spirit of the Executive

Order.

From the standpoint of the conference with the Attorney General on

October 6, we think the Bureau's position should be that the Industrial Security Pro-

gram problem should be settled either through Executive Order or legislation;

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 825

-7-

---

## Page 826

Domestic Intelligence Division

that whichever means is used must be practical and not merely drawn up in

a visionary manner in an attempt to satisfy the Supreme Court but end up

by placing the investigative agencies in an untenable position because they

cannot comply with the spirit of the Order.

(2) Port Security Program - There has been no change in the Port Security

Program with the exception that Treasury Department has drafted proposed

legislation to enable the Coast Guard to subpoena and pay the travel expenses of

witnesses to appear at Coast Guard hearings.

Treasury has indicated this

bill is in the Bureau of the Budget. At the March 12, 1959, conference the

Director pointed out that positive action should be taken toward getting such

legislation and the confrontation issue should not be used as an excuse to scrap

the program because the FBI had supplied a substantial number of witnesses

who could appear and testify. The Bureau's position should be the same;

namely, that the wherewithal should be devised to carry forth the program instead

of scrapping it. It should be borne in mind that in Port Security hearings as

in many other security-type hearings the question of confrontation will continue

to be an issue and the pattern set by the Executive Order in the Industrial

Security Program will probably be applied to the other types of security hearings.

(3) Air Crewmen Screening Program - The Air Crewmen Screening

Program is a program proposed by ICLS to screen crews of United States planes

engaged in international flights and to screen all holders of Airmen's Certificates.

The ICIS also proposed the Federal Communications Commission Radio Screening

Program which would require the screening of all operators of radio transmitters.

To our knowledge, nothing has been done on either of these programs since the

March, 1959, conference with the Attorney General. While the FBI originally

concurred that these programs would be helpful, we have not pushed them,

believing this is a proper function of ICIS. It is believed the Bureau's position

should be that a decision should be reached as to whether these programs should

be implemented and they should not be allowed to hang fire on the basis that

they might not be agreeable or acceptable to the Supreme Court. In other words,

security programs should not be left in a status of hiatus because of pending

judicial decisions.

(4) Personnel Security Program - The March, 1959 conference discussed

the Personnel Security Program, particularly whether there should be legislation

to provide for an over-all security program which would cover both sensitive

-8-

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 826

---

## Page 827

Domestic Intelligence Division

and nonsensitive areas. This is still an undecided issue although several bills

have been introduced into Congress to remove the distinction between sensitive

and nonsensitive areas of Federal employment. Undoubtedly, the Greene

decision in the Supreme Court carrying the strong inference that confrontation

is necessary in security-type hearings has slowed up consideration of legislation

in this field by the Department. This is essentially a Departmental problem

and we feel the Bureau's position again should be that the Department should

meet these issues rather than coast along in a state of indecision.

(5) In the field of legislation involving security, by letter dated September 2,

1959, the Bureau proposed to Deputy Attorney General Walsh the following items,

which the Director might wish to point out to the Attorney General. While bills

were introduced into Congress on some of these items, legislation has not been

completed as to any of them.

(a) It is desirable that Title 18, Section 791, United States Code, be

amended to extend the jurisdiction of the

Federal courts over acts of espionage

against the United States wherever committed.

(b) Amendment of the Foreign Agents Registration Act to clarify

and make more specific the definition of a "'Foreign Principal" and to further

clarify the exemption to registration afforded business representatives.

(c) Legislation is suggested which would permit the Secretary of

State to consider security factors in the granting of passports; however,

appropriate provisions should be made to protect FBI informants and sources

in this connection. This matter is mentioned in the Bureau's memorandum

to Walsh dated May 26, 1959, regarding H. R. 7006.

(d) Another suggestion is legislation to strengthen the Smith Act of

1940 by defining the word "organize" and the word "advocacy." A definition

of "organize" was introduced as H. R. 2369 and as S. 1300. S. 1305 attempts

to define "advocacy."

(e) Legislation is needed which would prohibit former Government

employees from disclosing to unauthorized individuals certain information

obtained by them in the course of their employment.

(f) Legislation is needed to amend the espionage laws so as to

provide punishment for persons who gather and correlate data from legitimate

• sources for transmittal to foreign governments.

-NW-62360_Docld:32989646 Page 82L

## Page 828

Domestic Intelligence Division

(6) In addition to the above, the Director may wish to point out to the

Attorney General the tendency on the part of the Department of Justice,

as well as Government departments in general, to shy away from pursuing

• logical courses of action in the security field rather than to implement necessary

security programs, this tendency apparently based on attempts to anticipate

decisions by the Supreme Court. The net effect of this is that the Supreme

Court is not required to meet these issues and render decisions and thus,

historically, to take responsibility for them. It is our feeling it is a far better

course of action to attempt to implement those programs necessary for our

national security and give ground grudgingly and only where forced to do so

so that the record will show that the Department and the FBI sought to

carry out their responsibilities in a proper manner.

FBI BUDGET REQUEST - FISCAL YEAR 1968

The Bureau's request for 1968 totals $186,574,000. It will

provide for a personnel staff totaling 15,780 (6,638 agents and 9,142

clerks). The request makes provision for an increase of 569 full-year

employees (106 agents and 463 clerks) when compared to 1967.

Of the additional employees, 165 (100 agents and 65 clerks)

axe for assignment to the field to assist in the handling of a heavy

volume of civil rights work. (This is the second increment of a

total increase of 300 agents and attendant clerical staff and

equipment previously ordered by the President for civil rights

work over a three-year period to be implemented at the rate of 100 agents

a year.) The remaining 404 employees (6 agents and 398 clerks) are for

assignment at our headquarters, the bulk to be utilized to handle the

tremendous increase in name and fingerprint checks being received.

The request of $186,574,000 for 1968 is an increase of

$4,249,000 when compared to the total requirements for the current

fiscal

year 1967 which includes $175,465,000 already appropriated

and by a supplemental request totaling $6,860,000 brought about

by costs growing out of new legislation increasing our payroll

costs ($5,250,000) and by new legislation 'increasing the costs we

must pay to transfer employees to meet the needs of the service

($1,610, 000) .

Most careful consideration was given to our request for

additional personnel in 1968. We are absorbing much work and will

endeavor to make further absorptions. When confronted. with a

one-million increase in fingerprint receipts, a 43% increase in

name checks, a heavy amount of civil rights and other work, we

have no alternative but to ask for additional manpower if we are to.

meet our responsibilities in these areas.

The Bureau's growing. work is not limited to these particular

areas by any means. The work of the FBI Laboratory mounted to a new

all-time peak during the fiscal year 1966, numerous criminal classifi-

cations reached new highs, and our work in matters vital to the internal

security of the country has continued to increase. We are going to

do our best to handle the mounting work in these areas with our

existing staff. In addition, new items of legislation continue to be

passed adding to our work.

Indicative of our heavy volume of work is the fact that as

of January 1, 1967, pending investigative. matters throughout the

field totaled 150,189, with 5 in a delinquent status. At that time,

the average individual assignment in the field was nearly 26 matters as

compared with 20 at that time in 1961.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE AND ORGANIZED CRIME SECTION

During the past few months the Department has

launched into a program of review of past, current, and

contemplated prosecutions to determine if such cases have

been materially affected by the use of electronic listening

devices. This has required the establishment of special

microphone indices at Bureau Headquarters and voluminous

correspondence with various field divisions to determine if

individuals listed in the Department's inquiries were covered

by FBI microphones. With regard to listed individuals on

whom we have had some form of microphone coverage, we are so

advising the Department and pertinent logs, together in

some cases with other supporting material, are being obtained

from the field for review by Departmental attorneys.

The Department made public the fact that such a

review was under way in the filing of a memorandum with the

Supreme Court by the Solicitor General in the Joseph Schipani

case, November 30, 1966.

Set forth as follows are the brief circumstances

regarding individual prosecutive situations in which, to

date, the Department has made disclosures to various courts

regarding the FBI's use of electronic listening devices of

pertinence to those prosecutions.

Joseph Frank Schipani

Schipani is a New York hoodlum and a member of

La Cosa Nostra who was convicted and sentenced to three years

imprisonment and fined $12,500 for violation of the income tax

laws for the years 1956 through 1960.

In response to the

Department's request, they were provided with logs reporting

those instances where Schipani was covered by an

electronic

surveillance.

This electronic surveillance was not directly

on Schipani but was in an office frequented by top La Cosa

Nostra racket figures. On November 30, 1966, the Solicitor

General requested the

Supreme Court to vacate the judgnent

regarding Schipani of the Court of Appeals and remana the

to the District Court for a new trial. On December 12,

1966,

the Supreme Court complied with the request of the

Solicitor General. This was installed under the general

authority of the Attorney General, as were all of the

following unless otherwise specified.

Louis J. Taglianetti

The Department on December 27, 1966, filed a motion

Appeals for the First

Circuit in the Louis J. Taglianetti appeal from the judgment

of the United States District Court for the District of

Rhode Island. Taglianetti, a member of the Raymond Patriarca

• Nostra, was indicted on February 26, 1963,

for income tax evasion for the years 1956, 1957, and 1958.

He was found guilty on September 16, 1966. Taglianetti

appealed but no brief had

yet been filed.

The Department's motion indicated Taglianetti's

conversations had been monitored by microphone surveillance

at the place of business of a close associate (Raymond Patriarca)

where Taglianetti andothers met and that this establishment

was being utilized for purposes connected with organized crime.

On various occasions between March, 1962, when this microphone

was installed with trespass under general

authority of the

Attorney General, until 1965, Taglianetti's conversations

related to his income tax indictment. None of the information

was used in evidence or was the source of leads to any evidence

in the case.

The Department's motion noted that Taglianetti's

case was within the ambit of the Supreme Court's decision in

the Black case, decided November T, 1966. The distinguishing

feature between the two is the intrusion upon attorney-client

conversations in the Black case, for which the Supreme Court

vacated the conviction and granted a new trial. The Department's

reasons for the motion to remand in Taglianetti was for the

limited purpose of enabling the District Court to examine the

facts and to determine whether Taglianetti's conviction should

stand or a new trial be ordered.

The defense has now filed a motion for new trial

claiming that, "The Government, having tasted the forbidden

fruit of its illegal bugging and having withheld all knowledge

thereof from the defendant, his counsel and the trial judge,

cannot now preserve the conviction thus obtained because such

forbidden fruit failed to produce a sweet taste." Hearings

on these motions have not yet been scheduled.

FRANK DE NIRO, JR.

MICHAEL DE NIRO

LOUIS DE NIRO

The De Niro brothers were convicted 3/23/65 of

conspiring to defraud the U. S. in evading estate taxes.

They have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the

Sixth Circuit.

The Cleveland Office conducted

a microphone

surveillance from 2/19/64 to 6/16/64 in the

office of the

National Cigarette service, Youngstown, Ohio, a vending

machine company, operated by the De Niros.

Department's request 10/14/66 we disclosed the circumstances

ot this surveillance to them by letter 10/18/66, and made

available for review the surveillance logs. No information

from this source was disseminated outside the Bureau.

The Department subsequently disclosed to the

Court of Appeals by memorandum the existance of our

microphone surveillance.

Considerable reluctance vas

displayed by the Department to including in this

memorandum our general authority for installation of

electronic surveillances. They did not clearly record the

dates concerning the manner in which the Department requested

and was advised of our coverage.

Our protests were clearly

outlined in correspondence to the Department before this

memorandum was filed.

Ultimately our authority was recorded

as a footnote.

This microphone was installed under the

general authority of the Attorney General.

Frank Peter Balistrieri

Balistrieri, the "boss" of Milwaukee's La Cosa

Nostra "family," and

as such the leader of organized crime

in that area, was brought to trial in United States District

charging evasion of Federal

income taxes.

An early issue in this action was our

microphone coverage of Balistrieri and certain of his

associates.

Microphone coverage had been established on

Balistrieri's office, in an apartment maintained by his

paramour, and in the office of hoodlum attorney Dominic Frinzi,

all in Milwaukee, for various periods between 1961 and 1965.

These installations were all made in line with general

departmental authorization as outlined in the Department's

memorandum filed with the Supreme Court in the Black case.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 845

## Page 846

The defense has made a motion to suppress, based

on this electronic coverage.

Bureau personnel, and reviewing logs of the coverage in

question, the judge instructed that the trial should be

commenced, with the defense having the right to renew its

mortion after the trial, in the event evidence presented

warrants such a proceedings.

Trial was undertaken on 10/17/66. On 11/29/66

Defense Attorney Walsh suffered a heart attack and further

trial proceedings have been deferred until March 1, 1967.

None of the information produced by this microphone was

utilized in obtaining the indictment of Balistrieri.

Ronald David Carabbia

Carabbia was convicted 6/21/65 for violation of

wagering tax laws and has appealed to the U. S. Court of

Appeals, Sixth Circuit.

The Cleveland Office conducted a

microphone surveillance at the Modern News Center and

Novelties Company, Youngstown, from 1/22/62 until 3/22/62.

Carabbia and his brothers operated a gambling game at this

location. Activities covered by this surveillance included

gambling with numerous participants.

The voices of the

individuals covered were never identified. It could not be

determined if the appellant was or was not present during

the operation of this source.

In response to the Department's inquiry, we

disclosed to them by letter dated 11/1/66 the circumstances

of this surveillance and made available for review all

surveillance logs.

By letter dated 1/9/67, the Department

indicated its intention to disclose this microphone

surveillance by memorandum to the U. S. Court of Appeals,

Sixth Circuit. In three letters we

have advised the Department

of the brief operation of this source and that the individuals

covered were never identified. The Department's proposed

memorandum to the court notes,

"There is a substantial

question whether any conversations in which appellant

participated were even monitored."

In spite of this, the

Department apparently feels it must disclose this surveillance.

The Department failed to include our general authorization for

installation of electronic surveillances over our protests.

We feel that at the very least the general authorization of the

Department should be in all briefs going to courts so there can

be no accusation that the Bureau was operating in an uncontrolled

and unrestrained manner.

Jack T. Rainwater

Jack T. Rainwater has conducted a large-scale

numbers operation in the Miami, Florida area.

He and six

associates were convicted of state gambling violations in

Florida courts based upon evidence furnished by the

Internal Revenue Service and testimony of Internal Revenue

Service agents.

In response to the Department's request they.

were provided with logs

reporting those instances where

Rainwater and one of his associates who also was convicted

in state court, were monitored by an electronic surveillance.

Neither of these individuals were the direct subject of an

electronic surveillance.

On January 11, 1967, the Solicitor General

disclosed to the Supreme Court that an electronic device

had been utilized by Federal agents in the Rainwater matter.

Our installation in this matter was made under

general authority of the Attorney General. Information from

this source was disseminated to Internal Revenue Service who

in turn disseminated to local

authorities.

Charles Joseph Battaglia, Jr.

Battaglia is a Tucson, Arizona, La Cosa Nostra

member who was closely affiliated with Joseph Bonanno a

former La Cosa Nostra "Commission" member. A microphone

for criminal intelligence purposes had been maintained on

him under general Departmental authority. He was arrested by

Bureau Agents for violation of the Hobos

Act in March, 1965,

• as a result of making threats in an effortto force a

firm to utilize his vending machins. Following the granting

of several continuances the trial judge in Federal District

Court ordered Battaglia to appear for trial on the morning

of January 11, 1967,

The Department advised that they intended

to infonm the judge

that Battaglia had been covered by microphone

surveilladces, but that the coverage had no bearing on the

evidence to be produced in substantiation of the criminal

charges against Battaglia. The Department further advised

-7-

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 847

---

## Page 848

they were going to recommend that the judge proceed with

the trial and at the conclusion thereof, if the judge feels

it necessary, a hearing will be held to determine the validity

of the Department's claim regarding the microphone evidence.

A hearing on this motion is scheduled for Monday,

January 16, 1967, in Tucson, Arizona.

Edward I. Levinson, et. al., Civil Suit

On December 10, 1965, Edward Levinson, at that time

one of the owners of the

Fremont Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada,

Illed a $0, 000,000 damage suit (later reduced to $4,200, 000)

against four Bureau Agents, charging invasion of privacy and

asking injunctive relief

against further invasion by use of

electronic listening devices. Levinson filed a similar suit

against the Central Telephone Company of Las Vegas and certain

of its employees.

The case has recently been taken over personally by

Assistant Attorney General Barefoot Sanders who is presently

reviewing all of the material in connection with preparing

a response to plaintiff's motions. No date has been set for

trial in matter. The Bureau has been pressing the Department

to take depositions in this case from such major hoodlums as

Meyer Lansky and Gerardo Catena who have hidden interests in

the Fremont Hotel.

Fred B. Black, Jr.

Fred B. Black, JI., named as being hired by front

men in Las Vegas to represent their interests in Washington,

D. Co, where Black was alleged to have influence, was convicted

on May 5, 1965, of evading income taxes. for the period of

1956 through 1959. After a number of appeals he petitioned the

Supreme Court for

issuance of a writ of certiorari which was

denied on May 4, 1966.

On May 24, 1966, Solicitor General Thurgood Marshall

filed a memorandum with the Supreme Court reporting a listening

device had*been placed in Black's hotel suite in 1963, but

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 848

- 8 -

---

## Page 849

none of the evidence used in Black's trial was obtained as

a result of the listening device.

The Supreme Court on

June 13, 1966, ordered a response by the Department to

questions raised by the Court with regard to the initial

memorandum filed by the Department which was answered on

July 13, 1966, by supplemental memorandum.

This memorandum indicated the listening device,

installed with trespass under general Departmental authori~

zation had monitored conversations of Black and his attorney.

The United States Supreme Court on November 7, .

1966,

vacated the income tax conviction and granted a new

trial, which will

not be set until after the Robert Baker trial.

. •

To date, the Bureau

has received over 1,000 names

of individuals of prosecutive interest for a determination

if such subjects have been covered by FBI microphones.

number of problems have resulted.

One problem which has been encountered, and

which can be expected to be even more serious in the future,

is the lack of identifying data accompanying the names of

individuals on whom the Department has made inquiry in these

matters. For example, one list recently received included

475 names, in some cases with a minimum of identifying data

and in others with no identifying data at all. In order that

an accurate determination can

be made whether

an individual

in question has, in fact, been covered by one of our microphones,

it will be necessary that the Department provide adequate

identifying data when submitting these names for review.

- 9 -

- NW- 65360-Đocid:32989646-Page-849.

---

## Page 850

An attendant problem has arisen in certain

inquiries in which the Department has made

unreasonable

requests for such reviews on extremely short notice. One of

these involved a request for the results of the review later

the same day it was received. Thoroughness and accuracy, of

absolute necessity in this type review, make extremely rapid

checks such as this in most cases impossible, and at best,

a very dangerous procedure.

With regard to those situations in which the

Department has made disclosures to the various courts,

continuing reluctance has been evidenced on their part to

inform the court of the fact that the installation in question

has been utilized by the FBI under either specific authority

from the Attorney General, or under the general Departmental

authority which was granted.

The Department has been repeatedly

reminded of their reluctance in these individual situations.

The volume involved in this project has caused

a decided strain on the Bureau in processing these numerous

inquiries to date, and these problems become magnified when

the enormity of the entire project is assessed,

in view of

indications by the Department that the full review may

encompass as many as 30,000 names.

FUGITIVE SECTION

Cassius Marcellus Clay

Cassius Clay, world's heavyweight boxing

Champion and Black Muslim, earlier this year filed a

claim as a conscientious objector and more recently has

applied to his draft board at Louisville, Kentucky, for

a ministerial deferment as a minister of the Black Muslim

religion.

After a very extensive investigation by the

Bureau, Clay's draft board denied his claim as a

conscientious objector and placed him in a 1-A classification.

Since the board's vote was unanimous, he has no further

appeal as a conscientious objector.

His ministerial

deferment request will now have to be considered by his

local board which our sources indicate will meet in the

next few days.

If the local board denies this request,

Clay has the right to appeal.

DOMINICAN SITUATION

The FBI was ordered into the Dominican Republic by

the President in May, 1965, to develop information to be used

in preventing communists from gaining control in that country.

We set up a staff of ten Agents.

House instructions we established a permanent Legal Attache

office there, staffed with three Agents.

The six-month-old government under Joaquin Balaguer

has brought about a degree of stability. Nevertheless, there

continue to be strong undercurrents of

dissension. The

rightists reportedly have considered plots to remove

Balaguer•

Juan Bosch's political party, loser in the June, 1966, election,

has been most vocal in its opposition to Balaguer's programs.

The communist groups have suffered much internal dissension

but to accomplish a common cause could be expected to regroup

as they have in the past. In fact, a student strike in Santo

Domingo, which began January 9, 1967, has attracted strong

communist support and has served as a rallying point for the

extreme leftists. Within two days, seventy percent of the

students in secondary schools had

joined the strike.

This is but one of numerous problems which beset

Balaguer, although to date he has been able to meet each one

head on.

Boeckenhaupt,

a Staff Sergeant, United States

Air Force, entered military service in 1960. He is a crypto-

graphic systems maintenance and repairman and possessed "Top

Secret" clearance.

On April 20, 1966, he was detected by FBI

Agents in a clandestine meeting in suburban Virginia with

Aleksey R. Malinin,

"Soviet Embassy employee and reportedly a

Colonel of Soviet Military Intelligence:

On October 24, 1965, Boeckenhaupt was arrested by

Air FOrCE rEplestuaTivES at Harch Ait Force Pace, Riverside,

California, for violating the Uniform Code of Military Justice

in that he

failed to report his contacts with representative of

a foreign government (Malinin).

On October 31, 1966, a complaint was filed before the

United States Commissioner, Los Angeles, charging Boeckenhaupt

with conspiracy to commit espionage.

He was indicted by a Federal

Grand Jury,

Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria, Virginia,

on December 16, 1966, for conspiracy to

• commit espionage and for

conspiracy to act.as

an agent of a toreign governnent without

prior notification to the Department of state.

On January 9,

1967, his court-appointed attorney submitted data to the Clerk

of the United States District Court, Alexandria, Virginia;

requesting that Boeckenhaupt's trial be kept in the Central

District of California,

and that Boeckenhaupt not be removed to

the Eastern District of Virginia to stand trial in this matter.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Martin Luther King, Jr., President, Southern Christian

Leadership Conference, is

currently writing a book to be entitled

"Where Do We Go From Here" to be published in the spring. This-

book allegedly will deal with the resurgence of the "white back-

movement.

King has been counseled by Stanley Levison, his principal advisor

and long-time communist, to run for President of

the United States

in 1968.

He has this suggestion under consideration and

reportedly has made no decision. We maintain a wire tap on

Stanley Levison to determine the degree of communist influence

in the racial field.

STOKELY CARMICHAEL

Stokely Carmichael, Chairman, Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee, a

highly militant civil rights

organization, continues to make inilammatory statements

advocating violence as a means of obtaining Negro objectives

as well as urging Negroes not fight in Vietnam.

At present,

Carmichael is facing charges of "inciting to riot" in Atlanta,

Georgia, and Selma, Alabama. He was convicted of these charges

in Selma, Alabama; however, the conviction is currently under

appeal by him. Carmichael

recently underwent a physical

I'e-

examination to determine his suitability for military service.

The results of this examination have not been made known.

ROBERT G. BAKER

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

The most recent development relative to the trial

of Baker is the disclosure in the afternoon edition of "The

Evening Star," 1/12/67, that the Narcotics Bureau of the

Treasury Department installed a "bug" in the Baker case.

It

is reported that this installation relates to the Department's

admission during the trial that it had planted a microphone

and transmitter on Wayne Bromley, a prime Government witness,

in order to record the results of a meeting held on 3/26/65,

at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel, Los Angeles, California, which

was attended by Baker, Clifford Jones and Bromley. The

article points out that the FBI had refused a request of the

Department to cover this meeting.

It also points out that

accoraing to award Bennett Williams,. Baker's attorney, that

in compliance with an order of Judge Gasch to turn over tapes

and transcripts, only notes made by two monitors were received

indicating the tape was not usable or available.

This meeting at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel is the

meeting which was arranged during telephone calls on 3/25/65,

between Bromley and Baker and Bromley and Jones which were

monitored and tape recorded by the Bureau at the request of

the Department, with the Department's assurance that such action

was legal and with the written consent of Bromley.

A complete

transcript of these recordings was made available to the

Department.

Although the Department did on 3/25/65,

request that

we monitor the meeting in Los Angeles, we refused to do so.

Upon revelation during pretrial hearings that this meeting

was monitored, Acting Attorney General Ramsey Clark was questioned

as to who performed this monitoring. He stated that he had ascer-

tained that upon the FBI's refusal to comply with the departmental

request, the Department had then turned to rither the Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) or the Bureau of Narcotics.

He was certain that it was the Bureau of Narcotics.

The only other coverage of any conversations by Baker

was accidental in nature and resulted from installations which

had been placed on Fred B. Black in Washington, D. C.; the

F remont Hotel, Las

Vegas, Nevada; Edward Siegelbaum, Miami,

- 19 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 874

## Page 875

Florida, (ald In connection with organized

crime matters) and

the Dominican Embassy (in connection with security matters).

Details concerning these installations were set forth in a

summary memorandum regarding the Bureau's involvement in the

prosecution of Baker. dated 1/10/67.

Logs relative to the electronic surveillances on

Black, the E remont Hotel

and Siegelbaum were furnished to

the Department and excerpts were furnished to the trial judge

who ordered that they be made available to the defense.

These

logs were the subject of pretrial hearings during November, 1966,

following which the judge ruled that there was no causal

relationship between the information in the logs and the

charges in the indictment.

Logs concerning Baker's conversations intercepted

on the Dominican Embassy installation were similarly furnished

to the Department and to the trial judge who placed a

protective order thereon and has instructed that any dis-

cussions relative to them must be held only in his chambers.

Information as to the existence of these logs has been

leaked to the press, presumably by Edward Bennett Williams

to cause some action favorable to his client. His reporting

to the trial judge that the FBI was responsible for this leak

is absolutely ridiculous and is completely unfounded.

JAMES RIDDLE HOFFA; ET AL.

OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE

James Riddle Hoffa and three others were convicted

in Chattanooga Federal Court, 3/4/64, o1 obstruction oi

justice related to their efforts to tamper with certair

members of the jury in a previous trial of Hoffa.

convictions were upheld by the U. S. Supreme Court on 12/12/66.

In response to a request from Assistant Attorney

we furnished a letter to the

the conversations of Hoffa and two other defendants were

overheard through the use of electronic devices. Hoffa, his

office, and his home were not the direct targets of any

electronic devices in the development of this case, and the

Acting Attorney General was so advised in our memorandum of.

12/29/66.

The instances in which he appeared to have been

present at conversations monitored occurred in Detroit,

Michigan, and Las Vegas, Nevada.

In 1961 and 1962 our Detroit office overheard

three conversations of Hoffa,

These conversations were

broadcast to and from radio-telephones in automobiles

operated by Teamsters Union personnel in the Detroit area.

This was accomplished through the use of a tunable

commercial-type FM radio receiver which was in operation in

our Detroit:

office. No trespass was involved in this

connection.

In addition, between 2/1 and 8/12/63, Hoffa

appears to have participated in four telephone

conversations

with two Las Vegas hoodlum figures who were being covered by

electronic eavesdropping devices (trespass involved).

Hoffa's part of these conversations was not overheard.

Zeno Thomas Osborn, Jr., (Nashville lawyer and

former attorney for Hoffa) was convicted 5/29/64, in

Nashville Federal Court of obstruction of justice

arising

from his attempts to influence a potential juror in a forth-

coming trial of Hoffa. In this investigation, a miniature

recorder was concealed on a cooperative Government witness

during a meeting with Osborn.

This installation was made

at the request of the Department and with the prior approval

of the two Federal judges in Nashville.

No trespass was

involved, and the use of this installation was brought out

fully during Osborn's trial. His conviction was affirmed by

the Supreme Court 12/12/66. The Department is fully aware of

- 21 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 876

---

## Page 877

this installation and details of same were included in our

letter to the Acting Attorney General 12/29/66.

At the specific request of former Attorney General

Kennedy, a microphone surveillance (trespass required) was

conducted on the Washington, D. C., hotel room of James E.

Haggerty (former attorney for James Riddle Hoffa) during

period 8/7/61, through 8/11/61. This coverage was for the

specific purpose of identifying an alleged "contact" of

Hoffa's in the Justice Department, whom Kennedy thought

Haggerty would meet in Washington.

Information concerning

this coverage was included in our letter to the Acting

Attorney General dated 12/29/66.

In addition, in response

to a letter from Vinson dated 12/29/66, we furnished the

Acting Attorney General copies of logs, prepared in connection

with this coverage by memorandum dated 1/6/67.

JURY PANEL INVESTIGATIONS

On January 9, 1967, a letter was forwarded to

the Acting Attorney General

advising him that in view of

the increasing sensitiveness to intrusion by the Federal

Government into the rights of defendants in criminal

trials and in order to assure that future requests for

jury panel investigations would be made only in truly

exceptional cases, investigations of this nature should

not be undertaken

by the Bureau except upon the specific

written request of the Attorney General or the Deputy

Attorney General

and that our field offices

were being so

instructed.

CIVIL RIGHTS MATTERS IN MISSISSIPPI

Two major civil rights cases are awaiting

prosecutive action in Mississippi. One of these cases

involves the murder of three civil rights workers near

Philadelphia, Mississippi, in dune, 1904, in which case

eighteen subjects were previously indicted on civid rights

charges by a Federal Grand Jury.

The other case involves

the shooting and burning of the residence of Vernon Ferdinand

Dahmer, past president of the NAAC?, near Hattiesburg,

Mississippi, in January, 1966, resulting in the death of

Dahmer.

A Federal Grand Jury

indicted fifteen members of

the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi

relative to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Civil Rights

Statute.

In view of a court decision subsequent to the

above indictments, it was determined by the Government that

all of the indictments in these two cases are faulty because

certain minority groups including Negroes had been excluded

from the grand

jury.

The Department has been pushing for

early representations to a properly composed grand jury and

had contemplated that both of these cases would be given to

a Federal Grand Jury being empaneled 1/16/57.

On 1/3/67 U. S. District Judge Harold Cox advised

SAC Roy Moore that he had instructed the U.S. Attorney to

use the January grand jury for the purpose of

checking into

possible misuse of funds in the Headstart project sponsored

by the Office of Economic Opportunity in Mississippi. The

Judge referred to press accounts stating that the Government

was providing additional money for this project although

it has been alleged that several hundred thousand dollars

of the initial appropriation was unaccounted for. Judge Cox

said that he felt

"first things come first" and thereiore

decided to use the grand jury to ferret out any possible

fraud in connection with the failure to account for these

funds. He stated he would advise SAC Moore when he convenes

another grand jury to hear the civil rights cases. Judge Cox

added that this will be done sometime in the near future

but that no specific date has been set.

It has been

speculated in the press that if judge

Cox fails to promptly

call a

grand jury to hear the civil rights cases the

Government will seek mandamus from the U.S. Circuit Court

of Appeals for the purpose of forcing Judge Cox to call a

grand jury to hear these cases.

PROPOSED LEGISLATION REGARDING CRIMES

AGAINST BANKING INSTITUTIONS

By letter to the Attorney General 3/1/65, we called

attention to the rise in crimes against banking institutions and

recommended the Department propose legislation which would require

bank supervisory agencies to establish minimum security requirements

for all banks under Federal Charter. A follow-up letter was sent on

3/29/65, and again on 3/1/66. The Department advised on 4/12/66,

that a legislative proposal was being developed. A proposed bill was

submitted for our review on 6/6/66, which we returned on 6/9/66,

recommending no changes. In reply to our inquiry on 7/25/66, the

Department, on 8/3/66, advised the Bill was under study by the

Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

We inquired again on 10/6/66, and on 10/26/66, were

advised that since the 89th Congress was so near an end, the legis-

lation would be included on program for 90th Congress. By letter

11/28/66, we were advised that the Bill had been returned to the

Criminal Division with certain observations and suggestions. On

1/9/67, we again called attention to the increase in violations. Current

figures show that during calendar year 1966, violations increased to

1871, a new all-time high, surpassing the 1749 violations in calendar

year 1965.

• WALTER BERYL CHIPMAN, ET AL.

CRIME ON HIGH SEAS

Alvin Junior Cupp, who had received a five-year

Federal term on 3/16/65, in Marquette

, Michigan, furnished

information to Chicago Agents pinpointing officials and "goons"

of the Seamens International Union (SIU) responsible for the

1963 bombing of the Canadian treighter, "Howard I, Shaw'

in Chicago, Illinois.

Upon Cupp's parole from prison 12/23/66, he was

immediately contacted by union officials allegedly for the purpose

of paying him off a promised $8, 000 for maintaining his silence

relative to the "Howard L. Shaw" bombing while in prison.

The U. S. Attorney's office in Chicago requested that an

electronic device be attached to Cupp's person to record con-

versations with union officials, anticipating evidence would be

obtained whereby prosecution of these officials would be

forthcoming. SAC, Chicago advised the U. S. Attorney on

1/4/67, that the Bureau could not accede to his request since the

Solicitor General had publicly announced that all eavesdropping

is illegal.

At approximately 9 P.M., 1/5/67, the Acting Attorney

General called Mr. DeLoach relative to this case, indicating he

felt this was a legal device and he could see no reason why it

should not be used. Mr. DeLoach informed the Acting Attorney

General if he felt this way he should put these views in writing,

since the FBI could not afford to be criticized on one hand and then

on the other hand be directed by the Departmentto enter into such

procedures. The Acting Attorney General, upon a moment's

reflection, stated that in view of the "psychological situation" he

probably would not put this request in writing and perhaps would

inform the Organized Crime Section of the Department not to

request the FBI to utilize this device. We have since received no

such request from the Acting Attorney General.

SYNOPSIS

BUREAU STATISTICS

FBI Personnel As of 2/13/69 there were 6,929 Special Agents and

9, 052 flerical employees for a total of 15, 981 employees on the

rolls of the FBI.

Overtime Services The overtime service by our investigative

staff averages more than two and one-half hours each workday

and during fiscal year 1968 totaled 3, 845, 161 hours, the equiva-

lent of 1, 849 additional employees on a full-year basis. This was

a cost-free saving to the Government of over $14 million.

National Crime Crime Index for January-September, 1968,

recorded a 19 percent increase. Largest increases noted in cities

250, 000 to 1 million population where a 22 percent rise was

recorded. There were an estimated 4. 6 million serious crimes

in the United States in 1Y6ờ compared to 5. ở minion in 1S07.

District of Columbia Crime For calendar year 1967, District had

sixth highest crime rate among the 56 cities 250, 000 and above.

Crime figures for calendar year 1968 indicate District recorded

an over-all gain of 25 percent in the number of serious offenses.

'Black Panther Party is most active, notorious and violence-prone

black extremist group. Branches in 25 cities. Will possibly go

underground. Minister of Education is George Mason Murray, a

suspended instructor at San Francisco State College.

Soviet and Satellite Espionage The U. S. is the number one

espionage target of Soviet Union and satellites. Intelligence

operations coordinated by Soviet Union. Embassies and missions

are focal points. As of February, 1969, approximately 230 Soviet

and 117 satellite personnel operating. Consular Convention

between U. S. and Soviet Union became effective July 13, 1968,

and will probably increase capability for espionage.

SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) Since the Bureau

of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD) was formed under the

jurisdiction of the Department, the -FBI has been conducting back-

ground investigations on its applicants and employees. This was

done pursuant to Departmental Order #175-59, dated 4-1-59.

However, the BNDD was discovered to be conducting some dupli-

cate investigation of their clerical applicants. We objected to this

wasted effort and expressed our views to the Department which

countered with a proposal advanced by Associate BNDD Director

Giordano, that we share parts of these investigations with them.

By letter

of 2-6-69, in reply to this proposal, we informed the

Department that no additional requests for BNDD applicant investiga-

tions would be accepted, except those submitted under the

provisions of the Federal Employee Security Program.

Martin Edward Underwood Underwood, an employee of the

Department of Commerce, who was detailed to the White House in

1966 to serve as an advance man for former President Johnson,

was removed from his office at the White House on 2-6-69, and the

Department of Commerce has been instructed to inform him that

his services are no longer required. Our investigation of Underwood,

which was furnished the White House on 2-12-69, disclose that he

had severe drinking problem until at least 1964.

Virginia Stanfill Savell We conducted a discreet inquiry of Savell

in September, 1966, at the request of former Senator Kuchel (R)

of Califernia, for whom she then worked in his Los Angeles office.

It had been alleged she was operating a bookie joint out of the

Senator's office but our inquiry developed no information to sub-

stantiate this. However, it was reported that she was an alcoholic.

Current investigation revealed Savel attempted to commit suicide

in July, 1967, by overdose of sleeping pills.

Donald Edward Ganoung We have investigated Ganoung as a

Departmental applicant for the position of consultant with the Law

Enforcement Administration at Washington, D. C., the position

he now holds. He has a degree in criminology and is a former

Episcopalian priest who has worked among deviate elements. He

has also been active in civil rights and antidraft demonstrations

and twice was arrested in this connection. Divorced by his wife

in 1967 after he had an affair with another woman, Ganoung also

The results of our investigation of him

were furnished to the Attorney General on 2/11/69.

William Henry Rentschler Rentschler, a candy company operator,

has been extremely active in Illinois Republican Party politics. He

carried on a notorious adulterous relationship which led to a divorce

from a former wife. Our investigation of him revealed many

prominent persons who would not recommend Rentschler for a

position with the Government in view of his moral weaknesses and

reported lack of business acumen. Our investigation not yet com-

plete but summary memo furnished the White House on 2/10/69.•

Special Inquiry Investigations for the White House Security officers

of various Government agencies have expressed shock at the lack

of knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the Federal

Employee Security Program by the White House staff responsible

for filling top-level positions with the new Administration. Most

requests for investigation have been of persons already firmly estab-

lished in their new jobs. When derogatory data is developed it is

simply requested that the investigation be continued. Only one person

is known to have been discharged as a result of derogatory information

developed during investigation. Don Virdin, Internal Revenue Service

(IRS), called Bureau 2/13/69 and indicated Bureau had checked through

IRS only 8 of last 25 publicly announced Presidential appointees.

Bureau has run checks of IRS on all requests received from White

House on Presidential appointees and it would appear White House

only asked for 8 of last 25 to be checked.

Selective Service These cases in recent years have broadened in

scope with recurring schemes to obstruct the draft. We have 14, 000

pending investigations, up 5, 000 from a year ago.

Fiscal year 1968

produced 809 convictions and the first seven months of this fiscal

period have recorded 380 convictions, an increase over this period

a year ago. An interesting case is summarized which involves an

18-year-old Californian whose mother, following his arraignment

for failure to register for the draft, attempted to get a Restraining

Order by contending that she was responsible for her son's actions

e

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 893

## Page 894

and therefore should be punished rather than him. The Judge

rejected her appeal and her son's trial is scheduled for March,

1969.

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime While our

organized crime investigations are aimed at key members in the

power structure, they have also struck hard in the lower echelons

with progressively greater penetration into the heart of hoodlum

activities - gambling operations.

Fiscal year 1968 capped four

consecutive record years in convictions of organized crime figures

with 281. There are now 789 other hoodlum figures awaiting trial

in Federal court thus indicating a continuance of the upward trend

• in convictions in fiscal year 1969. Recent major accomplishments

in the organized crime field include the arrest or conviction of

many top La Cosa Nostra leaders across the country. Our dissem-

ination of criminal intelligence data to other Federal and local law

enforcement agencies has broken the million mark in number of

items in the past five years. This sharea FBI data enabled other

law enforcement agencies to conduct hundreds of raids, execute

thousands of arrests, and recover millions of dollars in gambling

funds or stolen property each year.

Department Task Force

Operations (also called Strike Force) have been formed in Detroit,

Michigan; Brooklyn, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;

Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey; since

the original group at Buffalo, New York. We now maintain liaison

with these Task Force groups and it has been recommended that

we expand our liaison arrangements with Task Force. There have

been La Cosa Nostra leadership changes in New York and Chicago.

Department's Manual for use of Electronic Surveillance Under Title

Ill of Omnibus Crime Control Bill Attorney General has been fur-

nished our views regarding Department's draft manual for use of

electrical surveillance pursuant to Title Ill bf Omnibus Crime Control

Bill, the general provisions of which concern administrative regulations

not specifically required by the statute itself. The manual's requirements

would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions

on the FBI and other Federal agencies to the point that strictcompliance

might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining discreet electronic

surveillance coverage under court supervision for the purpose of

obtaining admissible evidence against the leadership of organized

crime and in other major investigative categories. Included would

be requirements for review of an application for a court order at a

number of levels within the Department, and by the Attorney General,

before the application reached the judge, involving delay and the

spreading of information about our use of this technique among a

comparatively wide range of authorities. Included in our views

was our belief that for the Government's ultimate success in making

use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions must not apply

which will create more limitations on law enforcement than the statute

itself prescribes.

BUREAU STATISTICS

FBI Personnel

As of 2/13/69 there were 6, 929 Special Agents and

9, 052 clerical employees for a total of 15, 981 employees on the

rolls of the FBI.

Overtime Services

The overtime service by our investigative staff

averages more than two and one-half hours each workday and

during the fiscal year 1968 totaled 3, 845, 461 hours, the equiva-

lent of 1, 849 additional employees on a full-year basis. Taking

into consideration the limited extent to which this overtime was

compensated under fringe benefits regulations of the Civil Service

Commission, there was a cost-free saving to the Government of

over $14 million when compared to the value of the total overtime

performed. This is a tremendous voluntary contribution by our

investigative staff.

National Crime

While preliminary crime figures for calendar year

1968 are not yet available, for the period January through

September, 1968, over the same period in 1967, the Crime Index

nationwide recorded a 19 percent increase. The largest increases

were noted in cities 250, 000 to 1 million population where a 22

percent rise was recorded. Nationally, the violent crimes of

murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault as a group

increased 21 percent and the more voluminous property crimes of

burglary, larceny $50 and over and auto theft rose 19 percent. There

were an estimated 4. 6 million serious crimes in the United States

in 1968 compared to 3. 8 million in 1967.

District of Columbia Crime

For calendar year 1967, Washington, D. C., had the

sixth highest crime rate among the 56 cities 250, 000 population and

above. Crime figures for calendar year 1968 indicate that

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 896

## Page 897

Washington, D. C., recorded an over-all gain of 25 percent in the

number of serious offenses.

National Crime Information Center (NCIC)

NCIC is a nationwide index of documented law

enforcement information on crime and criminals. Its objective

is to improve the effectiveness of law enforcement through the

more efficient handling and exchange of information. In January,

1967, a pilot operation was begun with terminals in 15 local and

state law enforcement agencies. NCIC now has 78 control termi-

nals in 47 states, the District of Columbia and Canada. North

Carolina and Wyoming will be added in the near future; however,

Alaska will be delayed due to very high communication circuit

costs. The files consist of stolen motor vehicles, license plates,

firearms, other identifiable stolen property including securities,

and wanted persons. Over 780, 000 records are in the system and

more than 33, 000 messages are handled each day. Positive

responses to inquiries wherein a record is furnished now exceed

220 each 24 hours. NCIC is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a

week.

Racial Unrest on College Campuses

Campuses throughout the United States have been

marked by racial unrest as exemplified by the current disrup-

tions at San Francisco State College, San Francisco, California;

and the University of California, Berkeley, California. Such

groups as the Third Horld Liberation Front, a coalition of

minority groups, and the Black Student Union are becoming

increasingly militant and violence prone in presenting their

demands to college authorities. Demands made by such

groups

include the establishment of a separate college for minority

groups, particularly Negroes; the establishment of black

courses; the hiring of minority group professors and adminis-

trators; and the control of hiring and firing of faculty mem-

bers by students.

At San Francisco State College over 400

individuals have

been arrested during a current wave of dis-

ruption and attempts are being made to force the College to

close.

Students for a Democratic Society and other militant

groups have joined in these demonstrations and offer full

support to minority groups.

Black Panther Party

The Black Panther Party is the most active,

notorious, violence-prone black extremist organization. In

the past nine months it has established branches in 25 cities

across the country with a hard-core membership of at least 1,200.

The latest development is the order from national

headquarters to stop recruiting for a time in order to weed

out informants and undesirables and concentrate on political

indoctrination based on the writings of MAO Tse-tung of Com-

munist China. There is also increasing discussion of the

necessity for going underground.

The Black Panther Party Minister of Education

George Mason Murray, a suspended instructor at San Francisco

State College, holds a position on the Central Committee of

the Black Student Union at that College.

The Black Student

Union instigated the campus unrest which has plagued this

institution during the current school year.

Soviet and Satellite Espionage

target of the Soviet Union and its European satellites

(Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,

and Romania).

Assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy

The essence of the Clay Shaw trial in New Orleans

Iles In the connection New Orleans District Attorney, James C.

Garrison is attempting to establish between Lee Harvey Oswald,

David Ferrie (now deceased), and Clay Shaw. The principal

witness has been Perry Russo who has said Oswald, Ferrie,

and Shaw discussed assassinating President Kennedy at a

meeting in Ferrie's apartment in New Orleans in September,

1963 .

Immediately following the assassination of President

Kennedy, the FBI received allegations of a connection between

Ferrie and Oswald.

These allegations were thoroughly and

exhaustiveiy invesiigai.

No evidence was over develoved

that Oswald and Ferrie were acquainted.

Clay Shaw's name

never came up in the investigation and the FBI never

investigated him.

The FBI has held to a "hands-off" policy regarding

Garrison's investigation. Although ve are closely following

Shaw's trial, we have no observers in the courtroom. It is

noted that the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice

has an unoflicial observer in the courtroom.

Garrison's mental stability is questionable. He

received a medical discharge in October, 1951, from the U. S,

Army for an emotional problem. He acmitted to Army authorities

that he had received psychiatric treatment. Garrison was a

Special Agent of the fBI for four months, resigning to

re-enter military service in July, 1951.

GENERAL INVESTIGATIVE OPERATIONS

SUGGESTIONS FOR THE

REDUCTION OF CRIME IN

THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA

In connection with the juvenile problem in the District of

Columbia, it is suggested that an Enabling Statute be passed which

would allow juveniles to be handled in the District of Columbia as they

are throughout the United States; publicize the names of the juveniles

involved in serious crimes and maintain and make available juvenile

records to law enforcement agencies. In areas of high crime,

improved street lighting should be installed.

Mandatory sentences are recommended for crimes

committed with the use of firearms or involving threats, and a

habitual criminal statute might be effective. Consideration could be

given to the registration of all convicted felons in the District, as

well as a law requiring registration of firearms.

Authorities responsible for allowing prisoners to be

released under the "Work Release Program" should thoroughly

consider their prior records so that vicious felons will not be returned

to the streets. In addition, prosecutors should not accept guilty pleas

on one count while dismissing other counts; and abolition of capital

punishment should be opposed until a life sentence means "life."

As a deterrent to bank robberies, District banks should

on a voluntary basis accelerate the implementation of the provisions

of the Bank Protection Act of 1968, and consideration should be given

to the deployment of one police officer and a bank guard to selected

institutions.

More stringent penalties should be invoked for violations

of gambling laws, and sentences should be made stiffer for second

• offenders.

KIDNA PING

On December 17, 1968, 20-year-old Barbara Jane Mackle

was abducted from an Atlanta, Georgia, area motel. A $500, 000

ransom demand was subsequently made of her father, Robert Mackle,

a Coral Gables, Florida, resident and business official. FBI

investigation resulted in the safe return of Miss Mackle, who had

been buried in a coffin-like box northeast of Atlanta, Georgia; the

recovery of most of the ransom money; and the apprehension of one.

of the subjects, identified as Gary Steven Krist. An all-out investi-

gation continues to locate Ruth Eisemann-Schier, the other subject

in this case. Federal charges were filed in Miami, Florida, against

subjects for violation of Extortion Statute, Interstate Transportation

in Aid of Racketeering Statute, and the Aiding and Abetting Statute.

The subjects were indicted in DeKalb County, Georgia, for kidnaping

on January 13, 1969. The Bureau has furnished results of its

investigations to local authorities and is cooperating in the state

trial which will be held in this matter. Krist was brought before the

circuit court in DeKalb County, Georgia, on February 7, 1969, at

which time the court appointed two attorneys to represent him. One

of the attorneys is James R. Venable, who has been for many years

Imperial Wizard for the National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Inc.

A three-week delay was requested by the attorneys, and the judge set

the next appearance for February 28, 1969.

DISCONTINUANCE OF BACKGROUND

INVESTIGATIONS ON CLERICAL

APPLICANTS FOR THE BUREAU OF

NARCOTICS AND DANGEROUS DRUGS

(BNDD)

The Bureau has been conducting background

investigations on applicants and employees of the BNDD

since that agency came under the jurisdiction of the

Department.

These investigations were conducted pursuant

to Departmental Order #175-59 dated April 1, 1959.

Our Chicago Division learned that BNDD had been

conducting preemployment checks to include credit and

criminal investigation, interviews with former employers,

supervisors, and references.

On January 21, 1969, both

Assistant Attorney General for Administration Pellerzi

and Associate Director Giordano, BNDD, agreed with the

Bureau's position that conducting duplicate investigations

of clerical applicants for BNDD was a waste of time and

money; however, on February 4, 1969, Mr. Giordano reversed

his position and stated he

wanted to run credit and

criminal checks and contact the last two employers to

see if they had any further interest in the

clerical applicant.

The Bureau would then be asked to complete the investigation.

Mr. Giordano was told that BNDD should do their own clerical

applicant investigations entirely or the FBI should do

them entirely.

The Director noted that he wanted no part

of divided responsibility and this position was confirmed

in our letter to Mr. Pellerzi dated February 6, 1969,

copy attached. This letter advised that effective

immediately we would not accept any additional requests for

investigations of clerical applicants and that, if during

the course of investigations of these people by BNDD,

they should find subversive derogatory information,

then

the case should be referred to the Bureau for a full field

investigation under the provisions of the Federal Employee

Security Program.

MARTIN EDWARD UNDERWOOD

Underwood, aged 54, was employed for a number of

years as a salesman in Illinois and Maryland. Since 1961 he

has been employed by the United States Government, for the

greater period by the Department of Commerce, and the Small

Business Administration.

He was detailed to

the White House

in 1966 as an advance man in connection with the travels of

former President Johnson.

We conducted an investigation of Underwood for the

White House in 1965 which revealed he had a serious drinking

problem prior to the investigation and was considered an

alcoholic at one time. He is unmarried and has had two divorces,

the first of which was precipitated by his drinking.

Several

people interviewed in the 1965 investigation would not recom-

mend Underwood because of his drinking on the West Coast in

1964.

After President Johnson's departure Underwood continued

to hold an office on the first floor of the Executive Office

Building, apparently gaining the favor of Vice President Agnew.

On February 6, 1969, Underwood was removed from his office

and his White House pass has been taken. The White House

has been in contact with the Department of Conmerce, on whose

payroll Underwood has been while vorking at the White House,

and advised the Department of Commerce to inform Underwood

his services are no longer required.

Persons interviewed during our current investigation

state Underwood apparently stopped drinking in 1964 and no

longer has the drinking problem.

Results of current investigation

were furnished White House in memorandum dated February 12, 1969.

Several interviews and one agency check remain to be handled.

VIRGINIA STANFILL SAVELL

She was employed by former United States Senator

Thomas H. Kuchel of California

in his Los Angeles, California,

office from August, 1961, to September, 1968. She is pres-

ently an assistant to Herbert G. Klein at the White House.

In September, 1966, at the request of

Senator Kuchel, a very

discreet inquiry was conducted

into an allegation Senator Kuchel had received that

Mrs. Savell was possibly operating a bookie joint out

of the Senator's Los Angeles, California, office. The

inquiry developed no information to substantiate

allegation.

The investigation did develop information

that Mrs. Savell reportedly was an alcoholic.

The current investigation to date has ascertained

that the South Pasadena, California, Police Department

records indicate Mrs. Savell attempted suicide on July 23,

1967. She reportedly took an overdose of sleeping capsules.

WILLIAM HENRY RENTSCHLER

William Henry Rentschler, aged 43, former news-

paper reporter, has been co-owner and/or President of a

candy company since 1956.

He has been extremely active in

Republican Party politics in Illinois for the past several

years. He was involved in adulterous relationship with a

woman other than his wife for approximately three years and

later married that woman.

This was a well known fact by

those interviewed and Senator Dirksen said his involvement

in notorious divorce action presents serious question of

his suitability for employment by the Government. Senator

Percy indicated Attorney General Mitchell recently told

him Senator Dirksen had indicated Rentschler could not pass

the rigid background investigation by the FBI. During the

investigation Rentschler was described as articulate and an

intelligent individual who is knowledgeable in the field of

politics.

Several persons pointed out he lacks business

ability, fails to follow through on details and does not have

a feeling for finances.

Some individuals did not recommend

him for a position of trust, some recommended him with reser-

vations, and some recommended him highly. A summary memorandum

containing the results of investigation to date was furnished

to the White House on February 10, 1969. Outstanding investi-

gation consisted of an interview of Maurice H. Stans,

secre-

tary of Commerce, and

several other individuals who

have

been unavailable

for contact. Secretary Stans has been inter-

viewed and states he cannot recommend Rentschler due to un-

favorable hearsay information concerning his alleged financial

irresponsibility and his moral life. Additional investigation

is necessary based on information furnished by Secretary Stans.

SPECIAL INQUIRY INVESTIGATIONS FOR THE WHITE HOUSE

Conscientious security officers in various

governmental agencies, many of whom are former Special

Agents of the Bureau,

have been shocked at the lack of

knowledge or the total disregard of the provisions of the

Federal Employee. Security Program by the eight or nine

individuals at the White House responsible for filling

top-level positions in the new Administration. This.

first came to our attention shortly after November 6,

1968, when Eranklin Benjamin Lincoln, Sr., and

William Rittenhouse Harman moved into the Pentagon

as the vanguard of the transition team. They had no

clearance for highly classified information and when

no request was forthcoming for a full field investiga-

tion of these persons, the

security officer at the

Pentagon requested the investigation.

This matter came to a head on February 10, 1969,

when the Secretary of Commerce was told by the White House

to write a letter certifying that prospective Assistant

Secretaries were cleared politically and from a security

standpoint. When the Department of Commerce was told we

had received no request for a full field investigation,

that Department was informed by the White House the FBI

had done a "24-hour check."

The Department of Commerce

would not accept this since the Federal Employee Security

Program requires that no critical sensitive jobs should be

filled unless a full field investigation is first conducted.

Most of the requests for investigations received

i thus far from the White House are in connection with persons

who have been publicly announced and are already firmly

established in their jobs. As a result, instead of dis-

continuing investigation upon the develogment of derogatory

data the White House requests the investigation be continued

at the present time we know of only one person the

Administration has discharged.

This was a stenographer

in Mr. Ehrlichman's office by

the name of Helen Galanoplos,

who had two brothers and a sister-in-law who were members

of the Communist Party.

In connection with White House investigations Don Virdin

of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) called the Bureau on February 13,

1969. Virdin stated that IRS had checked their files in connection with

1.9

-NW 65360_Docld:32989646 Page 915

---

## Page 916

the last 25 persons publicly announced and confirmed by the Senate.

He stated that this check revealed that the Bureau had only asked for

IRS information in connection with about 8 of these 25 people. He

stated he felt this was strange because there was some rather inter-

esting information in connection with some of these people, such as

the fact that one of these individuals, whom he did not identify, had

not filed an income tax return for the past three years. (We have

run checks on all requests received from the White House on

Presidential appointees and it would appear from the above that the

White House only asked for us to conduct investigations on 8 of the

last 25 publicly announced appointees. )

SELECTIVE SERVICE

Selective Service investigations conducted by the

Federal Bureau of Investigation in recent years have

broadened to cope with recurring schemes to obstruct the

draft. At the present time, we have slightly over 14,000

pending investigations, compared to 9,000 a year ago.

In fiscal. year 1968, 809 convictions were recorded

as compared to 763 convictions the previous fiscal year.

For the first seven months of fiscal year 1969, 380 convictions

were recorded compared to 374 convictions recorded for a

similar period in the preceding fiscal year. It appears

that such a trend will continue during the current fiscal

year •

There follows a brief summary of an investigation

of interest concerning a Selective Service matter. .

At San Francisco in October 1968, it was learned

Exik Alfred Whitehorn, aged 18, had not registered with

Selective Service because his mother, Evelyn Whitehorn,

had refused to grant permission. For his failing to register,

Whitehorn was indicted, on November 20, 1968.

Following arraignment and release on his own

recognizance, a Complaint and Petition for Injunction and

Temporary Restraining Order against registration for the

• draft was filed in behalf of the subject. It claims if a person

under 21 years of age cannot vote, control or dispose of

his own property, serve on juries, marry, contract or litigate,

then he cannot register for the draft without his parents'

consent. Therefore, the mother, by teaching her son

principles of morality and by influencing him to follow his

own conscience, bears the main responsibility and should

be punished instead of her son. The Judge hearing this

case ruled that the son must stand trial for refusing to

register for the draft and rejected the mother's appeals.

A date for the trial of Erik Whitehorn has been

scheduled for March 19, 1969.

CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

AND ORGANIZED CRIME

The main thrust of our investigations of organized

crime has been aimed at the key members in the power structure

of La Cosa Nostra in order to secure their imprisonment and

to disrupt leadership. We have also struck hard at the lower

working level who are the money producing figures for the

top echelon leaders.

With progressively greater success, we

have made deeper penetration into the heart of the hoodlum

syndicate, the illegal gambling operations from wich it

draws much of its vast resources.

Prosecutions of hoodlums, gamblers, and vice figures

for violating the laws within the Bureau's jurisdiction

have been steadily increasing.

For the fourth consecutive

year, convictions have reached new highs, as evidenced by the

fact

that during Fiscal Year 1968, our drive against organized

crime resulted in the conviction of 281 organized crime and

gambling figures, compared with the 197 convictions during

the preceding year.

In addition, there are now 789 other

individuals awaiting trial in Federal court. The substantial

backlog of individuals awaiting further prosecution indicates

that the upward trend of convictions will continue during

Fiscal Year 1969.

However, it is apparent that if we are to

continue to be effective in our drive against the hoodlum

element, prosecutions of these matters must necessarily receive

high priority.

Recent Major Accomplishments

Among our most recent major accomplishments are:

• the conviction of Ernest Sansone, Chicago hoodlum, and five

associates on February 12, 1969, in connection with a wide-

spread race wire dissemination

service; the arrest of John

Philip Cerone, current top leader of organized crime in the

Chicago area, along with two accomplices on February 7, 1969,

in connection with the operation of a large-scale gambling

organization; the conviction of West Coast hoodlum figure,

John Roselli, on February 3, 1969, for running an interstate

gambling operation; the conviction of William Daddano, des-

cribed as the 5th ranking mobster in Chicago, and four

on November 26, 1968, 0f

La CosaNostra "commission" member

Stefano Magaddino, and eight associates.for Interstate Gambling

Activity; the arrest on December 5, 1968, of Pittston, Pa.,

La Cosa Nostra "Boss" Russell Bufalino and two associates

for

conspiring to transport some $23,000 worth of stolen television

sets interstate; the September 12, 1968, conviction of

New Orleans La Cosa Nostra "boss"

Carlos Marcello for attempting

to assault a Federal officer; the March 21, 1968, arrest of

New Jersey La Cosa Nostra "boss" Samuel Rizzo Decavalcante and

two associates for conspiring to extort money from four gamblers,

and the conviction on March 8, 1968, of New England area

La Cosa Nostra chieftain Raymond Patriarca and one of his

"captains;" Henry Tameleo, for violating the Anti-Racketeering

statute in connection with a gambling murder case.

Dissemination Program

As a result of our dissemination program, 287,004

items of criminal intelligence "type" informationwere dissem-

inated to other Federal, State, and local law enforcement

agencies during Fiscal Year 1967, 300,244 such items were

disseminated in Fiscal Year 1968, and during the first six

months

of the present Fiscal Year we have disseminated 153,214

items. Over one million such items have been disseminated

during the past five years.

With respect to dissemination of information

concerning local gambling operations to other Federal,

State, and local law enforcement agencies throughout the

United States for Fiscal Year 1968, a total of 721 raids

took place; 31o1 Individuals were arrested of whom til were

convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted to $1, 395,069 and

United States currency confiscated amounted to $624,028.

In

the first six months of the present Fiscal Year 329 raids

have

taken place, 1787 individuals have been arrested, of

whom 77] have been convicted; paraphernalia seized amounted

to $221,021, and United States currency confiscated amounted

to $273,701.

Department of Justice Task Forces on Organized Crime

In the Fall of 1966, the Criminal Division of the

Department initiated the Task Force Operation (also called

Strike Force and the first one began operation in Burialo,

New York. These Task forces consisted of a group comprisec

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 919

## Page 920

of Departmental attorneys and investigative personnel from

several different Federal investigative agencies. The FBI

was invited to assign personnel but declined because of its

overall commitments requiring utilization of all of its

Agents. However, we have extended. complete cooperation in

the form of information in investigative reports and have

promptly handled all cases within our investigative juris-

diction that were referred to us from the Task Forces.

Since the initial Task force at Buffalo, the Depart-

ment has forned such groups in Detroit, Michigan;

Brooklyn,

NEw

York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois;

Miami, Florida; and Newark, New Jersey.

We now maintain liaison with the various Task

Forces but not on a full-time basis.

It has been recommended that (1) we continue to

cooperate on a full-time basis, from the standpoint of

furnishing information to the various Task Forces, (2) that

the Director indicate to the new Attorney General

that we.

will be happy to assign an FBI Inspector to serve as liaison

with the Department Task Force office in Washington, D. C.,

(3) that a supervisory employee would be assigned by each

SAC to a specific Task Force when such Task Force is established

within a given area where one of our field offices is located

for liaison purposes.

La Cosa Nostra Leadership Changes

In the New York City area where La Cosa Nostra

"Commission" member Thomas Luchese died during 1967, no

successor has been named to date, primarily because

the FBI

was responsible for the arrest and/or conviction of the four

leading contenders, all "captains" or ranking members of the

Luchese "family."

In Chicago, John Philip Cerone, who was being groomed

as the top leader of

La Cosa Nostra group in the Chicago area,

was arrested on February 7, 1969, for Interstate Gambling

Activities. Cerone was the interim Chicago leader for Sam

Giancana, who fled to Latin America following his release from

Federal prison and his successor, sam Battaglia, who is ir

DEPARTMENT'S MANUAL FOR USE OF ELECTRONIC

SURVEILLANCE UNDER TITLE III OF OMNIBUS

CRIME CONTROL BILI

• The Attorney General has been furnished our views

with regard to the Department's draft manual for use of electronic

surveillance pursuant to Title III. The general provisions of

this lengthy manual, much of which concerned administrative

regulations not specifically required by the statute itselt,

would impose tremendous administrative and procedural restrictions

on the fBl and other federal agencies to the point that strict

compliance might be self-defeating to the goal of maintaining

discreet electronic surveillance coverage under court supervision

for the purpose of obtaining admissible evidence against the

leadership of organized crime and in other major investigative

categories.

These requirements involve an investigative agent's

application for intercept authority to be reviewed by a

comparatively wide range of authorities including the Organized

Crime and Racketeering Section of the Department, in many cases

the United States Attorney, the Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, and finally the Attorney General before

the

request even reached the court which, according. to the provisions

of this statute, is the ultimate authority and control in the

use of this procedure. This process would, of necessity, be

time-consuming, cumbersome, and, at certain points, repetitious,

and would spread the knowledge of the use of this

technique

among a number of different governmental offices.

We noted that the draft manual made repeated reference

to the problem of probable cause becoming "stale" and observed

that the sheer weight of the deliberative process at various

approving levels before it even reached the judge could alone

result in

the probable cause becoming "stale." We also noted

• that requirements involving daily memoranda to the United States

Attorney concerning the progress of a court authorized surveillance

and other similar administrative requirements would tend to place

burdens on investigating agents which could detract from the

ultimate purpose of our use of this technique.

In connection with the manual's requirement that

an authorized surveillance be terminated when the subject of

the surveitlance departed the premises covered, we questioned

that such a requirement was called for in the statute and whether

- 24 -

NW 65360 Docld:32989646. Page 921

---

## Page 922

Congress, in providing this important added tool in the

evidence

gathering process, intended that such a restriction

applied.

He also noted that the draft suggested that in all

cases when an application for an order is denied, those named

in the application would be informed that the Government

intended to subject them to electronic surveillance. With

regard to denied applications, we contend that this notice

requirement pertains only to those situations where emergency •

Intercepts have been made without court order, and thereafter

che court has denied the application and not. to all applications

which might be denied in the normal course of business pursuant

to the main body of regulations in Title III..

We concluded our observations to the Attorney

General that while it was appreciated that the drafting of

guidelines in this matter presents extremely sensitive problems,

it was believed that for the Government's ultimate

success in

making use of this evidence gathering procedure, restrictions

must not apply which will create more limitations on law

enforcement than the statute itself prescribes.

Source stated that the Soviet occupation has

split the peace movement, and WSP in particular, that it

might be better to postpone the invitation temporarily.

UTEKHINA told source that all expenses would

be paid while in the Soviet Union. However, the delegates

probably would have to arrange to pay their round trip air

fare from the United States to Moscow, USSR, and return.

The group would leave from New York City or Montreal,

Canada. UTEKHINA stated it may be possible to fly the

group via Soviet commercial craft in which case the cost

of transportation might be borne by the Soviets..

Source discussed UTEKHINA's proposed with WSP

leaders and it was agreed in bring this matter up at a

Regional Conference of WSP which is being held in early

October, 1968, with the idea of sending the delegation

to the Soviet

Union late in October or early November.

Source advised UTEKHINA that SARAH

SHORESMAN on the West Coast, who is in charge of the WSP

International Clearing House, would be in charge of making

arrangements for the trip. She inquired of UTEKHINA what

the air fare would be. UTEKHINA later telephoned to advise

that a round trip ticket from New York in Moscow, Economy

Tourist Class, is $730. UTEKHINA stated that if the source

1s interested, as an individual in going to the Soviet Union,

• she should contact RICHARD MORFORD at the Soviet-American

Friendship Society, 156 5th Avenue, New York City, because

there is a 21 day tour arranged by

of American-Soviet Friendship eosting all together $795.

The latter has been verified by (if 279-52) on

goes to the Soviet Union she would like to go on to Hanoi,

Pan American World Airways and in either case the round trip

fare will be $548.00, which is the reduced off season rate.

Bureau authority is requested to advance to infor

mant the cost of her round trip air fare from New fork to

Moscow and return, in the amount of $548.00.

It is recommended that this authority be granted

inasmuch as it is believed that source will learn about

activities in the peace groups in the Soviet Union which are

directed toward influencing similar peace groups in the

United States.

Source undoubtedly will encounter informa-

tion on her trip concerning foreign influence on the New

Left in the United States and related activities.

WFO 105-New

(WE 1777-S,) who was the source of the above, was

invited to attend the WCW by members of the SWC while she was

with the WSP delegation in Moscow.

Since returning to the United States, source has been

receiving literature, magazines, and letters from various

women in Moscow associated with

the SWC.

ADA IVANOVA (who acted as interpreter for the delegation on

their tour of the Soviet Union), dated 5/8/69, at Moscow, indi-

cates IVANOVA expects to see her in Helsinki.

During the latter part of April, 1969, and to present

time, isP has been considering an official invitation received

from

the Women's International Democratic Federation' (WIDF),

to send ten observers to the WIDF convened WCW

Clearing House,

is handling arrangements for the "sP delegation

to Helsinki.

She has informed source that MARXACHARKE OI LOS L

Angeles, California, and TAIMIYHALONEN of Seattle, Washington,

will be

going from

the West Coast; a couple of women from

Chicago, Illinois, names as yet unknown,

from the Mid-West, and

it is assumed a couple of women from Philadelphia, Pennsy_vania,

and New York City will accompany the group.

Locally, the WSP in Washington, D.C. (WDC), want a

couple of its women to go but they do not have the finances

to

them.

Source has been cleared and backed by the Steering

Conte the has the notato vant one in trope ne

summer so that her motives in going to Helsinki have not been

subject to question.

The SWC has advised source and WSP that the theme of

the Congress 15,

This is to recommend the advancement of $800

over and above the existing expense authorization to

(WF 1777-S)which will enable us to have the benefit of

informant's attendance at the above Congress.

We sent this informant to Moscow, USSR, in

November, 1968, to attend a meeting between Women' Strike

for Peace (WSP) and the Soviet Women's Committee (SWC).

At that time the SWC representatives stated the above

Congress

was to be held and that the Vietnam situation

would be the main focus of attention. In the event

hostilities

were still going on the SWC said that the

Congress would address itself to "all phases of work to

end the war." In addition, the informant's visit was

very fruitful and we continue to realize berefits from it

through material she receives from contacts made at the

conference.

Informant has been cleared by the steering

committee of the WSP to attend the above Congress and

can do so without raising any question as to the source

of funds. Informant has advised that this Congress is

to include delegates from all over the world including

North and South Vietnam.

She anticipates traveling with

the leadership of the WSP and that she can renew contacts

previously made with the National Liberation Front, the

North Vietnamese and various Russian women.

RE:

WORLD CONGRESS OF

WOMEN

HELSINKI, FINLAND

JUNE 14 - 17, 1969

This is another so-called peace conference similar

to the one held in Sweden May 16 - 19, 1969.

We sent one of our

New York informants to this conference and received extremely

valuable intelligence information regarding the current

situation in South Vietnam as a result: It is probable that

Weat-s will be in a position through her contacts to furnisi

ve currently pay WF 1777-S,

up to $200 per month for services and up to $75 per month for

expenses.

The attendance of the informant at this conference

can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning

the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive

against the United States. It will also afford us a live

informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involving

individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying

the United States position as it pertains to Vietnam. It

will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts

and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We

should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce

positive intelligence information.

ACTION:

With your approval, the attached airtel authorizing

the advancement of $800 to (WE 1777-S) will be directed to the

Washington Field Office.

Office be authorized to advance the sum of $775 to (WF 1777-S)

to enable this informant to attend a conference of the above

group in Stockholm, Sweden, on 11/28-30/70.

BACKGROUND:

The SCV was organized in 1967 and is controlled to

some extent by the Soviet-dominated World Council for Peace

(WCP). The SCV, since its inception, has been one of the

major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connection

with the war in Vietnam. This group has also provided the

North Vietnamese with a

• the or Dotane destion to

Peace Talks:

The forthcoming conference in Stockholm will

undoubtedly hammer out the details tor additional moves and

'propaganda against the United States' position in Vietnam.

It is, therefore,' most desirable we

afford these meetings

live informant coverage. (YT 1777-S)is well established in

the peace movement on a

national and international scale

having contacts with major women's groups throughout the

United States and in the Soviet Union.

This informant, in

I June, 1969, attended a meeting of the WCP in East Berlin on

'our behalf

and furnished excellent intelligence information.

She has received an official SCV invitation and is in a logical

position to attend. This informant is a retired schoolteacher

and can make this trip without creating any suspicion.

Informant would depart Stockholm on 12/1/70 consistent with

Anticipated expenses are: round trip

OBSERVATION:

the extent to which foreign groups, such as the

SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit

the United States and their continuing propaganda barrage

aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have

firsthand information regarding future plans of this group.

We will also be in a position to identify other United States

citizens in attendance.

For these reasons it is felt we

should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the

informant's services as noted above.

An airtel to Washington

Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden

is attached.

Washington Field Office is being instructed

to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and to

obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

Source stated that the Soviet occupation has

split the peace movement, and WSP in particular, that it

might be better to postpone the invitation temporarily.

UTEKHINA told source that all expenses would

be paid while in the Soviet Union. However, the delegates

probably would have to arrange to pay their Inund trip air

fare from the United States to Moscow, USSi, and return.

The group would leave from New York city nr

indicated that she will have arrange-

ments made and details from Moscow by early next week

(October 13-19, 1968). As it stands now, the degation will!

leave New York City as soon after the Presidential election

as possible. The delegation will travel via Aeroflot or

Pan American World Airways and in either case the round trip

fare will be $548.00, which is the reduced off season rate.

Bureau authority is requested to advance to infor-

mant the cost of her round trip air fare from New York to

Moscow and return, in the amount of $548.00.

It is recommended that this authority be granted

inasmuch as it is believed that source will learn about

activities in the peace groups in the Soviet Union which are

directed toward influencing similar peace groups in the

tion on her trip concerning foreign influence on the New

At thai time the SiC representatives stated tne above

Congress was to be held and that the Vietnam situation

would be the main focus of attention. In the event

hostilities were still going on the SHC said that the

Congress would address itself to "all phases of work to

very fruitful and we continue to realize berefits from it

through material she receives from contacts made at the

Informant has been cleared by the steering

committee of the WSP to attend the above Congress and

can do so without raising any question as to the source

Informant has advised that this Congress is

RE:

WORLD CONGRESS OF

WOMEN

HELSINKI, FINLAND

JUNE 14 - 17, 1969

This is another so-called peace conference similar

to the one held in Sweden May 16 - 19, 1969. We sent one of our

New York informants to this conference and received extremely

valuable intelligence information regarding the current

situation in South Vietnam as a result. It is probable that

INFORmANT will be in a position through her contacts to furnish

equally valuable information.

We currently

pay INFORINANT

up to $200 per month for services and up to $75 per month for

expenses.

The attendance of the informant at this conference

can provide invaluable advanced intelligence data concerning

the forthcoming Soviet-directed world-wide peace offensive

against the United States. It will also afford us a live

informant in a behind-the-scenes situation involving

individuals from all over the world intent upon destroying

the United States position as it pertains to Vietnem.

will also enable the informant to solidify previous contacts

and to develop new ones among foreign leftist elements. We

should avail ourselves of this excellent opportunity to produce

positive intelligence information.

ACTION:

With your approval, the attached airtel authorizing

the advancement of $800 to INFORMANT will be directed to the

Washington Field Office.

PURPOSE:

Office be authorized to advance the sum of $775 to INFORMANT

to enable this informant to attend a conference of the above

group in Stockholm, Sweden, on 11/28-30/70.

BACKGROUND:

The SCV was organized in 1967 and is controlled to

some extent by the Sowiet-dominated World_Counctl. for Peace.

(WCP) • The sCV, since its inception, has been one of the

major sounding boards for anti-American propaganda in connection

with the war in Vietnam. This group has also provided the

North Vietnamese with a

propaganda outlet and has enhanced

the position of the North Vietnamese delegation to the Paris

Peace Talks:

The forthcoming conference in Stockholm will

undoubtedly hammer out the details for additional moves and

propaganda against the United States' position in Vietnam.

It is therefore, most desirable we afford hete mished in

live informant coverage. INFORMANT

the peace movement on a national and international scale

having contacts with major women's groups throughout the

United States and in the Soviet Union.

This informant, in

I June, 1969, attended a meeting of the

WCP in East Berlin on

'our behalI

and furnished excellent intelligence information.

She has received an official SCV invitation and is in a logical

position to attend.

This informant is a retired schoolteacher

and can make this trip without creating any suspicion.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

Re:

Stockholm Conference on Vietnam

100-453546

Washington Field Office has advised that informant

tentatively plans to depart on 11/26/70 in order to reach

Stockholm on 11/27/70 in order to attend a preparatory meeting.

Informant would depart Stockholm on 12/1/70 consistent with

airline schedules.

Anticipated expenses are: round trip

air fare at $596.60; registration fee, $20; incidental expenses

including room and board at $158.40.

OBSERVATION:

The extent to which foreign groups, such as the

SCV and the WCP, have gone in the recent past to discredit

the United States and their continuing propaganda barrage

aimed at this country make it most desirable that we have

firsthand information regarding future plans of this gromn:

We will also be in a position to identify other United States

citizens in attendance.

For these reasons it is felt we

should avail ourselves of the opportunity to utilize the

informant's services as noted above. An airtel to Washington

Field Office authorizing this informant to travel to Sweden

is attached. Washington Field Office is being instructed

to immediately debrief the informant upon her return and.to

obtain an exact accounting of expenses incurred.

ACTION:

With your approval, the attached airtel will be

forwarded to Washington Field Office.

SUBJECT:

ATTORNEY GENERAL'S STAFF CONFERENCE

WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 1970, 5:00 ₽.M.

In accordance with the Director's instructions, I attended the

captioned briefing which was commenced at 5:03 p.m. by the Attorney General who

introduced the Director and the Director thereafter briefed all attendees on the

work of the FBI. As the attendees arrived for the meeting I made available to each

individual the bound FBI exhibit to which they could refer in following the Director's.

presentation. There were 29 departmental representatives present at this stati

meeting. They were very attentive to the Director's presentation as indicated by

the many questions following the Director's discussion. When the Director was

providing the conference with the number of Negroes employe by the FBI, including

Agent and clerical breakdown, Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst interrupted the

Director and asked the Director to repeat these figures in order that he might

trecord them.

At approximately 5:25 p.m. the Attorney General left the room to

receive a telephone call. The Director questioned Deputy Attorney General

Kleindienst as to whether he should continue or wait for the Attorney General's

return. Mr. Kleindienst suggested the Director wait until the Attorney General

returned.

Mr. Kleindienst asked the Director concerning his references to the

volume of civil rights work - whether this included both civil and criminal investiga-

tions handled by the FBI under the Civil Rights Statutes and the Director replied

in the affirmative.

Mr. Kleindienst then referred to the number of organized crime type

cases the Director said are pending prosecutive action. He said are these all

organized crime individuals.

The Director replied they all have some connection

with the many facets of organized crime. The Director went on to say many of

these cases are"pending a year or two and he felt if we had swift prosecution and

substantial punishment a greater inroad could be made in removing the menace of

organized crime. Mr. Kleindienst then commented that he felt that some of the

problem here might be due to the resourcefulness of the organized crime subject's

attorneys.

The Director replied that certainly this is true where such shysters

as Edward Bennett Williams represent these characters and he uses every technical.

trick to avoid prosecution and conviction. The Director went on to say that Attorney

Kuntsler does the same thing in his field.

At this point, Wilson's Deputy, Petersen, of the Criminal Division,

took this opportunity to point out to Kleindienst that what is needed here are more

Assistant United States Attorneys, whereupon the Solicitor General added that

Federal judges were also needed.

Kleindienst then asked Petersen if he had studied

these cases and the reason for delay that Mr. Hoover referred to and Petersen

stated he did not have these figures at the end of his tongue but he had a survey

made and, as he recalled it, there were 185 of these type cases delinquent six months

or more.

The others were delayed because of some court motion or action. The

Solicitor General asked whether there was any concentration of these cases and

Petersen said the Southern District of New York. Kleindienst then asked Petersen

how many Assistant United States Attorneys he needed to do the job and Petersen

said he could not give him a figure; however, he said he felt the District of

Columbia's, for example, staff could be increased by half again as many at least

and other appropriate increases would be necessary in major metropolitan

Mr. Hoover at this point, pointed out Senate Bill 30 is going to put

the FBI, if passed, into the local gambling picture and that we, in order to fulfill

our responsibility, will probably have to ask for an additional 600 Agents. He

pointed out that he hoped that the Criminal Division would draw up appropriate

guidelines to prevent local authorities from relinquishing their responsibilities

to also investigate local gambling.'

At approximately 5:35 p.m., Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst

advised the conterence that the Attorney General was called to the White House

and requested the Director/proceed with the briefing. At approximately 5:55 p.m.,

the Director completed his briefing and was congratulated by the Deputy Attorney

General for the excellent presentation and the Deputy then opened the floor for

questions.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Assistant Attorney General Leo M. Pellerzi, Administrative Division,

referred to the FBI exhibits and in particular Exhibit No. 25 and questioned

Mr. Hoover as to why the State of Virginia had such a high number of Laboratory

examinations. Mr. Hoover explained that Virginia had no Laboratory and that

that was the reason for the high usage of the FBI Laboratory. Mr. Hoover took

this opportunity to explain the FBI's policy in not making our experts available

when local experts have already examined the evidence or are going to testify as to

the evidence. He also explained there are many "phonies" who are traveling about

the country conducting examinations and testifying but we, in these cases, have

briefed the prosecuting attorneys in advance. The Director explained that in such

places as New York State where they have their own Laboratories they only use

our Lab for the more sophisticated examinations.

•

Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst then questioned the Director as

to the basic qualifications for the position of Special Agent. The Director explained.

that they all had to be either lawyers or accountants or college graduates majoring

in science or language. The Director emphasized again that we have no discrimina-

tion and that we have many fine Negro Agents in the FBI, pointing out that only last

week he gave a meritorious award to a Negro Agent from our Detroit Office who had

developed valuable informants in the Black Panthers and related organizations in

that area. Kleindienst then asked the Director approximately how many applicants

we turn down for each Agent that we accept. The Director explained that for every

100 applicants 90 of them are turned down. He said that we carefully interview

these men, investigate them, test them, and give them thorough physical examina-

tions to make sure they meet our high standards. The Director told the conference

that he has a standing rule that if any Agent in Charge recommends an Agent or

clerk who is a hippie type; that is, long hair, sideburns, etc., this Agent in Charge

is going to lose his office, and we are going to get rid of the applicant. He said he

would not tolerate any hippie types in the FBI and do not want our Agents going into

Federal court looking like hippies.

The Director pointed®

out that many of our young clerical employees

are going on to school to become Agents, and he demands the same discipline of

these young people. He also pointed out that some 6,000 people a day tour our

facilities and we don't want them getting the idea the FBI has any hippie types.

As a matter of fact, the Director said with a smile that he would like to declare

open season on these hippies just like you have open season on the deer and shoot

them.

Memorandum j. J. Casper to Mr. Mohr

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference

Wednesday, April 8, 1970, 5:00 p.m.

Mr. Kleindient was also interested in the scope of our work and in

this regard the Director took this opportunity to point out that he did not believe the

FBI should be investigating every bomb threat and that he hoped that if the new bomb

legislation as proposed by the President is passed the Department's Criminal

Division will set appropriate guidelines. The Director pointed out that many of

these major cities have very excellent bomb squads and they are fully equipped to

handle these complaints. He said why should the FBI be paralleling work done by

competent local authorities. He said, of course, in the local areas where they have

no people qualified, then this is a different matter. The Director said in all of these

cases we are always willing to make our FBI Laboratory facilities and Identification

facilities available as well as assist the local authorities by covering out-of-state

leads.

Assistant Attorney General Johnnie M. Walters asked the Director

if he could see any lessening of the problems that he talked about in the foreseeable

future. The Director said in the organized crime field, if the steps he has

recommended are taken, he feels there will be a decrease. With regard to the

disorders in colleges and in the high schools and caused by the militants he said

this is another story. The Director cited the incident of one of the subject's in the

Chicago Seven trial appearance last night at American University and thereafter

going to Catholic University and then leaving town. He said that apparently these

university administrators will not call in the local police, and he said it was dis-

graceful how they threw rocks, destroyed property and set fires at American

University. He then also cited the incident wherein attorney Kuntsler after he went

out to Santa Barbara, California, gave a speech, and then left town, that Santa

Barbara was the victim of three days of looting and burning. The Director cited

the violence promised in New Haven when Bobby Seale is brought to trial whereupon

the Solicitor General commented that the judge who is going to try that case was his

law school roommate. The Director said that this is a very serious situation and

it is entirely possible that violence will occur when Seale is tried. The Director

pointed out that we have appropriately advised all local-authorities of this possibility.

The Director then cited the tremendous problems that Judge Hoffman

in Chicago had ir handling the trial and said that one could hardly blame him for some

of his actions in view of the provocative acts on the part of the subjects and the

attorneys. The Director said he recalled that Judge Medina in New York, when he

tried the Communist Party leaders, the experience was so trying that it actually

broke his health. Peterson at this point injected a comment that his people are

trying to find out whether in the New Haven Bobby Seale case the Panthers are

going: to try to kidnap the Department's representative whose name is Lynch or

whether they are referring to the Attorney General of the State of California whose

name is also Lynch and the Director said he felt it was the Department of Justice

representative being referred to.

The Director took this opportunity speaking about retaliatory action

to point out that he was very concerned over the kidnapping of diplomatic officials

in South America and said he felt it would be repeated in this country. He hoped

the guard force for the embassies and chanceries in the Nation's Capital would be

promptly secured as the President is also very concerned about this.

In further reply to Mr. Walters question, the Director also pointed

out that he felt many of these college presidents needed to be more firm and take

drastic action by expelling these students from the school, not giving them amnesty,

and assisting the local prosecutors in prosecuting these people.

The Solicitor

General indicated that he also felt many of the faculty were also/contributing

factor to this problem. The Director agreed. The Director pointed out that these

student problems in the college or high school can be traced back to the parental

responsibility. The Director said that District of Columbia policemen have told

him that many young children are out on the street at all hours of the night and

their parents don't even know, and in some instances, care where they are. The

Director told them of the incident of where four of our Identification people were

held up and a female employee raped and how the juvenile giant when arrested had

a juvenile court record of four appearances without a single sentence and how the

Director had requested the court to try him as an adult but they refused to do so.

The Director referred to the fact that we have too many bleeding heart judges

and told of the success Judge Loble has had in Montana in handling juvenile subjects.

Memo J. J. Casper to Mr. M hr 4/8/70

Re: Attorney General's Staff Conference - 4/8/70 - 5 PM

George J. Reed, Chairman, Board of Parole, questioned Mr. Hoover

as to the extent. of Communist influence in all of this New Left, Black Panther,

Students for a Democratic Society, and militant action that we are faced with.

The Director explained that the Communist Party will join anything that will

further its causes and that they get their orders directly from Moscow. He

said their influence in some organizations is complete control and in others

it is only one of participation but, he pointed out, they are always the most

vocal and, consequently, are very influential in those groups that they participate

in. He said the Black Panthers follow the philosophies of many international

revolutionary Communists. The Director then cited the incident of the young

girl who blew up her father's home in New York which she had turned into a

bomb factory. He stated she started to get out of control when at Bryn Mawr

she joined the Students for a Democratic Society, and now she has fled to

Canada and we are unable to extradite her.

At this point Deputy Attorney General Kleindienst thanked Mr. Hoover

for his outstanding presentation. He said he felt they all had a better knowledge

of the FBI and a greater appreciation of the many problems from a security and

crime standpoint facing our country. With that, the official part of the conference

was adjourned. Many of the conferees came up and personally congratulated Mr.

Hoover and thanked him for his presentation, including asking Mr. Hoover to

autograph the FBI exhibit folder which had been passed out to each participant.

I feel this outstanding presentation on the part of the Director brought

great credit and praise for our organization. Hopefully, it will act as an incentive

to some of our counterparts in the Department to do a more aggressive job

in fulfilling their dusies in meeting their security and criminal responsibilities.

Submitted for information.

a brief for the Director's use in connection with captioned conference. You

a current status!

Joul

There are attached amended pages 11, 12, 16, and 26 which

should be inserted in the briet.

1057

The change on page 11 is under the subheading "Stock and

Bond Thefts," and the last sentence has been changed to reflect that the

amount recovered is now $8, 026, 000 and that 29 individuals have been

charged. The change on page 12 is the fact that the last sentence on the page

has been added to show that the United States Attorney in Baltimore, with

the approval of the Attorney General, plans to seek the indictment of

Congressman Dowdy and two others on 3/31/70. The change on page 16 is

in the first paragraph, reflecting that the Identification Division made an

identification in connection with the Wilkerson bombing in New York. It

also points out that Cathlyn Wilkerson and Kathy Boudin are among six other

fugitives being sought by the FBI after they failed to appear to answer local

felony charges in Chicago on 3/16/70 growing out of the October demonstra-

tions. The change on page 26 was made to include additional Laboratory

findings in regard to the Bel Air explosion. E

Director has accepted Attorney General's luncheon invitation

for Friday, September 8. Pertinent items of possible interest for discussion

at luncheon include:

(1) The Attorney General (AG) called Mr. DeLoach on 9-5-67 concerning

FBI's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. AG said he

had contacted Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at White House and also planned to

meet with Dick Helms of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter

of National Security Agency (NSA). AG said Clifford and Rostow were surprised

FBI had so little coverage--and they hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use

surveillances, it might be good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic

intelligence to CIA. AG said he was opposed to this idea; that it would take time

to bring Clifford and Rostow around, but FBI would come out ahead and he (the,

AG) would have more liberal hand in approving FBI requests.

Regarding above, Mr. DeLoach noted it would be premature to

talk with Rostow or Clifford now; but after a decision has been reached, they

could be confidentially briefed on such FBI operations. Information confidentially

obtained reflects that Helms of CIA had a meeting scheduled with AG on 9-6-67--

the subject of which probably was electronic surveillances.

EX 101 REG 65 42-90185% 1

EBI has 31 telephone surveillances in FBI cases;

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

2) On 7-19-67, the House passed H.R. 441, which provides Federa

penalties for interstate travel with intent to incite a riot. Many persons question

its practical and legal usefulness due to difficulty in proving intentiour sources

on the Hill indicate there is a hope the bill may be böttled up in committee--but®

that it will pass the Senate if it reaches the floor. We took no stand on the bill

with the Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel to areas where

5 strite developed. The bill could increase our investigative responsibilities

substantially.

M.A. Jones to Bishop Memo

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(3) On 8-8-67, the House passed H.R. 5037, the Law Enforcement and:

• Criminal Justice Assistance Act of 1967 (originally the Administration's "Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act'' -but with considerable changes. One amend-

ment to the original Act would empower regional institutes to engage in police

training--thus duplicating and competing with FBI police training. This matter

has been brought to attention of FBI friends on Senate Judiciary Committee.

Our Hill sources advise that Senators McClellan and Hruska plan to combine

their bills regarding controlled use of wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and

add this to H.R. 5037.

(4) AG has indicated desire to achieve about 400 convictions in organized

crime field during this fiscal year. As of 9-7-67, a total of 382 individuals in

this field were awaiting Federal prosecution. By letter of 7-27-67, we called the

AC's attention to a situation wherein 23 persons arrested in New York for gambling

law violations in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive action. To date, no

treply has been received from AG.

(5) Latest two issues of "Life" magazine contain articles by Sandy Smith,

former Chicago newsman, focusing attention on La Cosa Nostra leaders, as well

as their political affiliations, and the need or electronic surveillances to cope

with organized crime. Smith has extensive background and contacts qualifying

him to write on organized crime. It is obvious he obtained help from such persons

as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre Dame, formerly in the Organized Crime

Section of Department.

(6) The "task force" organized under direction of Organized Crime and

Racketeering Section of Department conducted an operation against bookmaker

Ernest Reinhart in Niagara Falls, New York, area and learned from the Customs

Service that the Niagara Falls Police Department was also interested in Reinhart's

activities. According to officials of Niagara Falls Police Department, attorneys

and others on the "task force" appeared at the police department and "took over"

(entire investigation. "Task force" was

so inept that it "blew" the case against

Reinhart, and 'task force" surveillances were discovered by Reinhart and

associates. Although Reinhart's gambling activities were across state lines from

New York to Canada, our Buffalo Office was not notified. Pertinent details were

brought to AG's attention by letter of 9-5-67, and we requested that "task force"

be instructed to immediately advise FBI of matters within our jurisdiction.

M. A. Jones To Bishop Memo

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

(7) For first month (July) of new fiscal year, FBI convictions

decreased 189, or 22 percent. Decrease primarily due to: (a) shortage of

judges and prosecutors, resulting in overcrowded court conditions, and (b)

policy enunciated by Department's Criminal Division to reduce Federal

prosecutions of juvenile offenders. In July, 1966, Assistant AG Vinson sent

letter instructing U. S. Attorneys regarding diversion of subjects under age

21 to local authorities--which has principally been felt in Interstate Trans-

portation of Stolen Motor Vehicle violations, where experience indicates

about 65 percent of violators are under 21 and where FBI convictions

decreased 109 in July. 196% compared with July, 1966. For sometime,

we have been advising AG whenever shortages of Federal judges or shortages

in U. S. Attorneys Offices exist.

The Coordinator of

U. S. Attorneys,

John W. Kern, III, stopped DeLoach in the

Attorney General's Office on he morning of 9/7/67 and posed two

questions: (1) Sioula v. S. Attorneys attend meetings of Federal

DETAILS:

The Director has accepted an invitation for a luncheon with the

Attorney General on Friday, September 8, 1967. There is contained in this

memorandum succinct data concerning pertinent items which might be of

interest for discussion on this occasion. The General Investigative, Special

Investigative and Domestic Intelligence Divisions have contributed salient

information for this memorandum.

ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES:

On 9-5-67, the Attorney General called Mr. De Loach regarding

the Bureau's pending requests for approval of electronic surveillances. He

said he had finally made contact with Clark Clifford and Walt Rostow at the

White House on 8-31-67 and that he planned to meet with Dick Helms of the

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and General Carter of the National Security

Agency (NSA) regarding this matter. The Attorney General said Clifford and

Rostow knew little about electronic surveillances and were very surprised that

the FBI had so little such coverage. He said that Clifford and Rostow, without

saying so, hinted that because of FBI reluctance to use surveillances, it might

be a good idea to transfer FBI responsibilities in domestic intelligence to CIA.

The Attorney General said he was opposed to this idea. He

said it would take a little time to bring. Clifford and Rostow around but that he

believed the Department and the FBI would come out ahead in the discussions

and that he, the Attorney General, will then have a more liberal hand in

approving requests from the FBI. In this connection, Mr. De Loach noted

that it would be premature to talk with Clifford or Rostow at this point but

after a decision has been reached, these two individuals could be briefed on

a confidential basis regarding such FBI operations." It was also noted that it

did not appear the Attorney General could adequately represent the FBI in his

discussions with Clifford and Rostow.

We have confidentially obtained the information that Richard

Helms, Director of the CIA, had a meeting scheduled with the Attorney General

at 5 p.m., on Wednesday, September 6, 1967, and that the subject of the

meeting was probably electronic surveillances.

INTERSTATE TRAVEL TO INCITE RIOTS:

JFK Act 5 (g)(2)(D)

This bill was passed by the House on 7-19-67. It provides for

Federal prosecution of persons who travel interstate with the intent to incite

a riot. Its practical and legal usefulness has been duestioned by a number of

people, including many Senators, due to the extreme difficulty in obtaining

evidence to prove intent. Our Hill sources have advised there was a hope the

Bill could be bottled up in committee unless it could be changed to make it

more practical. These sources concede the Bill will pass the Senate without

difficulty if it reaches the floor because many Senators would consider it

politically unwise to vote against it.

We took no stand on the Bill with the

Department, but did cite examples of interstate travel by militant Negroes

and hate group leaders to areas where strife developed. The Bill, if passed,

could substantially increase our investigative responsibilities, depending, of

course, on the policy established by the Department.

H. R. 5037, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CRIMINAL JUSTICE ASSISTANCE

ACT OF 1967:

This is the Administration's bill, originally called the Safe

Streets and Crime Control Act, although it has been changed considerably by

Republican-sponsored amendments made when the House passed the bill on

8-8-67. One of these amendments by Congressman Robert McClory (R. -I. )

which changed Title 3 of the Bill, would empower the regional institutes to

engage in police training. This would duplicate and compete with the extensive

police training program we conduct on our own and in cooperation with local

and state agencies. This has been brought to the attention of our friends on

the Senate Judiciary Committee. Many of them have voiced agreement and

stated they will take the necessary action to correct this wrong. Our Hill

sources have advised that Senator John McClellan (D. -Ark.) and Senator Roman

Hruska (R. -Neb.) plan to combine their bills authorizing controlled use of

wiretaps and eavesdropping devices and to add this to H. R. 5037 in Committee.

They feel wiretap legislation as a part of the Administration's crime bill will

have an excellent chance for passage and possible acceptance by the President.

ORGANIZED CRIME :

• As of September 7, 1967, there were. a total of 382 individuals,

involved in organized criminal activities, who have been arrested, indicted,

or awaiting further prosecutive action in connection with violations of

various Federal statutes.

By letter dated July 27, 1967, the Bureau called to the attention

of the Attorney General a situation where 23 individuals arrested in New York

for violations of the gambling laws in 1964 were still awaiting final prosecutive

action. It was called to the attention of the Attorney General that prosecutive

action taken at the earliest possible date with reference to these individuals

would greatly assist in increasing accomplishments in the organized crime

field during the present fiscal year. To date no response from the Attorney

General has been received to this communication.

The Attorney General has indicated that he is desirous of

achieving in the neighborhood of 400 convictions of individuals involved in

organized crime during this fiscal year. With 382 such subjects already

awaiting prosecution, the Attorney General's goal would appear to be readily

available if vigorous prosecutive action is taken of these individuals at the

earliest possible date by the Department.

"LIFE" MAGAZINE ARTICLE:

"Life" magazine has run articles for the last two weeks on

La Cosa Nostra, which articles were written by Sandy Smith, former crime

reporter for the "Chicago Tribune "* Smith has done an excellent job in these

articles in focusing public attention on the Cosa Nostra leaders as well as

their political affiliations and the need for electronic surveillances in order

to cope with the menace of organized crime.

Smith is an outstanding investigative reporter who has a

wealth of independent knowledge built up over the years on La Cosa Nostra.

He also has tremendous contacts among the local and state police intelligence

agencies throughout the country. In addition, it is obvious that he obtained

considerable help from such persons as Professor Robert Blakey of Notre

Dame, former Departmental Attorney in the Organized Crime Section, in

*and "Chicago Sun-Times."

connection with this article. He also has used the information disclosed

from our microphones in court cases in such cases as the Raymond

Patriarca matter, etc.

DEPARTMENT TASK FORCE, BUFFALO, NEW YORK:

In October, 1966, under the direction of the Organized Crime

and Racketeering Section of the Department, a "task force" was organized

as an investigative operation, supervised by Department Attorneys, and to

which were assigned representatives from various Federal investigative

agencies.

On August 21 and 23, 1967, the "task force" conducted

investigative activity, including physical surveillances in the Niagara Falls,

New York, area. The subject of its investigation was one Ernest Reinhart,

a bookmaker from Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada, who was said to be

making trips daily to Niagara Falls, New York, to establish regular contacts .

and gambling pickups from other known gamblers. The Niagara Falls, New

York, Police Department, which was also investigating the activities of

Reinhart, had requested the assistance of the United States Customs Service

to develop sufficient evidence to establish a violation of the local gambling

statute. A representative of the Customs Service notified the "task force"

representatives of the local police department's interest in this matter and

immediately thereafter, according to the officials of the Niagara Falls Police

Department, attorneys

and other members of the 'task force" appeared at the

police department.and "took over" the entire investigation.

SAC Neil J. Welch.of our Buffalo Office has since determined

from representatives of the Niagara Falls Police Department and the Customs

Service that the investigative activity of the "task force" was so inept that the

case against Reinhart was 'blown." (In conducting a surveillance the task force

utilized a panel truck and their actions, while in the panel truck, were such that

they caused the truck to rock back and forth revealing to the gamblers who were

watching: that people were inside the truck. Surveillances conducted by the

"task force, " including attorneys assigned thereto, were readily discovered by

Reinhart and his associates. Reinhart remarked to a customs agent at the

border crossing that he would give the investigators a good run around.

• Although Reinhart's gambling activities were being carried on

between Canada and the United States, that is across state lines, in apparent

violation of the Interstate Transportation in Aid of Racketeering Statute, the

FBI Office at Buffalo was not notified. The FBI has a substantial investigative

responsibility in the investigation of violations of this statute. In this

instance, Customs Service, Internal Revenue Service, and the local

Niagara Falls, New York, Police Department also have investigative

responsibilities.

Pertinent details concerning this matter were brought to

the attention of the Attorney General by our letter dated September 5, 1967,

with the request that necessary instructions be issued to the "task force"

personnel that matters within FBI jurisdiction be immediately reported to

our Buffalo Office.

CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS - CONVICTIONS:

At the end of July, 1967, we had recorded 189 fewer con-

victions than were recorded during the first month of the prior fiscal year.

This represents a decrease of 22%, which is primarily the result of two

factors: (I) shortages of judges and prosecutors which result in over-

crowded court conditions and (2) the policy enunciated by the Criminal

Division of the Department to reduce prosecutions in Federal court relating

to juvenile offenders.

In this connection, our potential for increasing conviction

• statistics was decimated as a result of a letter sent during July, 1966, by

Assistant Attorney General Vinson instructing all U. S. Attorneys to give

primary consideration to the diversion of subjects under 21 years of age to

local authorities. These instructions are being followed by a majority of

U. S. Attorneys and have hurt us principally in Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Motor Vehicle violations where experience has shown that approximately

65% of all violators are under 21 years of age. At the end of July, 1967, we

recorded 109 less convictions in this category as compared to the first month

in the previous fiscal year.

-

We have for sometime been following the practice of advising

the Attorney General whenever shortages of Federal judges, U. S. Attorneys

or their assistants exist.

For example, we recently sent the following letters

to the Attorney General bring to his attention shortages of judges or U. S.

Attorneys in the indicated areas:

9-1-67, Southern District of Georgia;

8-16-67, Eastern District of Michigan;

8-7-67, District of Kansas;

8-3-67, District of New Jersey;

8-2-67, Southern and Northern Districts of Mississippi;

7-31-67, Western District of New York.

M. A. Jones to Bishop

RE: LUNCHEON WITH ATTORNEY GENERAL

In connection with the situation in the Western District of

New York, we originally called this to the Attorney General's attention on

3-30-67 and we have received no information indicating that an appointment

has been made for the vacant judgeship. Considerable newspaper publicity

has attended the failure to appoint a judge for this district.

With regard to the two vacant judgeships in the Eastern District

of Michigan, it is noted that we first called this to the Attorney General's

attention on 3-16-67 and we have not received any current information

indicating these judgeships have been filled.

Each SAC has been instructed to keep the Bureau currently

advised of any shortages of judges or U. S. Attorneys and we will continue

to bring these matters to the attention of the Attorney General.

As an example of shortages which have been brought to the

Attorney General's attention, in connection with the shortage of judges in

the Southern District of Georgia, it is noted that as of September 1, 1967,

there was a total of 87 Bureau cases awaiting prosecution involving 121

defendants. Of these 22 representing 32 subjects have been pending prose-

cution for more than six months.

It is also noted that in the District of New Jersey as of

July 1, 1967, there were approximately 200 Bureau cases awaiting prose-

cutive action involving approximately 392 defendants. Our New York Office

has also advised that it has 775 cases awaiting prosecution representing 874

subjects.

The following data concerning the antipoverty workers'

invölvement in racial disturbances has been prepared for the

Director's information and possible use at the forthcoming

luncheon conference which will include the Attorney General and

: Mr. Shriver of the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO).

ALLEGATIONS OF INVOLVEMENI OF ANTIPOVERTY EMPLOYEES

There have been a number of allegations regarding the

involvement of antipoverty employees in racial disturbances and

involving the misuse of antipoverty funds in connection therewith.

Allegations with respect to the misuse of these funds are

exceptionally difficult to substantiate because the funds provided

to local antipovertyagencies by 0E0 or other Federal agencies are

usually furnished on a grant basis with the grants becoming the

property of the local group at which time the Federal character

dof the funds is lost.

However, there have been instances wherein certain

officials and employees of local agencies receiving Federal anti-

poverty grants have reportedly not conducted themselves in a

manner conducive to law and order..

Examples follow.

Action Movement, a clandestine all-Negro revolutionary group

that calls for the overthrow of the U. S. Government by violence

and which is procommunist Chinese-oriented, were suspended as

employees of Haryou - Act following their arrest last June along

with a number of members of the Jamaica Rifle and Pistol Club,

a Revolutionary Action Movement front group,. on charges including

conspiracy to advocate anarchy. Another member of this rifle

club who was arrested, Arthur

• Harris, was also suspended as an

employee of an antipoverty organization in Jamaica, New York City,

which is funded by OEO. •

Newark, New Jersey

In Newark,

antipoverty funds were reputedly utilized

by the United Community Corporation to rent two station wagons

used to transport people who had been encouraged to appear at

meetings at the city hall to protest action of a city planning

board. Reportedly, one of the vehicles was equiped with a loud-

speaker and was used to make inflammatory remarks regarding the

incumbent city administration. Also, it is reported that

inflammatory posters prepared by the United Community Corporation

had been circulated.

Syracuse, New York

Employees of the Crusade for Opportunity, an antipoverty

agency funded by 0E0, are alleged to have been involved in the

racial disturbances which occurred in Syracuse, New York,

8/16-18/67. An officer of the Syracuse Police Department advised

that a Crusade

for Opportunity automobile bearing U. S. Government

license plates was used by two Negro males and two Negro females

to cruise through Negro neighborhoods in Syracuse on 8/15/67.

They utilized a loudspeaker to advertise a meeting on 8/16/67

regarding "the alleged rape of an 11-year-old Negro girl by a

white man.

A field worker of this organization, Leroy Glenn Wright,

was arrested during the first night's disturbance on 8/16/67 and

charged with inciting to riot and resisting arrest.

RE: LUNCHEON ENGAGEMENT OF THE DIRECTOR

MR. SARGENT SHRIVER, DIRECTOR OF THE

DURING WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 18, 1967

Washington, D. C.

Individuals affiliated with two organizations funded

in part by OEO were involved in the disturbance which occurred

in the House of Representatives on 8/7/67 in protest of the

shelving of the so-called "Rat Bill." The leader, Jesse Gray,

a former Communist Party organizer in Harlem and a militant black

nationalist, is the head of the Harlem Back Street Youth, Incor-

porated, which was the recipient of 0EO funds.

Such funds have

since been suspended. Gray and at least one other member of the

above organization were arrested for their part in this disturbance.

Also involved in this disturbance and arrested was Robert Bailey

Ransom, an employee of Volunteers in Service to America (VISTA)

Associates, an OEO-funded organization.

Hate-type Schools

The New York City Police Department advised on 8/9/67

that the walls of a school handling a program entitled "Special

Training in Reading" for children 8 to 10 years of age contained

numerous hate slogans.

Examples of the signs noted thereon were

"Don't love them to death, shoot them to death; make revolution

not war; burn, baby, burn; arm yourselves; Johnson is losing

sleep; Newark, '67; Chicago South Side, '66; Watts, '65, and

Harlem, '64." There was also a picture of President Johnson's

face superimposed on an Army sergeant carrying a rifle captioned

"Public Enemy Number One, Wanted for Murder."

The committee

handling this particular

program was funded

in part by OEO.

A somewhat similar situation occurred in Nashville,

Tennessee, in connection with a "Liberation School" which has

been in operation teaching 10 and 1l-year-olds.

Antipoverty

funds from OEO had been earmarked for the school; however, the

funds were withdrawn when national publicity resulted concerning

this matter.. Meantime, however, certain services including the

rental of an automobile and school supplies had been furnished.

MISUSE OF FBI INFORMATION BY OEO

In connection with the recent arrest by Kentucky

authorities of Alan and Margaret McSurely, employees of the

Southern Conference Education Fund, and Joseph I. Mulloy, an

employee of an organization being funded by OEO, on a state

sedition charge, someone in OEO apparently leaked to the press

a report prepared by an 0EO investigator which contained state-

ments attributed to the FBI. An article concerning this matter

appeared in the 9/1/67 issue of "The Evening Star."

The Director approved the lodging of a vigorous

protest with OEO concerning the fact that information appearing

in an FBI memorandum subsequently was published in "The Evening

Star." In approving this action, he noted "Yes, and if they

can't or won't give us the necessary assurances against leaks,

we will cut off all investigative services to OEO."

Such a protest was lodged through liaison with

Mr. Edgar May, Assistant Director, OEO, on 9/5/67 who advised

that steps had been taken to insure that such did not recur

in the future. A detailed memorandum is attached.

STATEMENTS AGAINST ESTABLISHED LAW AND ORDER

While no direct evidence has come to the Bureau's

attention of outright seditious statements on the part of anti-

poverty workers, allegations have been received of statements

against established law and order and of statements tending to

incite the people.

Examples follow:

Marion S. Barry, Jr., former Washington Director of

the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, joined the United

Planning Organization, Washington, D. C., as a $50-a-day consultant

on 7/21/67. This organization is funded by OEO. On 6/30/67. Barry

reportedly conducted a press conference on the steps of the 13th

Precinct, Metropolitan Police Department, at which time he

denounced the Police Department and stated that Negroes would

continue to threaten the police until policemen are trained

-properly in how to deal with Negroes.

Captain Al Prezio of the

funded by OEO, uses the office of the antipoverty organization

as a headquarters to conduct militant civil rights work and to

recruit teen-agers to incite riots and arouse a Negro community

on any issue that would create racial unrest. •

Willie Wright,. a duly-elected board member of the

United Community Corporation, Newark, New Jersey, is alleged

to have made statements concerning Negro rioting

such as "To

hell with President Johnson when he says something about not

tolerating riots. We've tolerated these conditions for more

than 400 years."

He is also quoted as having said: "It is my

firm conviction that in order to overcome the white man's complete

human and legal jurisdiction over my black brothers and sisters,

we are going to defend ourselves against all kinds of aggressions

that are being perpetrated against us by the white man. I most

emphatically want to make sure the majority of my black brothers

and sisters have a piece of firepower in their home possessions

to protect themselves against the most brutal atrocities to be

seen anywhere committed by the New Jersey National Guard, the

Newark and State Police in the recent rebellion in the City of

Newark and

Newark." The OEO has requested Wright's suspension pending its

investigation of statements attributed towright.

"The Washington Post" of 9/13/67 contained an article

by Columnist Roscoe Drummond captioned "Mayors Say OEO Programs

Helped Suppress City Riots" in which he refers to a nationwide

survey conducted by 0E0 in 64 cities, half of which had riots

this summer. In citing OE figures he pointed out that of 30,000

Community Action employees only 16 were arrested during the course

of the riots and none were convicted. Poverty programs. had 244

buildings in the hearts of the riot areas with none being burned

or destroyed.

Valley,

Inc., a Florida real estate developnent in which

Hoifa had an option to purchase 45 per cent of the stock.

During the past week Hoffa furnished this option, which is

dated April

he had recently located it in his old records.

Teamsters Union records were subpoenaed for

production before

to the subpoena and others are said to be in the possession

of the McClellan Committee.

The Crininal Division will

obtain such records from the McClellan Committee. Our

Vashington Field Office is making an accounting investigation

of the records that were produced before the grand jury and

will examine those the Criminal Division obtains from the

vehicle belonging to the Internal Revenue Service on the night of

September 16-17, 1959. This antenna was valued at approximately

$37.50.

with Purnell the son of a prominent Dallas, Texas, attorney and

Friedrichs related to Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee. Groner

was a star football player who recently signed with the Dallas

team of the new American Football League.

Property. Strickler in addition leaked the facts concerning

this case to the local press indicating that arrests would be

forthcoming.

In view of this matter being a potential source of

embarrassment to both the Bureau and the Department, the facts

were brought to the attention of the Criminal Division on

January 12, 1960.

The Criminal Division subsequently advised that

they had discussed this matter by telephone with U. S. Attorney

Strickler who reluctantly agreed to proceed against subjects by

Grand. Jury.

The Department indicated they were upset

with the

manner in which Strickler released this information to the newspapers

and that Mr. Hayden Crawford of the Department was to separately

take up this matter with him.

The Proctor at Washington and Lee University has indicated

that University officials are holding any action against subjects

in abeyance and would await final action by the Grand Jury. All

four subjects remain enrolled at lashington and lee at this time.

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on. 12/31/59. It relates to the association between John George

Ledes, a former legal advisor to Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC) Commissioner James E. Sargent, and Joseph

Abrams, a New York promoter of unsavory reputation.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files here and in

New York and have interviewed numerous persons in and out of

SEC who handledcases involving Abrams' firms. We determined

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still

with that agency. We are now engaged

in interviewing additional persons with possible pertinent

knowledge of the association and in the detailed job of tracing

Ledes' financial transactions through bank, realty and other

records to pin down specifics of loans from Abrams to Ledes

relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes. Abrams'

loans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and thus

bring their relationship within the scope of the Conflict of

It is noted we have been told that both Ledes and

Abrams were associated with Tony Russo, ex-confidential

assistant to former Attorney General Brownell.

Russo has not

been alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

The case is being given top priority in handling both

MELVIN W. SMITH - VICTIM

CIVIL RIGHTS

This is the case concerning which Acting Assistant

Attorney General Joseph M. F. Ryan, Jr., Civil Rights Division,

made a press release on 1/14/60 stating that the IBI has been

requested to investigate this matter.

By memorandum 1/14/60, Mr. Ryan requested a preliminary

investigation based upon a news article in the "Washington Post

and Times Herald," 1/12/60, and an editorial in the same paper,

1/13/60, regarding an incident in Montgomery County Peoples Court

wherein one Gordon L. Contee became violent when convicted of

rape.

He was subdued by officers but Melvin Smith, Contee's

19-year-old hals brother, rushed forward from the audience and

struck Irank Griggs, an officer who was subduing Contee. It was

alleged that Smith was beaten by the officers while being taken

to jail after his assault on Griggs.

Colonel James S. McAuliffe, superintendent, Hontgomery

County Police, Melvin L. Reese,

Montgomery County Manager, and

Luke Bennett, sheriff, have all

been notified that the Bureau

has undertaken investigation of this matter.

Percinent court records vere not available over the

week end but will be reviewed I/18/60. The Montgomery County

Police Department reports have not yet been made available, but

State's Attorney Leonard I. Kardy is meeting with County Manager

Reese and County Police Superintendent McAuliffe 11860 i discuss

making these records available.

Subjects' attorneys have advised them to make no

statement except in attorneys' presence.

Subjects Griggs, Bechtel

and Dovries have advised they are represented by Barnard

Welsh and will confer with him to determine whether they should

furnish statements.

hit on the head with

a hard object but did not see who hit him.

As he turned around,

Griggs hit hin on the head with the night stick.

Offutt then hit

him with his fist above the left eye and Bechtel kicked him on the

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving

coastole sabotase in connection with the throo captiona vessola de

the United States

being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

On 11-12-59 foreign

material was found in a pump on the "Nautilus." The Boston Office

has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1,500 ship-

yard employees, submitted numerous cut cables for Laboratory examination

and used

the polygraph in connection with pertinent interviews:

On 1-5-60 nine small cuts were discovered in the degaussing

"Long Baratection against magnetic minos) of the nuclear cruises

which is being constructed at Quincy, Massachusetts.

These

contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison

with tools.

As of 1-14-60,

2,144 of over 5,000 employees

having

access to this vessel had been interviewed.

On 12-28-59,

21 cuts were

found in the fire control wiring

of the guided missile

frigate "Luce,"

which is also being constructed

at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This

damage was not reported to us or to

the Office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-60 as the damage was

originally considered probably inadvertent.

In view of the other

two cases involving cut cables, the Boston Office has opened an

investigation on this matter also.

The type of damage involved or the lack of any attempt to

hide or disguise the damage may be indicative ai employees attempting

to create more work or of disgruntled Navy personnel.

The Boston

Office has been instructed to afford these cases vigorous intensive

investigation.

BERNARD J. GOLDFINE

Although we are not involved in the Goldfine matter,

Ith is case is currently the

subject of a great deal of discussion

between the tax Division and the Treasury Department.

The Goldfine tax fraud investigation, according to

our treasury sources, is scheduled

to go before grand jury in

Boston next month. Goldfine and his nine New England componies

owe the Government approximately eight million dollars. This,

of course, includes interest, d; delinguency penalties, 25%5

and fraud penalty, 50% You will recall that the approximate

figure appeared

in the newspapers and the Goldfine dejense

charged that this was an attempt on the part of the Gouernment

to try its case in the newspapers.

No action was taken by

Treasury to look into this alleged leak of information on ihe

request of the tax Division of Justice since the total figure of

Goldfine's delinguency had been discussed with Goldfine and his

tax attorneys. It was felt that they could have planted the

story

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

Following the supreme court decision in the Greene

case: on June 29, 1959,

prolonged efforts to prepare a

Presidential Directive

to establish a program under which

private contractors may be granted access to classified data

have culminated in a draft order dated Janary 7, 1960.

Budget is circulating this draft to all interested agencies.

The more recent Bureau comments concerning this matter were

forwarded by memorandum to AAG Yeagley, December 30, 1959;

by memorandum to the Attorney General, with copies to

messrs. Halsh and leagley, dauary , 4900; ру тетогапсит.

January Ils 1960, to dr. leagley; and Dy memorandum of

January 14, 1960, to Assistant Attorney General Kramer, with

copy to ur. reagley. The last two of these communications

both concerned the same draft which is now being circulated

by Budget.

In brief, we have noted that under the proposed Order

agencies may consider all of the pertinent information available

regardless of source. Under section 1 4 1 protection is

afforded to regular conjidential informants.

Under Section 4 A.2

information from persons other than current informants may be

considered if they cannot appear due to death, severe illness,

or some such other good and sufficient cause.

It is apparent

that information from casual informants who refuse to testify

cannot be used under this section.

Nection o B, according to ht. leagley, would allow

use of data jrom wire taps, microphones, and other sensitive

techniques..

hir. reagley has indicated,

however, that such

data would have

to be produced in the form of actual quotations

from. the conversations

rather than the paraphrased form in

which we disseminate this information.

We believe it will not

be possible for us to furnish other than paraphrased information

in most instances because of the absolute necessity of protecting

our sources.

• Even though data from casual informants and sensitive

techniques may not be used

as indicated above,. section 9 of the

Order grants and affirms the department head concerned authority

62-77855

/i.

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1032

---

## Page 1033

to exercise control over the Nation's military and defense

secrets and nothing in the rest of the order is deemed to

limit or affect his responsibility and powers in this regard.

Use of such authority and power will permit the department

head to act in those instances in which derogatory data is

available but cannot be utilized under the procedures established

in the balance of the order.

We have observed to the Department

that it has undoubtedly considered the public reaction should it

turn out that it is necessary to use this summary power in a

majority of cases.

We have several times reiterated that FBI wi1l

respect the confidence placed in it by both regular informants

or other persons and will not disclose their identity without

their specific permission.

Ve have summarized by stating

that from our stanapoint,

the Order as drafted, will permit

us to furnish all available data to appropriate agencies as in

the past and provides appropriate protection for our confidential

informants. .

Data from any casual informants and from highly

sensitive

techniques will largely be usable only under section 9.

We have stated that the bureau does not object to the proposed

Order from an operational standpoint.

On January 14, John Doherty of the Department informed

us of a very minor addition, proposed by Philip Areeda of the

White House, which was discussed in memorandum of January 15:

This addition would not affect the comments we have previously

made concerning this order.

PROTECTING IDENTITY OF CONFIDENTIAL INFOPMANTS

CONFRONTATION ISSUE

The supreme court is scheduled to near arguments on two

cases

involving hearings and

the right of confrontation on

January 18, 1960.

The

cases

involve Hannon us. Larche and

Hannah

us. Slawson.

Solicitor General Rankin will argue the cases

for the Government.

The cases involve the President's Civil Rights Commission

which was established by the ederal Curl Rights Act of 105%

to investigate charges of citizens being discriminatorily deprived

of the right to vote.

The question raised for the supreme Court

is whether the civil Rights Act of 1957 authorizes the Civil Rights

Commission to conduct hearings wherein state registrars and

private citizens acoused of depriving others of the right to

vote

are denied notice of charges against them and confrontation.

Although the hearings held by the civil Rights

Commission are investigative rather than judicial or punitive

such as the normal Goverment hearing, the argument and the

Supreme Court decision in these cases

could shed some light

on the issue of confrontation as

well as the investigative agency's

right to protect the identity of confidential injormants.

This

is particularly true in view of the current negotiations

to

produce an Executäve Order in relation to the Industrial security

program.

These are the two cases which the "Hashington Post"

commented upon editorially on December l4, 1959, supporting the

civil Rights Commission's hearing procedures in

that it was

nECEssary

that the commission protect their conjidential informants

from reprisals by segregationists..

The "washington Evening Star"

on January 1I, 1960, in reporting the Attorney General's first

trip to argue

a case

before the supreme court on the constitutionality

lof the federal curl Rights Act commented that the above cases would

prove more difficult for the Government to argue and obtain a

/fauorable decision.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

The Department for about a year has been

to be exported in violation

alson or 9.

of law and follow through

to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality

cases.

This was to be accomplished through the issuance

Executive Order conferring on the Attorney General

powers to seize under this statute which in turn would

be delegated to the FBl by the Attorney General.

On November 19, 1959, the Attorney General

advised that the Treasury Department had agreed to the

proposed Executive Order. The Department advised on

December 23, 195%, that the proposed

Executive Order

• had been sent by the Attorney General to the President

through the director of the Bureau of the Budget for

approval by letter dated December 16, 1959.

On January 15, 1960, pursuant to our inquiry

concerning the current

status

of this matter, Assistant

Attorney General Walter Ycagley advised that the proposed

Executive Order is presently in the Bureau of the Budget

which has sent it to certain agencies for comment.

Yeagley advised that the Bureau of the Budget had

heard

from the Treasury Department but had not received replies

from the Office of Civil and Defense Mabilization, Department of

Defense and the state Department.

He advised that he

could not understand why the Office of Civil and Defense

Mobilization or the Department of Defense would have any

comment on this and

stated he was going to check with

Mr. Levy at the Bureau of the Budget who is handling

this hatter in an effort to have it expedited.

ELECTION LAWS

This matter involves the reported contributions by

Local 688 to the political campaigns of federal candidates.

Most of the contributions involved were apparently nade from

the polisical action committee account of Local 688.

Contributions from such accounts would not normally constitute

violations of Section 610, Title 18, U. S. Code; however,

with respect to this case, the Department by memorandum of

December 14, 1959, stated

that it had been advised by the

U. S. Attorney in St. Louis that the political action committee

fund of Local 638 as actually a general fund of the union's

which was raised from dues assessments and was not a fun derived

fron voluntary contributions.

Section 610, Title 18, U. 3. Code,

prohibits contributions by labor unions to the canpaigns of

Federal candidates.

On November 2, 1959, the U. 5. Attorney in Si. Louis,

Missouri, began subyoenaing a number of witnesses to appear

before a

Federal Grand Jury in St. Louis which contucted an

inquiry concerning the captioned

matter.

In conjunction with

the Grand Jury's inquiry,

the Bureau, at the specitic requests

of the U. S. Attorney and of the Civil Rights Division,

conducted certain investigation for the assistance of the

U. S. Attorney in presenting this natter to the Grand Jury.

Our investigation included interviews with Senator Wayne

Horse (D.-Ore.), Genator Thomas Hennings (D. - ilo.),

Congressman James Roosevelt (D. - Calif.) and Congressman

Henry 3. Reuss (D. - Wisc.)•

On January 27, 1960, U.S. Attorney Webster and

Assistant U. S. Attorney Bigler, St. Louis, advised that. on

January 26, 1960, they hau sent a proposed

indictment,

together

with a sunmary of the evidence, to the Department for its

approval. They advised that they would life, ii possible, to

present the indictment to the Grand Jury in It. Louis on

rebruary &, 1960.

The U. S. Attorney said that the proposed

indictment

does not include

a charge against Janes R. Mofia.

ile said the evidence connecting Hoffa with the check payaile

to the Congressman lenry j. Reuss camyaign seemed insufficient

to support a charge against

Iloffa.

These officials mentioned

that the proposed indictment incluces 21 counts, involving

10 political contributions.

STATUS OF JOHN GEORGE LEDES;

JOSEPH ABRAMS

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT -

CONFLICT OF INTEREST

This case was referred to us by the Attorney General

on 12-31-59. It relates to the association between Ledes, a

former legal adviser to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)

Commissioner James C. Sargent and Abrams, a New York promoter of

unsavory reputation.

Ledes resigned from Reynolds and. Company,

New York brokers, on 1-28-60.

We have reviewed voluminous SEC files throughout

the country and nave Interviewea numerous persons

in and out

of SEC who handled cases involving Abrams! firms. We determined

that Ledes endeavored to assist Abrams

in several SEC matters

while Ledes was still with that agency. Abrams

made loans to

Ledes relative to financing properties purchased by Ledes.

These

Joans may constitute payment of compensation to Ledes and

thus

bring their relationship within the scope of Conflict of Interest

Statutes.

SEC Commissioner Sargent, who originally denied knowledge

as to any connection between Ledes

and Abrams, has since improved

his memory considerably and now feels he may have been taken

advantage of by Ledes.

Sargent finally furnished a signed state-

ment as to his recollection of these matters on 2-5-60.

Sargent

told us that Ledes had been in touch with Tony Russo who had

arranged for former Attorney General Brownell to talk to attorney

General Rogers in July, 1958, about Sargent's ambition at the time

to become U.S. Attorney for

the Southern District of New YOrk.

We have been told that both Ledes and Abrams were associated with

Russo, ex-confidential assistant to Brownell. Russo has not been

alleged to be involved in any irregularities in this matter.

Arrangements are now being made to interview subteet

Ledes in New York city. Arrangements are also being made

interview subject Abrams who is serving a 30-month sentence on

Fraud Against the Government charges,

as well as Abrams' uncle,

Charles Gordon. These interviews, and subsequent record checks

to verify information furnished by the subjects, will complete

the investigation.

CRASH OF NATIONAL AIRLINES FLIGHT 967

DESTRUCTION OF AIRCRAFT OR MOTOR

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

on November 16, 1959, a plane with 42 persons aboard,

owned by Delta Air Lines but staffed with a National Airlines

crew; plunged into the Gulf of Mexico while on a flight from

lampa, Florida, to New Orleans, Louisiana.

only ten of the

victims were identiried and the other bodies have not been

recovered.

On January 17, 1960, we initiated a full-scale

investigation in this matter.

It had

been alleged that

Dr. Robert V. Spears, an ex-convict with a long criminal

induced his friend

„Florida, to board the plane in his place.

Taylor of Tampa' $100,000 worth of insurance with his wife

Spears had over

as

peneliciaty and taylor purchased so, sov worth or flight

insurance just prior to the trip with his son as beneficiary.

From the first, our investigation was directed at

finding Spears or Taylor

since this appeared to be a key point

in our investigation.

Spears was located by Bureau Agents in

thoenix, Arizona, on January 20, 19o0,

and charged with the

Interstate Transportation of a

Motor Vehicle (1TSMV).

Spears admittca Taylor took his place on the ill-fated plane

and that following

the crash he, Spears, tried to conceal his

identity: He took Taylor's car,with his alleged permission,

but admitted he had no authority to take it to Arizona and

that he and his friend, Dr. William Turska, removed the

identification number from it and tried to

get a fraudulent

title for the car.

Spears, with Turska, contacted Nrs. Spears

• in Dallas, Texas,

about January 7, 1960, and Mrs. Spears

admitted

that her husband persuaded her not. to reveal the

fact that he was alive so that the insurance policies could

be paid to her as beneficiary.

Fhoenix,

On January 20, 1960, when Spears was arrested in

„Arizona, he was charged with the Interstate Transportation

Arizona.

a Stolen Motor Vehicle for taking Taylor's car from Florida to

He was taken to the J.ü.

commissioner in Phoenix on

that date and held on $35,000 bong.. Un February 1, 1960, Spears

was brought before the J... District Judge in Fhoenix and

## Page 1044

charged by information with the interstate transportaion of Taylor's automobile.

Spears waived indictment and entered a plea of guilty. His bond was continued

at $35, 000, and February 15, 1960, was set as the date for sentencing.

Physical evidence from the crash is extremely sparse. Since the

examination of the limited physical material found did not indicate an

explosion or the reason for the crash, it was hoped that the plane could

be located in the Gulf. If the plane could be found and examined, it might

reveal some definite physical evidence of the cause of the crash, particularly

if a bomb was involved. On January 28, 1960, salvage operations were begun

by the Navy in the Gulf of Mexico after sonar contact had located an object

which was thought to be the plane. On february s, 1yo0, however, the Navy

discontinued salvage operations without locating the downed aircraft.

Following an interview with an abortionist in Dallas, Texas, who

formerly associated with Dr. Spears, the Miami.Office advanced the theory

that Spears might have been in Tampa on November 13 to 15, 1959, for

the purpose of preparing an abortion formula through a process which involves

the cooking of dynamite to obtain nitroglycerin, and that Spears might have

prevailed on Taylor to transport the formula to Dallas by plane in Spears'

place. The explosion, if there was one, might have resulted from an

accidental explosion of the abortion formula. The Laboratory has considered

this theory and has advised that it knows of no instance of the use of

nitroglycerin in preparations utilized to produce abortions. In addition,

during a reinterview with the Dallas abortionist, he advised that all of

the ingredients used by Spears in his abortion formula were stable and not

volatile or explosive.

All persons contacted in this investigation have denied any knowledge

of the wilful destruction of the plane. Nevertheless our investigation is being

pressed to determine full facts and to uncover any violations of Federal laws

which might have occurred. The United States Attorney at Phoenix has been

kept fully advised and has under consideration the question of whether a

prosecutable Federal case for mail fraud exists against Dr. Spears, his wife

and/or Dr. Turska.

As of February 8, 1960, twenty-five investigative reports in this case

have been made available to the Department and to the Civil Aeronautics Board.

Irank's body,

which was found near lure Beach, North Carolina,

bore only remnants of clothing.

The body was mangled and the lower

portion of the left arm and of both legs were missing. His luggage,

which reportedly consisted of a zipper-type blue flight bag and a

brown leacher attache case, has not been located.

TBI Laboratory examination of Frank's right hand and part

of his right arm,

portions of clothing jound on his body revealed no explosive resiave.

Pathologists who examined Irank's body have aduised that his body

had the appearance of having been subjected to a severe force of unusual

nature and they believe his injuries resembled blast damage but they

cannot definitely identify them as such.

According to the pathologists,

similar wounds have jeen observed on victims of land mine explosions.

FBI Laboratory examination of a life jacket jound at Kure Beach

on January 28, 1960, disclosed some nitrate present in a dirty smeared

deposit in an ared of the jacket in which were imbedded metal fragments

from a ripper and pieces of blue material. Numerous small blue fragments

from the lije jacket and from unidentified clothing jound at the crash

scene were determined to de similar and appear to correspond to the

material which composes blue flight bags sold by various airlines.

These findings are consistent with what would be expected as a result

of a detonation of a high-order type of explosive.

These findings

are not conclusive and additional maierial from the scene of the crash

will be examined as received uy the FBI Lacoratory in an effort to

reach a definite conclusion.

Extensive investigation of the activities of Frank has failed

to develop any direct evidence to date that he was responsible for

the crash.

The investigation of his acüvities and of the activities

of his associdies is continuing. Thirty-tuo investigative reports have

been dissemirated to the Devartment and to the civil eronautics 30ara.

DAMAGE TO NUCLEAR SUBMARINE "NAUTILUS," NUCLEAR

CRUISER "LONG BEACH" AND GUIDED MISSILE FRIGATE "LUCE"

SABOTAGE

The Boston Office is investigating three cases involving

possible sabotage to three vessels of the United states Navy.

which was

being overhauled at Portsmouth, New Hampshire.

It has been determined

that 42 of these cuts could have been made accidentally On 11-12-59

foreign material was found in a pump on the "Naut."lus.

The Boston

Office has interviewed the entire crew of the "Nautilus" and over 1, 500

shipyard employees.

As many of the damaged cables as could se made

available by the Navy have been submitted for Laboratory examination

and additional specimens are being submitted when they can be made

available by the Navy.

The polygraph has beer used in connection with

the interviews of suspect individuals and additional interviews using

the polygraph are being arranged.

on 1-15-60 nine smoll cuts were discovered in the degaussing

cables (protection against magnetic mines) of the nuclear cruiser

"Long Beach," which is being constructed at Quincy, Massächusetts.

These cuts contain no identifying marks for Laboratory comparison

with suspect tools.

. An average of 2,700 employees worked on this

vessel daily ano a total of approcimately 5,000 employees hod access

to it.

Over 3,100 individual employees have been interviewed and

interviews are continuing.

On 12-28-59,

21 cut wires were found in the fire control

wiring of the guided missile frigate "Luce"

, which is also under

construction at Quincy, Massachusetts.

This damage was not reported

to us or to the office of Naval Intelligence until 1-11-50 as the

damage was originally considered inaduertent. Ouer 14, 000 employees

hàd access to the vessel.

The employees assigned to the area of the

damage have been identified and are being interviewed.

Other employees

known to have worked in the area are also being interviewed. The

damaged wires have been forwarded to the IBI Laboratory for examination.

In connection with the danage on the "Long Beach" and "Iuce"

supervisory employees have expressed the opinion that this damage is

of the nuisance and malicious mischief type rather than sabotage as the

damage was not hidden and was readily apparent.

Investigation concerning

been delayed by a strike at the shipyard where these vessels are

under construction which began 1-23-50.

Management representatives

have been unable to enter the shipyard due to the picket line and

thus personnel is not available to furnish the names and addresses

The Boston Office hos been able to secure

The Boston Office has been instructed to afford these cases

vigorous,

INDUSTRIAL SECURITY PROGRAM

On February 2, 1960, the House passed H.R. 8121,

introduced by ur. Halter, which would authorize the secretary

0f Defense to establish a program for screening employees

- of private contractors for access

to classified information.

The bill states that procedures prescribed

be designed to protect from disclosure all information which,

in the opinion of the secretary of Defense, would affect the

national security, safety, or public interest or would tend

to compromise investigative sources or investigative methods.

The bill has been referred to the senate Committee on the

Judiciary and, if passed, would permit Defense to reinstitute

the same program which was in effect at the time of the

supreme Court decision in the Greene Case. Defense could,

nowever;

institute a new program offering a maximum of con-

frontation while protecting sources or techniques in accordance

with the terms of the bill.

On February 5, 1960, Assistant Attorney General leagley

forwarded a new draft of the proposed executive order in this

matter and stated it was the result of meetings with the attorney

General and the Mite House and that he hoped that it would

be the final draft. This draft introduced four major changes.

22222

The first of these would permit use of information

from a so-called "casual" informant without confrontation if the

informani could not appear due to death, sèvere illness, or

some other cause determined bu the head of the depariment to

be good ana sulficient.

The underlined words have been added

and would considerably broaden the circumstances under which

information from such a source might be used.

A second change, however, would require that when

an exception to confrontation was granted in the case of death

or severe illness, as indicated above; the identity of the

source be disclosed to the applicant.

This requirement would

apply only in the case of death or severe illness and would not

apply to the new exception discussed in the previous paragraph.

We have repeatedly told the department that we must respect the

12-175: :6.1.6

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1048

---

## Page 1049

confidence placed in us by persons who furnish us

information

and that we will not disclose their identities without their

permission.

In the case of death or severe illness, we will

be unable to secure that permission and we do not understand

why this requirement has been added.

A thira change makes

it possible for either the

Attorney General or the director to certify that an individual

is a current confidential informant and that his disclosure

would be detrimental to the national security. The previous

draft required that this certification be made by the Attorney

General and we consider this preferable. If the head of the

investigative agency is permitted to furnish derogatory data

and, at the same

time, to decide whether the applicant is to

have an opportunity to confront the source of that data, this

procedure may be criticized both by the public and the courts.

This matter was discussed with the Department by Mr. Belmont

at a meeting in the Deputy Attorney General's Office on

August 31, 1959, when it was agreed that both from a logical

standpoint and the standpoint of the supreme court,

certification concerning the need to protect an informant's

identity should be made by the Attorney General in the case

of the FBI or the appropriate department head in the case of

other investigative agencies.

The fourth change clarifies the authority of the

department head to deny or revoke access to classified data

without regard to the balance of the Order. Although the

previous draft granted this authority, the new language is an

improvement as it removes all possible doubt as to its meaning.

SEIZURE POWERS IN NEUTRALITY CASES

The Department has been attempting to have

issued an Executive Order which would give us power

under Title 22,

Section 401, United States Code, to

seize arms, munitions of war and other articles

to be exported in violation of law and follow through

to final conclusion in the investigation of neutrality

cases.

The Department advised on December 23, 1959,

that the proposed executive urder had been sent by the

Attorney General to the tresident through the director

of the Bureau of the Budget by letter dated December 16,

1959.

Pursuant to our inquiries

.. the vepartment

determined that the proposed Executive Order had been

sen ate Barene ts the a tet tee be east commerce

Defense Mobilization. It had been previously cleared with

Treasury by the Department.

This matter has been closely

from all these agencies offering no objection to the

issuance of the Ordei. Connerce,

however, in its letter

we understood Commerce has jurisdiction under the export

Control Act of 1y4y and would keep the commerce Department

advised of any information developed of interest to that

agency•

A letter was sent to the Department on February 5,

1960, suggesting that the Department serid Commerce a

letter similar to the one it previously furnished freasury

assuring that these seizure powers would be used only in

neutrality cases and that

of course, the FBI would

furnish Commerce any pertinent information developed.

It is assumed that upon the receipt of that letter by

Commerce the matter will then be cleared for the resident's

signature.

Indiana.

Since that time, the Communist Farty, USA, has been

conducting a continuous campaign to effect Winston's release

either through parole,

executive clemency or amnesty: Pecently,

this campaign was accelerated because Winston was alleged to be

suitering from a brain tumor. On january 22, 1960, Winston was

The last hospital bulletin indicates his

condition is satisfactory and his eyesight is improving.

on vanuary 26, 1960, a parole hearing for Winston was

held before the U. S. Board of Parole in Washington, D. C.,

several known Comnunists and Communist sympathizers

appeared at

this hearing in Winston's behalf.

since

the attorney representing

Winston claimed that his briefcase containing petitions and

signatures had been stolen, the Farole Board agreed to postpone

the hearing for one week to enable him to duplicate the petitions.

Among the individuals appearing at the Parole hearing

was Reverend Elder G. Hawkins of New York City, a strong

supporter of communist front organizations.

Bureau files show

that since 1940, Rev. Hawkins has

STUART SUTOR, ET AL.,

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF

STOLEN PROPERTY; THEFT OF

GOVERNNENT PROPERTY; FEDERAL

FIREARMS ACT; NEUTRALITY MATTERS;

CONSPIRACY

On October 14, 1958, 317 weapons were stolen from the

National Guard Armory at Canton, Ohio.

Approximately one-half

of these weapons were seized by Federal Officers at Morgantown,

West Virginia, as they were being flown to Florida for eventual

sale to forces of fidel Castro in Cuba. Investigation by Bureau

Agents revealed that this theft was plotted and engineered by

henchmen of Sam Nannarino, well-known racketeer in the Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania area. Two of his principal lieutenants Joe Merola,

former jewel thief and Norman Rothman a

front man for American

gambling interests

in Cuba, were indicted along with the pilot

of the plane, Stuart Sutor, and three other hoodlums from

the

Pittsburgh,

Pennsylvania area.

They were charged with violations

of Theft of Government Property, Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property, and Conspiracy.

On January 12, 1960, trial convened in U. S. District

Court, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, before Visiting U. S.. District

Judge

Rodger I. Foley of Judicial District, Las Vegas, Nevada.

After a trial which involved the appearance of over 85 Government

witnesses, all subjects were found

guilty by the jury and on

February 4, 1960, were sentenced by the court. Subjects Sutor,

Merola, Rothman, Hanna, and Carlucci received 5-year prison

terms.

Joseph Giordano, one of the lesser figures received a

3-year term.

In addition lengthy suspended sentences were

imposed by the court on Sutor, Hanna, Carlucci, and Giordano.

The court immediately ordered all subjects remanded

to the custody of the U. S. Marshal, reiusing bail and

all motions

by the defense for new trial.

It is expected that the defense

will immediately appeai this case.

Memorandum to Mr. De Loach

Re: Director's Meeting with

Assistant Attorney General

Will R. Wilson

A number of case writeups are set forth which are believed

to be of interest to the Department, particularly AAG Wilson. Included

are fraud cases against the Universal Fibreglass Corporation (thirteen

million dollar contract to produce mail delivery trucks); Youth Pride,

Inc., Washington, D. C. (payroll padding); Chromcraft Corporation

("'paper" corporations formed to act as subcontractors in connection

with production of rocket launchers for United States Navy).

Writeups are also submitted concerning financier Louis

Wolfson and his alleged dealings with Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas

based upon information furnished by the Internal Revenus Service;

the bribery case involving Congressman George H. Fallon (allegations

received that payoffs totaling $200, 000 were made to Congressman

Fallon and Lawson B. Knott, Jr., former General Services administrator,

in return for obtaining commitments for Government occupancy of

(office buildings). Our New York Office developed information that a

theft ring existed at John E. Kennedy Airport, New York City, and

it is anticipated Federal Grand Jury will indict 15 to 17 individuals.

Attorney General Mitchell has reportedly expressed interest in this

case (Sidney Steinschreiber; And Others, Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Property).

ACTION:

This is submitted for information, and attached are more

detailed writeups concerning the above matters.

DETAILS:

ORGANIZED CRIME

ALBERT M. BILLITERI

EXTORTIONATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS

Billiteri is a Buffalo, New York La. Cosa Nostra

member in the "family" of "Commission" member Steve Magaddino,

and operates a major loan-shark racket in the Buffalo area on

behalf of Joseph Fino, the "underboss" of the Magaddino family.

On 4/23/69, the Attorney General approved a recommendation for

microphone and technical surveillance at two of Billiteri's

key locations where this illegal activity is carried on.

The

Attorney General authorized a Department Attorney to handle

the filing of affidavits with the Federal court in Buffalo,

York, to obtain the necessary court order for the

electronic surveillance sought, pursuant to Title 3 of the

Omnibus Crime Bill.

The Department Attorney, in conjunction

with our Buffalo office, was to make application to the court

on 4/28/69, the necessary affidavits to be filed by a Bureau

Agent.

This is the first such application we have made

pursuant to the provisions of Title 3.

MANHATTAN JOINT STRIKE FORCE

The Department has proposed a strike force with the

stated objective of making a concentrated drive against

organized crime in the borough of Manhattan in New York City,

This apparently has been enlarged to include the Bronx in

view of the inclusion of the Bronx County District Attorney

on the Strike Force Council.

This strike force is to be

composed of Department Attorneys, members of the staffs of

the District Attorneys of New York and Bronx Counties, members

of the New York City Police Department and investigators from

the various Federal investigative agencies, including the FBI.

The Federal Government is to provide the office space and office

equipment. A supervisory council has been named to make

decisions of strategy and timing and approve all planning. The

members of the Council have been named as Assistant Director

in Charge John F. Malone of, our New York office, the District

Attorneys of New

York and Bronx Counties, Police Commissioner

of New York City, Assistant Attorney General Will Wilson, the

Assistant secretary for Law Enforcement of the Treasury

Department, the Chief of the Organized Crime and Racketeering

ANTIRIOT LAWS

Chicago Cases

On March 20, 1969, the Federal Grand Jury at Chicago,

Illinois, based upon extensive Bureau investigations, returned

indictments against seven leaders of the New Left and one leader

of the Black Panther Party all of whom were charged with

Antiriot Laws violations in connection with the Chicago disturbances

at the time of the Democratic National Convention. Trial has been

set for September 24, 1969.

San Francisco Case

After extensive FBI investigation the Department commenced

grand jury proceedings on April23, 1969, at San Francisco in

connection with Antiriot Laws violations allegedly committed by

three Black Panthers who gave instructions in the use of firearms

and explosives during a conference held by the Black Panther Party

in San Francisco last November.

Philadelphia Case

We have conducted extensive investigation into Antiriot

Laws violations in connection with the Black Power Conference held

in Philadelphia in August and September, 1968. Approximately 3, 000

to 4, 000 Negroes from all over the country attended this conference

during which five subjects provided instruction in the use of firearms

and explosives for a closed meeting of approximately 70 persons.

Inauguration Disturbances

On April 18, 1969, the Department requested investigation of

fifteen subjects who allegedly came to Washington, D. C., on inauguration

day for the purpose of creating disorders. This investigation is being

conducted on an expedite basis.

Campus Disorders

At the present time there are also a number of Antiriot Laws

investigations being conducted with regard to recent campus disorders,

NW 65360 Docld:32989646 Page 1058

## Page 1059

.

most notably at Brandeis University where two professors from San

Francisco State College allegedly contributed to the seizing of the

Administration Building on January 8, 1969, and American University,

Washington, D. C., where members of the Students for a Democratic

Society allegedly traveled to Washington, D. C., and participated in

seizing a building on the campus on April 23, 1969.

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION

OF-STOLEN MOTOR VEHICLE

INVESTIGATIONS (DYER ACT)

In the fall of 1967, the former Attorney General and his

staff held conferences with various United States Attorneys (USA) •

here in Washington, D. C. Following these conferences, we learned

of a divergence of opinion among USAs concerning the Department's

views in prosecuting Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicle

(ITSMV) cases. Some had the opinion that only automobile theft ring

cases should be prosecuted in Federal court while others were of the

opinion that only cases having commercial aspects should be considered

for such prosecution. Other USAs felt only cases possessing aggravated

circumstances should be considered. Some continue to consider each

case on its individual merits. During the period October, 1967,

through May, 1968, we wrote four letters to the former Attorney

General requesting the Department's views concerning the prosecution

of these cases. In a letter dated April 12, 1968, to the Department,

we set forth our views that prosecution of Dyer Act cases in Federal

court should not be restricted to commercial matters and to adults,

but rather that each case should be considered on its individual merits.

None of these letters were answered. On March 5, 1969, we wrote the

present Attorney General informing him of the divergence of opinion among

USAs. This letter also requested the Attorney General furnish us his

views concerning this matter; however, an answer has not been received

to date.

UNIVERSAL FIBREGLASS CORPORATION

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

Following a partial audit by General Services

Administration, we instituted an investigation, at Depart-

ment's request, of alleged overcharges to the Government by

Universal Fibreglass Corporation (Universal) on a $13 million

contract to produce mail delivery trucks.

All logical investi-

gation has been completed and reported except the review of the

Universal records.

Access

to the pertinent records was recently

achieved through court action and an extensive audit is now

being pressed. Criminal prosecution of several subjects is

now indicated.

Congressman H. R. Gross (R-Iówa) has publicized

this matter.

Press items have indicated that the office of

then Senator Hubert H. Humphries may have been instrumental

in having the contract awarded to Universal.

YOUTH PRIDE, INC.

FRAUD AGAINST THE

GOVERNMENT

In January, 1969, following administrative investi-

gations by General Accounting Office and Department of Labor,

the Department requested we review subpoenaed records of

violation of Fraud Against the Government Statutes. Grand

jury began hearing witnesses March 10, 1969.

CHROMCRAFT, CORPORATION: ET AL.

FRAUD AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT

We conducted an extensive investigation in this case

of a multimillion dollar fraud scheme in which "paper" corpora-

tions were formed to act as subcontractors

in connection with

the production of rocket launchers for theU. S. Navy. Millions

of dollars in overcharges to the Navy were channeled by subjects

into Swiss bank accounts.

On August 7, 1968, two corporations

and four individuals, including Francis Rosenbaum, a Washington,

D. C., tax attorney, were indicted in Washington, D. C.;

on

charges of conspiring to defraud the Government of more than

$4 million.

Trial date is set for September S, 1969. On

January 29, 1969, Civil

suits were filed in Federal courts in

Washington, D. C., and St. Louis, Missouri, demanding judgment

for double damages arising from the fraud charges in the criminal

indictment.

LOUIS WOLFSON

INFORMATION CONCERNING

At request of the Department, received April 17,

1969, we are ascertaining subscribers to some 400 telephone

numbers in various parts of the United States called from

the Florida farms of Louis

Wolfson, who was recently

convicted in two Securities and Exchange Commission cases

in New York.

Most of these have been determined and furnished

Criminal Division. Remaining are being expedited and results

being furnished to Department as received.

Bureau records

also checked with negative results regarding $20,000 check

from Wolfson Family Foundation to Abe Fortas, Supreme Court

Justice, dated January 3, 1966, and $20,000 check from Fortas

to Wolfson Family Foundation dated December 22, 1966.

Internal

Revenue Service conducted investigation and determined $20,000

check to Fortas

was allegedly for discrimination study and

$20,000 returned to Wolfson Family Foundation by Fortas as

study was not undertaken.

CONGRESSMAN GEORGE H. FALLON; ET AL.

BRIBERY

Investigation is being conducted of allegation made

by Joseph J. Weiner, a Washington, D. C., mortgage broker,

that payoffs totaling $200,000 were to be made to Congressman

Fallon and Lawson B. Knott, Jr., former General Services

Administration Administrator (GSA), in return for obtaining

commitments from GSA for Government occupancy of office

buildings in Baltimore, Maryland, and Durham, North Carolina,

to be constructed by Piracci Construction Company, Baltimore,

Maryland.

Weiner was granted immunity by U.S. Attorney,

INTERSTATE TRANSPORTATION OF

STOLEN PROPERTY (ITSP)

THEFT FROM INTERSTATE SHIPMENT (TFIS)

CONSPIRACY

Captioned investigation concerns theft ring operating at

John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York City. Special

Prosecutor Daniel P. Hollman, Department of Justice Task Force, is

presenting evidence to Federal Grand Jury wherein 15 to 17 indictments

anticipated probably April 30, 1969. Organized Crime Section of the

Department of Justice and Attorney General Mitchell particularly interested.

In October, 1968, four individuals, including Steinschreiber

and Mario Alessi, were arrested by the FBI in connection with theft of

drugs. Since that time, Alessi, a Pan American Airways cargo

supervisor, has been cooperating and named others in connection with

pharmaceutical thefts amounting to over $100,000, as well as a series of

general merchandise thefts, such as furs, jewelry, and firearms

probably in excess of $250, 000 involved. Alessi has identified Raymond

Wood, U. S. Customs Examiner, as being involved. Wood has been

interviewed, but denies complicity. Customs Agency has been apprised

of Wood's alleged involvement.

This Bureau has long been aware of the serious problems of

thievery at airports in the New York metropolitan area, particularly at

John F. Kennedy International Airport. Special Agents of this Bureau are

assigned on the scene at that airport and are actively handling investigations

• of violations within our jurisdiction. In performing our duties, we enjoy

close working cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, with

the airlines, and with the Airport Security Council formed in 1968 to

cope with these problems.

ADDENDUM BY MR. TOLSON 10/13/61

I am inclined to the view that we should not send the attached

JEK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

with respect to countries in Central and

South America. Arter all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson,

indicated what we could do and he, in turn, advised that the requested

clearances would not be granted. It is not the Bureau's basic

responsibility to develop information concerning these foreign countries.

It is obvious that someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has

talked is opposed to our doing this. We have been told that if there is

a specific country or individual involved and a request was made by the

Bureau, consideration would be given to such a request. I think that we

should let the matter stand on that basis.

Mr. Belmont does not agree. This matter presently rests on

an oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record.

reports that Peiping's interest in expanding its network of diplomatic

ties has significantly increased in past three years.

Communist China now

has diplomatic relations with 48 countries and,

because of its recent

successes and continued intensive efforts, it may soon overtake

Nationalist China which has recognized 60

countries.

According to the

memorandum, this is liable to have immense effect on Chinese representation

in international organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN).

According to state Department, Japan is the number one target on!

Communist China's diplomatic horizon and an intensive step-by-step

cultivation of

Japan is under way. CIA's "Secret" Special/Report,

China Problem in Japanese Politics," dated 5-1-64, reports tHat in Japan

supporters of the Japanese Government feel that developmentrof Japan's

informal relations will lipen into full-iledged aiplomatic relations with

Communist China.

The fact that trade between Japan and Communist China is on the

increase cértainly can

be expected to encourage establishment of

diplomatic relations between these countries in the not too far distant

future.

In 1963, this trade increased 60 per cent over 1962 and it is

expected to take

another big jump in 1964. Further, the Communist Party

of Japan (CrJ) 1s urging close ties with China.

This organization of

approximately 105,000 members

has taken the side of Communist China in iis

ideological war with the USSR.

Memorandum Hannall to Sullivan

JFK Act 5

(9) 12) (0)

According

to articles in the 7/9 and 19/64 issues of "The

New York Times," the Japanese Government is not as strong now as in

preceding years.

Prestige of its Premier, Hayato Ikeda, re-electec

to a third term

7-10-64, has been damaged by inflationary trends that

have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three years.

His new

cabinet has been called "weak" and "lightweight" due to his attempts to

• achieve balance among feuding elements in his own Liberal Democratic

Party.

Japan is also buffeted by pressures from the USSR with which

lit has rather extensive trade relations.

On 5-14-64, the USSR's First

Deputy Premier, Anastas Mikoyan, made a

surprise "good will" visit to

Japan. He and

members of his group met with Premier Ikeda

and other

highly placed Japanese officials.

Real purpose behind his visit is

unknown.

Some claim his aim was merely an expansion of trade.

Others

believe

USSh felt the trip was necessary so as to

reinforce Russia's

position with Japan because of increased relations between Japan and China:

OBSERVATIONS:

Industrially, Japan is the leading power in Asia and it wields

considerable influence on lesser Asiatic countries. Capitulation by

Japan to pressures of Communist China could have significant effect

such countries, possibly hastening their own recognition of Communist China

and also the ultimate admission of Communist China to UN. We should do

what we can to make available to State Department and other interested

agencies, any information which would enable them to take appropriate

steps. It is, therefore, recommended

1/7/64:

This is to advise that there are reportedly five

thousand Japanese nationals in various capacities in the New

York City area,

JEK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

It is felt that the Bureau, at this time,

might consider authorizing the institution of nationality •

group coverage concerning Japan to further implement our

current coverage. It is felt that with recent overtures from

the Soviet Union

regarding trade and cultural exchanges with

Japan and, more important, trade relations being further

extended between Japan and Red China that for these reasons

Japanese coverage should be extended.

In view of the above, it is requested that authority be granted

to institute nationality group coverage concerning Japan.

At the present time, the Algerian Government, headed y

assistance from

Algerian military personnel are also receiving

military training in those countries. The Algerian Communist Party,

* Which supported Ben Bella's party in its fight against the French for

Algerian independence, is gaining in numbers and influence.

It would

appear that intelligence information relating to Algerian activities

both in the United States and abroad is of definite interest to the U.s.a

Government in view of Algeria's rising influence in North African

political and military matters.

JEK Act 5 (g) 12) (D)

Jamaica, an independent nation since October,

1962

within the past year has been subjected to widespread

civil

disorders posing a substantial threat to the existing

Government. There has been significant strengthening of

subversive, comnunist and anti-Government forces within the

country.

Increasing inability of Government and police to

cope with severe unrest has precipitated urgent plea for

substantial U. S. assistance. On basis of indications of

rapidly deteriorating internal situation in Jamaica.

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

HHS,

ЧАЇ,

Pilson

Grinding poverty and an extremely high unemployment

rate make Jamaica a prime area for left-wing agitators.

Consulate of Cuba in Kingston is focal point for procommunist

and anti-Government agitation and activity.

The recently

organized Young Communist Organization (YCO), is reportedly

receiving guidance and assistance from Cuban

• Consul, and is

preparing to become spearhead for sabotage and terrorism.

YCO has established training base in Jamaica and in mid-June

made unsuccessful attempt to dynamite a major Government

building.

Communist elements are attempting to control the

Ras Tafari lovement, a Jamaican back nationalist extremist

cuit with an estimated membership of twenty thousand.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

121 208

On occasion it has proved important in connection with United States

interests in and relations with the other American Republics to obtain

intelligence information on activities taking place within the United

States Specificallys it is important that the Department keep track of

the movements and contacts of selected Latin Americans while in this

country when there are reasons to believe that suoversive activities

directed at the other Governments of

this Hemisphere are being planned

and coordinated here. Such activities are against the national interests

of the United States in so far as they may result in developments which

could endanger United States lives, threaten United States business

interests and cause friction within the inter American system.

In the past the FBI has always cooperated in lunishing the Department

in specific Latin American cases with information available from estab-

lished sources, but it has shown understandable reluctance to become in

volved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in cases where

there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive activities

directed against the United States or violation of United States laws.

It is felt that while this information is helpful, it does not completely

fill the gap in the intelligence information important in the conduct of

foreign relations. It is understood that the CIA, while interested in

foreign intelligence, does not carry out surveillance operations within

the confines of the United States,

It would be most appreciated if you could express an opinion as to

how surveillance of selected Latin American visitors to this counticy might

be arranged on an individual case basis.

An identical letter is being sent to the CIA in the hope that 'ä

coordinated approach can be made.

Sincerely yours,

5?

By letter of 10/10/55 Mre hobert Murphy,

secretary

of state, noted that it

is important that state keep track op

movements and contacus of selected Latin americans while in los. when

there are reasons to believe subversive activities directed at other

governments of this hemisphere are being planned and coordinated here.

The letter notes

that the FBI has cooperated in furnishing information

from established sources but "has shown understandable reluctance to

become involved to the extent of conducting direct surveillance in

cases where there is no evidence of nor reason to suspect subversive

activities directed against the United States or violation of United

States laus." Letter requests opinion as to how surveillance of

•selected Latin Americon visitors might be arranged on

Anuricans while in this country won there are reasons to bolieve

that subversive activitios disected at the oüher Governments of

In this country

Amcricans whore there is no evidonce of nor reason to suspect

aubversive activitios directed against the United states or

violation of United States laws.

Tou requested an opinion as to

how surveillences of selectod Latin American visitors to this

country night be arronged on an individual case basis.

When there is creditable intormation available indicating

that subversive activitios directod at athor goverumonts of this

hemisphere are being plannea and coordinated in the United States,

the FBI takes prompi investicative action in view of the probability

of violations of the registration or neutrality provisions of

United States laus.

In conducting these investigations all logical.

investigative techniques are used, including physical survelllances

whore circumstances would warrant.

Full-time physical surveillances

roquire a tremendous expenditure of manpower, however, and are

practicable only in connection with some phases of highly important

cases in the security or criminal fields.

In the greater majority i

of cases more actual information can be obtained through such

Tolson investigative techniques as spot-type surveillance, the'use, of

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR

The Honorable Robert Murphy

Deputy Unrici Secretary for Political Affairs

Department of state

Vashington, D. C.

Dear Me. Murphy:

Reference is made to your letter of 10 October 1955, relative to

the problem of conducting surveillance of cortain Latin American

nationals who might be suspected of carrying en subversive activities

in the United States, directeù against Latin American countries. In

this regard you are correct in your understanding that the ClA does

not conduct such surveillances within the confines of the United States.

Mr. Hoover has furnished me a'copy of his reply to your inquiry setting

forth the FBi's jurisdiction and responsibilities in this matter.

We have been furnishing to the Department and to the FBI such

intelligence information as we have obtained through our operations

abroad bearing upon possible subversive activities of the type of per-

son you describe, do such information beceme available to us. It

woulá also be heipful i we could receive from time to time from the

Department, leads which you may receive and which we could possibly

* follow up in the Latir American country against which subversive

activities are being carried on.

In order to ansist us in developing our coverage of this field, we

would suggest that you designate someone in the Department of State

who could confer with the appropriate persons in this Agency, and if

you will let me know whom you will designate fos this purpose, I will

arrange to put him in touch with my representative. Also, if you see

no objection, I will mention this matter to the members of the IAC

he gone to the to mistan be able in ica i homem

to the Department.

A copy of this reply is being sent to Mr. Hoover.

Sincerely,

tis

MEMORANDUM TO BOARDMAN FROM BELMONT

OBSERVATIONS (continued)

since January, 1954, CIA has indicated on four separate

occasions a desire to explore the positive intelligence

potential the United Mation a man tina.

Certainly, there are dangers involved in any attempt to

cover official establishments of "friendly foreign countries.

Coverage would have to be most discreet.

We could not even

attempt to utilize the same type of extensive coverage we

have on the soviet bloc.

6.

If we went into a program óf this nature, we would have to

have funds.

Regardless of how limited the coverage is, it

will take money.

A program of this nature should be run by and within the

control of the bureau; however

endorsement of the state Department.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

That we institute a progrom designed to gather intelligence

from "griendly" foreign official establishments in this country,

starting on a highly restricted basis-neeLy una

wire taps and, where possible with full security, microphone.

on selected foreign establishments. Included in

these establishments would be embassies and consulates, and

delegations to the United Nations.

The selection of the

countries to be covered will be based on those indicated by

the state Department to be "problem children" or the most

fruitful potential sources of intelligence. Any further

coverage beyond technical and microphone coverage will depend

on what leads are developed through these sources and what

can be done on a most discreet basis. We will continue our

Anagram Program and will continue our efforts to develop

informants within these establishments when such action can

note castrument o

be done discreetly.

Dear Mt. Hoover:

I wish to thank you for your leüter of October 14, 1955 in

which you stated that there is no reluctance on the part of the

•FBI to conduct physical surveillance of selected Latin American

visitors to this country where the circumstances warrant such

action. Your assurances that every effort will be made in these

:

cases to. develop those aspects which may be of particular inter-

est to the Departuent of State and that consideration will be

given to the utilization of a physical surveillance when requested

by the Department of state where it is agreed that this type of

coverage is warranted and necessary, should prove helpful in

handling these cases in the future.

then the Department of State has reason to believe that visit

ing Latin Americans may be engaged in planning and coordinating

subversive activities directed at other governments of this

hemisphere, such infornation will be brought to the attention of

the FBI through established channels as heretofore, together

with an explanation of tha Departmentis objectives and requirents, s

in order that an appropriate investigation may be initiated.

The continued cooperation of the FBI is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Hwhen there are reasons to believe subuersive activities directed at otiler

governments of this hemisphere are being planned and coordinated here.

The

letter noted that the fBI had cooperated in furnishing information frum

established sources but "has shown understandable reluctance to become

involved to the extent of conducting direct surveillances in cases where

there is no evidence of or reason to suspect subversive activities directed

lagainst the Dos. or violation of U.S. laws." A reply dated 10-14-55 was

sert to Murphy. By letter dated 10-i4.55 a copy of our letter to Murphy

was sent to Allen Dulles of the Centrai Intelligence Agency (CIA). I+

should be noted that CIA also received a copy of lurphy's letter to us.

On 11-16-55 James Angleton of the CIA confidentially advised

Mlbalson agent papich that Allen Dulles might make some comments concernino

Murphy's letter before the Intelligence Advisory Committee (IAC) meetinga

week of 11-21-55. Our position concerning this motter was clearly set forth

in our reply to Murphy 10-14-55. He aduised that when there is creditable

information available indicating that subversive activities directed at

other governments of this hemisphere are being planned and coordinated in

the Voso, the FBI takes prompt investigative action.

He advised that in con

dusting these investigations all logical investigative techniques are used a

including physical surveillances where the circumatances warrant it. He

made it clear that there was no reluctance on the part of the Bureau to con-

duct physical surveillances when deemed necessary but we also pointed out

that there were instances where information could be obtained through other

means than physical survelllances.

He advised State that when that agency

received creditable information concerning Latin Anericans involued in

subversive activities directed of either the Vas. or other governmenta, ele

would appreciate recelving the information immediately in order that an

investigation could be promptly intuiated Me stated that every enjori

going into developments in Afghanistan, with particular

going into the soulet camp.

wuring the diaoussion, It

appeared to be the opinion of the IAc group that the souiet

government ta able to offer considerable advantages to sit ini

with which dighaniston is nuing aifficulties, and through

possible pinoncial and military supporto As a result, it

was the feeling that there is a atrong possibility Algianistan

will gradually fall within the control of the soulets, although

ostensibly remalning a sovereign state.

There were several changes suggested in the CIA

paper, and lito kuhrts will get a copy of it for our benefit.

In Iine with our recent discussions, it is suggested

that a remoranous be prepared, briefly posing

the problem that

RECORDED.

As a result of action taken by this Bureau over

a year ago, we,

at the present time,

have a well-functioning

program designed to produce positive intelligence infor

macion in this country concerning various foreign nations.

This intelligence information relates to the policy which

these foreign nations are pursuing or developing in

connection with various international matters:

With the development of the recent crises in

the Middle East and Eastern Eurppe we found that our efforts

in this field were especially rewarding.

Through numerous

sources which hove been established during the past year we

secured voluminous intelligence data which were given within

the-hour dissemination to other Governmental depariments and

officials.

Deputy Under secretary of state Robert Murphy has

addressed a letter to me concerning some of the intelligence

information which has been sent to the Department of state

during recent weeks. Mr. Murphy commented as follows:

"I want to express the Department's appreciation

to you and the Bureau for the special coverage

which you have been providing us during these

recent weeks. The material has been immensely

events and developments. in the international, s

situation and has been of great assistance tous a

¿in the formulation of polley."

In view of the keen interest you nave,

RuPt

in the past in the operations of this Bureaus of felt that

you would like to be advised of the above.

Indications were that a coup may be attempted in Libya in the near

future by pro-vasser forces.

(Memorandum sullivan to Belmont 8-1-58,

•re "precarious position of Libya in Middle East").

A state department representative on 8-1-00, while discussing

Deputy Under secretary of state Robert Murphy's recent trip to the

Middle East, aduised that sudan, like Ethiopia and other countries in

that area, is fearjul of Egyptian subversive tactios.

He noted that

while sudan and Ethiopia are basically friendly to the u.s. and the

West,

the Egyptians have been corrupting a number of officials of these

countries by bribes. (Memorandum Roach to Belmont 8-8-58, re

WFO on 8-8-58 advised that since the revolution in

Gandy

Kiet

Venezuela in January,

1950, the country has been ruled by a Junta. in

Newspaper media since the revolution have reported periodically that

individuals uno were political exiles during the regime of marcos Perez

Jimenez have been allowed to return to Venezuela and pursue their

former political activities.

It has become apparent from daily news stories that

Venezuela is presently in a state of political upheaval: Although

the leader of the Junta, Admiral Larrazabal, has stated he has no

political aspirations it has been pointed out by correspondents that

he has recently given indication of this by touring the country and

"wooing" the support of the communists. This reportedly has been

done by statements attributed to larrazabal that he could not conceive

of a venezuelan communist being controlled by the USSR since all

Venezuelans are inherently patriotic and loyal to venezuela.

It has

also been pointed out that the communists of Venezuela are being

played up as the heroes of the recent revolution in that country.

Some correspondents have stated that it is felt there will possibly

be a military coup is the politicians of venezuela do not soon set up

a government acceptable to the military leadèrs. It is further

noted that the Vice President and Mrs. Nixon experienced insults

during their tour of Latin America, the most vicious of which

occurred in Venezuela.

Irom the above, it appears that we should try to place

ourselves in a position to obtain current intelligence data

concerning the venezuelan political situation.

It is pointed out

that there appears to be a possibility of the Venezuelan communists

gaining more and more influence and power in that country and,

therefore, shifting venezuela to alignment with the soviet Bloc. WFO

noted that a confidential source has reported on several occasioner

a strong interest in Latin America bu the soviet Embassu. l

WFO on 8-22-58 advised that although Brazil's President

recently indicated a stronger stand in favor of the U. s., various news;

media have reported that politically powerful nationalist and leftist

groups do exist in Brazil and that until recently Brazil's President bad

avoided offending such groups.

Ban atto

Anti-U. So feelings and demonstrations were exhibited in Brazil

auring the south imerican trip of Vice President and Mrs. Nixon and

although the demonstrations did not attain the violence exhibited in some

of the other south American countries, the demonstrations indicated the

work of well organized group or groups opposed to the u.s.

On 7-8-58, Hilson Velloso, Press Attache, Brazilian Embassy,

who admitted former membership in the communist farty of Brazil, upon

interview at his request, stated that he had attempted to discuss his

Communist farty activities with Brazilian officials but they indicated

indifference to such information in 1951.

Velloso supposed the reason for the indifference was that Kis

information was common knowledge; however, another explanation would be

sanction of the Communist Party on the part of Brazilian officials, even

though the communist Party has been outlawed there. Velloso stated he

Knew of no communist influence at the Brazilian Embassy but stated that

it was the tendency of Latin American countries at this time to play

communist countries against noncommunist countries in an effort to

obtain all they could in the nature of aid and assistance, inferring

that the Brazilian Embassy would also attempt this practice.

Velloso

Latin American countries necessarily indicated that theylere

In view of the above information, it would appear that Brazil

could easily align itself with the soviet-bloc countries and thereby

create an international situation affecting the U.s.

While there is

no apparent indication at this time of a political upheaval in Brazil,

Brazil's President's recent opposition to the nationalist and leftist

groups in Brazil might tend to develop internal strife in Brazil,

leading to such an upheaval.

Rejerence is made

to information rècently furnished to

Gandy

the bureau by a highly sensitive source being handled by the

Washington Field Office (WFO) indicating that soviet and satellite

intelligence representatives have a keen. interest in assistance being

rendered by our "jriends." They were referring to attaches from

India, Indonesia, and United Arab

Republic who apparently have been

collecting certain types of information for the soviet and satellite

representatives.

The foregoing again confirms that the soviets and the

satellites realize that representatives of noncommunist diplomatic

establishments can be of tremendous value to them.

Naturally, a

representative of the Indian Embassy hos access to U.S. institutions

and areas not usually accessiblé to the soviets and satellites.

Furthermore, a representative of such an embassy can mix in circles

and have access to Americons and others without being placed under

any particular suspicions.

I such an individual is recruited by

the soviets, he can operate with an excellent couer...

He previously

haue seen instances where the soviets have taken an interest in

representatives of Latin American countries apparently for the purpose

of recruiting them as agents.

The Bureau feels the above program is essenticl

in vies of the strategic location of Thailand and its

proximity to cormunist Chine and Laos, the current area

of political unrest. It is felt sources developed within

diplonatic establishments of thailand could furnisn pertinent

information regarding political conditions and political

trends in southeust asia which uould be of considerable

interest to other U.S. Gouernment agencies.

In regard to nuth Muomi Burney, iro should open

a separate 134 investigation on her to develop additional

background information as required in section 107 of the

Hanual of instructions to make certain she is tupe of person

we want to contact as a sourse. If the investigation is

juvorüble, summit your request to the Bureau for state

Depariment clearance to intervier her. Bear in mind that

when Burney is of no further interest to us, the Burecu

should so advise CIA.

Bufiles fail to disclose ony pertinent derogatory

information identifiable with Ruth Naond Burney.

NOTE:

Since State Department clearance has been received

for the Bureau to institute a program in developing live

sources within Thailand diplomatic establishments in the U.S.,

WRO and New York being so advised.

State Department also

furnished clearance for very discreet investigations of

potential sources which we will select. In view of the

information received from CIA via liaison regarding Burney,

felt she is in a very good position for possible development as

a source of pertinent information regarding Thailand

octivities in the U.s. and in general.

In view of recent information received indicating Morocco

has accepted soviet military aid and will soon request the United

States. and France to remove its military bases from Morocco, the

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

Recent newspaper publicity has indicated a definite interest

by the soviets and communist China in infiltrating various countries!

of Africa, which at the present time are in the throes of various

nationalist moves.

on I1-16-60 an article appeared in the Madrid

daily newspaper "A.B.C. ". which stated the Moroccan Government had

announced the acceptance of soviet military aid.

On 11-22-60 the

same newspaper reported a Moroccan military mission was departing

Morocco for Moscow on that date to discuss soviet military aid.

The

same newspaper reported on the same date that a good-will mission

from Morocco had been received by Khrushcheu in Moscow.

A United

Press International release dated 12-5-60 stated that Morocco may

soon demand removal of all United States and French military bases

on her territory.

Madrid papers in October, 1960, related that Moroccan

labor unions, which are communist infiltrated, planned to send

representatives to Cuba and the same unions are urging the Moroccan

" Government to disband the Royal Moroccan Army and set up Castro-type

militias.

The Republic of Mali was admitted to the United Nations

as a new republic in Africa on 9-28-60. The Office of Special

Investigations (OSI), Department of the Air Force, has advised the

"leftist-oriented, government" of lali apparently intends to establish

• ties with a number of Sino-soviet-bloc countries. On 10-13-60 Mali

recognized Communist China and OSI indicated that the Nationalist

Chinese representatives in Mali would be asked to leave that country.

In October, 1960, Soviet Russia recognized the new Republic of ali

and a soviet delegation was due to arrive in Mali in late 1960.

Osf

has advised that lali has consistently voted

at the United Nations

with the communist bloc on East-iest issues.

The Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) advised on 1-27-61..:

that soviet-bloc activities in Mali were expected to increase.

Government of lali has retained "radical, leftist and pro-marxist"E

ministers in key posts including: interior, planning, informations

transportation, communications,

public laws and "leftist" prime

Minister lodibo Keita had retained portfolio of defense and securicy.

ONI advised on 3-21-61 that lali signed on economic and trade agreement

with the USSh for a 44 million ruble loan. Mali is presently

purchasing soviet planes; has concluded an economic agreement with

Communist China and is

the communist bloc in 1961.

We are requesting state to grant clearance for us to conduct

in the United States of the Government of the Republic of the congo

in view of political crisis existing in that country and in view of

soviet support and support of other African and pro-soviet countries

of procommunist political group in the Republic of the Congo.

The Republic of the Congo obtained its freedom from Belgium

in 1960 and since that time has been involved in a political turmoil

• between opposing factions.

The procommunist - pro-soviet faction was

represented by Patrice Lumumba who was killed in the Republic of the

Congo during February, 1961.

As a result of his death, procommunist

and anti-western demonstrations were held in the United States ana

many countries of the world.

Lumumba's Lieutenant Antoine Gizenga,

who is pro-soviet, has assumed lumunba's position with the dissident

group. In view of critical political situation existing in the Republic

of the congo and the fact that soviet Russia and other pro-soviet -

African countries (Ghana, Mali and Guinea) are supporting the

pro-Gizenga faction in the Republic of the Condo, it was believed

There is an additional factor here which warrants

chis matter at State

He was particularly helpful in connection

with the opening of the office of the Legal Attache in Manila.

fact,

on our behalf, he exerted pressure on the U.s. Ambassador

there in order to secure his approval of the establishing or the

office. He undoubtedly can be helpful in the future on such matters.

For the above reasons it is believed highly desirable to

send a letter to Johnson directly rather than to Rusk.

Johnson is

a top-level official and we will have served our purpose by putting

him on notice and outlining our views.

ADDENDUM BY MR. TOLSON 10/13/61

I am inclined to the view that we should not send the attached

communications to the Attorney General and Deputy Under Secretary

of State Johnson concerning our proposal |

JFK Act 5 (9) (2)(D)

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

with respect to countries in Central and

South America. After all, we presented the matter to Mr. Johnson,

indicated what we could do and he, in turn, advised that the requested

clearances would not be granted. It is not the Bureau's basic

responsibility to develop information concerning these foreign countries.

It is obvious that someone in the State Department to whom Johnson has

talked is opposed to our doing this. We have been told that if there is

a specific country or individual involved and a request was made by the

Bureau, consideration would be given to such a request. I think that we

should let the matter stand on that basis.

Mr. Belmont does not agree. This matter presently rests on

an oral basis only and he feels that we should be on record.

State Department "Secret" Research Memorandum RFE-36, dated

6-17-64 on "Communist China's

POlICy IOr EStablishing Diplomatic Relations,"

reports that Peiping's interest in expanding its network of diplomatic

ties has significantly increased in past three years.

Communist China now

has diplomatic relations with 48 countries and, because of its recent

successes and continued intensive efforts, it may soon overtake

Nationalist China which has recognized 60 countries. According to the

memorandum, this is liable to have

immense effect on Chinese representation

in international

organizations, particularly the United Nations (UN).

According to state Department, Japan is the number one target on'

Communist China's diplomatic horizon and an intensive step-by-stép

cultivation of

Japan is under way.

CIA's "Secret" Special Report,

China Problem in Japanese Politics," dated 5-1-64, reportg, that in Japan

supporters of the Japanese Government feel that developmentrof Japan's

informal relations will ripen into full-fledged diplomatic relations with

Communist China.

The fact that trade between Japan and Communist China is on the

increase certainly can be expected to encourage establishment of

diplomatic relations between these countries in the not too far distant

future.

In 1963, this trade increased 60 per cent over 1962 and it is

expected to take

another big jump in 1964.

Further, the Communist Party

of Japan (CPJ) is urging close ties with China. This organization of

approxinately 105,000 members has taken the side of Communist China in its

Ideological war with the USSR.

Memorandum Wannall to Sullivan

JFK Act 5 (g) (2) (D)

According to articles in the 7/9 and 19/64 issues of "The

New York Tines," the

Japanese Government is not as strong now as in

preceding years.

Prestige of its Premier, Hayato Ikeda, re-elected

to a third term 7-10-64,

has been damaged by inflationary trends that

have sent consumer prices up 20 per cent in past three years.

His new

cabinet has been called "weak" and "lightweight" due to his attempts to

achieve balance among feuding elements in his own Liberal Democratic

Party.

Japan is also buffeted by pressures from the USSR with which

lit has rather extensive trade relations.

On 5-14-64, the USSR's First

Deputy Premier, Anastas Mikoyan, made a

surprise "good will" visit to

Japan. He and

members of his group met with Premier Ikeda and other

„highly placed Japanese officials.

Real purpose behind his visit is

unknown.

Some claim his aim was merely an expansion of trade.

Others

•belleve USSR felt the trip was necessary so as to reinforce Russia's

position with Japan because of increased relations between Japan and China.

OBSERVATIONS:

Industrially, Japan is the leading power in Asia and it wields

considerable influence on lesser Asiatic countries. Capitulation by

Japan to pressures of Communist China could have significant effect on

such countries, possibly hastening their own recognition of Communist China

and also the ultimate admission of Communist China to UN. We should do

we can to make available to State Department and other interested

agencies, any information which would enable them to take appropriate

steps.

It is, therefore, recommended

Japanese coverage should be extended.

In view of the above, it is requested that authority be granted

The Algerian Communist Party,

Algerian independence, is gaining in numbers and influence. It would •

appear that intelligence information relating to Algerian activities

both in the United States and
