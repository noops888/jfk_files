The Moviniento Insuzzecional de Recuperacion

Revolucionario (NIRR) is an anti-Castro action group headed

by Orlando Bosch Avila of Mlami, Floride, which claimed

credit for severel bombing raids over Cuba in August and

September, 1963.

On December 11, 1963, a source who has furnished

reliable information in the past advised that Bosch is making

plans for a bombing raid of an oil refinety at Nuevitas,

Cameguey Province, Cuba. A twin-engine Beechcraft reportedly

will be used and the raid is tentatively scheduled for the

night of December 14 or 15, 1963, from Bimini in the

Bahama Islands.

Bosch reportedly has made arrangements through an

American businessnan, who was a prisoner of the Castro regine

in 1959, to buy or rent a Beecheraft twin-engine plane which

is located at Orlando, Florida,

Bosch stated he is paying

an American pilot to transport the plane fron Orlando to

Bimini on an ostensible pleasure flight. The American pilot

will be accompanied by his wife or girl friend. After landing

at the airfield, which is located on an island adjacent to

Bimini, the pilot and his wife will register et a hotel in

Dimini. The time of the departure of these individuals from

Orlando is unknown to the source but he presumes it will be

the seme day on which the bombing raid is scheduled or

possibly a day or two earlier.

that seven or eight fifty-pound demolition bombs will be carried

on the raid. The source in this matter presumes that the bombs

will be carrted in the boat together with the participants.

Infornation previously received has indicated that

the airport near Bimini is usually not manned by airport officials

atter sundown and it is possible for planes to take off and land

there under cover of darkness without

being cleared or observed.

The source further advised that Bosch has issued

Instructions for the plane to depart Bimini at 1 a.m.; bomb the

target at about 3:30 a.m. i and return to Bimini at 6 a.m.

British authorities have been advised of this

information.
