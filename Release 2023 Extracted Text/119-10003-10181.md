SUBJECI: Rima ZMITROOK -- Lee Harvey OSWALD's

Intourist Guide in Moscow.

1. An official British source has advised us that they now

have additional information on Rima ZMITROOK nee SHIRAKOVA,

who was assigned as OSWALD's Intourist guide in Moscow in

October 1959.

2. SHIRAKOVA came to the attention of the British authorities

when she befriended two British brothers who first visited the Soviet

Union in 1960. She and a male guide joined the party with which the

brothers were travelling at the Russian border. One of the brothers

has pursued the friendship more than the other and claims that his

relations with her have become affectionate, but platonic. In fact,

since he first met her, she has married and has had a child. They

have maintained a steady correspondence and he visits their home

when he goes to the Soviet Union,

3. After the birth of her daughter in October 1963, SHIRAKOVA

wrote and said that she had left Intourist and was employed as a

teacher of English in a Moscow teacher's training college.

4. The two brothers last visited the ZMITROOKs at their home

in a new housing estate in Moscow in 1965. One of the things Rima

DECRET

ZMITROOK showed them was an album of colored postcards of

places in the United States which she claimed had been sent to her

by an American in return for money she had lent him when he was

visiting the Soviet Union and ran short of funds.

5. Rima ZMITROOK nee SHIRAKOVA was born on 18 January

1939 in Moscow. Her husband, Valeriy ZMITROOK, was born on

29 October 1937. They were married in 1963 and their daughter

Aleksandra (Sasha) was born on 29 October 1963. At the time that

the British brothers knew the ZMITROOKs, he (Valeriy) was an

engineering student. At that time the ZMITROOKs resided at

8 Vladimirskaya, Apartment 31, House 23, Moscow E - 123.

6. The name ZMITROOK is reported above as transmitted to

us by the British. We believe, however, that the ending" syllable does

not represent a correct transliteration and may be an attempt to

record the name as given to the British phonetically. We believe the

proper transliteration would be ZMITRUK. Please note that the

British have also spelled the name as SMITROOK.

7. Going on the assumption that a destitute American would

turn to the Embassy for assistance, we would appreciate your checking

with the Embassy in Moscow, whether they could possibly identify

the American who ran short of funds and borrowed money from Rima

ZMITROOK. Based on the information supplied by the British, we

would presume that the American borrowed the money from her some-

time before she left Intourist in 1963. We would also appreciate your

asking the Embassy if they have any other information on the ZMITROOKs.
