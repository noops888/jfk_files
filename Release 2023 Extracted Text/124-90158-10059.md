• A review of the Miami file regarding

ORLANDO GARCIA VAZQUEZ reveäls he was born in Cuba

in 1927 and served in the U.S. Army from 1945 to

1947, during which time he obtained U.s. citizenship.

He thereafter returned to Cuba and attended the

University of Havana under the G.I. Bill and

during this period was reportedly active in an

anti-Communist group. He was a member of the Cuban

Secret Police under former President CARLOS PRIO

(1948-52) and later opposed the BATISTA regime in

Cuba and the TRUJILLO in the Dominican Republic.

He served with FIDEL CASTRO as civil attache at

the Cuban Embassy in Costa Rica until March, 1960

when he was discharged for his admitted "reactionary

attitude" and friendship with former Costa Rican

President JOSE FIGURES. He subsequently moved

to Venezuela obtaining Venezuelan citizensh foreign

1962 and has since served in the Venezuelan

Ministry and worked with the Venezuelan National

Police (DIGEPOL). He reportedly served as body

guard for former Presidents BETANCOURT and LEONI Of

Venezuela as

well as JOSE FIGUERES of Costa Rica.

A 1960 allegation that GARCIA was a

CASTRO agent in Miami was resolved to the

of ClA who recruited him during that year ens faction

(U)

1965 CIA advised GARCIA was still of operational

interest to this agency and there is no indication

at this time of a change of this status.(m)

￾ (U)

It is apparent from above that GARCIA is

highly placed

in the Venezuelan Government and is

anti-Communist in ideology. *He has long been

of operational interest to ClA and presumably

is still in contact with this agency Miami feels Elu

no additional investigation is necessary and is closing

its case on GARCIA.

It is noted the Miami Office is in contact

with LESLIE LLOYD ANDREWS, GARCIA's stepson who is

is under development as a PSt in Venezuelan matters

and may obtain information regarding GARCIAsi future

trips to Miami.
