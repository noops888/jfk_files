1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-R

52-0-1, section V, paragraph 2 (d) (1).

A. EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

FI-

(1) LIFEAT/Soviet During the reporting perlod, LIFEAT coverage

of Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV provided an important and valuable check con-

firming the reporting of a number of KUBARK controlled double agents targeted

ag inst this Soviet officer. Also, coverage of the Soviet Buller in Office, al-

though nor considered vital, dees complete Station coverage of the Soviet

target and does provide daily inforniation on the activities and contacts of the

Bulletin Office personnel.

(2) LIFEAT/ Polish

LIFEAT continued to provide vital Information

concerning the BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation with coverage of both Individuals

and their daily activities.

(3) LIFEAT/Yugoslav Besides the usual coverage uf day-to-day

activities of the official installation, LIFEAT leads have Indicated the possi-

bility of a suecessful recruitment of a Mexican employee of that installation.

LIFEAT information will become even more valuable for continuing assess-

ment of the potential agent and forming of a plan for approach to the Mexican

In question.

(*) LIFEAT/Communis: Party Coverage In this area gave Statlon

its first informatton concerning the secund arrest of LINLUCK, as well as

providing sonie information on important persons in the Mexican Communist

movement.

: (5) LIFEAT/Exile

LIFEAT provides.continuing coverage of the

dally activities and contaers of juan Jose AREVALO Bermejo. Although most

of the leads gathered will depend on. future exploitation, one contact with an

ODYOKE official was noted by LIPEAT (see reference b).

(6). LIFENT/Cuban :

•Of late, much of the cmplials of the LIFEAT

operation has been directed toward support of Station operations in this arca.

COME ONE AN ASTE OLDE

Coverage included monitoring of the activities of AMSTET-l for the Interested

Case Officer. Tlit information provided daily leads for the Case Ufticer in

his contacts with AMSTET-I. LIFEAT also covered three lines in support

of the AMSTRUT operation.

Of this support the interested Case Officer has

nored LIFEAT provided very valuable coverage of the important AMSTRUT

opcration during October.

The coverage gave valuable operational leads

and resolved wat would otherwise have been arcas of uncertainty or

groundleas suspicion.. This allowed the case officers to move with müre

certainty in developing the opcration than would otherwise have been prudently

possibic. It la noted that LIFEAT's continuing coverage is proving to be most

helpful.

(7) LIFEAT/American Communists LIFEAT cominued to provlde

information of interest to ODENVY. Travel and contacts of the ACGM arc

particularly worthwhile.

(8) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous

LIFEAT continucd it coverage of

former Station asset LIVESTOCK-2. This was in keeping with Station's

policy of making perlodic checks of the activitles of former, potentially

dangerous agents.

It should he nored that It Is the Station's opinion that LIFEAT'S

excellent ovcrall service, plus its ability to provide unilateral coverage of

targets of opportunity on short notice (sometimes on as little as two hours

Statio) make On EAT a dependable dally contributor to the fulfilling of the

B.

PROCESSING OF TAKE

No change from previous report.

C. LIAISON

During the month of October the two playback recorders used by

the ODENVY processor broke down.

These were repaired by the LIFEAT

technician, David M. WILSTED. ODENVY continued to process take from

the LIFEAT/AmerIcan Communists in Mexico lines.

D. SECURITY

There have been no known adverse securiry incidents effecting the

LIFEAT operation during the reporting period. LIFENT meeting sites con-

tinue to be changed periodically. The fourteen regular and six alternate

sites used for daily contact between the Station Case Officer and WILSTED

and Wayne C. DRABAND are considered adequate. Numerous meeting sites

are used for contacts between WILSTED/DRABAND and the basehouse keepers.

E. TECHNICAL.

Audio and dial tape recorders ordered by the Station in support of the

LIFEAT operation began te arrive at the end of October.

These were placed

in immediate service. It is noted that the automatic tape stop on the new

model Revere audio recorder has thus far proven to be of no use to the operation

This coverage providad valuable coerational

support during the period leading up to the recruitment of AMSTRUT-2 giving

¿imely advance information of AMSTRUT-2's arrival in Mexico, as well as

his day to day activities and contacts. Following AMSTRUT-2's recruitment,

LIFEAT gave an excellent account uf AMSTRUT-2's activities for those periods

he was not under the control of his case ufficers. This was invaluable proof

of his full cooperation with KUBARK and added a safety factor for the case

officers making the recruitment and initial handling which would not have been

otherwise available.

(3) LIFEAT/Polish and LIFEAT Yugoslav

These coverages con-

tinue to provide excellent information of the daily activities of the Satellite

officials assigned to Mexico. The LIFEAT support of the BEKNAVE/BECHICK

operation continues as noted in reference.

(4) LIFEAT/Exile

LIFEAT coverage of Juan Jose

AREVALO Ber-

mejo provides information and operational leads which, though valuable now,

would be invaluable if ODYOKE's policy toward AREVALO becomes sufficientl

1. The following report is submitted in accordance with CSHB-F 52-6-1;

Section V, paragraph 2 (a) (1).

A. Exploitation of Leads

(1) LIFEAT/SOVIET

With the departure of Vladimir G.

NOVIKOV during the month of August 1962, it was decided that LIFEAT should

pick up coverage of his replacement Svyatoslav F. KUZNETSOV. The contin-

ued coverage of leksandr G, SIDOROV, which includes extensive periods of

live-monitoring and special processing of the take, is considered essential to

those Station assets involved in the attempt to place the technical surveillanca

noted in last month's report (see reference A). Coverage of the Soviet Bullet in

Office continues to provide interesting personality data on Soviet officials

assigned to Mexico.

(2) LIFEAT/POLISH

LIFEAT coverage in support of the

BEKNAVE/BECHICK operation continues to be vital to that operation. Addi-

tional coverage for this operation has becn undertaken, leads from which will

probably determine future direction of the operation as well as aid KUBARK in

cont rolling the operation.

(;) LIFENT/EXILE

LIFEAT coverage in this area has been

midsi rewarüing in providing leads i tire conoels of Juat jose Arovalo Bermejo,

former Guaidmalan President. Spanish Ropublican Exiles were covered for

approviniately one-nald month in August, at which tinie it was decided that the

coverage no longer provided jufficient leads and information in justify con-

tinued LIFEAT effort.

19) LIFEAT/Aneric: Communis: Group in Mexico (ACCia)

This coverage is at the request of the local office of ODENVY and the processing

of take in this arca is done by that office.

One of the most interesting items

provide from this coverage was the fact that the American Communists Albert

MALTZ and Margaret Latin MALTZ had separaied and that Albert MALTZ

would probably reside in the U.S. with Margaret renining in Mexico. Con-

cemüg the LIFEAT coverage of the ACGM, ihe local office of ODENVY wrote

on 23 August 1962: "This office feels thai the coverage mentioned is quite

valuable and many useful leads are brained from this coverage, particularly

with regard to travel in and out

uf Mexico of American Conimunists who are

in contaer with individuals on whom coverage is maintained".

B. Processing uf Take

On 1 June 1960 4r. John J. Heyn ard Mr. Jolin Kennedy of WiD,

Mr. Robert, Brown of CI/OPS,

'4r. Robert Bryant of PI/OPS and Mr. Charles

Bray of FI/D not with lard M. WILSTED (Es).

WILSTSD ampharizes that the whole telephone system in Mexdco

City is undergoing a reforzation.

The company Telofonos da Meráco, S.A.,

has sub-contractod this work of cleaning up and reorganizing the phone

system to the independent fira, Intel.

They are cleaning up unused and

old Ilnes, putting in ney a spare lines, redefining exchange areas,

laying underground cables, etc.

Eventially we should be batter off ba-

cause there should be, more surplus lines.

The renovation work has

hampered much of the LIzaT work, principally because many of the lines

now. are underground and ve camot get access to them beforo they enter

tho central.

This is particularly trus with respect to the Crech En-

bassy, to whose telephone lies we cannot obtain access from the vantage

point we now occupy.

WILSTED sald that so try to keep track of the activitios of

"Intel" but since they see= to attack "Colonias" at random, we have no

prior waming of their presence in a cortain area.

In the recent far, "axico hes been using houses for listing

for security reasons. de have more control over the access of

phone company inspectors nir repairman to houses. However, under new

regulations, all neu aparteer: buildings must have telephono lines 1r-

stalled in the building by ise phone comoany during the construction

This means that the lines and their destination are concealed.

phasteD proposed that this vill man we can again uso apartmenta since

we can siphon off a line lastined for use by another tenant in such a

way that the phone company careot trace its destination without tearing

the building apart and me can then fistall a soparate line to the build-

ing and hook up the subscriber to this line which, if chocked, will

belong to a legitimato subscriber.:

•One system which has been used effectively is to take 0n9-balf

of tho separate pairs which hars one faulty line each. These two half

pairs then form one good pair shich wa

WILSTED explained that it cost about 3000 pesos to get &

regular talaphone.

This antilla the purchase of a telephone company

bond, which later can be sold.
