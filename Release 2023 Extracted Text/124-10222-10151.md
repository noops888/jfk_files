On 15 June 1964 a member of the Venezuelan Branch of the Movi

miento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR, Movement for Revo-

lutionary Recovery) claimed that the MRR has

no operational

base In Venezuela and does not intend to establish one.

MRR maintains an office in the Dominican Republic

believed to have facilities for using that territory

occasional staging point for attacks against. Cuba.

does not have a permanent base or training camp in

the Dominican Republic.

The Dominican Government has little

supporting Cuban exile activities at the present

2.

No large-scale exile operations against Cuba by the MR will

take place

until after the November

1964 elections in the

United States.

The MRR claims that this decision is based on

at least six months of preparation will be re- c

quired before internal conditions in Cuba will be favorable

that the decision does not imply close connivance between

the MRR and the United States Administration.
