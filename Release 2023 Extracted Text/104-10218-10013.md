Interview of Mr. Lus E, GUTIERREZ

RITICA REQUIRED. RIFERIILIS

Seo paragraph l belom.

B15019 60 BCTPSG

NO EATING NIELD

¡CAN DELTA STREE

1. Your assistance is requested in interviewing

Luis E. GUTIERREZ, for information which would be helpful to thie Goverament

in determining the accuracy of certain claims made confidentially by

Herbert I ITKIN. Mr. ITKIN is a prime mitress in legal proceedinga presently

underway in Now York Cil, involving the Mafia and related underworld organisa-

one. ITKIN lives under the protection of U.S. Federal Marshala.

2. The following data is for your information. It sbould not be used la

dealing with GUTIERREZ or ourside of this Organization. ITKIN has been an

FBI informant since March 1963.

Ho has now claimed to have worked for this

Organization daring the period 1954/55 to 1960. ITKIN &88erts that his contact

during these years was one Philip HARBIN. This inquiry is concerned solely

with ITKIN's claimed relationship with this Organisation frorn 1954/55 to 1960

when he alleges HARBIN was his contact. As will be seer, GUTIERREZ, ITKIN

alleges, also know HARBIN during that tine and that face, therefore, le

material to tho credibility a ITKIN's story.

ITKIN's frst contact with Philip HARBIN wae in 1955 when he claime to

have baen contacted purguant to a mecting be. ITKIN, had in Philadelphia with

a leading personality of this Organization and another high-goverument official

Late is 1954 or carly 1955. According to ITKIN, HARBIN sever made the

speclfc claim of being fsom this Organization but that was ITKIN's aseumption.

ITKIN describes HARBIN as about 42 or 43 (ia 1955), an American.

He had receding heit, combed back but parted. He was about 5'g" in height.

well-built with little evidence of fat. He always wore a vest. He spoke fluent

Spasish and could have been of Polish or Russiar family background. HARBIN

always drank tea, never collee, He appeared ailuent with a professorial air

about him.

Following an initial messiao. TVIN alleges tsui le as lifeti inci

periodically in New York City. ITKIN alleges that be passed to HARBIN copies

of the correspondence developed by his law firm, Delson, Levin and Gordon,

dealing with Indonesia, Burma, and India. ITKIN left that law firm in mid-1957,

presurably thereby losing total access. Among the materials ITKIN claims he

passed to HARBIN before he left the Delson, Levin and Gordon firm was informa-

tion he picked up from. = ian who worked at the United Nations for the

Government of El Salvador. This friend was Luis E. GUTIERREZ (see biographie

sketch, Attachment A). ITKIN claims that he became very friendly with

GUTIERREZ, who was studying either at New Yor'‹ University or Columbia

where he prepared a master's thesis on El Salvador's economic position.

HARBIN, he says, was interested in the topic and ITKIN alleges he furnished

HARBIN sotes of GUTIERREZ' monograph.

Sometime presumably after mid-year 1957, HARBIN asked ITKIN if he

knew anybody else who could do (intelligence) work, ITKIN recalled CUTIERREZ.

who meanwhile had moved to the position as Consul General of El Salvador in

New Orleans, Louisiana, HARBIN--ITKIN says--accepted the suggestion and

ITKIN provided an introduction for HARBIN by letter, which he sent to GUTIERREZ

in New Orleans. ITKIN asserts that HARBIN--according to his .own statement--

went to New Orleans and made the "new contact". ITKIN claims be last saw

HARBIN in 1960.

3. A comparison between the key points of ITKIN's account as surimarized

in the immediately preceding paragraph with the data set out in Attachment A and

E will show immediate contradictions that tend to destroy any credibility in

ITKIN's account, particularly with respect to his relationship to GUTIERREZ.

We also point out, solely for your information, that we have found no confirnia-::.

Hon in our records of any relationship between this Organization and ITKIN during:

the period 1954-1960, No traces have been found in our records or anywhere in

government thus far of a Philip HARBIN, and there is explicit denial thät there was

any meeting in Philadelphia in 1954 between ITKIN and the high officials he

nominates.

Finally, there is no substantiation in our files of any of the intelli-

gence product which ITKIN allegedly passed to HARBIN. This case, however, is

of such a nature that we must strive, if possible, to have GUTIERREZ' OWE

statement for the record.

*. We leave to the Station determination of the best manner to approach

GUTIERREZ. It is our preference that a Station officer, under suitable cover.

performa the interview, but it may well be that a consular of emubasay ufficer

might be the best person to do the job. H'e repeat that we are concerned in this

matter solely with the verification or denial of ITKIN's statements, specifically

the allegation that be introduced HARBIN to GUTIERREZ in New Orleans and

that as a consequence GUTIERREZ would be in a position to identify and describe

HARBIN in a way that would permit us to locate him if he exists.

The request

for GUTIERREZ' assistance in this matter is in no way predicated upon hostility

towards ITKIN nor is there any predisposition against his claims if indeed

evidence is found to back them up. If GUTIERREZ indicates that he is willing to

provide whatever information he can, you can assure him that his information is

solely for U.S. Government use and will not be made public by us at any time

witkout his expressed consent. Also, it is clear that we are prepared to accept

his decision to give no assistance in the matter.

5. We have compiled a shurt statement that might be used by the interviewer

to explain to GUTIERREZ, the purpose of the interview. (see Attachment B). A list

of questions, which sbould be given orally, in claborated in Attachment C. You

will note that these questione concern the larger as well as narrower clements

of GUTIERREZ' relations with ITKIN. We are willing in settlo for a specific

answer to the narrower question o1 thilip MANßlN in preference to generalizations

about the whole relationship. Il, as a consequence of your handling, GUTIERREL

is willing to talk in depth, we will be grateful.

6. Attachment Dia a copy of a New York Times article concerning ITKIN and

ose of the completed federal'

cases in New York: City. This item is attached for

your background reading. This may be shown lo GUTIERREZ., of course.

Attachment E is a copy of a letter dated 26 February 1965 from GUTIERREZ to

ITKIN. Again, the content of this letter tends to support the theory that iTKIN's

story, as elaborated in paragraph 2 above, is a fabrication. While possibly based

on a real relationship, it appears to be a fabrication with respect to chronology

and with respect to the exact mutual interests involved.. Also included in this

attachment is ITKIN's answer to the letter. We feel in retrospect that

GUTIERREZ might be unhappy to read his own letter in the course of a consular

interview. We, therefore, suggest that this not be shown to him. However,

there is no objection to an indication that the U.S. Government is aware that

GUTIERREZ was in perfectly correct correspondence with ITKIN during 1965 on

business mattors.

7.

We would appreciate compliance at your earliest convenience and a pre-

liminary indication by cable of GUTIERREZ' response, if one is forthcoming, on

the questions concerning GUTIERREZ' kaowledge of HARBIN. If there is anything

unclear la this dispatch, Headquarters would welcome any questions by cable.

All correspondence should be addressed Chief, WOMUSE, via Chief, WH.
