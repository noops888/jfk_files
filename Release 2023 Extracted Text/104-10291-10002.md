NEMORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Secretary;

CSCS Board

Recommendation for promotion -

Robert P. Wheelor

1.

As one of the final acts in my CIA career I want-

to bring to your attention and add my strong concurrenco

and rocommendation to

two (2) recorded rocommendatlong for

tho promotion of Robert P. Whecler to the grade GS-17.

I

tind it hard to imagine a more persuasive recommendation

for this action than that forwarded by my predecessor in

1969 (Attached).

I can imagino Mr..

Mitchell's Iccling

when

he prepared the second recommendation in February 1970

(Attnched)..

And yet, 1 find in February 1971 there has still

beon no action.

In the yoar that has passed this promotion

has becomo

even more deserved, for debnite tho natural dia-

appointmont accompanying such

2 continuine lack of recount-

tion,

there has been no diminution of entliuslasm, no lowering

of standards, and the CS is clearly better managed becauso

of his continuins efforts.

Here these two previous recommen-

dations not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude

that those in control simply do not know

what this officer

does and has done.

Knowing what he does and how he dogs

it

should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence, I add my

strongest recommendation for carly and favorable action.

This olficer has performed in a most outstanding

as testified in his fitness reports by my prede-

and certatnly during my tenure as Chiel, ips for

the past 12 months.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Secretary, CS Career Service Board

SUBJECT:

Recommendation for Promotion to GS-18;

Mr. Robert P. Wheeler

It is recommended that Mr. Robert P. Wheeler be promoted

to GS-16. He has been in grade since December 1957.

3. • Mr.

Wheeler is serving as Deputy Chief of Station, Tokyo..

To this post he has brought his depth of knowledge of things Jupanese,

gained over many years of concentration on this subject. He has

also brought his operational ability and his personal capability of

opernting among significant Japanese leaders.

He has been of major

value through a most difficult period of very substantial reduction

of the station's staff and the termination of many of its functiong.

While Mr. Wheeler may have spent much of his time on things

•Japaneso, he hay also served as Chici, Fl, for FE Division In which

post he demonstrated his ability to operato on non-Japanese innitera

with force, intelligence and dispatch.

3.

For these reasons it 19 recommended that Mr. Wheeler be

promoted to Gs-16.

share of the adminietrative burden of a big station, Mr. Wheeler has :

acquired a collection of Japandue friends and contacts in Important

governmental asid business circles miequaled, I belleve, by any other

nember of the officlal American community In Tokyo. Although he

has explolted theac contacts most effectlvely for Agency and U.S;

Governmental purposcu, it le the plan of the FE Division to glve freer

rein to Mr. Wheeler's operationg In this fleld by arranging, carefully

and delikerary,

for Mr. Whecler which will permit

him to devote a greater shore of his tire to the exploitation of this most

important secrion of Japoiese soclety. He belteve that his very con-

siderable talent as on administrator can be adequately replaced but

nails granding among the Japanese and hia capabuiry for operational

exploitatton of his advantages ore unique. I belleve that Mr. Wheeler

I thought that from a broad, general standpoint the orientation was worthwhile

but that far more BOB participation would have enhanced the programn greatly.

There was too much of "we think thie la what BOB meang" and too litile of

BOB saying "thia is what we mean". I found the movle presentation of Dr. E.

S: Quade's speech terrible because of inept projection, faulty audio enuipment,

and out-of-place music. Di. Suade had & messave and fortunatel. the CSO

plannere must have known thoir film was inadequate, for we were provided

with the written text.. Outstanding possibly because he stood out so far in

comparison to the othere was Mr. Peter Szatton from BOB. Dr. Adams from

tho University of Maryland was quite good and Mr. Greenhouse of VA mas one

of the fow others who really deemed to koow what he was talking about beyond

It is against this perspectivo that Subjoet's performance

durtag. the past year should be

evaluated.

He approached his job

with

enthusiasm

and vigor but soon

found that there were no

tangible operational activities he could

devote himself or his

supporting agents to.

He has been frank' to

state officially and

inofficially

the absence of any targets to which an operational

base could direct itself and has therefore been relatively

unoccupied during this perlod except for an occasional item of

local

coordination or follow-up on a headquarters task. Subject

has had under his direct supervision

He has

best to maintain their morale

spite of the fact that there were only a few specific targets

on whom they could systematleally work.

Subject is a mature;

experienced and energetic officer

with both operntional and scholarly Interests in Far Eastern,

especially Japanese,

affairs.

His talents are obviously being

wasted in Honolulu

and arrangements have already been made to

have him reassigned.

The base itself will be phased down in

the summer of 1966

Subjoct has displayed an economical approach to the use

both of funds and personnel.

of the limitations,

outside his control,

operational activities in Honolulu,

Subject's performance has

more than satisfactory and is

rated as proficient.

Ho is especially useful in Japan, bocause of his great knowledge of and

returning to current assignment for at least an additional tro
