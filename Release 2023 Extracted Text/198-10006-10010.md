FIRST WORKING DRAFT FOR REVIEW AND COMMENT

CUBA

EXCHANGE OF INTELLIGENCE AMONG OAS COUNTRIES

Nature and Scope

General:

Exchange of intelligence among OAS countries on

Communist subversive activities.

As has been repeatedly demonstrated throughout the

contents of the related reports a most basic and fundamental

requirement is that for relevant and high quality

• intelli

gence. This requirement is as

true for the Us itself as 1t

1s for each of the other American countries, and the problem

becomes increasingly complex as the requirement for

cooperation and coordination among two or more states arises.

Few

things in political and diplomatic life are more difficult

than the problem of combining the assets of all

participating

nations in a unified effective pattern.

The very title of this section demonstrates the

anomalous nature of the problem by suggesting that the oAS

countries should exchange secrets. From a strict view of

this

it could follow that exchanged secrets are no longer

secrets; and that since national secrets in most cases must

remain secret the best thing to do with this proposal is to

avoid or blunt it. This would be an extremely dangerous and

regressive course.

The fact is that the great portion of gross intelligence

is simply information of one kind or another which has been

collected, collated, verified, analyzed, etc. Only a small

portion is secret intelligence which has been acquired

through clandestine means. All would agree that secret

intelligence may be impossible to share, and similarly

all would agree that the sharing of useful and organized

information' is highly desirable -- especially when the

subject can be refined as it is here to cover

communist

subversive activities in the hemisphere.

Although the culture and political identity of most

of the countries of the Americas is built upon centuries

of national existence the Western Hemisphere is only a

geographical unity. As a political fact it is made up of

many completely separate and parochial states. Therefore,

as a first step much can be done to publish, transmit,

communicate, and circulate information of value on a

common basis. Initially by means of bilateral activities

between the US and other states; and wherever possible in a

similar direct manner between other pairs of states. Then

as progress is made this process will be enlarged on a

regional basis, on an OAS basis, and hopefully on an

hemispheric basis. The intial success of the SCCS

serves as an example of the projects which lie before

US.

II. The Current Situation:

At the present time, there are a number of resources

available to the US in furthering this effort.

a. Diplomatic channels are available to and within

each of the American nations. These provide a number

of information channels on their own merit.

b. USIA exists to further this endeavor.

c. Military attaches, missions, and assistance

programs of long standing provide abundant means to

increase the scope and volume of information and

intelligence exchange.

d. CIA has working liaison arrangements in every

country in Latin America where it has been found

fruitful to establish and maintain such arrangements.

This channel is available to transmit and protect

intelligence information of a more secretive nature,

and provides a mechanism to reach

any depth desired

and authorized.

e. Numerous other US government agencies such as

Agriculture,

Treasury, FAA, etc. have valuable contacts

for information exchange throughout the hemisphere.

f. Any such compilation would suffer from the

omission of the contribution which can be made by

business, educational institutions, religious groups,

news media, and other non-governmental agencies which

have a close association with our Latin American

neighbors.

The important point here is to note that any

positive and constructive steps taken to further the

exchange of information/ intelligence by all means

will, even in its least regimented form provide some

means of assistance in counteracting the flow of

subversive agents and their supporting assets

from

Cuba to Latin America.

Vital Considerations:

The path to success in the pursuit of this goal lies

in an area of cooperation, understanding, and mutual

trust. The beginnings of a truly cooperative effort

are evidenced already. Hopefully this trend will

continue and its pace increase. An increase in under-

standing of the problem may prove to require much more

effort. Nations, like individuals, are prone to respond

most to basic emotions.

Communist inspired subversion

will strike home as a threat when it becomes directly

related to fear in these nations and in their people.

And as long as it remains unnoticed and misunderstood

it will not strike fear at least to the proper: degree

in these countries. Here we must turn to education.

must provide information and we must track our fellow

Americans to know the beginning of subversion when

We

it is there.

The first basic step in this area will be to initiate

a vast program of education on an hemispheric scale.

News media -- the press,

radios, magazines, TV -- all

must be exploited not only for basic propaganda purposes;

but as a means of exchanging as much intelligence as can

be released to

such means. Beyond this, more selective

training programs must be established some of these to

reach Into the depths of professional intelligence

collection

and dissemination.

The

third and perhaps most vital of these requirements

involves that delicate fabric of mutual trust

among

nations which only comes from true cooperation and

understanding. This too is based upon the fact that

moral influence creates harmony among nations, their

leaders, and their people. Fortunately, the growth

and cohesion of such moral influence is nurtured by

a common cause such as that threatening these nations

from Havana.

Proposed Program:

Since the ability to exchange intelligence among OAS

countries on communist subversive activities is predicted

upon the interaction of two intangible ana rather delicate

factors -- the degree or depth of the intelligence, and

the existence of and quality of mutual trust between the

countries involved -- none of the proposals below can be

considered as building blocks or as chronological steps

independent of

each other or in

a pre-determined series.

Rather they are to be considered as piano keys to be

used

to sound the desired melody.

a. Broadcast information, especially that pertaining

to communist subversion (always making clear the

distinction between true Castro-communist inspiration --

and the label of subversion which is not too infrequently

used by those in power to smear their political rivals),

on a common basis throughout the hemisphere via all

available news

media. This will be enhanced through

the use of local columnists or other trusted voices

as the means when available. The development of a

wholly American viewpoint with respect to the

Communist menace,

as aistinct from the present local

and parochial view, is the goal of this mass

educational process which is intended to encompass

all media, especially the newspapers which can be

read, passed on to others, and re-read.

b. Increase the scope and nature of all means of

bilateral exchange between all paired gioupings of

countries especially to those which feel an immediate

need for securing intelligence on specific problems

affecting their immediate security and interests.

c. Through the SCCS and other controlled means

broaden and deepen intelligence exchange.

d. Develop a communications net, available to all

participants, which will be capable of accommodating

requirements which are impossible on an area-wide

basis today. Open feeder lines to areas which are

presently overlooked. Such a development should not

overlook the broadest facility of communications to

include the establishment and maintenance

of a

national, even international, presence in areas

which

are remote and under-developed today. This

concept envisages transportation means as well as

wires, radio, etc.

e. On a broad basis train Latin American nationals

to be aware of subversion, to detect subversion, to

understand subversion, and to eliminate it with the

aid of the exchange of information and intelligence.

1. Train the intelligence community of Latin America

in hard core established intelligence techniques.

Standardize these techniques wherever possible.
