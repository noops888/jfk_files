MEMBERS WHO DID NOT SPEAK ENGLISH AND HOPED PROVISIONS WOULD BE

IN PLACE TO ENABLE THEM TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THE SCHEDULED

MULTILATERAL MEETINGS.

ARRIVAL FOLLOWING A LONG FLIGHT, HE DID NOT WISH TO BE LATE BUT

NETTYER DID HE WANT TO LEAVE OTHER DELEGATES FAR BEHIND.

IT WAS MENTIONED THAT THEY WOULD HURRY ONCE THEY SAW HE WAS

READY, HE COMMENTED - WITHOUT ANY HINT OF REGRET

EVERYONE WAS DEMOCRATIC NOW AND IT NO LONGER WORKED THAT WAY.

HE EVIDENTLY HAS A GREAT INTEREST IN, AND RESPECT

FOR, THE JAPANESE, REFERRING TO THEM AS A SPECIAL CIVILIZATION.

HE AND JAPANESE DELEGATES AGREED TO MEET LATER

THAT NIGHT FOR FURTHER DISCUSSIONS IN SPITE OF SOME BADLY NEEDED

PAGE :

A PERSON WHO LIKES TO ESTABLISH A ONE-ON-ONE

RAPPORI, HE EXPRESSED A REGRET AT NOT SPEAKING SPANISH SINCE

LATIN AMERICA IS ONE OF HIS MAIN AREAS OF RESPONSIBILITY.

NOTED THAT LATIN AMERICANS DO NOT REALLY OPEN UP WHEN SPEAKING

THROUGH INTERPRETERS.

TIME CONSTRAINTS PREVENT HIM FROM

LEARNING SPANISH AT PRESENT.

ECOLOGY - A SPECIAL CONCERN:

MAMEDOV SHOWED A

PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR ECOLOGY AND NOTED THAT RUSSIA WOULD NEED

HELP IN DEALING WITH ITS PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA.

HE RUEFULLY

COMMENTED THAT MAN WAS THE ONLY CREATURE THAT WOULD DESPOIL HIS

ENVIRONMENT.

THE PROBLEM WAS A GLOBAL ONE AND REQUIRED

CONCERTED COOPERATION ON AN INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

PROBLEM AREAS FOR RUSSIA:

ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV,

RUSSIA'S CURRENT OPEN BORDERS MAKE THE COUNTRY VULNERABLE TO

TERRORIST INCURSIONS (IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN WERE MENTIONED) AND

TO THE OVERFLOW ONTO RUSSIAN TERRITORY OF BORDER CONFLICTS.

WHEN PROBLEMS BEGAN IN AZERBAIJAN,

IRAN SENT FIGHTING UNITS

ACROSS THE BORDER TO ASSIST AZERIS; RUSSIA WAS NOT NOTIFIED.

THE PROXIMITY OF THE CONFLICT IN FORMER YUGOSLAVIA AND ITS

POSSIBLE ESCALATION IS VERY WORRISOME.

CHECHNYA HAS THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING MORE SERIOUS AND IS A

VERY TROUBLESOME ISSUE.

THE ECONOMIC TRANSITION:

MAMEDOV ASSESSES THAT

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY WITH CANADA AND THE UNITED

STATES, WILL BE STRENGTHENED THROUGH COMMERCIAL TIES.

DEVELOPMENTS IN RUSSIA STILL HAVE 50% GOVERNMENT INVOLVEMENT.

THE BANKING SECTOR IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS

INTERNATIONAL-STYLE BANKING. YOUNG MANAGERS (MID 30'S) ARE

INTRODUCING NEW IDEAS, WHILE OLDER EXPERIENCED STAFE PROVIDE THE

NECESSARY ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.

THE CURRENT PERIOD IN WHICH

RUSSIA IS BEING ROBBED BY SOME, IS SYMPTOMATIC OF TRANSIIIONAL

UPHEAVAL AND IS COMPARABLE TO THE POST CIVIL WAR ERA IN THE

UNITED STATES WHEN A NUMBER OF ITS CITIZENS ACQUIRED-WEALTH IN-

THE 19607S, THE U.S: WENT THROUGH A STAGE-OE MILITANT LABOR

UNIONISM ASSOCIATED-WITH MOB ACTIVITIRS. A CASE IN POINT, THE

ACTIVITIES OF HOFFA AND HIS ALLEGED ORDERING OF THE

* <ASSASSINATION>OF<PRESIDENT KENNEDY>OFFERS AN ILLUSTRATIVE

EXAMPLE.

(FIELD COMMENT:

THE SOURCE PROVIDED THE QUALIFIER ON

*THE "ALLEDGED" NATURE OF MOB INVOLVEMENT IN THE<KENNEDY>

*ASSASSINATION, â€ºWHICH MAMEDOV APPARENTLY REPEATED AS IF IT WERE

ESTABLISHED FACT.)

2-COMMENTS ON TERRORISTS:

- TERRORISTS, EVEN -PHOSE-WHO

OPERATE UNDER THE GUISE OF RELIGIOUS FERVOR, NORMALLY HAVE AN

UNDERLYING FINANCIAL MOTIVE ACCORDING TO MAMEDOV.

AS

IS ESPECIALLY CONCERNED THAT ADEQUATE

SAFEGUARDS BE IN PLACE TO PREVENT TERRORISTS FROM ACQUIRING

NUCLEAR MATERIALS.

RUSSIA ALSO WANTS TO SEE AN IMPROVED

INTERNATIONAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK TO DEAL MORE EFFECTIVELY WITH

TERRORISTS AND PREVENT THEM FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF LEGAL

LOOPHOLES.

8.

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES

MAMEDOV ALSO MADE THE FOLLOWING COMMENTS ON SEVERAL

( (ZYUGANOV)) - ECONOMIC HARDSHIPS AND THE RESULTING

IDISCONTENT HAVE ENHANCED HIS CHANCES AT THE PRESIDENCY.

WOULD NOT BE OF CRITICAL CONCERN SHOULD HE WIN THE COMING

PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS SINCE THE COMMUNISTS HAVE UNDERGONE A

TRANSFORMATION AND WOULD NEITHER BE ABLE NOR WILLING TO TURN THE

CLOCK BACK.

THE NEW RUSSIAN COMMUNISTS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO

ITALIAN COMMUNISTS BUT MAMEDOV WOULD DREAD TO SEE AN

ITALIAN-TYPE POLITICAL SCENARIO IN RUSSIA.

THE RETURN OF

COMMUNIST PRESIDENTS IN POLAND, HUNGARY AND ROMANIA HAS NOT

CAUSED DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR RELATIONS WITH WESTERN NATIONS, NOR

SHOULD THIS HAPPEN WITH RUSSIA.

((ZHIRINOVSKY)) - A POLITICAL HOOLIGAN, ZHIRINOVSKY HAS

LOTS OF FINANCIAL BACKING.

WITH HIS ATTENTION-GRABBING ANTICS,

HE PROVIDES A DIVERSION WHILE OTHER ELEMENTS CARRY ON THEIR

UNSAVORY (I.E. CRIMINAL) ACTIVITIES.

IT REMINDS ONE OF THE

RUSSIAN TALE WHERE TWO CHARACTERS DISTRACT A CROWD WHILE THE

THIRD IS BUSY RIFLING THEIR POCKETS. ZHIRINOVSKY HAS PRESENTED

NO SERIOUS PROGRAM TO PERMIT HIM TO ATTRACT SUFFICIENT VOTES.

( (LEBED)) - WITH HIS BASS VOICE AND PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT

APPEAL TO THE DISCONTENTED, HE HAS EARNED SOME POPULARITY, BUT

HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH SOLID PROPOSALS FOR CHANGE

AND WILL NOT BE A SERIOUS CONTENDER FOR THE PRESIDENCY.

RELATIONS WITH CANADA: MAMEDOV FAVORS CLOSER TIES

WITH CANADA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE.

HALIFAX SUMMIT AND ( (YELTSIN'S)) BACKING FOR STRONGER ECONOMIC

COOPERATION WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD (I.E. THE CENTRAL

GOVERNMENT'S BLESSING IS ESSENTIAL TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN) .

NORTH IS AN IMPORTANT COMMON FACTOR.

FOR RUSSIA, DEVELOPMENT OF

THEIR NORTHERN SEA ROUTE WILL BE A HIGH PRIORITY AS IT WILI

PROVIDE A SHORTER LINK TO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING ROUTES.

LEGOLOGICAL CLEAN-UP-WAS ALSO-MENTIONED-IN_THE_CANADA/ RUSSIA

CONTEXT BECAUSE OF ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY.
