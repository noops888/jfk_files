Re: FRANK ANGELO FIORINI

XiEL

circumstances prevented execution

this sabotage and he

described the location on the highway between Ciudad

Mante and Ciudad Victoria where the explosives and

the magnets to be used for attaching the explosives

to

the hull of a ship were buried.

He also advised

that FIORINI had received a $200 money order from

ORLANDO BOSCH,

sent by BOSCH from Miami to

Cudad Mante.

As of July 5, 1967, a confidential source

abroad

advised that Mexican authorities had

located the cache of explosives, detonators,

and

magnets

on the highway between Mante and Victoria as had

previously been described by RONALD EDWARD THOMPSON. This

source advised that a money order for $200 had been

received by FRANK FOURGIS, Hotel Mante, Cludad Mante,

on April 13, 1967, sent by One ALDO FERNANDEZ ALC

When interviewed on May. 1, 1967, FRANK

claimed his trip to Mexico in April, 196%, together

-with DONALD ROCHE and his step-son RONNIE THOMPSON, was

in the nature of a vacation trip. He stated he is

acquainted with Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH of the MIRR but denied

he had seen BOSCH in several months. He denied

that

he carried any explosives to Mexico in his 1958

Cadillac, which he used on the trip. He denied that

ORLANDO BOSCH had sent him money to Mexico but said a

Cuban friend had sent him $100,00 from Miami.

On July 24, 1967, ALDO FERNANDEZ, 2000

Northwest 35th Street, Miami, Florida, advised that he is

married to the sister of Dr.

ORLANDO BOSCH.

He denied

acquaintance with FRANK FIORINI, also known as

FRANK STURGIS.

He claimed he did not

send $200.00 to FIORINI in Mexico.
