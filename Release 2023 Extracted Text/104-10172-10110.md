As for getting out on the diat or 22nd- u

make it until Set., but the prof 1e undecided as to changingthe exam

to 9.A,ll. or giving two, one in the morning and one in the aftemoon, since

there are many students who are anxious to get away that day. On the other

hand there are students who are concerned about thos last three hours

of study- so what can you do. If I don't mow fer sure by sonday I'll

meke reservations on both CHA and AA, round trip. I want to leaverexico

Sunday afternoon, March 30th I think
