MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Benefits and Service Division
Chief, Contract Personnel Division
SUBJECT : Creditability of Service - Ross L. Crosier
1. Subject, a Career Agent currently assigned to Special
Affairs Staff, will tender his resignation from the Agency on or
about 18 August 1963. In the final review of his records, it
was noted that Crosier had apparently been incorrectly categor-
ized as a contract "agent" during a period of service extending
from 1 June 1949 through 31 May 1957. To confirm the evidence
found in the files, we have attempted to obtain the testimony of
subject's former supervisors but, unfortunately, a number of these
could not be identified and others are not available at Headquarters.
2. As an alternative, we have extracted copies of correspondence
contained in Crosier's file which we believe provide
sufficient evidence that subject was, in fact, an employee of the
Agency during the period in question. Since Crosier was under
official cover during the entire period (in major portion as a
single), we found little evidence of regular office hours or day-
by-day supervision. Irregularity of hours and a limited amount of
supervision, however, are not unusual even for regular staff em-
ployees working under the same type of cover. We have, on the
other hand, found correspondence which reveal a degree of direction and
control-including proposals for training, reassignment, and grade
promotions which are incompatible with his (contractual) status
of independent contractor.
3. We are attaching a resume of statements made in the
correspondence referred to, with copies of the correspondence it-
self, to substantiate the above. On the basis of these statements,
it is requested that Crosier's service from 1 June 1949 through
31 May 1957 be deemed to have been in an employee status and hence
creditable for annual leave purposes. Creditability for Civil
Service Retirement, we understand, would be limited to the period
1 June 1949 through 31 December 1954 since amendments to the Social
Security Act preclude extending such creditability to contract
employees beyond the year 1954.
4. Also attached is a completed Form 144, establishing
the adjusted service computation rate for leave purposes, should
this request be approved.

SUBJECT : Contract Amendment, Arthur G. VAIVADA
1. It is requested that the contract of Arthur G. VAIVADA be
amended to provide for an increase in salary from $5060.00 to $5915.00,
effective 1 April 1956.
2. VAIVADA entered on duty with this organization on 1 June 1949
as a contract agent. From June 1949 through August 1953 he was
stationed in Costa Rica, where his record was outstanding and included
the successful handling of a high level Communist Party penetration.
He was subsequently given headquarters training for several months
and participated in PBSUCCESS.
3. VAIVADA has been in Cuba in his present capacity (P/A,
AMPHODARCH Project) since July 1954. His performance there has con-
tinued to be outstanding. He has proved to be particularly adept at
spotting and recruiting of agents and his work has been highly praised
by the Chief of Station, Habana. In recommending renewal of the
AMPHODARCH project recently, FI/Plans/Projects stated, with reference
to VAIVADA, that he "has obviously been a valuable, deep cover agent
handler during six years of service for WH." He had been qualified
previously as the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.
4. There are sufficient funds in the AMPRODARCH project (approved
13 December 1955 for the period 1 August 1955 through 31 July 1956) to
provide for the above-requested increase in salary. Such an increase
will be specifically provided for in the next project renewal request.
VAIVADA has been at his present salary level since July 1954.

SUBJECT : Contract Amendment, Arthur G. VAIVADA
1. It is requested that the contract of Arthur G. VAIVADA be
amended to provide for an increase in salary from $5060.00 to $5915.00,
effective 1 April 1956.
2. VAIVADA entered on duty with this organization on 1 June 1949
as a contract agent. From June 1949 through August 1953 he was
stationed in Costa Rica, where his record was outstanding and included
the successful handling of a high level Communist Party penetration.
He was subsequently given headquarters training for several months
and participated in PBSUCCESS.
3. VAIVADA has been in Cuba in his present capacity (P/A,
AMPHODARCH Project) since July 1954. His performance there has con-
tinued to be outstanding. He has proved to be particularly adept at
spotting and recruiting of agents and his work has been highly praised
by the Chief of Station, Habana. In recommending renewal of the
AMPHODARCH project recently, FI/Plans/Projects stated, with reference
to VAIVADA, that he "has obviously been a valuable, deep cover agent
handler during six years of service for WH." He had been qualified
previously as the most valuable agent of the San Jose Station.
4. There are sufficient funds in the AMPRODARCH project (approved
13 December 1955 for the period 1 August 1955 through 31 July 1956) to
provide for the above-requested increase in salary. Such an increase
will be specifically provided for in the next project renewal request.
VAIVADA has been at his present salary level since July 1954.
