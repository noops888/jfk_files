been received

at the Seat of Government reflecting thatsuch a CIA liaison repre-

have confidentially advised the Bureau's liaison section that they readily

recognize that it will take years to build upfa close liaison with the Royal

Canadian Mounted Police and related organizations They state, however,

they fee

such action must be taken in view of CIA's jurisdiction in foreign

circles

§r. lenn H. Bethel

This is boing brought to you for your attention so that you may be

completely aware of the situation.

You should be particularly alert to prevent

being used as a

"stepping stone" for CIR or(Hortong&CIA should develop its

own contacts without depending on the excellent relationships already

established between the FBI and Canadian Aficial channels.

Conly that

liaison necessary for the coordination o

domestic and foreign matters is

necessary & it should be most circumspect
