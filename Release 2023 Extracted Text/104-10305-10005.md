Ms. Penelope Grenoble, Editor

Los Angeles Free Press

5850 Hollywood Boulevard

Los Angeles, California 90028

Dear MS. Grenoble:

This letter is in response to the distortions and outright falsities

printed about me in the article written by William i: Turner, titled

BANK ROBBER, 'MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE' LINKED TO JEK ASSASSINATION PROBE,

which appeared in the July 25-31 edition of the Los Angeles Free Press

I request that the Free Press either print a retraction of such lies

and distortions or publish this letter.

Mr. mumar to me.

who spent ten years as a Special Agent of the FBI, is not

unfamiliar

He has authored similar articles, both during my

imprisonment in the United States and while I was detained in the

German Democratic Republic, in which he knowingly and purposefully

cited numerous lies about me.

words in my mouth and misquoting his sources of information to lend

credence to his major untruths, a skill he probably developed while

serving with the Bureau's intelligence-security division. His recent

claims cause me to wonder whether

or not he ever left the FBI..

Professor Richard H. Popkin, from whom Mr. Turner obviously collected

much of his latest baloney, is a character that I feel should either

purchase a hearing aid or

consult a psychiatrist. Each of my so-

called discussions with him (all but one occurred over the telephone)

were duly tape-recorded by me, and if he did in facy assert what Mr.

Turner has attributed to him about me, then he too is a liar.

Tablelisting the following facts in rebuttal to the Turner-popkin

The "papers" that I "carried" when arrested did not show me to be a

"decorated hero of the Korean War," nor did they reyeal anything

about "a career in Army intelligence.".. More to the point, the doçu-

ments found in my possession and under my control (some of which were

returned to me only last year by the FBI) ensured my incarceration

for a longer period than I had anticipated. They also guaranteed my

being held practically incommunicado for many months (for eleven

months I was not even permitted to read a newspaper), not to mention

the curtailment of my most basic constitutional safeguards.

My contacts with Lee Harvey Oswald did not entail any "friendship,"

nor were they effected for the purpose of establishing rapport.

After my acquittal (in 1968, not in 1967) I did not "drop from sight,"

as Mr. Turner, the FBI and the CIA damn well, know.

I have never stated to anybody, either verbally or in writing, that

in 1963 I was an agent for the CIA, although in 1974 I did state,

under oath,

that I thought I had been functioning for the CIA during

Mr. Turner is also aware that less than two months

after President Kennedy's death FBI agents confronted me with their

suspicion that I had "acted as an unregistered agent for a foreign

power," inferring that I was a spy for one of the Cuban intelligence

services (several years later the CIA, through one of its "former"

case officers, accused me of having been a Soviet spy, still later,

one FBI agent suggested that I had worked for the Chinese).

The registered letter that was dispatched at my instance to FBI

Director J. Edgar Hoover in September 1963 (not necessarily on the

13th) revealed sufficient details to warrant an immediate investiga-

tion (if not the arrest) of Lee Harvey Oswald and two Cuban refugees.

I certainly "assumed" that some "action" would be taken by the FBI.

I was not the least bit "frantic" about anything in September 1963.

I did not set foot inside the Republic of Cuba during that month.

To my knowledge I have never talked to any "Castro aides.":

The main

distinction between some American intelligence officers that I knew

and hired killers were the procedures utilized in murdering their

victims and/or the methods used to disassociate themselves and the

U.S. government from their crimes.

I had no fear of being implicated "in the planned assassination" at

the time of my arrest or prior thereto.

The two letters that I mailed to James L. Rankin, General Counsel to

the Warren Commission, were not sent through "private channels." They

were sent through proper jail authority.

I have never claimed that I "squirreled away a snapshot of (myself)

with Lee Harvey Oswald taken in Jackson Square in New Orleans in 1963.

I have never stated that I am "willing to surface and tell (any) story

to Congress" or to anybody: And I did not reveal any details about

Mr. Oswald to Professor Popkin that are "new" or unknown to the FBI.

OS INDICES RESULTS:

1963 the name of Richard FECTEAU (an individual by this name was captured.

by the Chinese Communists and is now in prison in China) and of six Agency

employees Research failed to reveal any reason why NAGul had these

names in his possession.

It was concluded that while NAGElL is unquestionably

unbalanced, his story of being involved in espionage is not fully contradicted

by evidence. He could have been contacted by a Soviet agent while in Washington,

D. C. in December 1962 or while he was in Mexico City in September and October

1962. His file contains mostly FBI reports dated 1962 and 1964 and in these

are documented his history of mental instability and physical complaints

stemming foom the plare crash. Attached is a chronology dated 3 March 1965

made from the information contained in the FBI reports. At the time this

security research was conducted, it was recommended that NAGELI, be personally

interviewed by a representative

now be eme tito the possession tee canes but to farther action is indicatea

in his file and this interview was not undertaken:

DETAITS:

Subject's file reflects no Agency interest in him prior to March 1964

when the names of CIA employees were found in his possession when arrested

for bank robbery.

The RAMPARIS claim that he received intelligence training after the plane....

crash is true. The crash occurred 28 November 1954 and he graduated from

Army Intelligence School, Ft. Holabird, Maryland on 15 August 1955. He

served in Korea aná Japan as a member of the U. S. Army Counterintelligence

Corps, terminating about 1958. A It. Col. Ned W. GLENN who served with

NAGELI personally in Korea advised that NAGELL was not stable mentally and

that this instability was probably due to brain damage suffered in the airplane

crash.

The RAMPARIS article's claim that NAGElL said he fired the gun in the

bank at El Paso, Texas because he wanted to be in custody when the assassination

took place is not completely in conflict with a statement NAGELL made on

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources

gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he

would be permitted to return same to his contact so

he could be of further use to U.S. Government. He

stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man

from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to

individuals whom heibelieved may have been Soviet Agent.

Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had

taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with

court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.

NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-

ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His

condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,

rigid". Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-

tempting to rob State National Bank.

Slashed

wrist night

of 9/20/63. NAGELI consistently denied he had tried

to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots

in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.

He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have

been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to

Cuba!'.

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-

rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,

the names of purported CIA agents and other information.

Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him

that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,

decided everything against him in Lös Angeles and made

arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to

pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and

eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly

attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but

lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance

of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,

California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-

davit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was

issued a new passport on 6 August 1963. )

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told

U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up

the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL

told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.

I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time. ".

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed

acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD

on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledge of NAGELL.

NAGELL furnished a signed statement:

"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a

representative of a foreign government preposed to me

that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal

offense and inimical to the best interest of the United

States.

At that time, I refused such proposal. In May

1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-

ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I

agreed to such a proposal. "

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,

known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government;

that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned

act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid

proposal.

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this

same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be

disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-

upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person,

although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation

actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which!

was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I thought that

my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,

solution to the problem with which I was confronted.

I am not guilty as charged. "

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for

bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination.

Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to

serve 10 years.

NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged

at the El Paso County Jail.

Given a lie detector test by the FBl,

Bogurd's responses were those "normally

expected of a person telling the truth.".

Nevertheless, the Warren Commission

dismissed the incident by noting that

Oswald supposedly could not operate an

automobile and that on November 9 he

nllegedly spent the day drafting a

lengthy lotter to the Soviet Embassy. It

evidently never considered the possibility

someone might be impersonating Os-

wald. But Bogard will never identify the

impersonator. He stuck to his story in

news interviews, and subsequently was

beaten to within an inch of his life by an

unknown assailant and arrested by the

Dallas police on seemingly trumped-up

bad check charges. He retreated to his

native Louisiana, where on St. Valen-

tine's Day 1966, he was found dead of

exhuust fumes in his automobile.

The main ingredients of the patsy

theory are wrapped up in a story that has

gradually filtered out of Leavenworth

Penitentiary. The story is that of inmate

Richard Case Nagell, and paradoxically,

the most cogent confirmation for it is the

manner in which he wound up sentenced

to ten years in federal custody.

Nagell was a highly decorated infantry

captain in the Korean War who, he

claims, subsequently became a CIA

ngent. It is a matter of record thit in

1957 he was seriously injured in a plunc

crash in Cambodin, which tends to sup-

port his contention, since Cumbodia wns

not exactly a tourist playground. On

September 20, 1963, Nagell wulked into

the ceiling, and then sat outside waiting

to be arrested. He says he staged the

affair because he wanted to be in custody

as an alibi when the assassination took

place. It was a desperate measure, he ad-

mits. But he had sent a registered letter.

to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the

impending assassination, which he says

was then scheduled for the latter part of

September (probably the 26th in Wash-

ington, D.C.), and the letter had gong

unanswered,

There is an incredibly brief FBI inter-

view report stating, in part, that on De-

cember 19, 1963, Nagell advised, "For

the record he would like to say that his

association with OSWALD (meaning

LEE HARVEY OSWALD) Was purely

social and that he had met him in Mexico

City and in Texas" (CD 197). Another

repore states that when the prisoner was

being led from court on January 24,

1964, he "made wild accusations to news-

paper reporters, accusing the FBI of not.

attempting to prevent the assassination

of President Kennedy. '" (CD 404).

That the charges may not be so wild is

indicated by the fact that the government

threw the book nt Nagell, a first offender

who says he expected to bé charged only

with discharging a firearm on govern-

ment-protected property. Since his sen-

tencing, he has been shuttled betwen

Leavenworth and the federal medical

center (a euphemism for mental institu

tion) at Springfield, Missouri. While the

government has suggested in court that

his airplane crash mentally affected

Nagell, the fast remains that he was

given intelligence training after the crash.

What Nagell alleges is damning not only

to the FBI, but to the CIA. In brief,

he says that the motive for the assassina-

tion was Kennedy's move in the direction

of a rapprochement with Castro, which

was ranks, betrayal. in the eyes of

anti-Castro elements. As he puts it, an

anti-Castro group in New Orlans ind

Mexico City, code name Bravo Club,

decided to give Kennedy a "Christmas

present" to be delivered September 26, a

date that was postponed. A party was

required. Two members of Bravo Club

approached Oswald while he was work-

ing at the Reily colfee firm in New Or-

leans in the summer of 1963, and ap-

pealed to his ego in setting him up as the

patsy. When the "delivery" site was

shifted to Dallas, Bravo Club enlisted

the aid of a Dallas "subsidiary," Deltu

Club.

Meanwhile the CIA got wind of the

plans and sent several agents into the

field to ascertain whether they were "for

real." Nagell says he was one of the

agents dispatched. Within a short time,

he claims, he was pulled in. It had been

verified that the plans were authentic,

that "gusanos (anti-Castroites) were

making the watch tick," and that the

sum of the plot was right-wing in nature.

Nagell says that he was instructed to

"arrow" the patsy, that is kill him, after

the assassination. At this point, he con-

tends, he got cold feet and bailed out. "I

would rather be arrested than commit

murder and treaso:," he declared in a

self-prepared petition for habeas corpus.

In the petition, Magell asserts that he

used the pseudonyms Robert Nolan and

Joseph Kramer in the U.S. and three

foreign countries under the authorization

of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He

states that the files of the FBI and the

CIA contain information that Oswald

was using the aliases Albert Hidel and

Aleksei Hidel. He charges that the FBI

illegally seized from him evidence crucial

to his defense, such as notebooks con-

trining the names of certain CIA ema

ployces, photographs, two Mexican

tourist cards (one in the name Joseph

Kramer, the other in the name Albert

Hidel), and receipts for registered mail,

including the one for the letter sent

Hoover warning of the assnssination.

When Nagell complains he has been

"salted away" because of what he

knows, he just might be making the un-

derstatement of the year.

[THE ELIMINATION OF A PATSY)

"IT DIDN'T KILL ANYHODY... I'm just

& patsy," Oswald shouted to news-

men while in police custody. A

marked patsy, contends Garrison-one

who was not supposed to have lived long

chough to utter his cry of innocence. But

somcthing had misfired, and Oswald fell

not into the hands of his would-be exe-

cutioners, but into the comparative

safety of the Dallas jail. The denouement

presented a crisis that the conspirators

could solve only by pressing police buff

Jack Ruby into service.

Although the Warren Commission

concluded that Oswald ducked into his

Oak Cliff rooming house to pick up the

.38 revolver, later confiscated from him

in the Texas Theater, it did not explain

why, if he had gone to work at the School

Book Depository that morning intend-

ing to kill the President and

escape,

he did not take the revolver with him.

That he made a beeline to his rooming

house for the sole purpose of getting the

* revolver spenks of a man who desper-

ately wanted to protect himself from

treacherous comrades rather than from

the police. Notwithstanding the mild re-

sistance he put up in his refuge in the

Texas Theater, Oswald's demeanor in

custody gave every indication that he

would resolve the great riddle-given

the time.

Oswald does not appear to be the only

double-cross victim of that bloody after-

noon: the evidence is persuasive that

someone other than the accused assassin

killed Officer J. D. Tippit, a friend of

Jack Ruby, whose patrol area included

the Harlandale Street section headquar

28 January 1970

Washington, D.C.

An editor of a trade journal, whom I first net while on

an intelligenco assignment in Latin America,

has urged me

for some time to make public the facts dealing with my.

involvement in

conspiracy. to

murder

the late Chief

Executive, John F. Kennedy, in 1963 and the circumstances

surrounding. my arrest and imprisonment in the. United States

and East. Cermany•

For reasons that, are more personal

than

advisable I can think of little else that I would like to do

better. Eit with the copious amount of documentation and

background meterial on hand, that I feel should be adduced

to in any valid troatise of. the subject, it rould require

writing no less than a tome, an undertaking for which I am

hardly qualified.

Then, too, there is a growing. skepticism

on my part concerning the kind of reception that a topic of

this sort would elicit from a socioty long since inured to

violence, corruption and injustice.

Still, after ovor six

yoars of rolativo silence, I'vo decided that I must say

something about all this, if only to answer the lies and

distortions concocted about me in the press. Thus,

I have

compiled this

small

booklet, a throwaway,: which

may be

easily: discarded at the whim of the reader. In it I've

taken the liberty to set forth a reproduction of one of the

least sanitized references to my cese that has appeared in

the

news media,

an article printed last summer in the

OVERSEAS FAMILY; a weekly tabloid catering to U.S. service-

non in Europe. I have utilized this particular article as a

vohicle to toll a bit of my side of the story by writing an

addendum to it.

confirn each and every

assertion made by its author, Thomas C. Lucey.

Ar. Lucey, despite

his citing a substantial number of inaccuracies,

has nonetheless depicted a vast area of

what may be termed, the fundamental truth.

With this in mind, I have tried

to set the

record straight only insofar as it pertains

to those inaccuracies - and omissions

- which in my opinion reflect adversely on the whole.

In order

to view Hr. Lucey's account in a sonewhat different perspective, I shall

begin by

advising

that I first went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency much

earlier than Aupust 1962.

It was during the winter of 1955-56, while assigned

aB & Case

Revion Officer with the Counter Intelligence Corps at Los Angeles,

that I was initially

rocruited into the CIA's farflung network of informants and agents, one of a number, I

suppose, within the Defense

Department's, intelligence

community who helped the Agency

koop an eye on its not always tame competitor.

My recruitment

was. handled by a Herbert

Leibacher, an agent of the CIA's Los Angeles office, and a Joe DaVanon, later identified

to me through photographs. as an

official from CIA headquerters,

then located

on

street in Washington, D.C.:

Motiveted by a degree of naivete and the Agency's subtle

reminders that loved a greater duty. to my country than to the military establishment,

served ab

a: non-paid,

confidential informant off and on until my resignation from

Army in October 1959.

A complete description of the information I supplied to the Agency

during my military career would only add to what must perforce become a lengthy addendum;

it suffice to say that it did not always seem gerrane to intelligence affairs,

when it did it consisted mainly of an assortment of data that for so-called discretionary

rossons was seldon passed on to the Agency. for for that matter, to our own higher

morriago to a foreign national. I was not barred from assignment to other, even more

sensitive,

organizations such as field Operations Intelligence, then the clandestine

espionage deportment of military intelligence.. As for the reasons I left the Army, they

voro clearly if euphemistically explained

in my second letter of resignation,

dated

31 August 1959, namely:

"I desire to tender my resignation because I wish to further my

civilian education:

It is not possible for ne to pursue the curriculum of which I am

desirous while

active duty.

Also, compassionate reasons of a personal nature exist

for desiring to tender my resignation at this time."

My patronege under the CIA did not end with my discharge from the Army and ensuing

employment

in.

December 1959

as an investigator for the State of California;

in fact,

henceforth I was offered remuneration for my services, however nominal it sometimes was.

what

my

real pertinence to this addendum or to later

developments,

except

perhaps

to mention that one of my contacts said he worked out of

Division,

which

and activities.

should also point out that I did not quit my position with the State

of California

"to work for

the CIA;"

as implied by Hr. Lucey. I was dismissed, in June

1962, at my own option and in my opinion for doing my job.

But I shall opine that if President Kennedy had not met his demise when and where he did,

I would not have been brought to trial

on charges of commiting a felony.

Whilo my return to the fold of the CIA in May 1968 may have been the only "practical

thing" for no to do, it definitely was not predicated on my financial situation, as a few

old bank account passbooks will substantiate (I am not quite the mercenary that bir. Lucey

has portrayed). Nor was it because of any peculiar allegiance to those who had tossed me

on the scrap heap for the sake of expediency 4t years earlier, love of country, masochis-

tic tendencies or wont of further intrigue.. And while

it remains axiomatic in my mind

the sole requisite

this did not apply in my

circumstanco, not really.

I agreed to go back out into the cold, so to speak, strictly

for personal reasons and I think

the explanation is wisely left at that for now.

My mission inside East. Germany - if indeed it was a mission - was neither as well-

defined nor as elementary as Mr. Lucey has perceived.

the mission was not directed against Fast Germany, per se.

Preparations bore the

trademarke of an authentic, even typical, Agency project targeted in the main to another

nation.

That I was unable to comprehend

the German language,

that I had been a recent,

unwilling guest of the U.S. Attorney Ceneral, brandod a Comnunist in the public records,

merely

served

to strengthen an already plausible cover built up by chance rather

than by design.

Paradoxically,

past. I had engaged in certain covert intelligence

actiritios hositle to

to which - as an integral part of my

cover - I frealy confessed.

Oddly enough, however, my mentors from Langely had neglected

to tell me during the briefings that these previous activities constituted a violation of

the criminal statutes of the GDR,

warranting &

maximum penalty of death upon conviction.

By inadvortence or by plan I found myself in a not altogether unfamiliar predicament.

I had confessed to my real mission, assuming that it was genuine, without doubt I would

have boon spared exocution,

probably even escaped long-term imprisonment.

Instead, I

for my treatment by the ufS, from

begining

it

was far more gentle than that

Nith regard to my marital status and my children, the

forenost area that ur. Lucey

appears to have exploited,

I have

never claimed

that

"Uncle. San hides my family"

stated that FBI and CIA gents deliberately isolated me from my wife and children; nor

havo I claimed that

the Agency used the promise of reuniting ne with my family as part of

tho incentive for accepting the assignment in the GDR.

My accusationg in this respect

contored around my children and they were leveled at the State Department as the result

promiso made to no shortly after.my release from the GDR.

Since returning to the

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: NAGIL, Richard Case - #264170

REF:

State Dept. Airgram No. A-903 from Berlin - Subject: Psychiatrist's

Report on Richard Case NAGHI, U. S. Citizen Released by GDR

Reference airgram furnishes background information on Subject and

on 29 April 1968 after his claim of temporary insanity at the time of

the crime found support in the expert testimony of a noted American

neurologist, Dr. Edwin WEINSTEIN. An article in the January 1968 issue

Of RAMPARTS by William W. TURNER implied that NAGELL had been involved

In the assassination plot against President KENNEDY and that he had been

"salted away". Subject denied any Involvement in any conspiracy and denied

that he had any information of use to GARRISON. Subject alleged that his

fear that the CIA might try to "eliminate" him was planted in his mind by

Mr. GARRISON. (See page 2 of interview report). On page 3 of the interview

report Subject states he no longer believes that it 1s realistic to think that the

CiA was trying to kill him.

George R. BABINGAU, Cpt., MC, the psychiatrist at the U. S. Army Hospital,

Berlin who interviewed Subject, was granted a continuing liaison clearance

on 17 October 1968 at the request of DDP/E/G/ IS.

Dr • Fawin Ae

WINSIEIN was security approved as a continuing contact

through SECRET for the Medical Staff on 13 July 1965. WEINSTEIN 1s with the

Walter Reed Army-Medical Center, Washington, D. C.

Ricey S. NW, Jrd, NACHI's attorney who was present during the

interview,

1s with the Washington, D. C. law firm of NEW, MACKEY ano

GEORGE. Newspaper clippings from the WASHINGION STAR for 17 March 1966

and the NEW YORK TIMES for 29 August 1965 reflect that NICEY has been

associated with East Berlin attorney, Wolfgang VOGEL, and West Berlin

attorney, Juergen STANGE, In a number of cases involving the release

of Americans from East Germany. According to an FBI report dated 3

February 1967 these releases usually involved the payment of specified

sums of money and VOGEL and STANCE were allegedly reaping large monetary

benefits for their

services.

In December 1962 and January 1963 Nagell wan examined

at the VA hospital at Bay Pines, Florida. The diagnosis was

"chronic brain syndrome associated with brain trauma with behavioral

reaction characterised by passive aggressive and paranold featurea."

(An FBI memorandam of 12 June 1964 noted that Nagell wan considered

mentally disturbed by his mother, hia brother, an ax-wife, and a

frierd. The mothet, who satd that she had been under paychiatric care

for several yeara, described Subject's brother, Louls, an an aimost

hopelens alcoholtc. )

6. On 20 September 1963 Subject was arrested la El Paso,

Texas, on the charge of baving tried to rob the State National Bank.

A cell rate concluded from Subject's remarka that he had become a

Communist Party member aftex hid discharge from the army, that he

had attempted suicide three times after his arrest, and that he had made

arrangements with the CP in Los Angeles to piek up bis paseport la

El Paso so that he could go to Crechoslovalda.

7. 2a a letter of 6 January 1964 Nagell advised the FBI in

El Paso that in September of 1963 he had been instructed by an agent

of a foretys government to comply with an agreement made in May 1963

to participate in a criminal offende againat the U.S. or be exposed to

the FBl. it was this threat, sald Nagell, that led bim to try to hold up the

bank.: The reference appeare to be to the assassination of President

Kennedy, At any xate, sometione alter the sasnasinatios Nagell claimed

that he had known both Oswald and hle wife.

Pietares of Nagell were

shown to Martas Dewald an 18 January 1964. She said that she did not

know biza,

Security on 12 March 1964 that at the time of arrest Nagell also had a

Hat of at names, marked CIA. The names were F, Parker, Mrs..

Guthries, C. Churchill, J. Sloss, E. Lelbacher, and J. Davazos,

was later determined that Richard Fecteau aldo appeared on this list,

where he was marked as "Lyon, Mass.", and "DAE (CLA)".

8. Out records show that Richard G. Fecteau was

aboard an American plane shot down over Manchuria in

November 1952 and that he to serving in Pelping a treaty

year sentence on spy charges. Fecteau, an OPG employee,

was quoted in the press as saying that he worked fox ClA.

b. F. Parker was not identified.. He may possibly be

Joba Floyd Parker, an Agency employee in 1961 who was in

Japan in 1952.

c. There la no pertinent identifiable laformation about

Mia. Inu Guthries.

She may be F'rances Agoes Guthrte, an

Agency employee la 1964.

d. C. Churchill was notidentilled. He may be Greighton

Churchill, who was in Japan in 195z.

e. I. Sloso may be Joba Richard Slost, an Agency

employee is 196€.

f. E. Lelbacher could be identical with Ernat Lelbacker

who in 1964 was in the Los Angeles fleid office of the DCS.

J. Davanon many refer to Joseph Frances Davanos,

also ta the Inos Angeles feld office at the time.

9. John Floyd Parker, frances Guthrie, Ernst Ledbacker.

Joseph Frances Davanon, and John Richard Sloss all stated to the best

of their knowledge they had never met Nagell. It lo possible, however,

that Nagell knew of knew of Parker, Churchill, and Guthrie through

their work in the fax Fast. An for Lelbacker and Davanos, Nagell

lIved in Lon Angeles in 1962.

10. On 16 April 1964 Nagell sent to the FBl a letter claiming

that in September 1963 he had sent to the Bureau a regletered letter

signed "Jack Kramor", The 1964 letter laplied that the 1963 letter

had warned the F'BI about the impending assassination. The FBI, of

course, did not receive such a letter.

11. In Jasuary 1968 Williaz I. Turner stated in an article in

Ramparts, "The Garrison Commission on the Assassination of

## Page 46

13-00000

President Kennedy", p. 56, that Nagell was then still confined

at Lcavenworth, that he had been a highly decorated infantry captain

Ia the Korean War, and that he clalmed to bave become a ClA agent

Ramparta shifted the plane crash in which Nagell was

Iajured fros 195é and Maryland to 1957 and Cambodle. The article

repeated the allegation that he ataged & phony holdup la order to be

under arrest when the ausassination occurred.

12. On 6 June 1968 the American Consulate In Zurich cabled

Washlagton to say that Richard Case Nagell, passport J 543069, had

appeared at the consulate on 1 June and had said that he was working

for a secret U.S. Government agency on a mission to Geneva, where

he was to meet some Japanese. He asked for money. He returned to

the consulate the next dey, war lacoherent, and seemed peychetic. He

claimed that on 14-16 May 1968 he had been interviewed by Dietrict

Attorney Jim Garrison. He said that Garrison had warned him that he

was in danger of being killed and that he wanted to inform CLA that he

was in Zurich.

19. On 7 September 1968 another William Turner plece was

printed by Ramparts under the heading"! Asiasainations / Epatein's

Garrison". It referred to Nagell as a former U.S. Intelligence agent

and repeated much the sare story that it had told in January. Turner

and Ramparts may have bees unaware that Nagell was out of jail by then.

14. On 25 October 1968 the Washingtos Post reported that after..

holding Nagell fox four months, the Last Germans had released him

on 23 October at an East-West Bexiin crossing-point. Nagell left.by

plane for the U.S. on 25 October, "Informed sources" said that Nagell

was taken off a train en route through East Germany to Berlin because

he raade some remarke which the East Germans considered derogatory.

15. On 31 October 1968 State forwarded the text of a report by a

J, 5. Army paychlatrlet who examined Nagell on 23 October.

Nagell

said that he was on active duty with the armay from 1948 to 1959 and that

from 1953 to 1959 he was an officer in military intelligence. He also

provided accurate information about the 1954 plane crash and its results ..

among them, in his oma wordo, his "'unstable personality and immature

or Impulaive behaviour". He said that he draws 64% disability pay. He

lost his job in Calliornte because one night in 1962, while drunk, he tried

to break down the door of the apartment of bis estrenged wife.

After his confused attempt in 1963 to rob the El Paso bank, he

spent 4 1/2 yeare in prinon. He was examined by Dr. Edwin Weinstein,

Information of any upe to him. The interview left him. however. wit

two feaxe: that Garrison might try to subpoens him and that CLA might

try to "elimlaate" hira.. (By the time he was providing this inforaation

In Bezlin Nagell was well aware that he was not involved in any conspiracy.

to assassinate President Kennedy.) He said that his fear of CIA was

planted in bla mind by Mr. Garrison.

After his release he went to New Xork, there a sister lives. He

was almost bit by a car driven without lights and decided to go to Europe

to escapo being killed by CiA. In June he appeared in Zurich. He next

det out for West Berlin but was taken off the train on 11 June 1968.

Fox several montha he was repeatedly anked to admit that he was a apy.

Eventually he concluded that the only way to obtata his release waa to

pretend that he wan mentally Ill. He did so, was examined by a

paychiatrlet, and was released.

"He no longer belleves that it is realletic to think that the CLA was

trylag to lll bim." He termed limself "chrontcally paranold", The

Army psychlatrist concluded "Currently he le not paychotic and peeras

competent in a legal and psychiatzle sense . . .

Negell'e final remark was, "Well, I'll tell you one thlag; that's

the last time I ever take a trada through East Germany. "

SIRHAN'S MOTIVES

Unlike Lee Harvey Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan

has lived an sell on his morivasions -but he

has chosen so semain silen. The onlyother

porensial. source of infirmation is lis

Jumils which hail mor spoken to the press.

Mushmund Acted-Heell, an

Egyptlan

correspondent fur Akhbar Elyoum in

Cairo, recentli guined access 1o Sirhan's

family. Based upon information supplied

him by she family, he has written exclusiv-

els for Ramparts she following account

of Sirhan's motivations and the strategy

he plans for his trial.

Because of the forthcoming trial and

the difficuli; of dealing with this subject

without emotional involvement, the editors

of RAMpaRTs have elected in present this

information of historic interest lo our

readers without display, and in as ob-

jective a form as possible.

B

ECAUSE I AM AN ARAB I was able to

break through the burrier of sus-

picion that had stopped other

journalists coll and obtain the first in-

depth interviews the Sirhan family has

given since the assassination. From their

comments and from what Sirhan has said

to them, a picture of the man and his

motives begins to emerge, replacing the

misleading portraits which haveswamped

the U.S. press.

The fact that Sirhan has not publicly

discussed his trial is no accident.. It is his

own strategy. sonething he developed

after thinking about it for long hours in

his specially made jail cell. In fact, he

has contided los his lienly that he will

never make an statement unless special

provisions are made for the courtroom

proceedings.

What Sirhan wants is,

quite simply, publicity. He wants the

major television networks to be allowed

to broadcast the entire trial. If they do

this, he says, he will tell all. "And if they

refuse?" his brother Adel recently asked

him. "Then I shall go to the gas chamber

-silent,"? Sirhan replied.

To understand why Sirhan is indeed

Mad. Nle is deeply committed to making

his trial a public and political forum for

the Arab position.

College educated, articulate and a

RAMPARTS

Assassinations]-

voracious reader, Sirhan is confident

about his own ability to cope with his

predicament. His eldest brother, Shereif,

told me that Sirhan studies the intrica-.

cies of his case as many as len hours a

day in his cell. Shereif recalls that Sirhan

recently said lo him, "I do not need i

lawyer. I understand my case and know

how to defend myself."' But even so,

Attorney Russell Parsons is defending

his client, and doing it on Sirhan's own

grounds. "The main issue," Parsons told

me, "is to answer this question: why, for

what reason, did Sirhan kill Robert

Kennedy? There are 100 witnesses who

saw Sirhan shooting Mr. Kennedy, but

no one seems to know why he did it."

Sirhan and his attorney hope that the

defense-presuming that the television

networks are allowed into the court-

room-will show that Sirhan did not

have "malice aforethought" in shoot-

ing Kennedy because the act was a polit-

ical gesture, and that Kennedy, to Sirhan

at least,

was merely a symbol. His

brother Adel noles that "if Sirhan was

just an assassin, he could have done it in

another way, just by having a gun with a

telescope. He went to the Ambassador

Hotel expecting to get caught; that is

why he left his notes at home. I believe

that Sirhan wanted to get caught so that

he could say what he believes."

THEN I FIRST TRIED to meet with

the Sirhan family, I was re-

• fused. Security is extremely

heavy around them, and they are under-

standably wary of new faces. Later, when

I finally obtained an invitation to mect

with them, Mrs. Sirhan apologized, I

believe for having been inhospitable to

a fellow Arab.

This family, which fled Jordan to seek

greater safety and security than it had

known, is now living in terror. They are

somewhat at a loss to understand the

events which have suddenly catapulted

them into history. None of the four

brothers goes to hisjob; they all feel that

death follows them everywhere, and they

move carefully, with a heavy guard.

"Why don't you just leave this country?"

lushed Shereil. "Where shall we go?"

he answered, "To whom shall we lenve

our brother! Our land is under Isruel's

occupation." Shereif clarified his state-

ment: "Our brother is in jail; we have to

stay."

11968.

I sensed not only the Sirhans' con-

fusion, but also some bitterness. They

have notreceived any aid from the Arab

countries, as they originally thought they

might. Parsons is aiso somewhat sur-

prised; he had hoped thit the vurious

locn! Arab consulates would help defriy

court costs. i

Indeed, Los Angeles' Jordanian con-

sul, who visited Sirhan in jail at Sirhan's

request, indicated to me that the accused

assassin hadjexpected the Arab people

to treat him as a hero. However, except

for some Palestinian extremists, his act

has been universally repudiated by the

Arab world. One Arab newspaper has

said editorially,

"We don't feel any

responsibility for this. It is the society

that fed him with hostility, the society

that gave him the gun, that is responsi-

ble." Members of the Arab Students'

Association, of which Sirhan was once

an officer, feel that the killing of Kennedy

was a terrible mistake. One of them suid

"What are we going to do with

the rest of the American candidates? Kill

them all because they want lo help

Isruel?"

Still, the Sirhans" friends are primarily

Arab, and they live in an atmosphere

that is more: Arab than American. The

entire family spent a good deal of time

discussing the Arab-Israeli conflict. The

mother says that Sirhan was the most

sensitive and the most involved during

these discussions. Adel says that Sirhan

once saw a television report of Robert

Kennedy addressing the members of the

Nevch Shalom Temple in Portland,

Oregon. While in the synagogue, Ken-

nedy, wearing a yarmulke, declared that

the United States must help Israel

against aggression from whatever source.

""Unlike the South Vietnamese," Ken-

nedy said, "the Israelis have shown they

are willing to fight for their own survival.

Indeed, Israel is the very opposite of

Vietnam: the Israeli government is very

democratic, effective and free of corrup-

tion. Its people are united in its support."

The senator then urged the Johnson Ad-

ministration to procred it oner with the

sale of 50 Phandone jet lighters los the

Israell Air Force and do den dll camormis

aid 10 the Arile commeres. This whole

episode made Sirhan very ngry, Shereif

recalls. "He lell the room putting his

hands on his ears and almost weeping."

tirined from prage o

I asked Sirhan's mother why

she

thought her son had shot Kennedy.

"Everything in this country was helping

Sirhan," she maintained. "It was push-

ing him to the danger point. Everything,

the propaganda of the Zionists, every-

thing, was against his country, against

his people."

Adel described Sirhan's current state

of mind: "He feels he has done a terrible

thing, but he feels now it is too late to be

sorry. Now he wants Americans to listen

to something they have never listened

t0."

And at their first meeting in the jail,

Sirhan's mother said to him, "Shame on

you. Why have you done such a thing?"

He replied, "Il's 100 late lo speak of it..

But all the Americans will know why."

EPSTEIN'S GARRISON

WO SUMMERS ACiD a landem allack

on the Warren Keport all but rele-

gated that work to the fiction

section of your local library. The first

was Mark Lane's Rush ‹ Judgment,

which convincingly demonstrated-us-

ing the Warren Commission's own evi-

dence-that Oswald could not have done

it alone, and drew the first dim outlines

of the conspiracy theory. The second

was Edward Jay Epstein's Inquest, which

exposed the rather shoddy inner work-

ings of the Commission and laid bare the

tortured logic it finally employed to dis-

pel notions of a conspiracy.

Both books became best sellers, but

their authors have since gone different

wilys. Lille, whees shuttered his lnw prac-

lice and struggled for yours to get his

manuscrip published in the United

States die was first published in Britain),

has stumped the country in support of

District Altorney Jim Garrison's theory

that the assussination was carried out by

11 inti-Castro paramilitary lean super-

HUMIDIDT:

vised by persons with ciA affiliations.

Epstein, whose book was a converted

Cornell University master's thesis-the

subject was urged upon him by his men-

tor, Andrew Hacker-has emerged as

one of Garrison's most fervid accusers.

His vehicle is The New Yorker: in the

issue of July 13, he delivered a 25,000-

word blast at Garrison, calling the DA's

investigation a fraud.

The New Yorker article had its genesis

over a year ago, when the author showed

up at Garrison's office in New Orleans.

According to Chief Investigator Louis

Ivon, Epstein spent about 48 hours in

town, some three hours at the office, and

hasn't been seen since. Much of what he

writes about has occurred since this

touch-and-go visit and is obviously hear-

say on his part, yet he writes with the

authoritative tone of a participant. Un-

doubtedly this technique is convincing

to his audience, which assumedly is un-

familiar with the intricacies of Garrison's

investigation. But to those familiar with

the facts, the article is badly slanted.

For example, Philosophy Professor

Richard. Popkin of the University of

California at San Diego, author of the

book The Second Oswald (propounding

the theory of an Oswald double) and

"Garrison's Case"' in The New York

Review of Books (September 14, 1967),

recently commented on the article:

"I found it a queer mix of facts, half-

facts, rumors and very dubious informa-

tion from people hostile to Garrison.

Epstein has compressed all this to make

it look like everything's on the same

level. I think it would take an awful lot

of work to disentangle what he's saying

on almost any page as to how much of

it has a factual base, how much of it is

rumor that he has heard from people,

how much of it are charges that have

been made by people like (William] Gur-

vich [who volunteered to work on the

investigation without pay, passed him-

self off as the Chief Investigator, then

•turned on Garrison] against Garrison,

which haven't been substantiated any-

where except by Gurvich's statement of

them. And also that he tends to take

facts and information and rumors and so

on, that occurred over a year and a half's

period, and compress them all into

simultaneous events, so that a statement

a paon the brin of in is

tion or staternents he mude a year and a

half later in a totally dillerent context.

So l think it's a quite untair presence-

tion, which has some laclual buse, but

which also has a lot of very dubious

elements in it."

One of the dubious elements is Ep-

stein's version of the testimony of Dean

Andrews Jr., a colorful attorney who

numbers among his former clients Os-

wald (who wanted his undesirable dis-

charge from the Marine Corps rectified)

and the late David William Ferrie, a

central figure in the Garrison investiga-

tion. The day. after the assassination,

Andrews told the Commission he re-

ceived a phone call from a man he knew:

as Clay Bertrand, whom he described as

a "lawyer without a briefcase" for local

homosexuals. Bertrand asked him to go

to Dallas and defend Oswald. Garrison

contends Bertrand is Clay Shaw, whom

he has charged with conspiracy.

According, to Epstein, Andrews ini-

tially gave the FBi "several different de-

scriptions" of Bertrand, and finally ad-

mitted that Bertrand "was merely a

figment of his imagination." Later, be-

fore the Commission, Andrews stated

that he had recently seen Bertrand in a

bar and, Epstein says, described him as

"a boy" who was "five feet eight inches"

and had "sandy hair." "No other clues

to Bertrand's identity turned up, how-

ever," writes: Epstein, "and Wesley J.

Liebeler, a Commission lawyer who con-

ducted the investigation in this arca, said

he was convinced that no such person

An objective reuding of "Andrews

testimony, however, reveals that he

told the FBl that Bertrand was" approxi-

mately six feet one inch to six feet two

inches in height, brown hair, and well

dressed" —a description that closely

matches the tall, aristocratic Shaw. As

for Bertrand being a figment of his

imagination, Andrews declared, "That's

what the Feebees (FBI] put on." He re-

counted that G-men had pestered him

to the point where he told them, "Write

what you want, that I am nuts. I don't

care." As for his later remark to the

Commission's Mr. Liebeler that Ber-

trand was only five feet, eight inches,

Andrews explained that "this time I was

looking for the fellow, he was sitting

down." Nöwhere does he refer to Ber-

trand as a "boy." Epstein was perhaps

confused by his exclamation: "I don't

play Boy Scout and measure them."

In his superficial examination of Our-

Continued from page 8

rison's case, Epstein evidently failed to

check the police records prepared upon

Shaw's arrest. Thoroughly shaken by the

irrest. Shaw blurted out, according to

Patrolman Aloysius Habighorst, that he

had used! the alias "Clay Bertrand." The

alins was daly entered on the fingerprint

card and booking sheet.

One of the most fascinating charic-

ters in the conspiracy drama is Kichard

Case Nakell, i former U.S. Intelligence

agent who claims he encountered O)swald

in Mexico Cily in 1963, and had been

instructed by his spy superiors to deter-

mine it the rumors of an assassination

attempt had any foundation. Nagell says

he learned that the first attempt against

Kennedy was scheduled for September

26 in Washington, D.C., and that Oswald

(who crossed the border into Mexico the

day before) was to be set up as the

"patsy" and shot in front of the Cuban

it the following occured:

The President, on the eve of

his abdication, arranged to accept the

resignation of the chief justice of the

United States Supreme Court in order

1n replace him with the President's

conceded than during his three years on

as the Prescolns irelesses:

There purstand do than role, los badd siall

but that he had merely "summarized"

Washington, Oswald got a reprieve. But

would come off but failed to get the FBI

Paso on September 20 so that he would

Epstein dismisses Nagell as being

mentally unbalanced, noting that "court

records indicated that Nagell had suf-

fered brain damage in an airplane crash

in 1957" and that, following the bank

episode, he was "an inmate of a federal

institution for the criminally insane in

Springfield, Missouri.". As he does so

frequently throughout the article, Ep-

stein delivers a version which if devel-

oped fully would throw a different light

ron the matter. Nagell was in a plane

crash, but he was given Intelligence

cized war spending, though whether his

call was made at the President's request

he could not say and remain faithful to

the Separation of Powers;

That the businessman had retracted

his statement, though in the end it

proved to be accurate;

That the justice could not answer

questions concerning his judicial opin-

ions since the Constitution specifies that

members of Congress may not be ques-

tioned about their acts in any place other

than in Congress;

That despite this asserted Constilu-

tional bar, the justice pointed to his dis-

senting vote against extending the one-

man-one-vote principle to local govern-

ment as proof of his devotion to State's

rights;

That although he had been at the

President's disposal as advisor-summar-

izer, he had never been involved in dis-

cussions that could conceivably reach

the Court;

That the issucs under discussion at the

1op level mucetings lud ranged trom the

Vietnam War to riots in the cities;

That the justice had voted to jail druft

card burners and had voled ugainst

taking up for consideration the legality

of the war;

That he voted to give the police sweep-

ing rights to stop-and-frisk suspects on

training after his recovery, indicating

that he had no permanent brain injury.

Moreover, the fact that he stood trial

implies that he was legally sane. Re-

cently, he was released from Leaven-

worth

Penitentiary-he had been at

Springfield only temporarily.

The publication of the lipstein article

came at an opportune line for Clay

Shaw. Obtaining advance copies, his al-

torneys entered it as evidence before a

three-judge federal panel which was hear-

ing arguments that the DA was "con-

ducting a"rein of terror" and "perse-

cuting" the defendant. Apparently the

panel was unimpressed, for it unani-

mously rejected the defense's argument

and ordered the case to trial.

If Garrison does get his day in court-

a day Epstein has struggled in deny him

than The New Yorker's brief for the

defense.

That within two months.uf his pro-

cases no legal defense could be urged,

That shortly after that boook was pub-

Reference cables concern the claim of an individual appearing at

the Consul General's office in Zurich, Sgitzerland on 4 June 1968 that

he is one Richard Case NAGELL. NAGELL was sentenced to a 10 year term for

bank robbery on 9 June 1964 and is supposedly in a federal prison in Missouri.

GARRISON interviewed Subject as a witness in his investigation

according to a news clipping from the CHICAGO AMERICAN dated 2 January

1968. The clipping is marked in Subject's file which is attached.

file also contains a copy of the summary dated 18 January 1968 prepared

in research on the GARRISON CASE.

It would be of interest for documentation of Subject's file to

ascertain from the FBI if Subject is still in préson.

I did not receive reference IN Cable 25955 intttally. Attached is

Mabley's Report:

Garrison Case-

Can We Afford

Not to Listen?

BY JACK MABLEY

THIS INVESTIGATION INTO the assassination of Presi-

gent kennedy is being reopened. It is being conducted by a

prosecutor with the power of subpena and a grand jury

with the power to indict.

It would be better for the country

if the dodoral government were mak-

ing the investigation rather than a

New Orleans official who has been

accused of beingunstable and of

seeking headlines:

However, the federal government

shows no signs of wanting to reopen

the matter; and the prosecutor, Jim

Garrison, appears to be quite insistent

on carrying it thru.

• *A number of writers and self-

appointed investigators also are dis-

satisfied with conflicting facts and

• unanswered questions, and they con-

tinue. to publish evidence to rebut the

JIN. GARRISON

Warren commission conclusion that

Lee farvey Oswald alone was invplved in the assassination.

ONE OF THE MOST persistent critics of the Warren

conclusion is Ramparts magazine.

This is a liberal, no, a

radical publication which represents the viewpoint of a small

minority. However, it has done some effective investigative

reporting, particularly in exposing the CIA infiltration into

college activities."

Ramparts assigned an investigator, William W. Turner,

who they say is a former FBI agent, to spend 9 months

looking into the New Orleans evidence.

"I have worked closely with the D. A. (Garrison] and his

staff," Turner reports. "In my opinion, there is no question

that they have uncovered a conspiracy."

The gist of the New. Orleans case is: that. Oswald was

Involved with a heterogeneous group of adventurers, anti-

Castro Cubans, and radical righters who included members

uf the Minutemen and American Nazis.

Their common cause was to encourage or mount a revolt

in Cuba against Castro. They also were strongly anti-

:ammunist.

There is no question this group existed. Garrison bas

sance that Oswald was part of it. Garrison's investigators

.. evidence that Oswald's pro-Russian leanings actually

vire a front, or a disguise to conceal his real role as an

=....

: ommunist.

GARRISON BELIEVES THAT Oswald was schooled in

covert operations by the CIA while in the marine corps

at Atsugi naval station in Japan. Supporting evidence is

Oswald's proficiency in the Russian language, the source of

which was never explained, the ease with which he entered

Russia, and the lack of censure by the gövernment on his

return, or by the marine corps in his discharge.

In effect, Garrison feels Oswald was either a CIA agent

or was involved with CIA activities.

The New Orleans group was angry at President Kennedy

because of the failure of the Bay of Pigs operation and

because thoy thought Kennedy wasn't sufficiently anti-

communist:

Garrison has dozens of witnesses he will subpena to fit

bits and pieces into the puzzle. Individually, many can be

dismissed as unreliable, but collectively they raise many

questions that an objective observer would like to see

resolved.

It certainly is within the power of the federal govern-

ment to disprove every one of these witnesses' stories, if

they can be disproved. Presumably, the federal government

does not want to dignify Garrison's allegations with formal

denials.

IF THERE IS ANY substance to Garrison's charges,

two powerful agencies of the federal government stand to be

discredited. Garrison has interviewed one witness, Ricard

Cass Nagell, a highly decorated Korean war veteran whö

claims to have been a CIA agent, who says he sent a

registered letter to J. Edgar Hoover warning him of the

assassination plot: If this is true, Hoover and the FBI would

be guilty of dreadful dereliction of duty.

The CIA and CIA fronts are deeply involved in

the

activities of the men Garrison believes plotted the Presi-

dent's murder.

-Turner, the Ramparts investigator, believes powerful

government agencies are doing everything in their power

to discredit Garrison.

Ten persons involved in the case have sled, most of

them violently, since the assassination. All west to their

graves with information Garrison considers pendent ic his

investigation. -

Unless Garrison is killed or removed from office in

some way, it is difficult to see what

can sir im from

airing these stories, probably in a court of law. that the

public may judge their validity.

DATE: September 2, 1969

SUBJECT: Item in East Village Other, August 20, 1969

This past weekend, I visited a friend who had just returned from New

York City, bringing back a copy of a New York underground newspaper,

the East Village Other, dated August 20, 1969.

Out of curiosity, I paged through the paper and, on page 17, found a

so-called classified section, consisting generally of ads for male and

female artists models and offerings of books alleged to instruct one

In the art of synthesizing hallucinogenies.

In the personal columns of this section, the foblowing was noted, a

verbatim transcript of which is set forth:

"Caught In The Act. Notice to the CIA and all SY

shitheads who participated in Project Purple Shaft:

After that fiasco in the GIR you worms did your best

to screw, blue and tattoo me.

You even tried to have

my ass dusted in Berlin . . a you fuckups. Now Its

my turn to do a little shafting.

Cordially, R. C. NAGEII."

Card indices in SY/E reflect no indication that anyone named R. C.

NAGELL, or any variation thereof, including NAGLE or NOGSLL, has

ever been granted clearance in this office.

DEF

A check in SY files reflected a record on Richard Case NAGiLI, born

August 5, 1930, who apprently is identical with the individual who

NAGELL has been of interest to both the FBI and the Dapartment

recent years.

While NAGELI may be something of a crackpot, the item

does appear to%

contain somewhat of an imolied threat.

For this reason, the informa.

tion is forwarded for your consideration and for any action which may

be considered necessary.

Background

My initial contact with Mr. Nagell was when he was

expelled

from the DDR by the East German officials who forcibly

propelled him toward us over the borderline into West Berlin.

As we initially escorted Mr. Nagell back to US Army lospital

Berlin in the US Mission vehicle, he seemed unsure of where

and who we were, as well as being angry and belligerent

In the course of

the two hour interview which was then conducted at the

hospital, Mr. Nagell gradually regained his composure and

gave a more cooperative and coherent history.

At his

insistance, the interview took place in the presence of the

attorney Mr. Ricey S. New, Jr:, who acted in an unofficial

capacity as a legally oriented "friend."

The salient aspects of Mr.

Nagell's history are as follows.

He says he was on active military duty (Army) fron 1948

until

1959. For the first three of these years he was an enlisted

nan, and for the last six he was an officer, working in

military intelligence.

In 1954 he was the sole survivor in

a plane crash which resulted in a brain concussion, runerous

physical injuries, and prolonged military hospitalization.

Mr. agell now claims that he believes it was this head

injury which resulted in his

"unstable personality and

immature or impulsive behaviour."

le attributes to this

instability his marital difficulties and his decision to

resign his comnission in 1959, something which he nov considers

At the time of his leaving the service he was not

awarded a disability pension, but he says that he was later

able to successfully petition the VA for a "it" disability."

Me claims that he had never seen a psychiatrist during his

military careel'.

From liby to 1902 he says that he worked for the stac oi

Calilornia as an investigator for various burcaus.

marital difficulties had increased and his wife insistod on

separation, leeping with her their two childen.

says that one night in 1962 he became intoxicated, and tried

to break down the door to her apartment.

says he lost his job and says that for

the next year he

"just drifted," apparently without notivation to worl;

supporting himself on his disability pension and financial

aid from his sister.

He is not certain about whether or not

the divorce from his wife has ever been legally compieted.

LINIT DISTRIBUTION

In September 1963 he was accused of committing an act which

he now says was bred out of his feeling of hopelessness

and desperation. He claims that in a confused way he

attempted while armed to rob a bank and was easily appre-

hended.

For the next 4 1/2 years followed a complicated

series of trials, appeals and retrials.

In addition to

spending these years

in prison, he also had at least three

prison hospitalizations for psychiatric observation. his

appeals apparently hinged on his contention that he was

"temporarily insane" at the time of the crime. He was not

considered insane at any time during his imprisonment, and

his claim to temporary insanity found support in the expert

testimony of a noted American neurologist, Dr. Edwin

Weinstein.

Dr. Weinstein apparently interpreted Hagell's

EEG's (electro-encephalograms) as being abnormal and argued

that Nagell had developed a "paranoid personality, and

instability" on the basis of his brain injury.

This conten-

tion was apparently disputed by other expert witnesses, but

in any case Nagell was officially acquitted on April 29 of /

this year.

Nagell says he then

went to the New York area, where his

sister (his closest relative) resides, but he claims an

additional complication in his life had risen in that he

had once been an "acquaintance" of Lee liarvey Uswald, and

had been implicated in a possible plot to assassinate

President Kennedy in an article in RAMPART'S magazine which

appeared in January 1968.

1x. Nagell firmly denies that he

was involved in any way with any such conspiracy, and was

in fact imprisoned at the time of the assassination. On

the basis of this magazine article Nagell says that

Mr. Garrison, the attorney general, from New Orleans who is

arguing that a conspiracy existed in the assassination,

came up to New York to interview him. Nagell says that he

denied that he had any information of use to Mr. Garrison,

but that the interview left him with two fears.

One fear

was that Garrison might subpoena him to testify in the New

Orleans proceedings, and the other fear was that the CIA

might try to "eliminate" him, a suspicion which he says

was planted in his mind by Mr. Garrison. He says that soon

afterwards while walking down a street at night in New Yorh

City he was almost run over by a car without lights. He

interpreted this as being an attempt at murder by the CIn

and in some haste left the country for a tour of Europe.

.

In June, shortly thereafter, he discussed with an American

consular official in Zurich

his recurrent fear that the

CIA was going to "hit" him. His next

travel point was to

West Berlin, and on June 11, 1968, while his train was

traversing the DDR, he says that he was taken off the

train and illegally detained.

He is not certain why he

was taken off the train but

admits to having talked freely

passengers about his life history,

of his Army and government records involved with his service

career, disability, and imprisonment.

For several mcntlis

Nagell claims that he was interrogated by the last Gernans

and repeatedly asked to confess his role as a spy or govern-

ment agent.

Eventually, Nagell says that he concluded the

only way to be released would be to feign mental illress,

which he says he proceeded to do.

This was several weeks

ago and he says he was soon examined by

an East German

psychiatrist and events were set in motion which culminated

in his release today, four and one-half months after his

detention began.

Mr. Nagell's plans for the future center around returning.

to

the United States and beginning an appeal to the govern-

ment to grant him a psychiatric disability pension, as wedd

injury. He no longer believes that it is realistic to think

that the CIA was trying to kill him.

Mental Status Exan

Mr. Nagell is a tall, 38 year old male who snows the evidence

of a prior head injury in the form of extensive scar: on

the left side of his face, facial asymmetry due to seventh:

nerve injury, reconstructive surgery on his left ear, etc.

In addition he shows

some healed incisions on his left wrist

which he claims were superficial lacerations self-inflicted

at the time of his first imprisonment in 1963, and again a

ago in the DDR.

He denies that in either instance

he seriously intended to kill himself.

He is of superior

intelligence

and shows a remarkable memory for dates and

of every effort made to help him.

was no overt evidence of psychosis.

His nutritional state

Summary

In summary then we seem to be dealing with a person who has

had a personality disorder for a number of years, manifested

by emotional instability, impulsive behaviour, a tencency

to be litigious, and a general suspicious or paranoic

orientation. It is difficult to know how much of what he

is saying is factual, but it may be that In June of this

year he was becoming

"borderline" or even delusional in his

thinking about possible attempts on his lie, and this

probably explains his flight to Europe.

His own closing words provide a lighter note to what other-

wise has been a

complicated and

SLOSS, a stall omployee since 1948, has recently been

repolygraphed with inconciustve results, having tracted to questions

regarding disclosure of chaselfled information, association with a com-

munist sympathizer, and homosexuality. He has also been lavolved

with cooperation li an extramarital aflair which tchminated lu & black.

mail attempt on one of the parties. His name la perhaps identical with

& name emong ils namos of Agency employees lound on a mentally die-

turbed and disaffected lorener GIC intelligence offisatwho alleges contact

with Russles and Guban Intelligence sgeste.. Detalle of these questionable

arABs in regard to 5LOSS are set forth bolor.. Recommend intenalve and

thorough tavertigation of SLOSS including survelllance al actlvities.

Hla parenta are American borA..

. Ho graduated from Yale Ualveralty la

He attended Colunbin Universlty, School of International Attairs and the

3. The name of John SLOSS may be identical with the name J.

SLOSS found on the pereon of Richard Casa NAGELL when arrested in eon-

nection with a bank robbery in El Pato, Texas, os 20 September 1963. A

notebook found on NAGELL made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Gommit-

teo, the addressee of Foreign Embassles, the names of purported CLA

agents and other information. Although NAGELL le inquestionably mont-

ally unbalanced, he tella a story of being involved in esplonage which is

not fully contradicted by evidence. There la no apparent explanation of

why the nare J. SLOSS as well an five other names of CIA personnel

should have been in the possession of Richard Care NAGEll. The weird

stoxy of NAGELL is contained in a chronological listing of bia activities

appended to this memorandura.

4. A review of the Security file on SLOSS in connection with the

Richard Case NAGELl matter revealed that SLOSS, for the past few yeare,

1960-1964, had provided hid apgrtment as a place of assignation in the

adulterous relationship of Philip Barry KENNEDY/ a GS-I5 Intelligence of-

fice, assigned to OCI and Mrs. (Betty BARKER, ( a former employee of the

Central Intelligence Agency from 19 Octobex 1953 until 26 July 1962, The

S. It la noteworthy in the SLOSS KENNEDY -BARKER/matter

that SLOSS has been involved in cooperating in an unlawíul and immoral

actlvity which, according to the direct teatimony of one of the parties.

(belteved to be true because the report was agalast her own Interest)

reculted in a blackmail attempt agalast her in May 1964,

6. Of particular concern should be the results of the latest

two polygraph examinations, the validity of which, because of medication

including & tranguilizer type drug and alcohol in the Subject'e syotem, was

deemed to be inconclusive.

7. During the 1955 polygraph examination, the Subject admitted

so homosexual desires but stated that these had never caused a persona)

problem and had never resulted in bis partieipation in a homosexual act.

During the 24 April 196d examination, the Subject showed consistent re-

actions to the homosexual question which indicated deception. During

further specific questioning on 22 May 1964 covering the various homosexual

areas however, there were no strong reactions to indicate that subject night

be practicing deception on the specifle question regarding engaging in homo-

sexual actlvities since workdag for ClA.

In conxection with the phane of queations concerning contact

with any possible communiet eympathises, the Subject reflected overall

disturbance indicating that all the questions obvioualy bothered hira and

that deception was being practiced within that phase. The polygrapà opera-

for noted that there were outstanding reactione to the following two questione:

20 b "Other than your comments about FISHER, during your

undergraduate period at Yale did you have any contact

with any Communlat or Gommunet sympathizer?

AnEwer: No."

20 €

During your CIA employment, have you had any contact

with any Communiot of Communiat sympathizer?

Anasser: No."

9. It ls particularly noteworthy that duriag his examination on

22 May 1964 when asked nine questione as to whether be had been acquaint.

ed with certain individuals, Subject only reacted when he answered "no"

to heving been acquainted with Jerry SEVERN and llya WOLSIQN. These

names had been sabraitted to Subject based upon pure conjecture that these

possibly might have been some connection with these individuale at Camp

Ritchie Military Intelligence Traling Genter. Since the fact that both

Jexry SEVERN and Ilya WOLSTON have cooperated with Sorlet Intelligence

should have been unknown to SLOSS and he declared he is not acquainted

with they, there should have been no reason for him to react to these names.

The polygraph operatos states that SLOSS was not presaed further regarding

FISHER (whom he had characterized as "left of center") of bia own possible

knowledge of SEVERN or WOLSTAN since it was obvlous that 56O5S was

beginaing to feel haraased on this matter and stated that he did not enjoy

being asked these questions.

10, During SLOSS' interview on 1 April 1964, SLOSS reflected

consistent reactions on the questiona:

"Since working for CIA, have you glven CIA documente of

clasalfied information to unauthorized persons?'"

"Have you ever deliberately given classified information on

documents to any unauthorised person?"

Is explanation, Subject sald he was bothered by this idea, but

that he had no knowledge of any particular altuation wherein he had di-

volged Information to anyone who was unauthorized to receive it or who

would have uned it against the Agency's interest. On the test administered

on 22 May 1964 to resolve any possible compromise to communiet or foreiga

intelligence organisations, It was determined that there were no significant

reactions to relevant questions in this area.

Il, It should be especially noted that the polygraph operator, during

the 4 April 1964 interview, detected an odd axell on Subject's breath and

noted his fluched face, frequent ailly grion and lethargle movements, sug-

ject when arrested for drunken driving in 1965 bad produced evidence that

he was a diabetic and had taken redication prior to the incident. Conser

quently, during the second interview on 22 May 1965, Subject was questioned

regarding his physical healta.. He replied that he had stopped taking medi-

cation for diabetes ia Noveraber 1963. He explathed that he took three of

four diuretle pille. He pacifically denied that he had taken any other drug;

narcotis or alcohol. When this question was asked duxing interrogation.

he reflected reaction indicative of decoption and then adraitted that tor

breakiast he had taken one glass of vodka with some orange juice. He

stated that he drank rodka for breaklast sometimes whenever he was tense

or nervous over anything.

12. The polygraph operator in his report concluded that the

"yalidity of final teet charts is held in quention and there is no

strong evidence that the specific areas of concera have been

conclusively resolved at this time. It le recommended that a

further study be conducted on this case and that information

resulting from such a study be sent to IRD for possible reintes-

view of tho Subject and polygraph resolution".

13. SLOSS has indicated renctions indicative of deception during

the polygraph examinations. In one specific question where these re-

actiona were present, be admitted to lytag.. This was in the question as

to whether or not he had taken any alcohol prior to the examination.

CONCLUSION:

1. SLOSS has led in his most recent polygraph examination and

has evidenced indications of deception in areas concerning divalglag

classified information to unauthorized individuals, association with a

communiet nympathizer and homosexual lnclinations. SLOSS! reaction

to the names of Jerry SAVERN and Ilya WOLSIQN has not been fully ex-

plored. The polygraph operator has recommended further investigation

and a repolygraph because the recent tests are laconclusive.

2. SLOSS has been lavolved in an immoral and Illegal extra-

marital activity between a Staff employee and a former Staff employee

where one of the parties was subjected to a blackmall attempt.

3.

The name 1, SLOSS (posalbly identical to Subjeet) appeared

on a lot of ClA eraployees found on the person of a self-designated "die-

affected Americast arrested by the FBI for bank robbery la Septembes

1963. This Individual (mentally disturbed) with previous intelligence es-

perience has declared that he was approached by Sovlet Intelligence while

and/or after he was la Mexico City in September 1962.

4. It lo suggested that the extent of the adverse security implica-

tions conceraing SLOSS lo such, that 1l SLOSS in ever found to be a security

rink, the tailure at thia time to pursue an aggrensive invertigation of all

his contacta and activities to resolve all areas of doubt could possibly lead

to s conclusion that we have been remies in our duties. The undersigned

recommends the following action:

That physical and technical surveillance of at least two

weeks duration be made of SLOSS to determine his contacte and

activities after wozking hours.

b. That current seven way National Agency Checks be made

on SLOSS.

C That Richard B, FISHER, a friend of SLOSS', characterized

by him as having been involved in radical and left of center ideas

while en undergraduate at Yale, be fully identified, his present 10-

cation be ascertained and the degree of his assoctation with BLOSS

be determined by a personal interview with FISHER.

d. That Richard Case NAGILl be personally iaterulewed by

his failure to answer questions pertaining to allegations

he made concerning corruption within

that organization.

NAGELL stated he was presently residing with bis

sister, ELEANOR GAMBERT,

82-25 Grand Avenue,

Elmburst,

Queens, Long Island, New York, telephone number HA 6-6830,

and was attempting to obtain employment in the New York area,

NAGELL advised

his present objective was

to have the California

ARC exposed, and he was willing to furnish "court room

testimony" that would result in the prosecution of many

Los Angeles hoodluns and their

attorneys, who have acted

as go-betweens in securing alcoholic beverage licenses

through payoffs

NAGELL advised that he was shot in July, 1962, as

aresult of his refusal to "lay off" the Mauna-Loa investiga-

tion; horever, he declined to disclose the details concerning

the actual shooting.

NAGElL stated he had furnished some information to

the State of California investigators assigned to the

California Attornoy General's Office; however, nothing was

acconplished through this

NAGELL appeared overwrought and obsessed with a

desire to expose the ABC, and, as a result, clear his name:

He stated this situation has caused a separation

between

himself and his wife and children, who are still residing in

Los Angeles.

NAGELL advised he had spoken with SA "DICK" RICHARDS

of the Los angeles office on three or four occasions; however,

hs had given limited information to him, due to personal

circumstances at the time. He requested that apologies be

conveyed to SA RICHARDS for not "going all the way" on

revealing all he knew concerning individuals in whon SA

RICHARDS expressed an interest.

that he also thought he should have. On his initial interview

he refused to discuss why he was in the hospital, saying that

he had been through all this before.

Interview was given him.

He seemed well oriented in all

Spheres .

Speech was of normal

flow and coherent

He showed

no flight of ideas. He denied delusions or hallucinations.

No suicidal or homicidal tendencies were elicited.

He states

that his main trouble is headaches which I have had continuously

recently. He also complains of dizziness, and at times an

unsteady gait.'

These symptoms are sometimes associated with

a transient loss of menory.: During the interview his retention

and recall were good. Sensorium was intact. When I asked

him what he thought was wrong he said 'I think my trouble is

physiologic.'

when

tasked him what he meant by phystologic

he stated My trouble is all due to my head injury.

He felt

reassured when I told him that i thought some of his symptoms

Awere due to that mishap.

Although he smoked continuously

during the interview he related quite a story about his Army

activittes and his domestic situation, but was sorewhat evasive

about the trouble he was in while in California,

especially

the trouble involving the f.B.l, and sone shooting event.

He

was presented before the

Psychiatric stand and at first was

sonewhat reluctant to

answer questions and when asked a question

that was not due to his liking he would relate

this is my

private life.'

During the Staff Conference he said 'you

Psychiatrists are all stereotyped.'

During

the Staff

Conference, however, his mond was one of friendliness and

not one of depression, although he will occasionally get irri

table when supposedly asked a personal question.

After the

interview at the Staff Meeting he approached me saying that

he did not want any of

the nurses

aides to know about his

business and

that was the

reason why he refused to give out

any infornation.'

He further related that he keeps everything

in a little book that he has done or said because he has a poor

memory, although some of these memory deficits were not brought

out in the interview with him.

He was advised to stay on the

ward for another week or two for further observation but

felt that he didnot have to since nothing more could be done

for him. He also said the reason for him wishing to leave

was that

the had a job in mind and was going for an interview.

Since his insight and judgment were unpredictable at times

and although no psychotic behavior was noted, it was felt

can be made with or without the consent of the accused.

Assistant U.S. Attorney MORTON stated that tbe subject

nas constantly retured to cooperate with prychiatrists and

has refused to even speak to them, and that this refusal

on his part has held up any possible psychiatric

examination, necessitating postponing further action.

The subject, who is still incarcerated in the

El Paso County Jail, sent the following note to SA THOMAS: B.

WHITE, JR. of the El Paso Office of the FBI, which reads

as follows:

Mr. White

"When one's actions are motivated by an

ideological

conviction, he cannot deviate from his pursued path simply

because society may censure it as wrong. But when he becomes

disillusioned with such ideology, and an existing situation

so dictates, he must initiate immediate correstive action

as befits circumstance and as best he knows how.

"I have always acted from a principal of love for.

my country, and this same principle actuated my conduct of

September 20th, however inappropriate or incomprehensible it

may Appear.

"/s/ Richard C. Nagell"

The

December 10, 1963, Issue of the El Paso Times

contained an article on pages 1 and 3-4 entitled "Says Bank

Holdup Try

'Patriotic!."

According to the article, NaGELL

had submitted several handwritten petitions to the Judge

of the United States District Court in El Paso:

The article

states,

"In one petition, dated December 5,

he wrote,

I have

always aoted from a principle of love for my country and'

this same principle actuated my conduct on September 20,

1963, however inappropriate or incomprehensible it may

appear.

God and I, and also the FBI, know that I an not

guilty.

"NAGElt is accused of pulling

a gun on a teller

at the bank. When the teller fled, NAGELl is alleged to have

fired two shots into the bank ceiling.

"NArELl had previously Indicated he might submit to

examination by a psychiatrist at William Beaumont General

Hospital.

But at the hearing it was brought out be refused

to do so now.

"Judge THOMASON then overruled his motion for a

writ and asked that NAGELL's case be taken before

a Federal

::..

Grand Jury -

Previously the judge nad ordered that au

prosecution be deferred until an examination report on

NAGELL's mental competency was obtained.

"The judge said NAGELL's

argument on the bond

more thoroughly convinces the court you need psychiatric

help.

When NAGEll was returned to the jail, he would not

tell reporters why he entered the bank.. As in the past he:

said he would not disclose his motive.

FRED MORTON, Assistant U. S. District Attorney,

said

Monday afternoon that the case will probably be taken

before a U. S. Grand Jury in January in San Antonio."

On January 3, 1964, GEORGE NORMAN STANGA was

contacted and interviewed at the El Paso County Jail after

he contacted the El Paso Office of the FBI and specifically

requested that he

be interviewed regarding RICHARD CASE

NAGELL.

At the time of the interview, NAGELL was incar-

cerated at the El Paso County Jail as a Federal prisoner

for the crime of bank robbery.

FP 65-951

STANGA stated that since his arrest and incarceration

at the El Paso County Jail for bad checks, he has become quite

friendly with RICHARD CASE NAGELL.

He stated that NAGELL was a

very mixed-up individual, but that he enjoyed the company of

STANGA and confided in him.

He went on

to say that NAGELL

had recently confided in him to the extent that he had

told

him why he atterpted to hold up the State National Bank of

El Paso, Texas .

NAGELL told STANGA that after his release

from the United States Army, he drifted from job to job and

became more aod more mentally confused as to his political,

religious,

and econonic allegiances. During this confused

period, NAGELL apparently became a member of the Communist

Party of the United States and told STANGA that he did some

ninor work for this organization prior to his trip to El Paso

NACElL also explained to STANGA that he divorced his wife during

this period, and after making several scenes with his wife,

was barred by

court order from seeing his children

During

this period of his life, NAGEll told STANGA that he lived in

the Los Angeles, California, area.

NAGELL explained

to STANGA that he came to El Paso,

after making a decision that everything was against

him in los Angeles and that he should attempt to leave the

United States for a Conmunist country in Europe. In line with

this decision to leave the United States, NAGELL made

a contact

with the Communist Party in Los Angeles, and arranged to meet

a courier or contact man for the Party in El Paso, Texas.

This

contact man was allegedly to have a visa

and passport for

NAGELL SO that he might leave the United States and eventually

end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL then left the Los Angeles

area and drove to El Paso, Texas.

He told STANGA that during

this trip, he stopped by the side of

the road on at least

three occasions and attempted suicide with a pistol which

was in his possession.

He explained to STANGA, however,

that he did not have the guts to do it and just let things

drift

along.

After arriving in El Paso,

Texas, NAGELL said

that he got a hotel room

and again attempted suicide with

the revolver. He agate did not have the nerve to "pull the

trigger" and decided that

the best way to commit suicide

would be by leaving the hotel and having a "shoot-out" with

43.

A poliCeman.

He bert the hotel room, Rot in his car.

proceded down the streets of l Paso looking for a policeman

no looked like he would shoot it out with him.

NAGELL told

STANGA that he did not see a patrolman, however, and decided

that be would enter the State National Bank of sl Paso and

cause a big ruckus because he knew that a policeman was in

the building guarding a Treasury Department money display.

Nigilt entered the bank and fired tuo shots into a wall and

then left the bank fully expecting to be shot down by

passing policeman: However, he escaped to his cat, which was

parkad an an alley, and save up peaceably then arrested by

the polican who was guarding the money display in the bank.

NIGELL TOld STANCA that his robbery of the bank was purely a

suicide nttempt and that he had no intention of robbing the

bank for any monetary gain

In addition to the Communist activities mentioned

shove, Stavria reported that NAGlil told him of a number of

roils of microfilm which contained names, meeting places

and othor activities of the Communist Party, which

pere in his

possession. NAGEll explained that these microfilms were hidden

in a gor mask (lapanese type) which was located

at his sister's

house in New York City.

He went on to say that these micro-

film are bidden in the salve container wich is afixed to the

gus mask.

explained to STANGA that he had not

given this information to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation

because his foit they would indict him as a spy and put him in

jail for life:

On January 6, 1964, the subject furnished the

following signed statenent:

"1/6/64

free and voluntary statement to Edward fosoph Murphy and

that any statement that I do make may be used against me in

a court of law.

They have advised me that I may have an

attorney 1f. I desire.

No threats, promises, force, or

inducements of any kind have been used to get me to furnish.

this statement

"I was born on August 5, 1930 at Greenwich, New York

"The following statement is

relative to the motive

which actuated my conduct on September 20, 1963.

"In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City a

representative of a foreign government proposed to me that I

participate in an act; Such act being

a criminal offense and

inimical to the best interests of the United States

At that

time I refused such proposal. In May, 1963, another representa-

tive of the same foreign government made the same proposal

to me.

At that time I agreed to such a proposal:

"In Sept. 1963, I was informed by an American, known

to me as an agent of the

same foreign government, that arrange

ments for my participation in the aforementioned act were

completed, At this time I refused the aforesaid proposal

"Approximately one week later I was instructed by

this same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be disclosed

to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation

Thereupon I agreed

to follow the instructions of this person, although I did

not intend to do so.

This existing situation actuated ny

conduct of September 20,

1963, for which I was arrested and

an presently charged.

"I did not actually attempt to rob any bank. I

thought that my arrest would provide an immediate,

though

temporary solution

to the problem with which I was confronted

"I am not guilty as charged.

Los Angeles, California,

telephonically advised

a Special Agent of the El

Paso Office of the FBJ that she

was the mother of the subject

and that she' had heard on

the evening before about the bank robbery charge filed

against the subject.

She stated that she last say the subject in August,

1963, at which time subject indicated he wanted nothing to

do with his relatives and no interference with his private life.

She cornented that her son had had a brilliant career"

the military service up until the time of the plane crash

near Washington, D.C. following which he was unconscious

for three weeks in the Walter Reed Mospital In Washington.

Upon his recuperation from

those injuries, he underwent

a complete personality change.

On innuary 34, 1964, the subject was arraigned

Medical Center for Federal Prisoners, Springfield, Missouri,

for a period of 30 days for the purpose of psychiatric

examination. The subject advised the court that he would

not cooperate with the psychiatrists at the Medical Center

for Federal Prisoners at Springfield,

while being removed from the United States District

court House

in El Paso, Toxas, enroute to the El Paso County

Jail on danuary 24, 1964, and while in the custody of the

Deputy United States Marshals, the

subject accused the

Assistant United States Attorney of violating his constitutional:

vights. This accusation was a repetition of numerous accusations

which the subject had previously made against the Assistant

united States Attorney, according to Assistant i. S. Attorney MORTON.

On January 3t, 1964, Assistant United States Attorney

FREDERICK J. MORTON, El Paso, advised that he had received

ixiformation on a confidentlal basis a short while before to

the etfect that there was a man incatcerated in the El Paso

County Jail under a Federal charge of attempted bank robbery

by the name of RICHARD CASE NAGEl who was a

Communist and

sho was about to defect to Russia when arrested.

Mr

HORTON

related that the story was generally that NAGElL, a retired

Amy Coptain who served with distinction in the Korean Mar in

combat and with CIC, became embittered with the United States

and our formot goverment partially due to the alleged denial

of visitation privileges of his children, custody over whot

awarded to his Japanese wife by California divorce decree

He allegedly turned over secret material to soviet agents

while in the Military Service.

He was supposed to obtain

a passport to Russia here in El Paso from a Communist agent

but was so distraught over the possibility of never again

seeing his children that he considered suicide or some other

drastic means of preventing his defecting that he gent in

a bank in El Paso, asked for $100.00 in cashier's cheques,

pulled a gun which caused the teller to run, and fired two

shots high into the wall and fled. At the time of his

arrest, he called the policeman a

capitalistic sob

hns stated that what he did was

done out of "love for

country a

Other than that he has made no statements

concerning the bank robbery except to say that he did not

intend

to take any money.

He has refused to talk to a

psychiatrist and fired two court appointed attorneys. His

court room appearances have convinced all that he is

intelligent and competent mentally but extremely confused

and disturbed.

He files motions and writs almost daily,

which are

well written and lawyer like.

At the time of his arrest, September 20, 1963; a

notebook was taken from him containing what purport to be

various codes, CiA

and FBl agents' nanes, Soviet and otber

Communist embassy addresses

and names, and the addresses

of various other people and organizations, including the.

Los Angeles address of the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee."

NAGELL has supposedly recently received a 1963 Information Please

almanac with a scrambled message. Mention is made of this

in the notebook.

NAGELL is supposed to have located at the address

of his sister, Mrs. ELEANORE GAMBERT, 82-25 Grand Avenue,

Elmburst 73, Long Island, New York, HA 6-6930, a trunk in

which a Japanese gas mask is contained. In the salve box of

this mask are supposedly 4 rolls of microfilm containing

the names of various Communist Party menbers, agents, couriers,

thotr activittes, etc.. A man by

the name of

FRED JOHN (BENIO),

an insurance agent in California, is supposed to get these

things fron NAGElL's sister in the event of NAGELL's death.

The

sister

supposedly knows nothing of the contents and is

not a Communist.

NAGELL recently wrote a letter to this

JOHN in Californta mentioning the almanac bit.

Mr.

MORTON said he rejected an offer of a deal for information

purportedly furnished by NAGELL to the FBT

regarding Communists

in exchange for favorable consideration made through NAGELL'S

prior gourt appointed attorney on the basis that the information

was of no value.

Mr: MORTON's confidential source told him

that NAGELL's prior contacts with the fBI were not revealing

because they were made by him solely to determine what the

FBI knew of him.

the subject advised Special

azents of the El Paso

office of the FBI that "for the record"

ho would like to say that his

association with LEE HARVEY

Texas. NAGElL refused to comment further

regarding this matter.

assassinate the president. The subject stated that the

requests made by prisoners in the El Paso County Jail for

interviers wero at times honored and at other times they were

not.

The ahove interview was conducted with the subject

in response to a request made by this subject to be interviewed

by a Secret Service Agent.

The Secret Service Agent was

introduced to NAGEl and he attempted to interview NAGELL,

however, NAGELL stated

that the information he originally

desired to report to the Secret Service was "too late now."

On January 23, 1964, an Agent of the United States

Secret Service, El Paso, Texas,

advised that an

-.

Agent of

the United States Secret Service in Dallas, Texas, had

displayed a photograph of the subject to Mrs. MARINA OSWALD,

not know anyone by any of those names

On January 24, 1964, while the subject was being

the El Paro County Jail for incarceration

and while in

custody of the Deputy U.S. Marshals, the subject made

wild accusations to

newspaper reporters, arcusing the fBi

of not attempting to prevent the assassination of President

KONNeDY and stating that the fBi had questioned him regarding

LEE HARVEY OSWALD:

These statements were made by the subject

in a shouting manner on the elevator enroute to the El Paso

JOHN resides in a boarding house at 817 South

Catalina Avenue, Los Angeles. He is employed by the Hartford

Insurance Company, 548 South Spring Street, Los Angeles.

He has known RICHARD NAGELL for about one year.

He met him through BILI LYNN of the California Alcoholic

Beverage Controll at The Happy Rabbit.

JOHN does not know

any members of NAGELL's family nor does he know of any other

close friends of NAGELL.

NAGELL left Los Angeles the first of second week of

September, 1963, Just before leaving he told JOHN he would

be traveling and asked him to share his Post Office box so

he could forward on the government disability checks which

he receives monthly.

He also asked JOHN to mail him an almanac

whenever 1t was convenient as he Ilked to refer to the almanac

from time to time as a general source of information:

JOHN

complled with both requests.

Near the end of each month JOHN

has sent the checks to NAGELL at a Post Office box In El Paso,

Texas.

He also sent him an almanac with a yellow cover as he

becalls 1t. JOHN did not mark or alter this almanac in any way.

JOHN recently received a form letter from a hospital

box.

that he is depressed at the manner his ex-wife treated him

and the manner in which the local, state, and Federal governments

have treated him. JOHN definitely considers NAGEld to be mentally

disturbed.

In addition, the subject had in his possession at

the time of his arrest on September 20, 1963, a piece of

paper containing the listing of what appeared to be United

States Army Officers and their serial numbers. One section.

of this paper was listed under the heading "Third Operations

Group".

On March 24, 1964, Lieutenant Colonel NAD W. CLeA

Deputy G-2, United States Army, Japan, advised that he had

known the subject personally and had served in Korea with

the subject.

GLEN! noted that his name appeared in one of

the above mentioned photographs of papers which were found

in the possession of the subject when arrested in El Paso

on September 20, 1963. GLENN stated that he and the subject

had been attached to an Intelligence Branch of the United

States Aruy in the Far East during the period of their acquaintance.

GLENN explained that the names in parentheses in

one of the above mentioned photographs were "code names" used

EP 65-951

by members of Army Intelligence Units in Korea in order to

protect their real identities fron informants.

GLENN also advised that the subject was not

stable mentally and that this instability was probably due

to damage to brain tissues suffered in an airplaue crash

during the Korean War in which the subject was the only

survivor. GLENN stated that the subject, in fact, did have

a brilliant war record, which was the

reason for his

assignment to Army Intelligence in spite of what should

have been an obvious, psychological defect.

GLENN pointed out as an example of the subject's

instability that the subject had turned in allegations

against an Intelligence Officer in Korea, which became the

subject of extensive investigation.

GLENN added that te

subject was subsequently transferred to another Army unit

and upon reporting to that unit, was greeted in a friendly

way by his new Commanding Officer, who told him he hoped

the subject would enjoy his new assignment and that he,

the Commander, would do all he could to make it a worthwhile

tour of duty for the subject.

To this, NAGELL allegedly replied that the Commander

had certainly better see that this was the case as, NAGELI

told him, he made a practice of keeping a record of every.

move made by his Commanding Officer and if he stepped out

of line one; whit at any time, it would be made the subject

of an immediate report to higher headquarters.

GLENN made available; a letter from the Assistant

subject and which contained the following infornstion:

SUBJECT, after graduation from the Aruy Intelligence

School, Fort Holabird, Haryland, in August 1955, served as an

advisor to the First Republic of Korea Army and subsequently

in sendai, and Tolyo, Japan, terminating in about 1958.

these assignments were concerned with intelligence activities,

as an' advisor to the ROK Array in Korea, and as a member of the

US Army Counterintelligence Corps in Japan.

During the

latter tour of duty, the counterintelligence unit was designated

the 35d Operations

Group, with Headquarters in Tokyo and

Detachment B in Sendai,

as referred to in photographic inclosures

to your letter.

In assignents of this nature it is cormon practice

for members to become acquainted with personnel of various

Japanese security agencies, such as are mentioned in March

5 Memorandum of the FBI, El Paso, Tezas. It is not unusual

for individuals assigned counterintelligence duties to retain

lists of these persons for reference in the event they are

again reassigned to the area, or for dispatching cards or

thank you notes fron the United States.

to be the reason for SUBJECT having kept the list of agency

personnel, although to have retained the list for a number of

years after leaving the service appears unusual. The names Kaji,

Wataru and Jack Cannon were known to the public as the results

of allegations of illegal intelligence operations that were

publicized in the Japanese press, but SUBJECT'S reason for

Including those names 1n HIS lists cannot be assessed. Also,

no reason can be given for the two or thice miscellaneous.

names in NAGELL'S file.

The list of Americans mentioned in one of the photographic

attachments pertains to US personnel in the intelligence field.

It appears that the subject maintained a roster of those persons.

with whom he would or had contact, which is aot unusual.

Information contained on those rosters, particularly that

portion indicating code nancs, was and is regarded as classified

information by this office.

Files of the Counterintelligence Repository, USARJ,

disclosed no information relazive to NAGelL or of his aliases.

"Richard Pecteau, Lynn, Mass." is undoubtedly identieal to

Richard George Pectenu who in in prison in Communist China.

Fecteau was taken prisoner by the Communinte during an Agency

operation ia November 1952.

"Mr. F. Parker" may be identical to John Floyd Parker, cur-

rent Agency employee, who wan born 2 January 1898, Louisville,

Kentucky.

"Miss Guthries" may be identical to Frances Agnes Guthrie,

born 29 February 1908, Charlenton, West Virgiala, who is also cur-

rently employed by this Agency.

"Mr. C. Churchill" may be identical to Greighton Churchill

who was bora l October 1912, Cornish, New Hampshire, whose pres-.

ent address 1e not known and whose addreas in 1952 was 27 West 44th

Street, New Tork City.

Joha Floyd Parker and Frances Guthrie have been interviewed

in regard to any knowledge of Nagell but neither individual has any

recollection of having ever met Richard Cane Nagell. Guthrie was em-

ployed by this Agency in Japan in the 1950*s. Greighton Ghurchill and

Joha Floyd Parker were in Japan in 1952 to interview and debrief

United States servicemen who had been held prisoners of war by the

Communists.

In view of the background of Nagell in the Far East. the possi-

bility esdats that Nagell could have obtained the namen of Parker,

Guthrie and Churchill in the approximate 1952 perlod, althoagh a spéci-

fe statement concerning this cannot be made in view of the limited in-

formation concerzing Nagell.

"'Mr. E. Lelbacher"' and'Mr, Da Vanon" are believed to refer to

Ernst Leibacker and Joseph Frances Davanon of the Los Angeles Field

Office of thie Agency. Your Loe Angeles Fleld Office has been previ-

ouely aware that Leibacker and Davanon bave no personal knowledge of

Nagell, There la no tecord of any past interest is Nagell by tbie

Agency.

"J. Sloss" may refer to John Richard Slose who was bora 24 Sep-

tember 1919, Cleveland, Ohlo and te currently employed in Head-

regard to any knowledge of Nagell and has advised that he has no

recollection of having met any individual by that name.

If John

Richard Slosa in identical to "J. Slone," it is not possible from

available information to even speculate as to how the name came

into the possession of Nagell.

In view of the fact that Richard George Fecteau i currently

in prison in China and the indication that the other six namen listed

above may refer to Agency employees, it is requested that the

above information not be disseminated outalde your Bureau.

does not appear that the above information could affect either the

prosecution of or the defense of Nagell on the charge of bank rob-

bery, and disclosure of the above information could create a later

cover problem for this Agency, as well an directing additional at-

tention to the position of Fecteau.

It would be appreciated if your Bureau would advise this

Agency of any information brought to your attention concerning how

the above names came into the possession of Nagell.

JIFLOYD PARKER

TE ExT 7876

CREIGHTON CHURCHILL #9657

It was good to hear from you, to learn

you are still at the old shop; etc.

I got your letter yesterday in New York,

and while driving the 300-odd miles hoped that my

subconscious would perhaps come out with a peal of

a bell regarding an individual named Ed Nagell. But

no bellsrang.

I have only a small hunch -- a piccolo-toot

in my memory. When I worked for the shop I once went

to see Mr. James Bennett, Director of Federal Prisons,

( with whom I had once shared a table on an ocean

liner, years before). You can guess why I ranted to

see Bennett: I was seeking ways for birds to fly out

of cages.

Bennett mentioned a guy (with a questionable

record,

as far as he was

concerned who claimed to

know us, you and me, what we were doing., etc. etc.

He had

aproached Bennett " as from us".

Ed Nagell

-- the name -- rings a piccolo-toot on this, but only

that.

Incidentally, I filed a report on the incident

when I got back to the shop.

I am often in New York -- at the Harvard

Club -- and should you ever be in town, give me

a ring.

It would be fun to see you.

I met Harry Osterweis in

a restaurant the other day - fater some many, many

years. You may remember him.

I have recently become an author on Wines.

After a year in France in 1959, I wrote a book on French

wines which

was published by Knopf, and

Become an author an

am about to bring

out one on wines of the world with MacMillan in September.

That is about the extent of my news.

My best to you.

Asked FBI in Miami if his Cuban or Russian sources

gave him a pistol with silencer and microfilm if he

would be permitted to return same to his contact so

he could be of further use to U.S. Government.

stated that in August or September 1962 he met a man

from Maryland in Mexico City who introduced him to

individuals whom he believed may have been Soviet Agent.

Advised FBI in Los Angeles, California, that he had

taken his former wife to court for failure to comply with

court order giving NAGELL visitation rights with children.

NAGELL appeared at the Out Patient Clinic and was re-

ferred to the Neurological Clinic for treatment. His

condition was diagnosed as'depression, tearful, nervous,

rigid".. Would only utter words "Got to see my kids".

NAGELL arrested in El Paso, Texas, on charge of at-

tempting to rob State National Bank.

Slashed wrist night

of 9/20/63. NAGELL consistently denied he had tried

to rob the bank; stated that the fact that he fired two shots

in the ceiling proved he had not been trying to hit anyone.

He stated that he was certain that "all of my problems have

been solved for a long time, and now I won't have to go to

Cuba"

A notebook which the Subject had on his person when ar-

rested made reference to Fair Play for Cuba Committee,

the names of purported CIA agents and other information.

Cell mate in jail reported that NAGELL disclosed to him

that NAGELL, during confused period after discharge,

decided everything against him in Los Angeles and made

arrangements with Communist Party in Los Angeles to

pick up visa and passport from contact in El Paso and

eventually end up in Czechoslovakia. NAGELL reportedly

attempted suicide three times enroute to El Passo but

lost nerve.

(Noteworthy that State Department records reflect issuance

of Passport to NAGELL on 7 August 1962 at Los Angeles,

California, and that on 9 July 1963 NAGELL signed affi-

davit that his passport had been lost or stolen. He was

issued a new passport on 6 August 1963.)

El Paso Herald-Post article states that NAGELL told

U.S. District Court that he did not attempt to hold up

the bank. "I had a motive for doing what I did" NAGELL

told Judge, "but my motive was not to hold up the bank.

I do not intend to disclose my motive at this time."

Subsequent to President's assassination, Subject claimed

acquaintance with OSWALD and wife. Marina OSWALD

on 1/18/65 disclaimed any knowledgé of NAGELL.

NAGELL furnished a signed statement:

"... In September 1962, while I was in Mexico City,a

representative of a foreign government preposed to me

that I participate in an act; such act being a criminal

offense and inimical to the best interest of the United

States. At that time, I refused such proposal. In May

1963, another representative of the same foreign govern-

ment made the same proposal to me. At that time, I

agreed to such a proposal."

"In September 1963, I was informed by an American,

known to me as an Agent of the same foreign government,

that arrangements for my participation in the aforementioned

act were completed. At that time, I refused the aforesaid

proposal.

Approximately one week later, I was instructed by this

same person to either participate as previously agreed

or derrogatory information pertaining to me would be

disclosed to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. There-

upon, I agreed to follow the instructions of this person;

although I did not intend to do so. This existing situation

actuated my conduct of September 20, 1963, for which I

was arrested and am presently charged.

I did not actually attempt to fob any bank. "I thought that

my arrest would provide an immediate, though temporary,

solution to the problem with which I was confronted.

I am not guilty as charged. "

NAGELL arraigned in connection with indictment for

bank robbery and was committed for 30 days for the

purpose of psychiatric examination.

Sentenced in U.S. District Court, El Paso, Texas to

serve 10 years.

NAGELL swallowed several sleeping pills while lodged

at the El Paso County Jail.

Room 1E520, The Pentagon

Washington, D.C•

Dear

Mr. Plant:

In further reference to my letter from Switzerland: During our conver-

sation of 6 April you made it clear that I must step back into tine and prove

the existence of a condition over ten years ago that could and should have

been resolved by the Army then . :.

afeat that is all the nore complicated

by the ABCMR's refusal to interview the appropriate witnesses, vicw certain

pertinent records and to place the blame for my not receiving an adequate

medical examination where it belongs.

I believe what you really neant to say was that in my particular case

(as opposed

to others much less valid) the function of the Board to correct

an injustice does not apply.

So if this

assumption is fact,

as I have every reason to feel it is, then

you lay pass on to the Secretary that before my case is closed the Army will be

confronted with a scandal that will make France's Dreyius affair seem inconse-

quential by comparison.

I am not quite the fool that apparently I have been

taken for.

Very truly;

Ichard C: Vasilt
