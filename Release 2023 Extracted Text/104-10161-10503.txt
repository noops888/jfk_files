8. SON IS MOST FRIENDLY AND CORDIAL AND AWARE OF NEED FOR
DISCRETION AND SECRECY. ENVISION NO SECURITY PROBLEM FROM SON,
WHO FROM ALL EVIDENCE IS PROUD OF HIS FATHER'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH RTACTION AND IS QUITE WILLING TO BE HELPFUL WHERE HE CAN.

PARA 4 REF, $1,086.00 WAS FOR JULY, AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER SAFEHOUSE
RENT AND $131.44 WAS FOR AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER FURNUTURE RENTAL
WHICH C/88 HAD (ACCORDING TO APT MANAGER) PAID BUT FOR WHICH HE
HAD NOT YET SUBMITTED RECEIPTS TO BADENDICK. DELAY WAS DUE TO
INFREQUENCY OF SUMMER OPS MEETINGS AND C/88'S PLEADING MILD FLU
ATTACK ON ONE OCCASION AS REASON FOR NOT HAVING ACCOUNTING READY.
WOULD NOTE FURTHER THAT BADENDICK CONTINUALLY AND CONSISTENTLY
TOOK INTO ACCOUNT C/88'S HEALTH PROBLEM AND TOOK CARE ALWAYS
