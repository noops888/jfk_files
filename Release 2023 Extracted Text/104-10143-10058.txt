1. (Secret - PG) LIAISON Together with June Elliott, EA/JK,
and John Walker, O/SA/DO/O, met with Michael J. Hershman, Deputy
Staff Director, Subcommittee on International Organizations, House
International Relations Committee, as scheduled. We covered
Mr. Hershman's agenda completely and I had a private chat with
him concerning the security situation in the Subcommittee. (See
Memorandum for the Record.)
2. (Secret - PG) THIRD AGENCY Exchanged several telephone
calls with Danny Coulson, FBI, concerning the current status of NUMEC
in the Department of Justice. Mr. Coulson reported the situation in the
FBI and referred me to a Department of Justice official for a status
report. I thanked him for his assistance. Mr. Coulson also informed
me that Mr. John Hotis had replaced Paul Daly, in the Office of
Legislative Affairs, FBI. We made an arrangement for Mr. Hotis
and Mr. Coulson to have lunch here on 10 November.
3. (Internal Use Only - PG) LIAISON Received a telephone
call from Victor Kramer, Special Counsel, Senate Select Committee
on Ethics, who indicated a desire to get back together promptly with
regard to a Memorandum of Understanding and Nondisclosure Agreement.
I offered to see him on the morning of 28 October and he was pleased.
4. (Secret - PG) THIRD AGENCY At the suggestion of Danny
Coulson, FBI, I telephoned Erich Richard, of the Justice Department,
to inquire as to any investigation the Department of Justice might have
underway concerning NUMEC. Mr. Richard advised me that it is his
understanding that NUMEC is still an "open case."

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Staff Director, House Select Committee on

5. (Secret - PG) LIAISON Received a telephone call from
Peter Stockton, on the staff of the Subcommittee on Energy and Power,
House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. Mr. Stockton
wished to inquire as to whether we had received and understood a recent
letter on NUMEC from Chairman John D. Dingell (D., Mich.). I told
him that I had and informed him of the arrangements we projected for
briefings. There ensued a long discussion as to Mr. Stockton's
preferences for the mode of briefing, which I informed him I could not
guarantee. It was left that I would check with the appropriate CIA
element, and inform Mr. Stockton of the results when I had them.
6. (Confidential - DTC) LIAISON Talked to G. Robert Blakey,
Chief Counsel, and Staff Director, House Select Committee on
Assassinations, to make arrangements for staff personnel to review
certain DDO documents here at Headquarters on 30 October.
