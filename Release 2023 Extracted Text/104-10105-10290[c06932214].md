MEMORANDUM FOR: Acting General Counsel

SUBJECT:

Mr. Eo Howard Hunt • Alias Birth Certificate

1. On 30 October 1973 I saw Mr. John S. Warner, Acting

General Counsel, to discuss two outstanding requests from the Special

Prosecutor's office in regard to U.S. passports which had been issued

to E. Howard Hunt and a MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD on Mr.

Robert Bennett's session with the U.S. Prosecutor Silbert in July 1972.

I handed Mr. Warner a memorandum listing the type, number and dates

of the 2 passports which Mr. Hunt was issued between 1950 and 1970.

In reviewing the information in this memorandum, I mentioned Mr. Hunt's

tour in Spain in the middle 1960's and the fact that I had been instructed

not to include Mr. Hunt and his activities in my inspection of the Madrid

Station in 1965. I also mentioned to Mr. Warner that I remembered two

discussions with Mr. Skip Dunn late in 1972 during which he inquired of

me whether CIA had ever issued an alias passport to Mr. Hunt. I said

that as I recalled, CIA did not initiate the issuance of a U.S. alias passport,

but that Mr. Hunt did have in his possession an alias travel document.

This came as a surprise to Mr. Warner. He had not been previously

aware that Mr. Hunt possessed a U.S. international travel document in

alias. As a result he called Mr. John Richards, Office of the IG, and

asked whether Mr. Richards was aware of this and whether Mr. Dunn's

reports provided this information. After an interval, Mr. Richards

called back and told Mr. Warner that I had provided information to Mr.

Dunn that Mr. Hunt had a tourist card in alias. According to Mr. Richards,

Mr. Dunn's memorandum quoted me as saying that my information came

from an" A I source." At that moment, I could not recall having made

such a statement.

2. Upon my return from Mr. Warner's office, I consulted with

Mr. James W. Franklin, Chief, Official Cover Branch, CCS, with whom

I had discussed Mr. Dunn's inquiry in late 1972. I asked Mr. Franklin

whether he could refresh my memory. This he did immediately. He

reminded me that a newspaper article (Tab A) had appeared claiming

that one of the Watergate 5 had carried a U.S. passport in the name of

Edward Hamilton. This newspaper article had been seen by Mr. Robert

Johnson, Deputy Director of the U.S. Passport Office, who had had the

U.S. Passport Office files examined with negative results. Mr. Johnson

then determined from the FBI that the document involved was not a U.S.

passport in the name of Edward Hamilton but a tourist card in that name.

I then remembered that because the information came from the FBI via

Mr. Johnson, I had not identified the source of my information. I

immediately called Mr. Warner and advised him of the foregoing.

3. Later in the afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin

came to my office with a number of documents. They consisted of a form

memorandum signed by me which was addressed to Mr. Hunt dated 29 June

1970 (Tab B), a list of names numbering from 1 through 154, representing

true names (Tab C), and a second listing similarly numbered, representing

aliases (Tab D). Number 63 on the true name list reads E. Howard Hunt

and on the alias list, Edward Joseph Hamilton. Mr. Franklin explained

which I had forgotten - that we had obtained from TSD this list of outstanding

alias birth certificates issued by TSD in an attempt to recall if possible

as many of these documents, or to determine what had happened to them.

(Most of these alias birth certificates were issued in connection with the

Bay of Pigs Operation.) The memorandum was never forwarded to Mr. Hunt

because by June 1970, he had been retired for 3 months. This memorandum

had not been included in Mr. Hunt's cover file but had been kept with the

working papers pertaining to the action trying to recall as many of the

outstanding alias birth certificates as possible. As a result, the repeated

reviews of Mr. Hunt's cover file had not yielded the information that an

alias birth certificate had been issued to him. 97 of the 154 aliases were

not previously recorded in the CCS central index and the indexing after the

acquisition of the list had been overlooked. The surfacing of these documents

at this time occurred because in re discussing Mr. Hunt's possession of an

international travel document in alias reminded Mr. Franklin of the 1970 CCS

exercise of recouping outstanding alias birth certificates. Discussions on the

same subject in December 1972 simply did not result in the same memory

4. In the late afternoon of 30 October 1973 Mr. Franklin and

I saw Mr. Warner, reported the foregoing facts to him, showed him

the documents, and agreed that we would ask Mr. Johnson to check

the Passport Office files once more to confirm that no U.S. passport

in the name of Edward Joseph Hamilton had ever been issued to Mr.

Hunt. The result of Mr. Johnson's check is still outstanding at the

time of this writing.
