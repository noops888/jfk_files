Hould you please let us have a renewal request by l January 1968.

2. LIENVOY wag. estimated at $57,000 In our recent FY 1968

program exercise, so we must ask that you stay within this figure

in the rencwal.

If you o1ll be necding replacements for equipment

for the LP, would it be possible to reallocate funds previously

budgeted for LISALAD and for "purchase of information" to cover

the

cost of such procurement?

3.

Beadquarters appreciates the carefully detailed renowals

which you prepare on LIENVOY because they give such a good picture of

what the project produces.

Could you also include in the current

renewal a brief description of the center and the equipment and

how the management of the daily routine is shared betreen AREHAKT

and big Mexican collcagues?

PROJECT BRIEFING

PROJECT: LIENVOY

WH - Mexico

ACTION : ADD/P approval of renewal

1 Feb 67 - 31 Jan 68

PURPOSE: Project supports a joint CIA-Muxican Government telephone

tay unit and a non-official liaison relationship with access to

the highest ranking Mexican officials.

PROGRESS: During the past year covered a total of 30 telephone linea :

simultancously providing 8, 6tt reels of raw take. Of the 30

lines, at least 15 of them are exclusively for Station targets

and the remaining targets are chosen by the Mexican authoritieg.:

but are usually of interent to the Station. Station targets include

the Cuban Embassy, the Soviet Embassy, Czuch Embassy,

Polish Embassy and the New China News Agency.

FI/INT files contain 107 positive intelligence reports produced

during the review period. This production, although unavoidably

uneven in quality and coverage, included a considerable amount

of useful information relevant to priority needs of the community.

LIENVOY coverage of Cuban and Soviet installationg has been

of particular uscfulness as a check on Station operations. A

set ol voice samples of Soviot ufficials hay been collected which

assists the identification of unidentified speakers elsewhere.

The channel established to the President of Mexico has been

used to promote a close personal rapport between the President

and Chester D. DAINOLD (p) and in consequence closer co-

operation between the Government of Mexico and the U.S.

Government and CIA in particular.

The Station appears to be fully aware of this problem

and is maintaining tight security discipline.

Project LIENVOY -- Renewal Feriod 1 February 1937 - 31 January 1963

Comments and Recommendations (To be forwarded to the Division)

1. Our files contain 107 positive intelligence reports praisced wholly

or in part by LIENVOY and disseminated in the period 1 February 1060 - 31

January 1907.

Over half of this production (60 reports) dealt with pians and

activities of Mexican Communists and other leftists. Included were 17

reports which provided useful information on the unrest at the National

Autonomous University. (UNAv) and other universities. As our recent

study of reporting on Mexico indicates, student unrest has been a subject

of high interest to the community. Also included were 13 disseminations

which contributed to the station's coverage, highly praised by ail customers,

of leftist activities in connection with President Johnson's visit. The other

30 reports in this group, primarily concorning the FOM, MLN, and DPS,

varied considerably in quality but in general appeared to be oi minderate

value in relation to customer needs.

2. The disseminated production from foreign Communist instailations

was relatively meager. There were 9 reports on relations with the soviets,

mostly on cultural programs; 3 reports on commercial negotiations with

Czechoslovakia and Foland; 7 reports concerned with Cuba; and 5 reports

on Chicom (NCNA) activities in Mexico.

With the possible exception of

information on Mexican-Bloc trade -- a subject of much interest to ORR --

the LIENVOY coverage of official Communist installations did not provide

positive intelligence of any great signiricance. Motaily lacking was niorma-

tion on ioreign subversive efforts against Mexico, for which customers lave

expressed an urgent need.

3. The rest of the production for the perioi included the follering:

9 reports concerning Guatemalan exile activity, nich appeare to ce of

value: 9 reports on activities of the press secretary of the Presidercia which

contributed to covcrage of the government's pians and activities -- an area

on which the community has a high priority need for information; and one

report concerning initiatives for a Vicuamese peace which was disseminated

as an Intelligence Information Special Report to ine Director.

also 4 reports on right-wing Sinarchist activity, a subject of relatively

little interest to customers.

%.. In summary, the positive intelligence production as a wiole,

thour: imavoidably teren in is quality and coverage, included a considerable

amow: ot useful informaton relevant to priority needs of the cominunity.

While this disseminata: produc: t itself would hardly justify the total cost

of the project,

we assume that a substantial portion oi the cost is warranted

for purposes other ther collecdon of positive intormation. Consequently

FI/INT/RE recommenas renewal.

MEMORANDUM: FOR:

SUBJECT

Deputy Director for Plans

Renewal of the LIENVOY Project

l:..-

Renewal is requested of the LIENVOY Project

for the period 1 February

1967

through 31 January

1968

for a total of $57,100, with $22,170 for FY

1967

and $34,630 for FY 1968.

The LIENVOY Projuct

was included in the 1967 Operational Program for-

$50,000 .

The additional funds requlred for FY

1967 are available within ll Division.

The LIENVOY Project covers both access to

high lovel Mexican Government officials, including

the President,

and a joint telephone tap operation

run in cooperation with the Office

of the President.

3.

The phone taps produce FI, CE, and operational

support information.

According to

Headquarters

records, during the period 1 February through 31

December 1966, LIENVOY was the source of ninety-eight

positive intelligence reports, seventy-nine of which

were disseminated.

These reports covered the follow-

ing general subject categories:

Soviet Embassy

activities in Mexico,

Mexican Communist Party activi-

ties, Communist front activities,

the activities of

the Chicom representatives in Mexico, and the

activities

of various

extremist groups.

Included in

this reporting was that prior to and during President

Johnson's trip

to Mexico City in April 1966.

The

Station's reporting on this trip, which included

LIENVOY, was highly praised by the customers.

LIENVOY

also provided some good coverage during

the trouble

at the National Autonorious

University (UNAM) in the

spring and useful information during disturbances at

some of the other universities.

The remainder of the

LIENVOY coverage couid be considered of medium-level

interest and value.

During the

same period, LIENVOY

provided inforcation

for ten ch disseminations

the

to

FBI on Americans in contact with the Soviet

and Cuban Embassies in Mexico.

1.

LIENTOY coverage, particularly of the Cuban

and Soviet installations, was

usciul as a check on

the Station's operations.

It furnished information

on double, agents directed against the Soviets,

instance, and on several agents in contact with the

• Cuban Embassy. LIENVOY also identified leads into

some of whom have since been recruited

agents.

(e.g. LIROAN and the LIROBBIN's)

Another example of the

usefulness of LIENTOY Is the

set of voice sauples of Soviet officials

which has

been collected and

which permits the identification

of unidentified speakers on other coverage. For

examplc,

recenti; in LIFEAT a man speaking with

Suzic PIERRE Charles, a Haitian Communist. was

identified is Vladinir Ivanovich SHPAKEVICH (KGB).

LIENVOY is also the principal source of information

on the travel of Soviets within Mexico and abroad.

The Station has a standing roquirement for informing

the Office of the Legal Attache in Mexico of all

travel performed by Soviet officials within the

Republic of Merico, and LIENVOY helps the Station

to fulfill this request.

5.

LIFEAT. the unilateral telephone tap

operation, concentrates on individual Soviets, Cubans,

Communists, and Americans who are of special WUFACT

CE interest.

The channel established to the President of

Mexico through LIENOY permits direct contact by the

Chief of Station.

While there is also a channel

through the LITEUPO Project, the President and the

Station arê both careful to

selcct the proper channel

which depends on nether there is in anticipated ned

for the cooperation of the LITEMPO Ministry, or

whether the contact and problem should rerain a matter

of concern only to the President and his special

principal use of the LIENVOY liaison channel during

the past jear has been in the political action fiold.

Chester D. DAINOLD contributed greatly to this effort

with his briefing of the Nextean President.

The

oriefings, held in December 1966, resulted in an

agreement:

Uy the President to accept a Panamanian

politician to study the Mexican Political Party (PRI)

in the hope that Panama might benefit by PRI experience

in gaining political stability.

lopefully through the

use of a controlled ClA agent, the Agency will also

benefit by obtaining information on the organization

and inner workings.of the PRI which has not been

available through other sources.

The President

offered to send an expericneed educator to Panama

to

review the situation at the University since DAINOLD

expressed concern about the problems gnawing at the

University of Panama.

7.

The President of Morico has also used his

special LIENVOY channel to the Chief of Station to

obtain advice on personal and communications

security, and on the purchase of technical equipment.

The Station, on the other hand,

has used this special

channel to pass to the President background informa-

tion on Soviets and subversives in Mexico on whom

the lexicans expressed an interest, and against whom

we hoped the Mexicans would take some action.

One

memorandun resulted in the cancellation of a foreign

diplomatic

assignnent of a Mexican career diplomat

who is a suspect

Soviet agent.

8. It is believed that the close personal

rapport established between the President and DAINOLD

Station has contributed to better

relations and closer cooperation botween Mexico and

the U.S. Government and

CIA in particular.

Division recommends renewal of the LIENVOY Project.

PROJECT LINVOY RENENAL

A. CURRINT OBJECTIVES

The LIENVOY Projoct provides for a joint WOrACT-Mexican Goverrment sponsored

telephone tap unit and for a non-official liaison relationship with access

to the highest ranking governient officials of Mexico.

The tap unit

provides direct support necessary to cover targets and operational programs

levied on the Mexico Station via the RMD as bell as spot requests from

Besdquarters and other Stations. This projoct also produces considerable

positivo intelligence.

B. CHANGES

(1) The LIENVOY Project vas created in late 1958 and put into operation in early

1959 at the request of LITENSOR who appointed LIELIGANI as his special

assistant to vork with Willard C. CUrTIS in the supervision and administration

of the projoct.

In n1d-1964 1t becane evident that LIRAMA would replace

LITENSOR 1n December 1964. (LIRAMA Las then LITEMPO-2 and a clandestine

Haison contact with Willani C. CURTIS under the LITEMPO Project but was not

laosiledgeable of the CURTIS/LISLELANT/LITEN3OR relationship in Project

LTENVOY.) On 10 Mugust 1964 LIRAMA net with CURTIS and LIBLEGANT and advised

then that LIPENSOR had briefed him on the LINVOY Project in detail and

that it should be continued with the same personnel and the same nanner of

operation.

Both LIELEGANT and LIBNVOY-2 were given nominal positiong on

LIRAMA '3 stafe with

cover for dally contact with LIRAMA.

Government

credentiala were also provided for Arold P. ARBIART (Staff Agent) as vell

as the local agents working in the Li.

Since March 1960, the LP has renained

in tho same location.. Inside the frot doorway a credential, provided by

LIRANA, prohibits entry to anyone without special pernission obtained frou

LIRANA..

(2) Agents

Por information of reviewing officials not familiar with this Project,

there 18 enclosed as Attachment-1, a chart listing current LIENVOY targets

as well as the functions of each agent. Two changes during the past project

joar can be noted: (a) LIENVOY-8: was rabired as a monitor by LIENVOY-2

at the request of LIRAMA and with the egreement of CURTIS. The request was

alsó made for reactivation of his Operational Approval by the Station: and

(b) LIENVOY-19 tas given tratning li July 1966 in flaps and seals and sot

up the LISALAD unit at the request si Lirama.

Start' Agent Arnold P, AREHARi has bean with the project for seven years.

His duties inside the liP are to maintein the technical equipment and

protect HOPACT interest by observing activities of locel agents and preventing

negligent breakage or loss from thef". There has been no major mechanical

breakdown during the past project year. ARDHARI also 18 there to see that

desired. The equipment in this lP has run over thirty-five thousand hours

since installation and is still in excellent candition, due to the excellent

care and maintenance by ARSMART.

C.

INTELLIGENCE PRODUSTION

Tue LIENVOY project has proved a valuable source for positive intelligenco

on Mexican political figures on Cornisa and on activities of foreign

cause of the heavy. workload in the telephone tap LP.

Thoro are 30 lines

This monitoring

1s only to determine tha importance of the call and in order to make

and action can be taken by the Station or the Mexicans with no time

Ing. Secondly, It makas the work of the transcribers much easier.

They must process all the taros overnight so that a briefing paper 1s

value received the previous day through the telephone intercepts.

The

Station has rehired Lnsivur-8 at a salary of $240/monch. This le the

of lot when the President of Mexico decided that he neried

accees to a letter intercept proerm which would give him better

results than be hed ireriously gotten through ClA'S LEIGH LAn

Program. (The LIMUD irogram is essentially a unilateral ClA operstion,

but LIRAliA hed adoptod the prectice of giving Ilnlur-2 several espes

of persons whose nail he wished perschally to recolve). Theresire, in

Jine the President devignated LutiiVOY-2 and hiG father, LIELDiAN, to

establich a new intercept program.

The Fresident authorized the Misister

of Communications to cooperate with HELDaLT in this endearer.

In fre-

paration for institutine, actual nail coverne LLELEGANT selested an

individual to conduct a thorough study of the Mexican postal sisten.

to be a U.S. citizen,

the transcripta are prepared imediately which

frequently permits the Station to arrange for unilateral surreillance

and identification of the persons involved.

The Coumercial Office

coverage provides infomation on Cuban Commercial activities in Mexico

and Identification of firms doing tusiness with Cuba.

: Project LIEVVOY

The LIENVOY Project is submitted for renewal in the

including President DIAZ Ordas.

The telephone tap operation

is extronely complex, involring four outside case officers

G. URAUHARI (ps), presently 1a Mexico on temporary duty has

provided the Station with the sollowing evcluation of the LENVOY

prodüct:

"The LIENVOY production on the Cuban Embassy traific in

Mexico. City hes

been one of the basic elements contributing to the

success of the AMROD operatlor, airected ageins: the tIS for CA

purposes.

Tre WIENVOY operation has been of value in two general

senses:

Ine documentary material derived then the texts has

foracd

needed for the operation.

b.

The day to day coverage has enabica

the case officer on the AMROD operatior to corse the climate inside

the target,

to keep track of the novenents of key opposition personnel,

to check on the bona fides oi certain egents, to check the work of .

others for veracity and to live monitor portions of the reactions

to the A•ROD operation itcclf. Beire able to keep track of the

chifts and moverents of the opposition and their personal relations

has been of vital importance to this operation. On two occasiors

the AMROD Case Officer also used the LIEVOY base as his command

post when engineering personal contacts between a KUBARK staffer

and the opposition.

This type of close support did muct. to deterine

the success of thosc mectings and contributed grently to the success

of the operation.

These transcripts provide one of the best sounding

boards for the AMROD operation and are regularly forwarded to ne at

Headquarters."

The six lines above are filij transcribed by LIEVOY transcribers

and delivered by AREMART to RIGGS each morning.

Lengthy conversa-

tions sometines require an additionai. day for transcription. A

carbon copy is pouched weekly to Heeiquarters for WH/SA use. The

orlainal is retained by the lexico Stallon. A third copy 10 rotalaca

these transcripts unless some sinificant item appears in the
