MEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Liaison Meeting with FBI Yew York Agent Frank O'Brien

At 1500 hours on 13 September, Ken Millian and I

net with FBI Cuban specialist Frank O'Brien at d cafe!coffee

shop at 72ad St.

and 3rd Ave., two blocks away from the Bu-

reau's Nex York headquarters.

I had arranged the meeting by

telephone from Washington.and advised C'Bricn-that i wanted

to revien and coordinate a number of items with him... I also.

inforned tin that I would bé accompanied by Millian, a col-

leazue interested in the Cuban. UN Mission.

2.

The neeting opened at an easy pace with an uninhib-

ited

revier of happenings of mutual interest: 'Brien noted

that

• In his view the cubans at the Mission had been relative murt:.

ly inactive and had not recently been involved in sutversive

activities of any sagnitude.

He reiientd FBI coverage of as

yet not mily explained purchasing activity by Mission per-

sonnel which included procurement fron various Ned York area

Che's

military surplus cutlets of parchos, lezgings, and other.

similar equipment.

He implied that in the process of cover-

ing the activities, the Bureau had acquired a substantial

tre.

amount of surplus

equipment itsels but he diin't provide de-

rails and ve didn't pursue the matter.

30

He noted that blanket Bureau coversge of the activ-

ities of Roiando Masferrer was continuing and that he occa-

sionally talked with Masferrer by telephone or in person.

He indicated that the Bureau was intinately aware of efforts

on the part of Masferter and other Cubans both in New York

and Florida tO procure aris in the U.s.

and position then it.

se repseted that an attenpt to sove

a shipment of such aras from the florida Keys ¿o the d.r..

cursently was underway and that the U.S. Custons Service was

alerted to move in at the appropriate time to confiscate the

material.

(Although acknouledging Hasferrer's gargster back-

ground, d'brien complemented him on his intelligence aná eí-

ficiency and indicated that Masferrer was one ef the ablest

Cuban refagees he haủ net.)

The two principal action items on my agenda were

the coordination of my planned luncheon neeting with photo-

journalist Lee J. Lockhood (201-78771), and discussion of

NEKNIFE, who allegedly was interviened by the Bureau in New

York several years ago:

D'Brien advised ue that he had re-

viened their Lockwood file and talked with the Bureau agent

responsible for the Lockwood "case".. He stated that he had

not uncovered any derogatory information on Lockwood and saw

no reason to prevent my meeting with him.

I told him I would

advise him of my meeting arrangements with Lockrood when they

were firm and that I would brief him after the meeting was

(It is of interest to note that during my briefing

of O'Brien on the morning

of the loth, the day folloning my

luncheon with Lockwood, O'Brien noted that some of his supe-

slors in Mashingion thought Lockwood was an opposition (sic)

8s Ambassador, were discussed and itineraries of Cutans ar-

rivirg for the reneral Assembly were noted. Eariy in the

conversation, d'Brien surfaced his long tern contact with

Cuban UN Advisor and Alternate Renresentative Antonio de Souza

Carvajal (201-354048), a friend of Cutan Foreign Minister

Raul Roa, who has served the Cubans in New York for the past

ten years of sore and has been with the Cuban Foreign Set-

The souza subject was not new to me, since

earlier this year.

Implications of the case with Agency officials in hashington.

D'Brien indicated no interest in Miguel Juan Alfonso Martinez

(201-354041), Counselor at the Missionr thom ve suspected

they night be in contact sita.

9.

D'Brien's eagerness to discuss the Souza matter

seens to imply that he is deeply interested in it and may

suggest that he is not satisfied with results thus far ob

tained.

It one point he indicated that his headquarters was

not at all happy with the take frcm Souza.

He reviewed she

history of the contact with complete candor beginning with

his initial contacts with Souza in the mid/late 195C's when

O'Brien had open access to the liban "ission. in iex York

and ras a trequent visitor there.

Fron his description, Souza

would appear to be a thoroughly experienced and skilled

dipionat who has survived the numerous changes in the Cuban

overment because of his friendship with Roa and other in

fluential Cubans.

and

because of his ability to isplenent

affectively for the Cubans the more suotle diplonatic maneu-

vets required by

seabership in the UN community. In fact,

O'Brien feels thet the cubans utilize Souza exclusively on

these latter duties and tend to exclude him fros high level

nattess inyclyina polizical, military, or econosic policy.

This, according to O'Brien, accounts for Souza's inability

to provide information of

real value.

O'Brieu did indicate,

however for example,

that the usual P.I.

requirenents had no punch.

cited,

the requirements after Souza's retur

fron Hawaii, which

in effect amounted to: What's new?

10.

Despite the long history of the Souza contact,

@'Brien is not now meeting with Souza

in person.

Souza feels

that O'Brien is too well known in the Cuban community in

New York and

even the most elaborate contact arrangements

would not be free of danger.

Souza also shys away from talke

ing un his home phone for fear that it may be tapped.

O'B=ien

'an, however, telephone Souza and lay on altestate telephone

• even meeting arrangements. We did not establish che fre

quency of O'Brien's current contacts with Souza nor did we

establish at what point in the history of the contact the

decision was made to dispense with personal meetings; the.

nature of our meeting with O'Brien did not permit elaborate

and detailed questioning. He did recount, however, an in

teresting aspect of the case which followed fron the fact

that a State Department security officer assigned to Nen York,

(Inu). swazey, occupied the apartment directly above souza

uring his tour in New York and becane quite friendly with

SoUza.

O'Brien apparently used Swazey as an isformal

до-

betweet on the case.

(Should we choose to pursue the Souza

lead, an atteapt perhaps should be made to locate and debrief

Swazey with O'Brien's concurrence. Note: This could be

Anthony Clinton Suezey, DOB 9 August 1913, who was Special

Assistant to Secretary General of U.S. Mission to UN 1946 to

1947. In 1963 lie was First Secretary, FSO-Z, in Paris.)

11. It is difficult at this point to identify with ac-

CUraCY

the true nature of O'Brien's tie with souza.

Based

upon O'Brien's coments, it does not appear that Souza should

be classified as an

"agent" of the Bureau in the classical

sense, particularly at this point when there apparently are

s0 formal arrangements for contact, lo remuneration or even

lastructions given,

and apparently

no reports received fron

80028.

It is probable that a critical point in this opesa-

tion was reached about three years azo when, according to

Оʼвтіст,

retirement equities with the cuban governaent, and his

nancial needs in general.

O'Brien thought that Souza was

looking for guarantees which would provide for his future

should he choose to cooperate fully and ultinately be sur-

faced and forced to forego his retirenent and remain in the

U.S.

O'Brien apparently presented Souza's case to his supe

810ss but was unable to generate any substantial enthusiasa.

He stated they were not willing to five souza a stipend.

The

Bureau's position, both then and now, apparently is that

Souza has little potential as an asset for internal security

natters and therefore would not justify any substantial fi

nancial obligation.

In very low key, it was made clear to

O'Brien that the Agency was interested in Souza's Positive

Intelligence potential (his access in Havana should be good,

given his long friendship with Roa

and his closeness to

Maria Celia Girona Fernández (201-327421),

cousin of Celia

Sanchez Mandsley) and well might find justification for pro-

viding modest security for Souza's old age.

12. Throughout our

conversation it appeared clear that

O'Brien was of the opinion that there say

be a role for the

Agency in the Souza operation.

lie asked nim, therefore,

whether or not he felt: Souza may still be interested in

feath-

ering his nest and,. if so, if it would be bureaucratically

possible to get word to Souza that such a possibility existed.

O'Brien felt that Souza would still be interested and he

was of the opinion that he could get the point across. to.

souza via double talk in a telephone conversation.

This ap-

proach was accepted and it was agreed that O'Brien would

rise us. of the results after the call vas

made.

ad-

If prospects

appeared encouraging, it was agreed that we would then get

together again to discuss the next step which might entail

arranging direct contact with Souza.

O'Brien noted that

Souza lives in Jackson Heights and

usually drives to nork.

Possibly a contact could be

arranged somewhere along the

route.

The foregoing generally covers the extent of our discussion.

regarding Souza.

When I met with O'Brien again on 16 Sep-

reber just prior to my departure for Mashington, I requested

that he not take any action on the Souza case in our behalf

until he heard something further fron re.

13.

During our meeting ve reviewed other members of the

Caban Mission with particular reference to aGI types.

O' Brien

noted that Chafik Homero Saker Zenni (201-335014) undoubted-

ly is the senior member of the Df. group but even so he vas

sor thought to be particularly active.

He suported that

Saker had been in contact with Lee Lockwood (see above)

on

several recent

occasions but nothing was known of the nature

of the beetings.

He also noted that the Bureau was in con-

tact with Saker's Cuban girl friend in New York City whoa

shey had just traced

without surfacing any derogatory infor

nation.

She is cooperating and the bureau is optimistic

sbout her potential.

He did not provide the girl's name but

indicated that we should hear about her shortly through chan-

Bration of Prensa Lating in New York.

double agent case.

He noted that he had been involied to a

degree and actually was present at the hotel bar in downtown

New York when the agent made his meet with the Cuban case

officer.

O'Brien, accompanied by at least one other Bureau

nan, reported that AMBIG-3 winked at them while passing close

by them at the bar on one occasion.

O'Brien took this to

nean that AMBIG-3 presumed that O'Brien and his friend were

Bureau men assigned to survei! the meeting. O'Brier also

stated that after his meeting with his Cuban DGI contact,

AMBIG-3 called for an emergency meeting with the Bureau and

they gave him $290.

It was close to 2000 hours before ou: meeting ter-

minated.

We parted on a cordial note with

agreement reached

that we would talk soon again when some of the material

discussed had been further sifted.
