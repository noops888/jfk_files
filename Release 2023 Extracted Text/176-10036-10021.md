LIMIT DISTRIBUTION S/S

In discussion with UK Consul Dodson and myself last night,

local UN representative Mathu bitterly criticized local In-

dian UN commander who he claimed "wanted start fighting so they

could kill blacks and go back home with decorations".

Dwelt

particularly on September 12 patrol incident and October 8

Post Office patrol affair (CONTEL 569). Said he considered

substance UN commimiques both these occasions (which he signed)

untruthful. I told Mathu that information

on which Noronha

mation, that we had any real choice.but to pass it

on rapidly

as possibly correct or Noronha any choice but to act

on it

same basis.

Said did not believe slightest intention Noronha's

part provoke incident.

Mathu said he glad learn these supplementary facts which In-

dians had not given him. However, he then resumed criticism

of Indians, claiming they told him nothing and harbored secret

designs.

It obvious Mathu smarting under criticism from Gardiner during

recent visit on failure maintain upper hand over UN military

here and similar criticism from Bunche, who apparently sent

Gardiner telegram after Post

Office affair asking whether

Mathu boss in Elisabethville or Indians. As Consulate report-

ing as indicated, charge that Mathu has not firmly established

control over UN military, especially Indians, and that this

is evidenced in their repeated

failure to inform him promptly

and: fully, is well based. Belteve Gardiner-Bunche approach at

this point will help stiffen: Mathu and tone down Indians.

However, aside fron overly professional military posture on

which we have commerted, have seen no evidence here during

past two months to justify charge of separate aggressive In-

dian policy on part local Indian officers. As frequently,

outbreak of dispute over civilian .control.of military reflects

differing capacities of individuals involved. In addition,

as previously noted, Mathu lacks organizational back-up.to

cope with tight, professional Indian staff.

Further, believe as stated Noronha patrol action October 8

justified by circumstances and in no sense evidence of aggres.

sive intent.

Should note that attempt was made pass same

information Mathu but no answer (Mathu says previously unable

hear phone from library at night, had phone installed bedroom

two days ago) and that though Indian patrol stationary rather

than mobile, men did not descent from trucks, take up positions,

or otherwise act in menacing way. Noronha may have had obli-

gation make further effort reach Mathu before ordering patrol

but was late at night and operational requirement was immed-

iate. He made typical error, however, of not fully informing

Mathu of patrol until 1700 next day.

Above for background only; as far as local situation concerned,

do not believe Mathu will

at. this time take action aggravating

personal relations now that has blown off steam. Possible

Embassy Leopoldville and USUN may wish consider giving Gardiner

and Bunche further details background October 8 patrol if they

believe this would reduce unnecessary friction among UN Ã§om-

ponents.
