On the basis of this information, we immediately instructed the

Washington Field and New York Offices to institute confidential inquiries with

appropriate Post Office officials to determine the feasibility of covering outgoing

correspondence from the U.S. to the U.s.s. R., looking toward picking up a

communication dispatched to the aiorementioned address.

On January 21, 1958, SAC

of the New York Office called

advising that his preliminary inquiries at first disclosed that such coverage

could possibly be effected at LaGuardia Airfiela. Powers stated that he subsequently

received a cafi from the Chief Post Office Inspector who told him that he would not

be able to make such arrangements and explained that something had happened in

Washington on a similar matter and that Bureau Headquarters should take up the

I matter with Post Office Headquarters here in Washington. The Post Office

Inspector said that it did not involve our agency and because of what was going

on in Washington at the present time, he just couldn't do it on his own.

Almost simultaneous with this advice, Mr. James Angleton of CIA

approached our Liaison Agent, (Sam Papich) on a personal basis. He indicated

that if it were known within CIA that he was volunteering this information to the

Bureau, he would lose his job. Mr. Angleton stated it had come to the attention

MEMO TO: MR. BOARDMAN

RE: COVERAGE OF MATI TO THE(U.S.S. R.)

and in view of the volume of material being sent from the U.S., their coverage

is an extensive and expensive operation. He indicated that they had to set up an

elaborate array of IBM machines to tally and tabulate the results. In addition

a complicated indexing procedure was involved, as well as complex scientific

examinations of the material.

He further

indicated that the coverage has been in existence in excess of a year and he

stated that the sole purpose for the coverage was to identify persons behind the

Iron Curtain who might have some ties in the U,S. and who could be approached

lin their countries as contacts and souroes for CIA. Angleton indicated that CLA

had successfully developed several sources through this means.

He stressed

the confidential nature of his information and stated that while other officials of

CIA more directly concerned with the coverage were expecting a visit from the

FBl he was passing this along for our guidance.

It would appear that our inquiries of the Post Office officials in

New York have flushed out a most secret operation of CIA. The question

immediately arises as to whether CIA in effecting this coverage in New York

has invaied our jurisdiction. In this regard, it is believed that they have a

legitimate right in the objectives for which the coverage was set up, namely,

the development of contacts and sources of information behind the Iron Curtain,

and according to Angleton they have had some success: in this regard. At the

same time, there is an internal security objective here in which, because of

our responsibilities, we have a definite interest, namely, the identification of

illegal espionage agents who may be in the United States..

While recognizing

this interest, it is not believed that the Bureau should assume this coverage

because of the inherent dangers in the sensitive nature of it, its complexity,

size and expense. It is believed that we can capitalize on this coverage by

pointing out to CIA our internal security objectives and holding them responsible

to share their coverage with us. Of course, we are not interested in the

identities of the numerous persons in this country legitimately corresponding

abroad. The Post Office has indicated there are approximately four thousand

lems of correspondence to the J.s.3. R. each day. Angleton said they have not

come up with a micrögot or secret message communication as yet.

ACTION:

1. On the basis of our inquiries conducted in New York, we are in

a position and should, through Liaison, approach ClA, Informing them that it

has been indicated that their Agency has coverage of mail going to the U.s.s.R

We Should get from them the details of their coverage and explain our interest in

being furnished with the results of the coverage as it might effect internal security

It is believed that we can and should furnish CIA with the name

to them our interest in the particular address and, therefore, we will not be

violating the confidence of the/British.

In view of the highly sensitive nature of this coverage, we will

secret writing has been made to a limited extent because the volume of mail has been too

humerous for the establishment of a practical system without delaying moverent of the

mail. «CIA has advised that to date it has not discovered any microdots or secret writing

or information revealing evidence of Soviet intelligence operations in the United States.

CIA has also advised that this program has not reached its full potential, but that its

system of opening mail is rapidly increasing. CIA has expressed a willingness to

furnish us any information obtained from this coverage which we feel would be of

interest to us.

An analysis has been made of CIA capabilities as revealed to the Liaison Agent

re: COVERAGI OF MAT TO THE(U.S. S. R.)

With regard to the above coverage, it is believed desirable that Liaison make

arrangements for us to review at CIA any material of this nature and we will then

select that which appears to warrant investigation and then make appropriate checks.

This procedure will eliminate.having CIA sending us a bunch of worthless material with

the possible expectation that we will be running out leads for them. It is believed this

arrangement can be mocked out with CIA in a proper fashion.

In addition to the above it is believed the following arrangements can be

effected with CIA:

Place stops against names and addresses of individuals possibly presently

engaged in Soviet espionage to determine if they are in correspondence with U.So po h

This would include a check of the back traffic on these individuals also. We would,

of

course, make these stops on a highly selective basis.

Request CIA to place stops against addresses in Soviet Russia believed by the

Bureau to be mail drops or suspected mail drops. (It should be noted that we already

have placed a stop with ClA against the name and address of

which, according to inforination received from ivй-5,

1s a drop utilized bysoviet) legal agents all over the world arranging emergency pueet

We will, of course, continue to analyze this coverage by CIA to see that we

obtain maximum benefits.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1)" That information received from this source be hereinafter designated as

Bureau informant to Records section has advised that this informant symbol has

not been previously used.

2)

That this matter and any mail relating thereto be labeled "June" and then

filed and maintained in the Sovme) Unit, Room, 1734 (the regular repository of "June"

mail) to afford maximum security to this source.

That our Liaison Agent orally advise CIA of the type of data set forth above

that would be of interest to us and make arrangements with CIA so that we can review

• this type of information in order to select that which we feel will warrant further

investigation. Liaison should also perfect the arrangement with CIA so that on a

4. In order to facilitate

your reading of machine run entries,

there follows an explanation of the various types of replies which you

will receive in connection with requests.

A hypothetical request for

This reply has the following meaning:

"A" has no present meaning. All numbers are now preceeded by

"A'' only to allow for future additional classifications. None are

presently contemplated.

"57CO3'is the date of intercept, namely: "57" is the year. "C"

indicates the month. The code key for months is set out as Enclosure I.

"OS" is the day of the month. Thus, "57C05" is 5 March 1957.

The group "C3325" is our own internal filing number.

The "Name In entry icentifies the correspondent inside the UssR.

The asterisk ia "Res" columa indicates that KROVAN)sent the letters

The entry in "Loc" (ation) column indicates the area or city inside

the Soviet Union from which the letter was mailed. In this case it was

mailed from the western section of/Ukrainian SSR. The code key

used for this column is set out in Enclosure 2. This code key is to

be used for all items prior to 1 January 1958, on which date a 4-place

code was instituted in order to designate more precisely the localities

within the USSR. A copy of this new code is enclosed as Enclosure 3.

The "Name Out" entry identifies the correspondent outside the

(USSR)

In both the "Name In"' and "Name Out" columns, the last or

family name is listed first.

The absence of an asterisk in the "Ref"' column after EVOSWA

indicates that she is the recipient of the letter.

The entry in the second "Ioc"(ation) column indicates the state of

the U.S. (in this case, New Jrsey) to which the letter was addressed.

The code key used for this column is set out in Enclosure 4. You

will note that some 3-digit entries indicate large cities within a state,

thus 1O indicates New York State and KOA indicates New York City.

For your convenience an alphabetical list of the states with their code

indicator is set out in Enclosure 5.

The absence of an 'X"' in the "Ban" column means that the letter

was not opened and that only the exterior is recorded in our files.

5. Since the hypothetical request was for mail fromP. KROVAN,

above would be furnished, since it would not appear that Paraskoviya

otherwise available, you may believe that KROVAN)may be identical

with the individual of interest to you, you need reference only the

HUNTER report number and request the exterior photographs of

item No. A57C05C3325, which will be reproduced from the original

film and made available to you.

6. Il the hypothetical request is for any mail from the soviet

Union to Rose ESTERSON, who resides in Chicago, the reply might

be as follows:

The difference in this listing from that previously illustrated is as follows:

"U' is our internal identifying designator. The first date is the date

of the intercept.

The second date is the date of the communication

inside the letter. The "X" under the "Ban" column indicates the letter

was opened. Again this indicator would indicate only a possible identi

fication since KKB under "Loc" indicates California. In this instance

upon request, identifying the HUNTER report number and referencing

both A57D23U and 57D18 numbers, the outer envelopes and their con-

tents will be reproduced and furnished to you.

7. Normal service of either of the above requests will be 24 hours.

In an emergency we could

19. In order to insure most efficient servicing of your request,

it is suggested that you submit trace requests as follows: List the

last name first with any known first and given games or initials, and

address including state, city and street, if knowa. If an exact address

List, i.e. 30, 60, 90 days, or "until cancelled". If a Watch List is

requested, you should also indicate the treatment desired when a

possible hit is made, i.e. photograph outside only; photograph

RE: BUREAU INFORMANT 2001

advised that the U. S. Postal Service had raised a question as

to CIA's necessity to continue PROJECT HUNTER in view of possible

security problems within 'the Postal Service.

The Bureau has always handled PROJECT HUNTER

on a strict need-to-know basis. The material received is handled

on one dosk in the Domestic Intelligence Division where it is

screened for items of possible investigative use and retention. Ik

material of no interest is destroyed. HUNTER material can be

only transmitted to our field aivisions in parapnrased Iorm

and can only be used for investigative purposes. The material

can never be incorporated in any communication which is intended

for dissemination outside of the Bureau. HUNTER material that

is retained is kept in a Special File Roon In the Records Branch

at the Identification Division Building. Periodically CIA has

been furnished with general guidelines as to the material which

rould be of special interest to our needs. Lor example, we are

currently interested in material concerning current and

it has provided us with the identities of Americans in contact

Ith Soviet exchange students in the United States who offer some

Memorandum from W.

Branigan to Mr. E. S. Miller

RE:

BUREAU INFORMANT 200

The Soviet Union is currently building up the number

of trade representatives who vill be assigned in various areas

of the United States where we normally would not have coverage.

We anticipate that PROJECT HUNTER would be valuable in providing

leads for any necessary coverage of these people.

With the relaxation of tensions between the U. S. and

the ussel the volume of correspondence has obviously increased.

We do not currently know what that volume is. To the best of

our knowledge, CIA has maintained this PROJECT smoothly and

without hitch. It would be necessary to now examine what

security problems the U. S. Postal Service is experiencing.
