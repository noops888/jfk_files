MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

ITKIN Case

Memorandum dated 20 March 1970 by

MI. Houston

I. This memorandum follows up paragraph 6 of

referenced memorandum. The MI¿Srepresentative in Washington

has indicated that the British Consulate here and in New York does

indeed have a file on Mrs. ITKIN. She met at her own request.

Mr. William Edward BRUCE in the New York Consulate on 19 August

1969. Mr. William Edward BRUCE is not David BRUCE, and he is

not an MI. 5 representative or spokesman.

2. Mrs. ITKIN contacted the Consulate in order to commu-

nicate that her two children were wards of the British High Court,

that they had been removed from her custody by the British High

Court and were now in danger from the Mafia in the United States.

She desired to communicate this information because she said she

was able to publicize her predicament in the British press.

Mr. William Edward BRUCE had no prior knowledge of the ITKIN

matter, custodial or otherwise, but he recognized the possible sig-

nificance of what Mrs. ITKIN had to say. He therefore wrote two

full pages, recording in detail what Mrs. ITKIN said. He told her

that inasmuch as the children were outside of the jurisdiction of the

British High Court, he saw little possibility of any effective redress

even though the children might indeed be wards of the British Court.

In any case, he would refer what she had had to say. Since August

the New York Consulate has been sending clippings on the criminal

aspects in the ITKIN Case as it is developed. The last set of clipp-

ings arrived in Washington from the New York Consulate in December.

3. Nowhere in Mr. William Edward BRUCE's detailed

report of this transaction with Mrs. ITKIN is there any acknowledg-

ment of the statement she alleges to Miss PERLES as having been

made by "David" BRUCE. I have not requested a copy of BRUCE's

report although I am sure that the MI, 5 representative would make

it available if we felt that a reading was a requisite. The (MI. Srep-

resentative in any case offered the possibility to us of going to 20

BRUCE directly with a specific question on Mrs. ITKIN's allega-

tion. I replied that I desired to consult with our General Counsel

before taking that action. How say you?
