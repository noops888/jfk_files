streets between Merida and Morol on Puebla street iniColonia

Roma. Subject walks along Püobla street and I pick him up

In the car and drive elsowhere for the mooting. I attempted

tọ change

the time of the meeting as well but. Subjeot does

not olose his store until just before 2100 hours each

day and fools that it would appear odd 1f he wore to close .,

the store at various times of the evening on different days

of the wook.

His wife is not always in the store and he

would have to close the store in order to meet me. He

closes at 1400 hours on Sundays: I also instruoted him to

change the speed of the recorder fror l 7/8ths to 3 3/iths.

We have no recorders in the Station that will take a largo

cool at 1 7/8the and this-extremely slow spood la not

necessary.

2. During early September Subject commented that there.

of Gelati and Goreral de los Santos, across the street from

the Soviet Embassy. (This 18 our new basehouse). I took

Several Soviets have mentioned to

subject that they would like to rent apartments in the

3. Subject sald that ISAYEV had been in his storo about

the last week in September. (As far as I can tell this is

ISAYEV 9 first vialt to Subjectis store.) ISAYEV mado a

great many antl-U.s. remarks during his vislt to the store

and blamed the U.s. for most of the world's troubles. At one

point he said that the Soviets made much better cars than

the U.S. and that Sovlet cars were bullt 118o: "tanks".

subject laughed at this remark because the thought crossed

hls mind that only a soldier would like to drive a "tank".

and from where Subject was standing at the time he could.

the Sovietta" new fleet of American Fords and Chevya.

4: I again asked Subject why the Sovlets bad not been

vlaiting his store in the evenings as they had in the past

and he Insisted that it was becausé most of his "friends"

at the Embassy had returned to the soviet Union beginning in

July and their replacements had not warmed up to him yet.

I asked him if a amall floata might not help this situation

and he sald that he thought that lt might help. I told i

him to make plans for a flesta in honor of Mexican

Independenco Day and to Inülte as many. of the new Sorlota

as possible.

He said that he would probably give

the

party on Friday, 17 September. I suggosted that he invite

Yurly ANDRIANOV (the GRU chauffeur) first and tell ANDRIANOV

to invite soveral of his friends.

At the

next meeting with

subjeat he reported that NIKIFORpy,

LOGINOV and kORMuSHRIN

were the only Soviets who came to

the flesta on the 17th.

They arrived, had a few drinks, danced to

some. Rugglan

records whloh they had brought with them and then left.

(All are KGB types), They told Subject that the other

Soviets could not attend because they had to attend a Crect

Embassy reception that same evening. L I can find no récord

of such a reception either at the Czech on Polish Embassles

and there 1s no indication on the soviet lines that they

had anything flanned for that evening. A soviet from

Cuba arrivod

on the 17th but we have no idea how many Sovlets

were at the airport to greet him. I questloned Subjeet

about the Soviets who. hnd apreared at the fleste and he

gave me a ilttle information about them. They, isited his

store several times in the next few weeks and I showed him

photographs of the men and, expanded on his previous information.

He had the following to say about them lhe has previoualy

reported on NIKIFOROV).

LOGINOV: Subject said that he belleves LOGINOV replaced

NECHIPORENKO (correct). Subject calls him "the Bull"

and

deseribed him as being vulgar, crude, 111-mannered, short...

tempered and a tyrant. He is a person who thinks that he

le'some sort of a "big shot" and when he sits down he

spreads lils lege and arms and takes up a space big enough;

Sor to moni.. His Spanish ls very bad and ho amokes "Pleata"

cigarettes. At the fiesta LOGINOV told him that he was

from the northern part of the Soviet Union, la married and

has children. He claimed to have served in the Red Army.

KOSMUSHK IN :

Subject likes KORMUSHKIN whọ is friendly,

well mannered and outgoing. He speaks good Spanish and

told Subject that his wife likes Nexico.: Although RORMUSHKIN

was wearing glasses in the photo show to Subjeot, he

commented that be ofton sees KORMUSHKIN without his glasses

He smokes "Record" cigarettes and Subject oalls him

"El Joveneito".

??:t

5. Subject said that ISAYEV had dropped by his store

during the weak of 18 October and spent some time making

fun of the king and Queen who were visiting Noxico at the

time. ISAYEV felt that the very existance of a king and

Queen in 1965 was silly. He also claimed that the soviets

had discovered

the Comet that was then in the sky. (The Comet

had actually been discovered by two Japanese and bears

their names. He bragged

about the great advances in the

Soviet inion In all flelda and told Subject with great pride

that the ruble was worth more than the

dollar. He commented

## Page 66

that the U.S, was a waring nation while the Sovlet Union

sought only poade and that the United States would change

to something dimilar. to the Soviet system in the near future.

6o the reat of the meeting and the next tro, were spent

disownsing Stanislav SILNIKOV and his request that subject

aot as "flador" on an apartment for him as

well as supply

him with

a a prostituto. (800 IMMA-27548. Of 4 Nov.)

7. In addition, Subject dald that ANDRIANOV had asked bim

to get Viktor KÄLININ some aphrodisiao pills.. ANDRIANOV

sald that they vero "for Viktor KALININ In Moscow" but

Subjeot thinks they are "for Yurly ANDRIANOV in Mexico".

subject sald he hasn't the slightest idea where to buy

such a thing.

8. I told Subject to test the recorder by speaking into

the microphones both in the upstairs room as well as in the

main part of

the store and then to play back the tape.

Although RESCIGNO has explained the workings of the recorder

to subjeot soveral times; he claimed that he did not know

how to do this. I then Instructed him to disconneot the

recorder and to deliver it to me at 2100 hours on Friday,

5 November. I sald that I would toät the recorder myself.

Ro asked why RESCIGNO could not comé to the store and test

It and I told him that RESCIBNO was away. le then asked 1f

RESCIGNO was a Mexican or an American. He said that RESIGNO

speaks Spanish l1ke a Mexican ard looks like a'Mexican but

that họ (Subject) 19 sure that he vos an American. I told him

They were driving car 337-D (LEONOVts)

since both LOGINOV and KORMUSKIN live in apartments

outside the Embassy and since they would not willingly go

September 1966

from 1730 to 1800.

arranged by phone.

subject reported that LocINoY st1ll comes fairly

rogularly to the French Club on weekends. Occastonally he brlage;

hits wife. Once of twice he brought two young soviet men in

their early twenties.

He has also brought a Soviot woman ca-

25 who has played tennis with two other women (club nembers)

whom Subject doesn't know. Subject hasn't seen CORLITSYN since

our last seeting

Since LOGINOY doesn't play tennds but only sits around

outside or in the bar, Subject doesn't see hin for sustained

periods. Subject has seen LOGINOY talking to SARMIENTO or his

wife tro or three times. From observing him in the bar,

say that LOGINOY Is on speaking ters ulth several members.

I asked subject if he knew Ofella ALPARO Lopez (P-11939),

a good friend of the SARMIENTOs and also in contact with the

Soviets.

he didn't recognize her name as a club nonbef he

I told kid that ate dacher at the too unty i,

remembered that at a dinner party at the home of henry

an American and local head of Continental Ö11 Co., & Mexican

woman was prosent who was a professor of Econonics. She speaks

excellent English and to in her thirties.

ALFARO but is not sure

He thinks this 1s

He will check his wife who 1s the name

ronemberer In the fantly.

5. Subject remarked that he found the above dinner strange

for its odd mixture of solid busdless types and a fey off-boat

"beatnik" Mexican types Including the female profossor. He

hastened to assure ne that SISCHANN wus a sterling character.

6; Por the next mooting Subject will attempt to contira

ALFARO's

identity and also to spot ilkely club membere tho

appear to be on close terms with the sARMIEnTOs with the vlow

of getting an assessment of the latter.

subject is interested and willing.

However, ho does

not appear to be very much interested in" people.

Thus he has

played tennis with SARMIENTO for years and hasn't a thing to

say about hin except that. he is a pleasant tennis companion.

Similarly SARMIENTO's site is good

looking and a good tennis player.

8. I haven't had an opportunity to talk to Subject's ulfo

yet because subject says that she does not know the SArMIENOs.

I met big wife last fall and noted that she 1s much more alert,

interested and lively in social relations than be 1g.

Therefore

I bet that she knows a lot more than he gives her credit for.

I Intend to invite them to dinner soon in order to talk with the

wife and explore possibilities.

that this was the old bent of the Soviets on which he had furninhed a wealth of

could not seriougly connider using Subj'o cira to "Jecalizo" their son, heceuse.

It would be a patont rroud to the omployeen in nie farm, and he did not thing the

Soviets were stupid about such things.

The C/O's surmary comment to Subj'e unspoken plea for criticism or his course

of action was that under the concopt of a "friends, rest work, no" policy terard:

the Soviets ho was doing a fine job or walking the tientropo.

LOGINuV said Subject must know these apartments well.

to be interested in his efforts. LOGINOV then asked:

how many

apartments thero were in the building.

Subject answered;

16.

LOGINOV then

said that since subject knows the apartments

so well he must also know the people who live there.

Subject

admitted that

he did.

At this point some other Soviets came in

and the conversation.ras torminated.

On 6 Növember LOGINOV

dropped by for some small talk'and left some Soviet chocolate

(which Subject showed ne) for subject's grandchild.

Oñ 9 November

LOGINOV came In at 1230 and asked Subject to go to

a restaurant

with him:

Subject countered by saying his wife was: home sick

and he had no one to leave.

the stote nith.. subject then invited

LOGINOV tö his house

but LOGINOV insisted on a restaurant.

Subjedt agreed to go on 12 or 13 November.

From the above Subject concludes that LOGINOV wants to.

recruit him to report on LIEMPTY-6 (who lives in P.A: de los

I asked why LoGINOV would be interested in LIENpTY-6

The apartment directly

went to see the owner having LOGINOV

in mind.

that the apartment had been rented by

LI EMPTY-6 which Subject also finds surprising.

The whole theme

was that he is suspicious of LIElPTY-6 and that LOGINOV wants

to recruit him to report on hin.

All of the above on LIE!PTY-6

and his apartment was verbal.

There was not a word about hin

I told Subject that 1f LOGINOV tries to recruit him för

since the Station

had had no contact with subject sine 6 January 1955, i

contacted Don Lautz of the Visa Sootion on 27 Septerber

to see 1f Subject was still coming into the Embassy

regularly on on visa business.

Lautz

said that Subject

had for some time now been sending an agent to the

Embassy rather than coming himself. Lautz readily

agreed to give Subjeat a call, however, and reached.him

late that afternoon. He told subject that the "people"

at the Embassy wrom he had introduced Subjeot to earlier

were interested in talking with him and asked if he could

drop Into the Embassy in the next row daye.

Subject

immediately recognized which "people". Lautz was referring

to, sald that as a matter or fact he had somithing to

diecuss with "them," commented that it probably in fact

Involved the same matter, and agreed to come to Lautz's

office at 11:00. the next day.. As he had done with Irving

A. Oronsky, Lautz agreed to let me use his offico to

talk to Subject.

2. I went to Lautz's offico at 11:00 on the 2eth,

but when Subject had not appeared by 11:15, Lautz agreed

to call me in my office when Subject arrived. Lautz called

about 11:30, and I went right down. By the time I got

there, however, Subject had already explained to Lautz

that he has sure I wanted to talk about his invitation to

confirming that it was the Intourist

conforenco I was interest in, took off from there:

Without

the slightest prompting, he rattled off the following:

a) He had received a telegram from

Moscow on

Moscow from 24-29 October.

He had immodiately thought

He has not yet definitely

made up his mind about

attending the conferenco, but

thinks he probably will go. At the moment, he was still

awaiting the detalled lotter on the conference which,

acoording to the telogran, was to collow. (LICOZY-S has

already rocolved his letter.) in reply to my question

as to whether he was sending enough people to the USSR

to make the trip really worthwhtle, he said that he

had sent only five people there so far this year, but

that he thought travel to the Soviet Union

was definitely

going to pick up. He said that LOGINOV, who has been

perfectly legitimate reason for being thero..

d) Subject

stated that he had already given Lautz

the names of the other travel agents in Mexico whom ho

had heard had been invited

to Moscow and said that once

he received the Intourlat letter giving the dotalls on

exactly who was going.

3. Since a) Sübject had already volunteerod to do

Indication of preparing to leave us alone, and d) I

clearly could not got any farther with subject on a

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This is a now, experimental version of the Personality Assessment

Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Ill) which has been in

use for several years..

This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires

far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

2. For a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de.

veloping a system-for "indirect assessment of larget personalities. The

system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations

of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are :

used as if they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile..

Working from the

profile, operational psychologists describe the larget personality's basic

aptitudes, antitudes, motives and susceptibilities. The gocl of the assess.

ment is to identity feasible means of influencing the target person,

3. Reliability is vastly increased when tio or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently. All items need not be completed; in fack,

it is a rare case where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking.

Mark such

items with a "C," instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, on

observer with very limited confact.can be expected to enter more

•"G's'"

than "X's."

(Check the most appropriate description.)

He is a hearty, hale fellow who laughs with gusto and pleasure:

His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometime

loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the

time, his good humor is contagious.

He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-

siderable gusto. However, he is fréquently dour and sorrietimes

intolerant and somewhat humorless. His humor is direct, even

crude, end at times, inappropriate. He tends to be thie kind of

person who laughs more at people than with people.

He is à good-humored follow who sometimes can be considered

jolly and carefree. His humdr is clever and well timed. He is

quite sensitive to the moods and feelings of others and ofteni

can do a good job appropriately livening up a party. Although

something.of a toase, he is nover cruel or insensitive.

He is generally a rather quiet and somewhot complacent person

who, at times; can be surprisingly gay and carefree: However,

when gay, he sometimes overdocs it and causes some strain for

those ground him. His humor is often cleyer but he can be

qüite sarcastic and even biting on occosion.

He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-

priate. He does not necessarily appear to bo a humorless: person,

but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sornetimes diffi

cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way

he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied::

than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate:

He is a dour and humorless person, olways serious and intense.

It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re

sponsive and partly because he secms to disapprove.

He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow with d subtle wit. He

can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.

However, there is something of an aristocratic quality-to his

sense of humor and he con be quite condescending towards

people who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humore

He is an arty, somewhat cynical person who con be quite

tlippant at times; His humor tends to be a bit far out. He

seems to have private jokes he shares with intimates. It is

sometimes difficult to tell whether he is being amusing of

subtly hostile.

sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way

but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropricteness:

He is neat, even dapper, and con be quite fastidious:.

Most of his relations with women appear to be quite pla-

tonic. He is the kind of person who likely hos several

very close friends who are women:

He is a somewhat shy and indifferent persón whom some

people consider odd or unusual; He shows little or no
