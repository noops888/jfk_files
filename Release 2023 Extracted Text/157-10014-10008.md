Mr. Halpern. Samuel Halpern, H-a-1-p-e-I-n, 2202 Popkins,

Mr. Johnston. Mr. lalpern, you previously testified before

the Committee, and I assume you know that you have various right.

the right to coungel, and that you previously have been furnished

a copy of the Committee rules, is that correct?

Mr. Halpern. That is correct.

MI. Johnston. And you're testifying here today voluntarily.

MI. Malperh: That is correct.

Mr. Johnston.

What was your position with the CIA in the

period, say, June to

December, 1963?

Mr. Malpern. I was the executive officer for the Special

Affairs Staff of the Directorate of Plans.

The staff was

responsible for operations against Cuba at that time.

Mr. Johnston. And you were executive assistant to Mr.

Fitzgerald, who was chief.

Mr. Halpern. That

is correct.

Senator Schweiker.

Were they two different capacitics, i

the same?

Mr. Halpern. It's the same. The actual title was Executiv

Officer at that tine.

Senator Schweiker. Okay.

Mr. Johnston. And prior to Mr. Fitzyerald's taking over

the Special Affair's Staff, Mr. Harvey was in that position, is

Mr. Halpern.

The staff?

Senator Schweiker.

In other words, Task Force W. In

other words, whatever it was called

at the

time, Task Force W

I guess.

Mr. Halpern.. I was in the branch of the Western Hemisphere

Division when it was taken out of the Western Hemisphere Division

and turned into Task Force w, and that was in early '62.

Mr. Johnston.

What vere your responsibilities as executiv

officer to ir. Fitzgerald?

Mr. Balpern. Almost anything he wanted me to do. Basically

it was to be sure that all of the papers that did reach his

desk

were in correct form, content and distribution and routiny.

didn't feei that tilty wanted to talk to the boss about, and I

acted as a screen in that regard. But basically I was there

to do whatever the boss wanted me. to do, as an alde does.

MI. Johnston. Did you have operational responsibilities?

Mr. Halpern. Only those he gave me from time to time.

Nothing in the line of command. From time to time I did get

involved in operational activities. I had one specific field

of endeavor, and that was liaison with

British intelligence.

• Mr. Johnston. Were you knowledgeable of operational

matters?

Mr. Halpern.. Yes, quite a bit. I didn't see everything,

but I saw an awful lot, and I was knowledgeable of most operational

matters.

Senator Schweiker. How large a staff at Langley did

Desmond Fitzgerald's SAS have at its peak

at lleadguarters?

Mr. llalpern. To the best of my recollection, about 150

at

Headquarters.

Senator Schweiker. When it was Task Force W, how large willi

it be?

Mr. Halpern. 200, 225, something like that. That's vorj

much a guess

at this point. That includes officers and cleri...!

that's

the total force.

Right.

Mr. Johnston. Who did Mr. Fitzgerald report to on Cuban

matters?

Mr. Halpern. To the DDP.

MI. Johnston. That was Mr. Helms at the time.

Mr. Halpern, That's right.

MI. Johnston. Did he also report to Mr. Cane, J. C. Cane?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, no, no, no, there was nothing like that.

It was taken completely out of the divisional, regional lines

of command and made a special staff.

Senator Schweiker. There was nothing that related to

Cuba, Cuban activity of anti-Castro activity, after that was

done, that went through the formally normal channel.

Mr. Malpern. Only

in regard to seekiny the help of the

Western Hemisphere Division and its stations, to help us in

our activities. Obviously Cuba was still part of the Western

Hemisphere geographically, and

you need to have help, for

example, if we are going to send

people from TFW Or SAS into

Mexico or into Venezuela, you had to get permission of the

holding division. So in that regard we had an awful lot of

work to

do with and constant liaison

and communication with the

Western Hemisphere Division, the same kind of activity we had

with other divisions such as Europe, where we had quite a bit

of activity in Spain because of the Cuban refugees in Spain.

But most of it was at that time obviously with the Western

Hemisphere Division.

Mr. Johnston. Did SAS in the fall of 1963 have any of its

own

people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. Yes. How many, I don't know, but we did have

some that were attached to the station there, under the station

command.

The staff had no authority to break the

chains of command,

and everything that was communicated to and from the SAS

assignees anywhere else in the world went through

WH Division

here in Washington, and they saw the replies when it came from

the station.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall whether Mr. David Phillips as

one of the SAS people in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. No, I do not.

Mr. Johnston. You do not recall?

Mr. Halpern. I do nọt recall.

Mr. Johnston: Who provided counterintelligence support

to the Special Affairs Staff?

Mr. Halpern. We had our own small counterintelligence

staff. I believe, if memory

serves me, it was headed

up sone:!

during this period by lal Swenson, who is a CI specialist, and

we always had, of course, the support of the CI Staff of the on.

under Mr. Angleton.

But basically each of the divisions in this case, it was

Senator Schweiker.

Going back to a question that Jim

asked, the SAS office in Mexico City was headed up by whom ?

MI. Halpern. I don't know, sir.

We had people

assigned to the station in Mexico, but I don'

know who was there. I don't remember.

Senator Schweiker. SAS had people.

Mr. Halpern. Yes. We had people there, we had some in

Madrid, I believe, and we may have had them in other places.

at various

strategic areas around the world.

Senator Schweiker.

Well, who would

the head of the SAS

in Mexico City have

reported to?

Mr. Halpern.

To the Chief of Station.

Senator Schweiker. To the Chief of Station.

Mr: Halpern. To the Chief of Station, that's correct.

Hie

was

under

the Chief of Station's command.

Senator Schweiker.

The Chief of station would have reporte

to the Western Hemisphere Division?

Mr. Halpern.. That is correct, but the way it operated

not.

only with Mexico but any other place is that the sAs people

reported through the Chief of Station. The Chief of Station';

messages were then sent to Washington, and all messages were

addressed to the Director and the cable secretary who made thi

distribution because of the necessary slugs that were on there.

man, the action cable, which I think wad the yellow copy, would

come to sAs, but WA Division vould get an Into copy? it it was

the other way around, if it were something that was Wil's action,

they would get the yellow copy and SAS would get an info white

copy, so that there was no way of trying to keep somebody out of

somebody's act. Everybody was in, with one man being responsible

for action. Everything

going out would then be coordinated.

Senator Schweiker.

Now, following that same line of thought,

how did the JMWAVE station report?

MI. Halpern.

Well, JMWAVE was TEW's, or then SAS's, field

station, and it reported.

Senator Schweiker. What kind of station?

MI. Halpern.

Field station.

Senator Schweiker.

I'm

sorry, field station.

Mr. Halpern. And therefore reported

directly to TFW or

SAS •

Senator Schweiker. Did you have any other field station

besides JMWAVE?

Mo. Halpern. No, sir.

Senator Schweiker. At the peak of the anti-Castro activi:.

how

laige a group was

IMWAVE, would you say, approximately?

Mr. Halpern. The peak was about the time of the missile

crisis, and shortly thereafter. I would say, including

the

commo people, who were technically not part of JMWAVE's conui.r:

although they worked almost exclusively for JMWAVE, I'd say ibu:

600. That is again, male and female. That's male and female.

Senator Schweiker. And that was the only field station that

SAS had.

Mr. Halpern. JMWAVE had a sub-base, not a station, but

they had some people scattered through the Keys, the Florida

Keys, and there was a small unit near Key West, Which was

basically responspible for taking care of the boats and other

activities of that type, and some training areas, but basically

the station was JMWAVE, and we didn't correspond directly with

the Key West element, either. We went through JMWAVE.

MI. Johnston. In your previous testimony before the

Committee, as I copied the quote, "Military intelligence units.

were involved in working with Cuban exiles in the Miami area,

and the Florida area along similar lines of CIA."

My question is, would you elaborate on this activity?

Mr. Halpern.

I don't know

too much about it. The military

then, as now, are supposed to coordinate their activities with

us. In operations against Cuba, they not only coordinated

them, but we provided, the CIA and I'Fi and SAS actually provisel

both communications facilities for

agents, including agent

gear, agent radio gear, as well

as

using our boats to piggy-bais

on our activities going in and out of Cuba, so that we actually

did put from time to time one or

more military agents into

Cuba..

We didn't always know the identity of the military ageni,

which was always

one of the problems we had on coordination,

sources and methods being sacrosanct. Even in the business we

don't tell each other our sources. But we do try to check

as much as we can, and when the military coordinated with us,

they tried to give us enough information to be sure that we are

not going after the

same body or stumbling over each other.

Mr. Johnston. Did this relationship exist in the fall of

1963?

Mr. Halpern. Io the best of my knowledge

it did.

Mr. Johnston. And what Defense agencies were

involved?

Mr. Halpern. DIA

and Army Intelligence, to the best of

my knowledge. I don't think the Navy was involved, and I don't

think the Air Force was involved, but I'm not sure about that.

Mr. Johnston.

In describing

these operations, they are

distinct from operations being Iun out of Guantanamo.

Mr. Halpern.

That is correct, that's correct. The ones

I'm talking about are the ones run out of the florida area.

basically.

Mr. Johnston. Who were SAS's contacts in the Defense

Department in the fall of 1963?

Mr. Halpern. I don't know the answer to that. I'm not

sure. I did not conduct the liaison myself, so I'm not sure.

Mr. Johnston. Was General Lansdale still in the Defense

Department at that time?

Mr. Malpern.

He may have been, but he

was not on cubar:

activities, to the best of my knowledge.

Senatorsschweiker. Well, when he got into Cuban activities,

In what way did he coordinate or not coordinate with what sis

was doing?

MI. Halpern. If I can change the terminology for a minute.

Senator, SAS was after the missile crisis, and I think General

Lansdale left the Cuban activity after the missile crisis in

'62, so it would have been Task Force W. Such coordination, if

there was any, was with the Chief of the Task Force Bill Harvey,

and I just don't know.

Senator Schweiker. Then

there might not have been too

much

coordination.

Ms. Halpern.

As far as I know there might not have been.

There was no requirement on his part to coordinate with us. 'Theri

was a reguirement on our part to coordinate with him, and we

did report to him weekly on all of our activities and proposed

activities, some in response to his direction in which he

requested reports on things he asked us to do, directed us to

do,

and

some of our own ideas which we checked with him before

we did it.

Senator Schweiker. WEll, the way his set-up worked, diu

he have any field stations or any troops, so to speak, to cal!

on, or was this more of a planning operation?

MI. Halpern. It was

a coordinating operation.

Senator Schweiker. On policy levels

and directing activi: i

as far as i know, he relied on the other agencies of

government. Including ourselves and the military, to be his

troops, because I think as I mentioned to the Committee last

time, General Lansdale's original idea, approved by the

Attorney General but not approved by the President, after

objection by the Secretary of state and Secretary of Defense

and the DCI, General Lansdale's original idea in the fall of '61

when it started was to take actually troops from each of the

agencies concerned, Defense, CIA and State, and create in

effect a small new agency of its own directly under the Attorney

General.

NOW,

this was objected to by the two Secretaries and the

DCI.

with CIA, and I'm sure

the military,

and I know

that State,

each component stayed within its own chain of command.

Senator Schweiker. So your group, either Task Force W

SAS. would have had the main thrust of what activity was yoi

Mr. Halpern. That is correct.

Senator Schweiker.

Now, you did mention DIA and Army

Intelligence, but the main thrust of what you were doing went

through your operation.

Mr. Halpern.

was true, by the way, even after General Lansdale left the

Cuban scene::

Mr. Johnston. One other question on this topic is that

generally the concept most people have of DIA is that it

relles solely on the services for intelligence activities.

Mr. Halpern. Uh-huh.

Mr. Johnston. Are you saying in this case DIA did have

its own assets?

Mr. Halpern. I can't say that for certain. DIA may have

been

representing the Army when they came to talk to us about:

things. They were supposed

to coordinate

and be

aware of what

the Army was doing at all times, but I know we talked about

DIA and to Army Intelligence, and I am not sure at this point

whether each one ran

its own,

or whether they even talked to

each other. This was kind of really in

a coordinating game

with Defense.

Senator Schweiker. At the time that you were in both

Task Force W.and SAS, Sam, who was Station Chief or Chief of

Station of JMWAVE?

Ms. Halpern. During that whole period Ted Shackley,

Theodore

Shackley. He is still in the Agency as far as I

know.

Senator. Schweiker. And he would have reported, now, to

Desmond Fitzgerald.

And Harvey before that, that!s correct.

MI. Johnston. Previous testimony before the Committee

dealt

with the AMIASH operation, and you indicated some knowledge of

that operation.

Did you know at the time that Eltzgerald had gone to

Paris to meet with AMLASH in October of '63?:

Mr. Halpern. Yes.

Mr. johnston. Did he also go there on November 22nd to

meet AMLASH?

MI. Halpern. No, sir, despite

what the committee's report

has printed, he was not in Paris on November 22nd. He was

hosting a luncheon at the City Tavern, and if the City Tavern's

records are still available, they should prove that point.

Anci

if the Agencies financial records are available, I am

sure

Fitzgerald must have gotten reimbursed for that luncheon.

Mr. Johnston.

Were you knowledgeable in October of '63

of the purpose of the AMLASH meetings?

Mr. Halpern. In a general way, yes.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know that AMLASHl was proposing a

coup?

Mr. lalpern. That is correct.

Mr. Johnston. And did you know that as part of that coup

he was proposing to assassinate Castro?

Mr. Halpern. Yes.

because I remember when the case officer went with the

pen, so

I guess I knew it was ready. I never saw the pen but I assumed

It was ready when he went.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know there was going to be a meetiny

with AMLASH on November

22nd?

Mr. Halpern. Not the

exact date, no, not the exact date.

Knew the Case Officer was going to meet him, but I didn't know

the exact date.

MI. Johnston. Did you know that the meeting depended upon

the pen being ready? Was that the main element of the meeting?

Mr. llalpern. I don't know. I just don't remember that.

Ms. Johnston. Was there

a message to the case officer

November 23rd, 1963, the day after the assassination, orderin

him

to break contact with AMLASH and return?

Mr. Halpern.

I don't remember.

There may have been but

just don't remember. I would have assumed that would have

happened just on the basis of being a professional officer, bur

I am not sure.

Mr. Johnston.

Well let me Just refresh it.

The case

officer has testified to the effect that he had planned to retur

right after the meeting anyway, and that therefore such a cable

from. Langley to him would not have been necessary.

MI. Halpern. I just don't know.

Mr. Johnston. Did you meet with the case officer or with

Mr. Fitzgerald about the November 22nd meeting after the case

officer had returned?

Mr. Halpern.

I don't remember it. I may have.

But I just

don't remember whether we did or not.

MI. Johnston. Did you see the case officer's contact

report of that meeting?

Mr. Halpern.

No, I don't think só.

If I did, I don't

remember it. It wasn't my habit to see contact reports of

case officers most of the time.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know when the case officer

met with

Mr. Fitzgerald?

Mr. Halpern. No, I don't have any idea.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know what happeried to the pen that

the case officer took with him?

MI. lalpern. To the best of my knowledge he never took

it. I mean, the case officer took it but the agent never took

the pen. At least that's what I was led to believe, that he

never took the pen. He thought it was silly and he just didn'

take it:

Me. Halpern. I belleve it was from the case officer,

somewhere along the way, in bull sessions sometime later.

Mr. Johnston.

Now, is it your testimony that you don't

recall that you knew the meeting was going to be on November 22nd?

Mr. Halpern. I do not recall that it was going to be then?

MI.. Johnston. When you heard the President had been

assassinated, did you make any association between what you did

know, l.e., the case officer was going to deliver a poison

pen to an agent, a Cuban agent, did you make any association

between that and the shooting of the President?

Mr. Halpern. None whatsoever.

Mr. Johnston. At the time you heard of the assassination.

Mr. Halpern. At the time that we heard of it, at the City

Tavern on the top floor, the only thing that crossed my mind --

and I even mentioned it to Bruce Cheever later, who was

Fitzgerald's deputy, was I sure hope that the guy isn't involved

in Cuba in some way.

Mr. Johnston. You said that.

Mr. Halpern. For a very

simple, practical, bureaucratic

reason. We had been swamped enough with

paperwork, and if he

was, it would mean an

awful lot more paperwork, as it turned

out to be on our part,

in terms of name

and file checks

and coordinations and papers to write and

Mr. Johnston, Later, on the day of the assassination,

news reports started coming out with Oswald's Cuban connections.

At that point, did you begin making any associations with the

Senator Schweiker.. You mentioned Fitzgerald's deputy.

Mr. Halpern.

Bruce Cheever.

Senator Schweiker.

Mr. Halpern. C-h-e-e-v-e-I.

He was Deputy to Fitzgerald and he had also

Senator Schweiker. Where is he now?

Mr. Halpern. In Arizona?

Senator Schweiker.

Retired?

Mr. Halpern. Yes, he retired before I did.

MI. Johnston. Was Director McCone told of the November 221l

AMLASH meeting?

MI. Halpern. I don't know. That would have been up to

Fitzgerald and the DDP. I have no idea.

question?

ME. Halpern. Well, we heard his threats against the

President, but it never occurred, at least to my knowledge,

to

sit down and ask somebody to do a paper or do a review or

anything like that. I just never was involved in any question

like that. It just never struck us in terms of the AMLASH

operation because while Castro may have known about the AMLASH

operation, AMLASH continued to move in and out. of Castro's

circles I think for a couple of years thereafter before he was

arrested

and tried.

Senator Schweiker. Well, let's remove it for a minute Ero:

AMLASH. Wouldn't this be a question, knowing of the other anti-

Castro efforts

terms

of assassination planning with both

Task Force W and here, that you would laryely assume that this

is one of the risks that we undertook, and that this could wel!

be a consequence of what we might be doing? Didn't somebody

bring up something like that as

part

of the

contingencies?

Mr. Halpern. They may have, Senator. I just was never

involved in it, and I never heard it discussed. It may have

been

discussed at the CI Staff level or some other level. 1

just

was never

involved

and never heard it discussed.

it may

have

been

we just never gave Castro that much credit. And I

think again it would be basically a problem of first seeing !!

and what Oswald was and did before you would

start two and

together to try and pin it on Castro or the Castro government.

Mr. Halpern. Oswald. I mean Oswald. I'm sorry.

And as long as we're on that subject, talking series, then

and now, even to: this date, the one thing that disturbs me as

a professional and as a citizen is nobody has ever been able to

zero in on =I don't think you can .. but nobody has ever

zeroed in on what Castro did in the Soviet Union for the: couple

of years that he was there. Nobody had a clue where he went,

what he did, what he saw, what he was up to. He marries a

Russian girl, and suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, she gets

exit visas, which is very abnormal.

Mr. Johnston. I think again you said Castro.

Mr. Halpern. I'm

sorry.

I meant Oswald. And this has

always disturbed

me. I don't know where we can get the answers.

The Russians aren't going to give us anything, obviously. I

don't believe what Nosenko said, sinply because Nosenko's

this

is

It's a question. That doesn't say there's any connection

raised..

Senator Schweiker. Did any of the groups that you recall

working with directly or indire oly deal with these

Fair Play for

Cuba Committees as part of your operations, either infiltrating

them or keeping an eye on them?

MI. Halpern.

Neither SAS nor TEW, to my knowledge, no.

Senator Schweiker.

Not to your knowledge.

Mr: Halpern. No, sir, not at all.

Senator Schweiker. This would have probably come under

what, counterintelligence?

Mr. Halpern. Under the FBI, because we were not involved

in this at all.

Senator Schweiker. How about like Alpha 66? Would this

have been something that Task Force

W or SAS would have

been interested in or directing or financing?

MI. Halpern. To the best of my knowledge, we looked at

Alpha 66 originally mostly because of the nuisance value, and

they were i pain in the neck in. terms of

getting their boats

in our way most of the time. We never tried to work out, to

my knowledge, any kind of a system whereby we could use them i

off there was talk that the miiitary, our military may have been

that was just talk in both task forces.

Senator Schweiker. So to your knowledge CIA didn't

finance.

MI. Halpern. No, sir.

Senator Schweiker. Are you reasonably certain of this?

Mr. Halpern. I am reasonably certain we did not finance

Alpha 66.

Senator Schwelker. And you're speculating that if there was

financing, it would have come from intelligence.

MI. Halpern.

Right.

Senator Schweiker. Was this DIA or Arny?

MI. Halpern. Probably Army. This is again based on my

knowledge of the situation at the time. I've got no facts.

It is kind of analysis more than anything else.

Senator Schweiker. Did you ever come

across a CIA or an

Army Intelligence person using the code name of Bishop,

Morris Bishop?

MI. Halpern. No, sir.

MI. Johnston. After the assassination, the CIA designated

Mr. Johnston. Do you know whether anyone in SAs -

Mr. Halpern. Well, I don't know if anybody by identification

was named as a focal point or what have you, but we must have

had some way of coordinating our activities in terms of the file

searches and the papers that were written as a result of those

searches with the CI staff, which was given the overall job,

I believe, of investigating and coming together with reports

and documents to go to the Warren Commission. There must have

been somebody. I just can't think of who it was, the focal

point.

Senator Schweiker. Along the same line of the other

question, did you ever come across a military attache who was

stationed in Havana, Lt. Colonel Samuel Cale, who I believe al

some

point was with

the American embassy

in Havana?

It. Colon

Samuel Cale. Now, again, he is not CIA. He probably was Army

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever see any wiltten orders to

SAS of to anyone in CIA to conduct an investigation of the

assassination of President Kennedy?

Mr. Halpern.

I never saw any such orders, no, sir.

Ms. Johnston. Did you personally see any oral orders, or

do you know of any oral orders to other than SAS to conduct

such

an investigation?

Mr. Halpern. The only thing I know of were the file checks

that were made ad nauseum on everything connected with Oswald.

Even the slightest inkling was checked, double checked, and .

file traces

were

run and cables were sent out to all parts of

the world which might have had any possible connections with

this.

Mr.. Johnston.

Now, when you are saying traces and cables

being sent out, were

these cables being sent out by SAS and the

traces by SAS?

MI. Halpern. SAS sent out some. SAS coordinated on others.

It

was under the direction of the CI Staff, to the best of my

recollection, and we were just doing what we were asked to do

in terms of doing traces.

I mean by task force it was a small group of people put

but I am not sure.

Mr. Johnston. Was John Whitten in SAS?

Mr. Halpern.

John Whitten, at that point, to the best of

my knowledge, was on WH Division.

Mr. Johnston. And what was his responsibility?

Mr. Halpern. I think he had one

of the branches, one of

the area branches, a few countries put together called a branch,

but I don't know which one it was. It may have been one of

the Central American branches. Or it may have been Mexico, but

I'm not sure. He was in WH.

Mr. Johnston. Our investigation suggests the following

structure for the investigation.

The GPFLOOR crypt was used

to designate the CIA activity between the time of the assassinadion

and the time the Warren Commission got rolling, and that Mr.

Whitten was of had principal responsibility in that period, whic

may

have.been a period of a month or more before Mr. Rocca of

involved.

Do you recall any meetings that Mr. Whitten had with sis

Mr. Whitten or not to provide information to him or other

Mr. Halpern. No, not to my knowledge.

Senator Schweiker. You mentioned thatAlpha 66 occasionally

got in the way of some of your activities.

Mr: Halpern. Xes.

Senator Schweiker. How did that happen or occur?

Mr. Malpern. Well, it could happen by we may have been

planning a landing of an agent or a sabotage raid at Point x

in Cuba, and unbeknownst to us, Alpha 66 may be going in the sain:

vicinity, and we would either hot up an area unnecessarily

they would hot up an area unnecessarily.' If they went in the

day before we were supposed to be in, the area would have been

really alerted to the enemy, so that way they would louse up

our activities, and they were a nuisance. They weren't a help

at all, they were a nuisance.

Senator Schweiker.

Then in essence, they were either

operating pretty autonomously or independently, or might have. had

some financing from Army intelligence.

are not always followed.

Nr. Johnston. After the assassination of President

Kennedy, was anything done with regard to using the JMWAVE

assets to investigate the assassination?

. Mr. Halpern. I don't remember anything special except

that they were asked to also check their files and to investigate

through their sources in the Cuban exile community anything

and

everything that they could come up with on Oswald and any of

his activities.

Mr. Johnston. Was there a message to that effect?

Mr. Halpern. There probably was. I couldn't vouch for it.

The only way JMWAVE would get that kind of information or

directive would be by either a cable or a dispatch, and most

likely it would be cables.

MI. Johnston.

Did the CIA at this time period that we

are

talking about have

an arrangement with Customs whereby

Customs agents were detailed or affiliated or loaned to CIA

in the Florida area?

MI. Halpern. I don't remember that, the detailed

so that we would tell them when our boats were going out for

It may have happened, but x was not in any

such meetings. As I say, this never crossed my chin at all

at the time.

Mr. Johnston. Hould:the.fact.that you didchot/hear..any

such discussions to you indicate that they did not take place?

Mr. Halpern.. I just wasn't privy to it. if they did take

place, I just didn't know.

Mr. Johnston. Would you normally have been in such

discussions?

Mr. Halpern. No, not in every discussion, no.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever see any paperwork relating to

suggestion of Cuban involvement in the assassination?

Mr. Halpern. No, sir.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know that on November 25th, the

Chief of Station in Mexico briefed the President of Mexico

saying that they suspected Cuban involvement?

Mr. Halpern. No.

This is the first I have heard.

Mr. Johnston. Would that be at

variance with

the activity

at headguarters?

Mr. Halpern. Not necessarily. It could have been

thought of in Wi Division. It would have been thought of

the CI component of SAS: I just don't, this is the first I

have heard of that.

in the afternoon until about 10:00 o'clock in the evening, and

that a twin engined aircraft arrived at the airport in Mexico

Mr. Halpern. This is allinew to me. I never heard of

that.

Senator Schweiker.. You never heard of that.

Mr. Halpern.

This is brand new.

Mr. Johnston. No information like that came in?

Mr. Halpern. It might have cone in. I just didn't see it.

That's brand new.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know of the travel of a man named

Gilberto Policarpo Lopez who crossed the border into Mexico

apparently on November 23rd, and then on November 27th left

Mexico City as the only passenger on a Cubana Air Lines flight

to llavana?

Mr. Halpern. No,sir, I don't know that.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know a woman by the name of Jane

Roman?

Mr. Halpern.

Yes.

ME. Johnston. What was her capacity?

Mr. Halpern. She was on the CI Staff, and at that time I

think in liaison with the Bureau, and I think also had some

other liaison responsibilities with other intelligence and

security services in the community.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know of would you suspect whether

she was knowledgeable of the AMLASH operation?

MI. Halpern. If she was, we've got lousy security, or

we would have had lousy

security at that time if she knew about

it.

That was very tightly held.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever see -- and again I'm on the

November 22nd, 23rd, 24th time period, a name trace coming from

CI Division, asking for a name trace on the true name of AMLAS!!?!

MI. Halpern. No, but I wouldn't have gotten -- a name

trace request of that type would have gone directly from the

requesting unit, in this case CI, directly to our name trace

unit

in

SAS. If the normal requests for traces came through the

front office, we would be swamped. I would not have seen that

anyway.

particular time, do you have any recollection of any questions

being raised about such a name trace?

Mr. Halpern. No, I don't, but it

wouldn't have been

unusual. AMLASH was a fairly senior officer in Castro's

entourage, and if they had picked on him and only him, I would

have said there may have been a cause to question it in terms

of, you know, why they looked at him only but if they looked

at him and a

dozen other people then I would not have questioned

it at all, even at that time.

Mr. Johnston. And the name trace would have given what?

MI. Halpern. The name trace would have given

whatever

we knew about the individual except our operational contacts

with him. It would be biographic information.

Mr. Johnston. Well, if CI Division asked for information

on AMLASH, even if they were furnished biographical information,

It would not contain the fact that he was involved in some

assassination plot.

Mr. Halpern.

That's correct.. That would normally go

to the case officer concerned, who would

be alerted by the name

tracers that somebody had asked for AMLASH.

Mr. Johnston. And what would the case officer have done

in that case?

Mr. Halyern. Well, in thisse I'm sure he would have

gone

and talked

to MI. Fitzgerald about it.

December 19631 and handwrltten on it is the phrase "not to leave

It is dated December 1963.

Do you know of any instructions to that effect emanating

from Mr. Fitzgerald or yourself or anyone else in SAS?

Mr. Halpern. Not that I know of. It's possible that

Fitzgerald told the case officer not to release it without

his knowledge or something like that. That's the standard

practice. It's not unusual.

Mr. Johnston. But again, in the context of investigating

the assassination of President Kennedy, and the indication that

the name, trace was proposed on him, would it appear unusual?

Mr. Halpern. No, because again, even if it happened that

way, it would have been up to the case officer to tell Fitzgerali

that somebody has asked for the file. The file would then be

handed by Mr. Fitzgerald to whatever element needed it. In

other words, it wouldn't be handled routinely.. In other words,

MI. Johnston. Was the case officer, AMLASH's case officer

still in headguarters throughout December 1963?

Mr. Halpern. Unless he went off on TDY, he was assigned to

headquarters.

Mr. Johnston. But do you know of any instructions to

him to look into or to re-evaluate the AMLASH operation as

part

of this Cuban policy review?

Mr. Halpern.

Nothing specific, not to my knowledge, no.

Mr.. Johnston. We have seen papers going over to the

White House coming from Mr. Fitzgerald in early 1964 discussing

the Cuban operations that the CIA had. Absent from that is any

detail of the AMLASH operation.

Do you know of a conscious effort to withhold that fron

those papers?

MI. Halpern. I don't know that it was conscious. I thin

it was

just normal security. If anything like that

Mr. Johnston. So the only way the President would have been

told about something like AMLASH would have been.orally.

Mr. Halpern. I would think so.

MI. Johnston. And would Mr. Bundy have been privy to that

information?

Mr. Halpern. Not

necessarily.

MI. Johnston. Was he privy, to your knowledge?

Mr. Halpern. Not to my knowledge.

Mr. Johnston. On November 18th, 1963, President

Kennedy gave a speech in Miami saying - very much

anti-Castro.

Do you know whether Mr. Fitzgerald had an input to that

speech?

Mr. Halpern. I do not know. I would doubt it, but I don't

know for sure.

Mr. Johnston. Did you know the case officer proposed

telling AMLASH that Mr. Fitzgerald had drafted that part of

the speech?

Mr. Halpern. No, I did not know that. It may have been i

good ploy in terms of case officer-agent relationships, but 1

don't know of any like that.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you one more question on 1963.

Was the CIA actively involved in the relocation of exiles

in Miami to other parts of the country?

Mr. Halpern. Yes. We tried to help some of the people,

particularly the ones that were working for us, our former

agents, relocate them in this country or others. Yes. I

don't know who.

I can't give you names of people, but from time

to time we helped them, and we helped them in terms of intercediny

with HEW, with monies that they might have been getting from

HEW. That's all.

Mr. Johnston. Catholic Charities and Catholic Cuban

Relief was also involved, is that right?

Mr. Halpern. That's right.

Mr. Johnston. Was there a liaison between the Catholic

Charities and CIA?

Mr. Halpern. Not that I know of. Not an official one.

There may have been an unofficial one down in Miami, but I

the habit of questioning the Director's wishes.

MI. Johnston. Do you recall when you were first aware that

there was such an investigation taking place?

MI. Halpern. No, no, I don't know the day or the month or

anything like that. It was while Fitzgerald was still alive,

so it had to be sometime before he died in July.

MI. Johnston. Did Mr. Greer ask you about any connections

between the Kennedy assassination and CIA plots against Castro?

Mr. Halpern. No. The only comment I think he made

was

something to the effect that it was strange and ironic that the

day Kennedy died the case officer was trying to give AMLASH

a poison pen. That is the only connection that I remember.

not to talk about it, and I didn't.

Mr. Johnston. And other than Me. Greet, you talked to

no one else at the CIA about it in 1967.

Mr. Halpern. Well, I then talked to the IG himself when

he called me back up to go over some of the points.

MI. Johnston. Mr. Earman?

Mr. Halpern. Yes, Jack Earman.:

Ms. Johnston. And

was what I

didn't even hear rumors about it. He may have used the office

over at the CIA building, the old OSS bulldings on 23rd & E.

the old Public Health Service buildings.

Senator Schweiker. They were still in operation?

Mr. Halpern. I think the Agency still has some of those

buildings,. and the old Admin building, which used to be General

Donovan's headquarters or office was a very VIP type of arrange

ment, and it's possible -- it's possible that he may have used

that, because that has been used from time to time by other

Mr. Halpern. When

Senator Humphrey was Vice President,

his liaison with the Agency used one of those offices down

there.

I think his name was George Carroll. He used to be trainin:

you if you knew, to put you back in the environment of 1963,

If you had known about this flight from Mexico City to Havana

on the afternoon of the assassination, and if you had known about

the Lopez travel and the Porta-Villa allegation, and the fact

that AMLASH Or AMLASH's name had come up in the course of the

Mexico City investigation, would you have felt that those

facts would have justified a more complete investigation?

Senator Schweiker.

If you had known them at the time.

MI. Johnston. If I had

known them at the time, I sure

would have tried to find out more about them, and I would have

sat down and really sat down with Porta-Villa and asked him a

hell of a lot more, and tried to find out where he got the

information, how, the reliability of his source and so on,

and

I sure would have worked with the Mexican police to try to fin!

out

more about those flights.

I don't -- this

is all new to me, and if it hadn't, somethily

was

slipping. It really should have been gone into with a

vengeance, not that we would have gotten any

answers. I'm not

predicting that, but --

Mr: Johnston:

Dot mere use:

well With regard tomlet me

say, the November 22nd flight, that Information came In in early

December to CIA and was passed to Mexico City. There was

followup on it. Especially since it affected Cuba, wouldn't

a followup have been within SAS?

MI. Halpern. If it had to deal with working with the

Mexican Government and following it up, no, the action would have

been the WA Division, using SAS people in the Mexican station,

but the action would have.

gone to the Chief of Station for

his action, since he had the liaison with the Mexican police

and the internal

security people.

Mr. Johnston:

With regard to the Lopez matter, again in

March of that year, March of 1964, the Mexico City station was

informed through a source of unknown reliability that Lopez

was somehow involved in the

assassination.

You don't recall receiving that information?

Mx. Halpern. It may have crossed my desk, but I just don't

remember. I think I might have remembered if I had seen it.

Mr. Johnston. And is it your testimony that SAS did not

form a task force-or any kind of organized effort to investigate

Cuban connections?

Mr. Halpern.

Not that I know of. We responded to, I know,

the CI Staff in terms of traces and whatever else they asked

for, but we did not organize our own task force.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of the fact that the FBI

assassination was routed to SAS?

Mr. Halpern. I wasn't aware of it, but i assume it woula

have been.

Mr. Johnston. That would have been logical?

Mr. Halpern. If they had Fair Play for Cuba on it, we

would have gotten a copy from the Bureau and the front office

wouldn't have gotten it. It would have gone right to our

CI people, and the file people and the research people, and they

would extract the name and card it and have it available for

future reference.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of any other information on

Oswald that arrived in SAS before the assassination, specificalli

his contact in Mexico City?

Mr. Halpern. No, I

wasn't even aware of the Bureau's

report, but it is not unlikely for that, in Just normal

bureaucracy, if the Bureau puts out a report and it has the word

Cuba on it, and it gets over to CIA and you take

a look at it

and

you see Cuba, then it goes to the people who work on Cuba.

That's the way we get the information.

MI. Johnston.

And let me again make sure I understand

you.

SAS,

Did you testify that you knew of no senior staffer within

specifically assigned to the Kennedy investigation?

Mr. Halpern.

Not that I remember, no.

It is possible that

Mr. Malpern. Not necessarily. No. It could have -- if

It came in from the Warren Commission, it could have been

been knowledgeable of the matters we have discussed today?

Mr. Halpern.. The only other one - he wouldn't have been

knowledgeable of AMLASH - was the Chief of the Fi unit, who

has since died.

Senator Schweiker. Chief of what?

MI. Halpern. Foreign Intelligence.

Senator Schweiker. In

SAS.

Mr. Halpern. In SAS, we each had the components. We had

the CI unit, an FI unit, and a covert actions unit, just small

branches.

Senator Schweiker.

What were they?

Mr. Halpern. Foreign Intelligence, Counterintelligence,

and covert actions.

Senator Schweiker. They were the three basic elements.

Mr. Halpern. The three basics, and oh, one more, para-

military, which was technically part of covert action but was

set up as a separate branch because of the heavy involvement

in paramilitary activities, but Ed Morelius was Chief of the

unit, the Foreign Intelligence branch, and he would have

been

involved, if necessary, in some of the Warren Commission

stuff, but I just don't know for sure.

any discussion after November 22nd, to break off with AMLASH

or to have a cooling off period with AMLASH?

Mr. Halpern. I don't know of any instructions. I'm just

conjecturing now that there probably would have been a cooliny

off

period. I doubt if there was an order to break off

completely?

Mr. Johnston:

And why would you assume there was a cooling

off

period?

Mr. Halpern. Simply because nobody knew which way anything

was going to go on Cuba once it came out that Oswald was

connected in some tangential way with something to do with

Cuba, and things just got held, period.

Mr. Johnston. Do you have any what is the reason for

your statement that there may have been a cooling off period?

Do you have any actual information?

Mr. Halpern. No, except what later developed in the 303

Committee meeting, where our paramilitary activities were in

effect held, then. We were going to take a look, which is

something we have been

taking a look at for a long time ourselves.

Mr. Johnston. And

you associate the hold-down of paramiliay

activities with what, the Kennedy assassination or the new

President?

Mr. llalpern. I think the new President taking a look at

what we

were doing on Cuba, and that the paramilitary activities

were not having the desired effect, and I think as I testified

before, we on the task force, both under Harvey and under

Fitzgerald, kept saying this ain't the way to do it, but we

kept on doing it.

MI. Johnston. Finally, do you know, or were you present

in

any

discussions in December 1963 in the course of this

apparent policy review about AMLASH and what should be done

Mr. Halpern. I don't remember any meetings held on that,

and the meetings would have just been Fitzgerald, the case officer

and me, probably, or Fitzgerald and the case officer, because

as far as I know, the Deputy, Bruce Cheever, was not involved

In the AMLASH activity:

Mr. Johnston. Was there any concern at the time by

Mr. Fitzgerald or the case officer about what happened to the

poison pen?

Mr. Halpern. Not - that may have been when I was led

to believe that he didn't take it, and when I asked what happenell

to it, I don't remember what kind of an

answer I got.

Mr. Johnston. Were you concerned about what happened to

the pen?

MI. Halyern. No, because it wouldn't have

been useful

for anybody. You know, if somebody found that

pen on the

street, if it had been thrown away, they wouldn't use it as

a pen. It couldn't have been used

as a pen.

MI. Johnston.

What if AMLASH had taken the pen with him?

Mr. Halpern. I think if he took the pen

with him, if he

was going to use it, he would have had

a complete change of

heart.

As he told the case officer, he thought it was silly and

it wouldn't work, and

if he took it, I don't know why he would

take it. He wasn't going to use it.

Mr. Johnston.

would you be concerned, after the Kennedy

assassination, given what may have appeared to be a pro-Castro

automation, if AMLASH had taken the pen with him?

Mr. Halpern. No, no, because if he wanted to get rid

of Castro he would have gone ahead and gotten rid of Castro

anyway, whether Kennedy was assassinated or not.: If he was

going to have a coup, he was going to have a coup. The fact

that he didn't -- the pen didn't surface at his trial leads

me to believe that he either -- A, he didn't take the pen, or

B, if he took it, he didn't use it, he threw it away.

Mr. Johnston.

You were present at the time and I was not.

Let me just put to you the fact that if AMLASH had

possession of that pen, CIA was in a very compromising

position.

Mr. Halpern. Not true. He couldn't prove that CIA

gave it to him.

Mr. Johnston. Although he could identify the case officer.

MI. Halpern.

No, he couldn't. The case officer was

under some kind of a pseudonym.

Mr. Johnston.

But he could identify him by face.

Mr. Halpern. Well, he'd have a difficult time trying to

find him, coming up with a drawing, a police -

Mr. Johnston. And he could identify MI. Fitzgerald who

he met

a month before as the Attorney General's personal

representative.

Mr. Halpern eWell

he had met, him once and if he wanted

to find the Attorney General's personal representative, he'a

go through the whole office and couldn't find that face. So

I don't think the CIA was on the hot spot, I don't think the

CIA was under any kind of problem unless they stood everybody

up in a police line..

Senator, Schweiker. Well, refresh my recollection. Where

did he meet Fitzgerald?

Mr. Halpern. In Paris.

Senator Schweiker.

The month before.

Mr. Halpern. In October, yes, sir, not in November.

Mr. Johnston. And you indicate there was no concern

whatsoever.

Mr. Halpern. Well, I didn't have any concern. I don't

know about other people, but I didn't have

any concern.

Mr. Johnston. That any attempt to investigate Castro and

Castro's motivation vis-a-vis Kennedy might be very difficult

if AMLASH had kept the pen.

Mr. alpern. No, I didn't. As I say, the fact that the

pen never surfaced in the course of the trial -- it was a biụ

ghow trial as I remember. It was an indication to me that A,

he didn't take it, and if my initial information was correce,

or B, if he did take it, he didn't use it and threw it away,

because not much was made of the pen as a pen, and I could

see them making all kinds of publicity gimmicks out of that if they

Senator Schwelker. Sam, what, in your recollection, now,

just your recollection, what kind of a role was Army intelligence

playing with the Anti-Castro activities at the time? I am a

little puzzled just as to why the role was even there at all in

what they were doing.

What existed then that does not exist now in terms of

Army intelligence, of what mission they had?

Mr. Halpern. Army intelligence was to get tactical or

strategic intelligence from clandestine sources, and they were

in there trying to do as much as they could, getting intelligence

on Cuba and what the soviets might be doing on cuba.

Mr. Johnston. But if they were working with a group

such as Alpha 66, it was more, it would get into the paramilitary

covert field, would it not?

Mr. Halpern.

It would.

Senator Schweiker.

Who would have been directing that

Army intelligence setup at that time?

Mr. Halpern. I don't remember who it was, and I don't

remember who the chief of the intelligence unit was at that

time, and again, they may have been dealing with Alpha 66

for intelligence purposes, and Alpha 66 could have been using

some of that money that they got for paramilitary.

Senator Schweiker. For paramilitary

purposes.

MI. Halpern. In other words, I'm not saying the Army hau

control over their people as we did over

some of our Cuban

groups in the course of our activities.

Senator Schweiker. But they could have been using them

for intelligence purposes and not for paramilitary purposes.

Mr. Halpern. That's correct, but even intelligence

purposes and this is one of the reasons why we finally offered

the Army to run our boats with their agents, put our agents

aboard, so that the Army wouldn't have to A, create its own

capability, or use Alpha 66 or any other kind of boats in the

area, so that they would have a source of boats, namely, us.

Senator Schweiker. In other words, you eventually worked

out an agreement with them?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, sure, we worked with them.. As I say,

we helped -

Senator Schweiker. When would that have been? When did

the agreement come out, roughly?

Mr. Halpern. Oh, '63, '64, something like that.

Senator Schweiker. And this was to avoid duplication

andl

overlap?

Mr. Halpern. Overheating areas.

Senator Schweiker. And your deal was to provide what?

Mr. Halpern. We provided radios, radio training, and ls.

the ferry service.

Senator Schweiker. The boats.

Mr. Halpern. The boats.

I was present in the eatly days of

the use

of

ait.

the polygraph when an Indonesian officer was

here on a trip,

and one of the show and tell was to show him the polygraph

and how it operates. And they tested it on him. He agreed

to be tested. And they gave him a box, a little cardboard

box with a key In it, and they said, take the

• key out. so he

took the key out and he held it in his hand. And then the

question is, were you given a box with a key in it? And not

a blip. Did you take the key out of the box? No. Not a

blip..and.so on.:.

so the use of the polygraph is a tool, it's an extra file

check, it's an extra drawer that you have to look in, but it

is not the be all and end all of all questions.

I mean, I saw this happen.

Senator Schweiker. So you are a disbeliever.

Mr. Halpern. I am a believer in that as long as you use

It as another file check and not as the answer, and this is why

people say he's on polygraph, he's off the polygraph. That

is fine. You've got to use it, but don't believe everything

that comes off of that.

And these polygraph operators have learned

a lot since

them. What I'm talking

about goes-back to about 1950, and in
