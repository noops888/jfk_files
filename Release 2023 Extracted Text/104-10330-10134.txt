Translation Information for Attachments
to JFK Document 104-10018-10070
1. A CIA translator confirmed that the attachment,
dated 1 December 1963, is a translation of the full-page
attachment in Dutch and Spanish dated 1 December 1963..
The translator reported that the translation reads a little
awkwardly, but the original, a telegram, was also rather
awkward. He further stated that the Dutch text on the same
page was also a translation of the Spanish text above it.
2. The following is a translation for attachment
AC-56, dated 2 December 1963:
SUBJECT: Statements by SANTOS MESA
It has been heard that during a USSR reception on
7 November of this year, the third secretary of the Cuban
Embassy in the Hague, Richardo SANTOS MESA, was asked about
CASTRO's reaction to attacks on Cuba by Cuban exiles.
He
replied "Just wait, and you will see what we can do; it will
happen soon." (quoted response given in English in the
original)
SANTOS declined to elaborate.
It has also been heard that SANTOS has a brother who lives
in the United States as an "exile."
Although this brother is pro-Castro, he is said to have
left Cuba at the urging of his conservative wife.
SANTOS is said to exchange correspondence with this
brother.
