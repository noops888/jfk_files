Chief, Information Review Team

Office of Security

Coordination of Two Roselli Memos

1. The Office of Security (OS) has reviewed the

following per request of the Historical Review Group (HRG) :

*18 May 1966 Memo to the Director of the FBI from OS

Director Howard Osborn reporting a meeting between former OS

Director, Colonel Sheffield Edwards and John Roselli, a

Mafia figure.

*27 May 1966 Memo to the Director of the FBI from Howard

Osborn detailing a phone conversation between Colonel

Edwards, James O'Connell of OS and John Roselli.

In summary, OS concurs with HRG in the full

declassification and release of the two memos.

It is noted

the relationship between OS and Mafia personalities has been

documented in great detail not only in prior official

releases but newspapers and other periodicals.

Additionally, it appears the release of the memos will not

adversely affect Agency sources or methods of collection.
