ADEX should ve changed to include the new alias and

subject's positione a staff writer for the Times.

since subject is writing under a still different pseudonym,

for the Monterey Park Progress newspapers, it is suggested

that consideration be given to advising the Internal Revenue

Service that she may be receiving payroll checks under these

The Director has inquired concerning the procedure which

was followed in the Atomic Energy Act applicant case whereby

Tolo.

Neaso

the Hashington Field Office was not alerted to the fact that

M133 Gandy.

Harold Ickes, whose name was given as a reference, should not be

interurewed.

There is attached a

memorandum dated December 20, 1949 frOm

Mr. Rosen to ur. Ladd with respect to the specifio atomic energy case

mentioned, namely Ired Ernest Schnepfe, who had given Harold Ickes

as a rejerence on his PSQ or application form.

from a reading of the

attached memorandum which was prepared by section Chief G. C. Callan

of the Applicant section, it is obvious that the supervisors uno handle

applicani matters in the Investigative Division do not have any policy

with respect to the interurewing of rejerences, former employers,.

associates or others except where the Bureau has specifically indicated

that certain individuals should not be contacted, such as Henry Steele

commager, personnel of CBS and the like. As a matter of fact, the

present policy in effect it the seat of Government concerning applicant

investigations is to interview all references and the attached memorandum

indicates that Harold Ickes had been interviewed in the past in connec

tion with applicant investigations and has exhibited a cooperative

attitude. It would seem, therefore, that no action should be taken

with respect to the supervisory personnel at the seat of Government con

cerning the referral of Harold Ickes' name to the Hashington Field

Office for interview in connection with the stomic Energy Act case:'"

mentioned.

As you know, at the Executives conference the Director's wishes

with regard to interviewing persons who have demonstrated hostile.

attitudes toward the Bureau have been considered in the past ond no

instructions have been issued to the supervisors at the seat of Gover

ment or to the field concerning this matter except as to specific in

dividuals

whose names have been sent to the field in the recent post

in an SAC letter. This matter was called to the attention of the

Executives conference as recently as December 20, 1919 and the Confer-

ence felt it would be undesirable for the Bureau

to embark upon a pro

gram of aduising the field to not interview certain individuals in

connection with various types of investigations conducted by the Bureau.

The Executives Conference realized that the hostile attitule toward the

Bureau stèms not from our criminal investigative work but fron the

Bureau's investigative activity in the jield of applicant

investigatiors

and

the Loyalty program. The Conference feels that the blacklisting

of individuals is fundamentally bod and will ultimately result in ei

treme embarrassment to the Bureau.

jifficult to draft a letter to all sAd's pointing up the problem to

them and expecting them to adhere to any policy which will eliminate

the difficulty which we have encountered heretofore.

I have discussed this matter with dr. Carison in some detail

and he jeels that we may be. able to control to some extent the inter

viewing of persons hostile to the iureau at the seat of Government

without furnishing a "black list" or statement of policy to the field.

Ir. Carison feels, and I agree with hin, that the major portion of our

aifficulty stems from the Loyalty investigations and applicant investi

gations.

Iro Carison and I therefore propose that the following pro-

cedure be instituted immediately at the seat of Government in order to

meet the objectives desired by the Director in connection with this

matter:

I. The Crime Records Section shall be responsible for preparing

and maintaining in a current status a list of those individuals known

to be hostile to the bureau. It is felt that' it is imperative that a

list bé prepared. because the judgment of individual Supervisors re-

ferring cases to the field will differ depending upon the extent of

their day to day newspaper reading, radio listening and perusal of

various and sundry periodicals.

It would also mean that each superuisor

would have to either prepare his own list or endeavor to depend on a

saulty memory. Furthermore, an individual may at one time appear to be

hostile to the bureau and subsequently his attitude may change and it

may be very desirable to intervier him.

2. This list shall be furnished to only those supervisors at the.

seat of Government who have the responsibility for assigning Loyalty

or applicant cases

to the field. This will include supervisors in the

Loyalty section of the security Division, the Applicant Section of the

Investigative Division and those supervisors in the Administrative

Division handling Bureau applicant cases

This will mean that not more

than 25 supervisors at most at the seat of Government will have pos-

session of such a list. These supervisors shall check all references

and present and former employers against this list bejore referring

the case to the field for investigation.

It should be realized that the procedure recommended will not

provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or

associates whose names are brought up during the course of the inves-

tigation.

It is felt, however,

that the bulk of the people who are

interviewed in these cases are

set out as references by the applicant

and it would only be on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the

Bureau will be interviewed on a neighborhood investigation or as an

associate of the applicant.

respect to the procedures in conducting applicant lait.

investation ant particularl the method suggested to avoidinters ge

views with those individuals having a hostile or critical attitude,

toward the bureau and its work.

It was pointed out to the Conference that apparently the

hostility and criticism of the bureau stem not from our normal day to

day criminal investigative work but to a very slight extent to inves

tigations in the Internal security field and very specifically and

¡definitely to applicant and Loyalty investigations.

It was feit that

is some procedure could be devised to avoid interviews with individuals

in applicant type cases where the individuals have exhibited a hostile

or critical attitude toward the bureau that much could be accomplished

to eliminate the difficulties experienced in the past. The conjerence

felt it would be undesirable to prepare a list of any sort which might

¡be termed a

"blacklist" to be distributed to all of the divisional

offices.

It was proposed that the following procedure be instituted

immediately at the seat of Government in order to meet the objectives

desired by the Director in connection with this matter:

It was pointed out that the procedure recommended will not

provide against interviews with neighbors of the applicants or subjects

under investigation in connection with the Loyalty program nor would it

provide against interuiews of associates whose nomes are brought up

during the course of the investigation. Likewise it would not provide

against interviews. with college professors whose names were not given

by the applicant or the Loyalty subject as references, but who are

contacted. in the course of the ordinary investigation.

It was jelt,

however, that the bulk of the people who are interviewed in these

cases are set out as references by the applicant and it would only be

on a rare occasion that a person hostile to the Bureau would be inter

viewed in a neighborhood investigation, as an associate or as a college

professor.

"It was also unanimously recommended by the Conference that in

specific individual has manifested hostility or unjust criticism against

the Bureau that the specific jield office or offices which would likely

contact the individual be advised in writing in the form of a Personal

and Confidential SaC letter. In these letters the SAC will be instructed

that it is his responsibility to aduise all of the Agents in the office

of the undesirability of contacting the individual in question without

prior Bureau authority.

The field will be instructed that in address-

ing their communications to the Bureau requesting authority to contact

such individuals, the letter or communication should not contain the

phraseology that

the interview will be conducted unless aduised to the

contrary but specific approval must be obtained from the Bureau bejore

such a contact is made.

Should the Director agree with the recommendations of the

conference set forth in this memorandum, appropriate steps will be

taken to inaugurate the policy recommended.

Respectfully,

For the Conference

RE: COURTNEY A EVANS

PERSON NOT TO BE CONTACTED

On December 10, 1966, Senator Robert F. Kennedy released

to the press a copy of a letter to him dated February 17, 1966, from

former Assistin Director Courtney A. Evans. In direct contradiction

to official memc. auda prepared by Evans for Bureau files during the

early 1960's., his February 17, 1966, letter to Kennedy stated that

Evans! did not discuss the use of "microphones by the FLe with Kennedy

during his tenure as Attorney General--nor did Evans "know of any

written material that was sent to you"' (Kennedy) "at any time concerning"

microphone surveillances.

In view of; Evans' obvious lack of integritv, distegard for

the truth and duplicity toward the FBI, he should net be contacted

without prior Bureau approval.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

MERE VS20.00

DATE

in line with the Director's approval, the Attorney General was

contacted this morning, July 7, 1961, relative to his observation as to the

possibility of utilizing "electronic devices" in organized crime investigations.

It was pointed out to the Attorney General that we had taken action

with regard to the use of microphone surveillances in these cases and while

they represented an expensive investigative step, we were nevertheless utilizing

them in all instances where this was technically feasible and where valuable

information might be expected. The strong objections to the utilization of

telephone taps as contrasted to microphone surveillances was stressed.

The

Attorney General stated he recognized the reasons why telephone taps should

be restricted to national-defense type cases and he was pleased we had been

using microphone surveillances where these objections do not apply wherever

possible in organized crime matters.

The Attorney General noted that he had approved several technical

surveillances in connection with security-type investigations since he took

office, but that he had not kept any record and didn't really know what he had

approved and what surveillances were currently in operation. He said that for

his own information he would like to see a list of the technical surveillances

now in operation. He added that this could be brought over to him personally

and that he would look it over and immediately return it because he realized

the importance of having these records maintained under the special security

conditions which only the FBI had.

If the Director approves, we will have the list of technical

then returned to the Bureau's file.

WASHINGION 25. D. C.

August 17, 1961

In connection with the use of microphone

surveillances it is frequendly necessary to lease a special telephone.

line in order to monitor such a surveillance. These situations

occur when it is impossible to locate a secure monitoring point

in the irmediate vicinity of the premises covered by the microphone.

Even though a special telophone line is utdized, this activity in

no way involves any interception of telephonic communications and

is noi a ielephone tap.

In the New York City area the telephone company

has over the years insisted thai a letter be furnished to the telephone

company on eaci occasion when a special telephone line is leased by

the 231.

It is required that such a lease arrangement be with the

approval of the Attorney General. In the pest we have restricted

the utilization of leased lines in New Yor's City to situations involving

telephone taps, all of which have been approved by tiù ittorney General.

We have not previcusly used leased es in connection

with microphone surveillances because of certain technical carriculties

which exisied in New York City. These technical difficulties have,

however, now been overcome.

ii we are permitted to use leased telephone

lines as an adjunct to our microphone survalances, this type of coverage

can be materially extendeú both in securily and major criminal cases.

Accordingly, your approval of our utilizing this leased line arrangerent

is requested. A sample oi the letter which it is proposed will be sent

to the telezone company it a leased line is secured in connection wit

microphone surveillances is attached.

The Not To Contact list is a card index of 332 in-

on oificial business, gave rise to doubts as to the advisability

When a person was placed on the

Not Io Contact list, the Field Office covering the residence

or occupation or both was advised that this particular individual

should not be contacted without prior Bureau authority. Thus,

the Not To Contact list did not prohibit future contact, but

specified it could be made only after clearance with the Bureau.

Examples of the type of individuals on this list

are sei furii belun.

- DE. Vannevar

DI. Bush was placed on

the Not Io Contact list in June, 1964, at

which time he was connected with the Massachusetts

Institute of Technology.. He was so designated

when he made derogatory statements concerning the

•Bureau when contacted on an applicant-type case.

Rex' Stout: Rex Stout is an author who was

designated for this list in 1965 because of his then-

new mystery novel, "The Doorbell Rang."

This novel

presented a highly distorted and most unfavorable

picture of the FBI in its operations as they relate

to the plot of the book.
