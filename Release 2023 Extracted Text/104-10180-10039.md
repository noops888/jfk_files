conn Hale MUNSON, born 1905, rcuident of los

ngeles, aproached LICorEr/l in 190% claiming he

epresented a large group of Cuban exiles in the Lor

Angeles area. MUNSON asked LICCIFT/l about the location

of training camps, etc. LICO!T/l reported the discussion

to Station Mexico City and was instructed to avoid MUNiON.

Donn Hale MUNiON is probably identical with the vonn MUNSON

2. There are numerous traces on Juan BlUING! Aircorbe,

the oner o: the weapons plant named ir the jage article.

The FBI also reported ERrElAdA ms Involved in the sale of

arns to Cubun revolucionaries in 1905. although RI was Ui

ible to locute the report, it was classicied to ranolo it's

any weapons supplied by ENQUIAGA': fion went to the JURE

He claimed he does not have any

He still maintains his half hour radio

broadcast over

Puerto Rican radio stations.

This

is prepared by his people and the radio

time donated so the cost is minimal.

Although he maintains contact with

active

menvers of his

"movement" they have no

present or projected plans for "action" except

in the propaganda field.

His business in the prefabricated

MIG-21--Defecting Pilot--ot al.

In lengthy discussiong on this point it developed

that Ray has beon unable to obtain any more pertinent infor-

mation since he first callod the matter to AMBADGER's

attention almost two months ago.

The basis of the

Plot"

brought to him by somoone oxiting Cuba.

inside contact

roliable but prefers not to identity him.

Ray has not been ablo to determine if the inside contact

is porsonally in contact, or can arrange contact, with the

'Mig Pilot who reportedly is led up with the situation in

Cuba and plans to defoct with his airplane whenever he has

an opportunity.

The "tip" Ray received was to this effect

1.0.1

that there is a Mix Pilot who is disenchanted and

plans to defect with his plano.

One point Ray

was specific

on was that the plane was described as

Migs"

"one of the smaller

and according to Ray 1t is not a Mig-21.

2.

After Ray's original contacts with AMBADGER on this

subject (wherein

the plane was apparently erroneously

identified as a MIG-21) Ray claims he sent a message to the

insido contact requesting the complete details we had asked

foi.

He has received no reply.

In response to my request

at the meeting on 13 October 1966 he told me at our subsequent

meeting on 15 October that he attempted to reach his inside

contact by phone but was unsuccessful.

He was urged to

continuo until he reached the party and to obtain as much

detail on this matter as possible so we could nopefully

clarify the situation.

He assurred me he would follow-through

on this and report to

AMBADGER.

(It seemed protty obvious to

me aftor two discussions with Ray on this subject that he has

no direct means of reaching the original reporting source on

the

"Mig

Plot" and consequently may never be able to verify

the original "tip" and obtain further details.

We both agreed that if

NEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

Personal Situation:

a personal friend and JURE colleague who is in the

publicity business.

RAY said he just signed a

contract for the planning of a commercial develop-

ment

site in San Juan,

from which he will realize

several thousand dollars profit.

His principal

(and pet) project is the promotion and attempt to

raise through private funds the financing of a

plant to mass produce low-cost prefabricated housing

designed by him.

He claims with an investment of

$200,000 he can mass produce prefabricated homes to

sell

for $3,000 which would be ideal for Puerto

Rico's needs.

Recent Trip to Santo Domingo:

b.

RAY said his recent trip to Santo Domingo

was strictly for business purposes.

He hopes to

start a small project in Santo Domingo to produce

prefabricated

housing.

The small project he has

get underway with

an expenditure of

$80,000, which he feels confident can be raised

in Santo Domingo.

He said he naturally talked with

some people in

the government about Cuba and the

JURE, but that the government mast become stronger

and more confident before there would be any possi-

bility of obtaining their assistance--or blessing--

in conductiny any activities against Cuba.

Internal Contacts.

d. One gets the impression that Ril lires

somewhat removed fron the actual realities o the

Cuban internal situation.

He has a tendener to

compare

the internal situation today with that

which

existed in Batista's time when he (RIY) sas

one of the leaders of the 26th of July underground

resistance

movement in Habana. RAY maintains

direct personal contact with many new arrivals

seeking asylum both in Puerto Rico and the U.S.

and also undoubtedly receives a certain anount of

general information and gossip from other JURE

contacts and supporters.

He claims to have many

friends

and

former associates inside, which is

probably true, but does not have any regular or

secure means to communicate with them.

It appears

obvious that these friends and contacts are not

working together,

if at all,

and that he has no

cohesive resistance group or force as such inside.

I questioned him about several personalities

such as Carlos Franqui,

Pedro Miret, Emilio Aragones,

and others.

He had no specific information at all

on their activities in recent months but said ne

"could get it if you want it."

In summary on this

point, it would appear that RAY and the JURE main-

tain no regular contact with any internal "supporters";

that he undoubtedly still has many former friends

and supporters inside but just what they would do--

or how far they would go--to support him is a zoot

question.

JURE Propaganda Activities.

The JURE, Manolo RAY, Emilio Guede, and

others, have a half-hour weekly program which is

carried on 4 different Puerto Rican radio stations

between 6:30-7:30 PM each Sunday.

features commentaries on

which is taped in advanceinterviews with recently

news and events in Cuba,

and other items of current interest

arrived refugees the program is composed without cost

and all radio time on the 4 stations is donated free

of charge.

Future Plars.

Ray is a man who is relaxed, is now engaged

in making a legitimate livellhood for himself,

his

children but still seriously dedi-

i called and motivated towards secking the overthrou

of the Castro government: He has a realistic outlook

to a considerable degrce, although as mentioned in

paragraph d.,

above, his viewpoints on the reality

of the internal situation in present day Cuba are

somewhat naive.

As an experienced resistance organizer

and fighter in the 26th of July movement against

Batista, he knows the value of propaganda in preparing

the general populace for resistance.

He also knows

that propaganda is useless and counterproductive

• without: follow-up positive results. He speaks of

continuing his local radio broadcasts (which he

readily admits are useful only to maintain some

spirit amongst the exiles for possible future use),

and at some later date--he has no timetable--hopes

to obtain facilities in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, or

some other site where he can beam broadcasts into Cuba.

His intention being to follow-up the broadcasts with

action:

He speaks again of clandestine entry

into

Cuba himself to contact sources

within, prove

to

people that there is a resistance movement, and to

form a nucleus for later

action.

He openly admits

the blunder of his last "publicized" return and that

if it is done

again it must be completely clandestine

and unannounced.

He seems to have no fear of returning

and claims he still has plenty of friends who would

hide and help him.

He made an off-hand reference to

the Agency furnishing him assistance to enter clan-

destinely at some future date.

He was told that his

sources in Miami surely knew of several "family run"

operations which could take him

successfully to Cuba

if and when he was ready to return.

Financial Situation.

RAY made no request for financial assistance

and from all indications is doing fairly well in his

local business.

RAY plans to travel to the U.S. inerly November for

about two weeks and said he would visit JuRe representatives

in several large

cities,

including D.C.

He will be in touch

with AMBADGER

who will be vacationing in the U.s.

and hopefully they will be able to get together sith

the writer while in D.C.

In any event, RAY obviously likes,

'espects and accepts AMBADGER as our go-between

and I believe be will keep AMBADGER posted

on most of his

activities.

anolo RAY, as exiles go, certainly seems like on€

of the better of the lot and contact on the scene by AMBADGEE

on a regular basis should be adequate to keep up with his

activities.

Occasional contact by an Agency

staff officer,

could be useful in keeping AMBADGER's relationship

fully alive.

inside support in Cuba and contacts who are anti-regime and prepared

to assist him when needed. He did not reveal to QUSPORT-I, however,

whe the pecple were or where they are located.

RAY told QUSPORT-I that he wanted very much to see the writer

concerning a delicate operational matter. When pressed by QUSPORT-L

RAY said he had access to a MIG pilot in Cuba who was ready and anxious

to leave Cuba and was willing to fly out a MIG aircraft. RAY did not

mention the name or location of the pilot or the model MIG aircraft he was

Neither did he discuss his ways and means of communication with

the pilot and how he had determined the pilot's intentions to defect with

his airplane:

He admitted that a MIG aircraft might not now have as much value

to the U.S. because of the recent access to a MIG-2i in Isreal but that it

would have tremendous propaganda value il a Cuban pilot defected and

with the weiter because if the operation were successful he did not want

latter part u the conversation on this subject when he learned QUSPORT-l

was coming to Washington the following day, asked him to check with the

writer to determine if it was OK for him (RAY) to discuss this subject with

3. I told QUSPORT to phune RAY and assure him that I wanted

him to pass all the details to AMBADGER even thuugh according lo

QUSPORT-l's arrangement this was not necessary. QUSPORT-I was

unable, however, la reach RAY by phone during the afternoon of

20 August.

•1. About 8 p.m. on 20 August I receired a collect phone call

from AMBADGER from San Juan. AMBADGER was very excited and

said he had to see me right away. After he settled down a bit he sold

me he had just left RAY and his two local lieutenants Emilio GUEDE

and Arturo VILLAR (the so-called triumvirate of the JURE): He said

RAY had contacted him and the four of them discussed the possibility

of defecting a Cuban MIG pilut and having him bring out his plane. In

essence and from what I could discuss over the phone the details were

substantially the same as those given to me by QUSPORT-l earlier in

the day. AMBADGER said he needed my guidance right away and

further urged me to come to San Juan to discuss the matter with RAY

who was pressing AMBADGER to see me.

He said he had agreed to see

RAY latter that night. I told AMBADGER I could not make the trip in

the next few days and that further there were a few bagic facts I needed

to convince me that RAY really had the potential to pull off the operation.

I told AMBADGER to see RAY later that evening and to try and determine

the following:

a. Name of the MIG pilot.

b. Military field where he is stationed.

c. Type MiG he flys.

d. RAY's commo if any with the pilot.

e. Estimated timing for the defection, i. e., has the pilor

indicated he was ready to deject and awaiting instructions,

it c.

I asked AMBADGER to phone me if he could develop any further

information. AMBADGER phoned Mr. Mahoney on the afternoon of

24 August to report he had attempted to obtain further details from RaY

following his conversations with the writer but that RAY had replied he

did not know the name of the pilot or other details of the operation. (See
