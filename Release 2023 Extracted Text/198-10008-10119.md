1. Control of Travel to and from Cuba

Central Intelligence Agency

a. Developed highly useful information on frequency

of Cuban "chartered flights to Brazil, names and nationali-

ties of passengers and crew, and lax measures of control

followed by Brazilian authorities. Transmitted this informa-

tion to station chiefs in the Latin American countries of the

non-Brazilians travelling on those flights.

b. Maintained close watch over travel to and from

Cuba. See Annex B for table of known travel of Latin

Americans during July and August.

c. As a result of information furnished to him by

the CIA Station in Buenos Aires and with

indicated that he would

make every effort to prevent Argentine delegates from attend-

ing the International Union of Architects Congress in Havana.

d. At the urging of the CIA Station and the Embassy,

the Bolivian Minister of Interior issued in mid-July an

order prohibiting the granting of travel permits to Cuba or

other bloc countries to Bolivian nationals.

e. Partly as a result of the efforts of the CIA

station in Santiago, the Government of Chile prohibited the

entry into Chile of organizers of the Cuban-sponsored Second

Latin American Youth Congress, which had been scheduled to

take place in Santiago in August. This was one of the

factors which led to postponement of the Congress.

f. After considerable prodding by the CIA Station

and the Embassy the Minister of Public Security of Costa

Rica presented legislative proposals to the Costa Rican

Assembly which will require all persons intending to travel

to Communist countries to have their travel approved by a

newly created Costa Rican security agency.

g. CIA Station in Mexico City developed information

concerning the clandestine arrival of passengers in Vera Cruz

on Cuban merchant ships. Efforts are being made to obtain

more information and to encourage stricter controls by the

Mexican authorities.

Department of State

a. Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade

Guinean authorities to deny use oi airport facilities by

flights on Habana-Moscow route.

These efforts achieved a

temporary withholding of permission for future regular flights,

at least until such time as the Soviets develop cheir own

refueling facilities at Conakry.

b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian

authorities to express our deep concern at the growing

frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request

their cooperation in curbing them. Also instructed our

Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with CIA

station chiefs in furnishing the names of nationals of those

countries travelling on these flights to local authorities

and urging them: (1) to institute tighter controls on their

own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their

concern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil

as a way station for transporting subversives.

c. As a result of representations made to the

British Government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands

carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed

an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the

use of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit

points for passengers. The British intend to require transit

visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to

reject applications for such visas except in certain special

cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from

leaving their aircraft, or would be returned to their point

of origin.

d. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to

inform the Mexican airline CMA that the United States is

opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to

carry refugees from Habana to Central America. CMA, as a

result, stated that they had no intention of proceeding

further with this project.

e. Instructed our missions in Curacao and the Hague

to investigate a report that KLM was planning to renew.

scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US

opposition to resumption of air service to Cuba. KLM assured

our Embassy that there is no plan to initiate service,

scheduled or non-scheduled, to Habana.

Â£. Instructed Embassy Ottawa to express our strong

objections to a proposal that a Cubana charter flight pick

up a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly them

to Cuba. The flight was not authorized.

g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigate

Cubana approaches to secure flight facilities. Mission

reported on August l that the Governor bad no knowladge of

any talks between the B.G. Ministry of Communications and

the Cuban Government regarding landing rights for Cubana

planes.

The Governor indicated his intention to inquire

further and to keep us advised. London reported that neither

the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the

issue of landing rights with H.M.G.

h. Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica

and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban Government

in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 58

American students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also

informed Pan American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban

request for a PAA charter flight to fly the students from

Habana to New York.

i. Instructed our missions at Port of Spain and

Barbados on several occasions to approach these governments

to express the concern of the U.S. at indications of Cuban

interest in the use of their aviation facilities.

Embassy Port of Spain discussed with the Foreign Secretary

of Trinidad various legal moves available that would enable

GOTT to control movements of aircraft within their territory,

citing examples of such controls instituted by Mexico, Canada

and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal that

the list of suggestions be made available to the aviation

officials concerned.

j. During a previous reporting period Embassy

Santiago urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to

Cuban delegated to a preparatory meeting for the II Latin

American Youth Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean

capital. Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean

visas for this meeting is one of the contributing factors to

the Cuban sponsors announcing during August that the meeting

had been postponed.

k. Sent general instructions to our missions in

countries which participate in the International Union of

Architects asking them to urge the cooperation of governmental

authorities in preventing or discouraging the attendance of

their nationals to the VII UIA Congress in Habana, September

29 - October 4, 1963. Followed this up with instructions to

individual posts to try where feasible to dissuade

architects from free world countries from serving on the jury

for the selection of a Bay of Pigs monument.

1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to

commence food parcel shipments to Cuba on a commercial basis

that would have required the establishment of scheduled

weekly charter flights by Canadian planes.

2. Control of Movement of Cuban Propaganda

Central Intelligence Agency

Responding to the urging of the CIA Station, police

of the State of Guanabara seized large quantities of

ropaganda brought into Brazil by passengers on the specia

ubana flights. For example, some 50 pounds of printed

propaganda was taken from the various passengers who arrived

on the 16 August Cubana flight.

3. Control of Clandestine Movement of Guerrillas and Arms

Department of Defense

a. Continued surveillance of the area surrounding

Cuba during the months of July and August at the same rate

and with the same emphasis as prior to 1 July 1963.

b. Continued to maintain U.S. Forces, primarily from

within the Atlantic Command, available to assist other

Caribbean governments in the interception of suspicious craft

in territorial waters, as might be requested. No such

requests were received from any other government during the

period covered by this report. However, U.S. Forces did keep

track of the location of the Soviet merchant freighter

MITCHURINSK, which was suspected of carrying subversives and

arms from Cuba to British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINSK

was under U.S. surveillance from its departure from Habana.

until United Kingdom forces assumed the task of kesping this

ship under surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown,

British Guiana. Subsequently, British police search of

MITCHURINSK in British Guiana waters revealed nothing of a

suspicious nature.

Central Intelligence Agency

At the repeated urging of the CIA Station in Lima,

the Peruvian Government late in August published a new anti-

terrorists law providing a penalty of no less than five

vears imprisonment for persons who participate in guerrilla

activities or in the illegal manufacture of weapons or

explosives.

The Peruvian National Intelligence Service is working

on a lead furnished by the CIA Station in Lima concerning a

200 ton vessel reportedly involved in arms traffic.

Department of State

Instructed our Consulate General in Georgetown to

investigate reports that commercial cargoes (which could

conceal illicit arms traffic out of Cuba) had developed

between British Guiana and Cuba. Investigations to date

have been negative.

4. Control of Transfer of Funds

Department of State

Cooperated with the Foreign Assets Control Office

of the Treasury Department in developing blocking controls

with respect to Cuba which went into effect on July 9, 1963.

5. Strengthening of Counter-Insurgency Capabilities

Department of Defense

a.

Continued the installation of military communica

tions facilities in Latin America. Operatioal dates for

the multi-channel radio stations to be installed in Managua,

Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa, Honduras have been delared to 15

October 1963 and 15 December 1963, respectively because of

new engineering and contractual requirements. Negotiations

are continuing with Colombia and Ecuador for installation

of U.S. military radio facilities. Completion of a new

commercial trans-isthmian cable in the Panama Canal Zone

within the coming month is expected to improve military

communications within the United States and the Commander-

in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command.

b. Continued the surveillance of Cuba by U.S.

Forces, reporting as before to U.S. commanders, organiza-

tions

and agencies. Reports of surveillance have been

disseminated to all who have a requirement to know.

c. Established a 24 hour per day, 7 day per week

duty watch at the U.S. Military Groups in the Caribbean

countries in conjunction with implementation of the military

alerting system.

Continued efforts to staff the U.S.

Southern Command Intelligence Center with properly cleared,

trained personnel (this center is the military focal point

for relaying information concerning the movement of

subversives). Filled, partially, the authorized billets in

the U.S. Southern Command Intelligence Center and took

under consideration the problem of an increase in the billet

structure in the Center. The Commander-in-Chief, U.S.

Southern Command together with his intelligence officer

visited Honduras and Nicaragua and determined that no

significant problems existed which would interfere with

effective operations in those countries.

d. Action previously initiated by the Commander,

U.S. Naval Forces, Southern Command (COMUSNAVSO) to establish

a Small Craft Inspection and Training Team (SCIATT) as a

contribution to the Caribbean Surveillance System is progress-

ing satisfactorily. Permanent assignment of U.S. Coast Guard

personnel to SCIATT in the Canal Zone has been approved and

the U.S. Coast Guard has taken appropriate implementing

actions.

e. During the period of this report, the SCIATT con-

ducted an on-the-job training course at Puntarenas, Costa

Rica. Training was given to 13 members of the Guardia Civil

of Costa Rica who were either newly assigned to the 40 foot

Coast Guard utility boats (CGUBs) or were to be assigned as

replacement crew members.

f. A quarterly inspection and evaluation of the CGUBs

provided other Central American countries was conducted

during the period 17 to 31 August by a mobile training team

(MTT) made up of SCIATT personnel.

&. Continued efforts to improve the internal security

of Latin American armies through the provision of Intelligence

Advisors. Presently there are such advisors assigned to 14

Latin countries, emphasizing counterintelligence and counter-

subversion.

h. During the reporting period MTTs conducted train-

ing in counterinsurgency for the armed forces of Colombia,

BolIvia, Venezuela, Peru and El Salvador.

1. Civic Action MTIs were sent to Guatemala, Bolivia,

Colombia, El Salvador, Jamaica and Ecuador.

Exchange of Intelligence on Cuban Subversion

Central Intelligence Agency

CIA Stations throughout Latin America continued in

a great majority of countries to furnish to the local internal

security organizations with whom they are in liaison informa-

tion concerning travelers to and from Cuba, as well as such

information as came to CIA's attention concerning the movement

of funds, arms and propaganda material. In many instances,

the furnishing of information to the internal security

service by the CIA Station was paralleled by the furnishing of

similar information to the Foreign Office by the Ambassador

or his representative. The response to this information has

varied greatly. The Central American countries, in general,

began to pay greater attention to the information and act on

it. At the other extreme, the Brazilian Government during

the reporting period showed little inclination to follow up

on the information.

Department of State

a. Reiterated to the Foreign Minister of Peru our

interest in having the facts of the Puerto Maldonado incident

brought to the attention of the OAS, and urged that this

action be taken as soon as possible.

b. Urged the Government of Guatemala to submit

evidence of communist activity to the OAS.

7. Surveillance of Cuban Diplomatic, Commercial and Cultural

Missions

Department of State

Instructed Embassy La Paz to follow up closely on

charges of involvement by the Cuban mission in internal

policies of Bolivia, and, at the Embassy's discretion, to

point out to Bolivian officials the opportunity for a possible

break in relations with Cuba. Embassy La Paz was not able to

NN 50955 DocId: 32424608 Page 11

press

for a break when the evidence of Cuban intervention

did not prove to be as conclusive as originally reported.

8. Other Special Actions

Department of State

a. Obtained action by the COAS on July 3 on the

Lavalle Committee Report transmitting the document to the

governments and urging them to implement the specific and

general recommendations contained therein as soon as

possible.

b. Through Embassy Managua informed the Nicaraguan

Government of the matters which we wanted to have considered

during the informal meeting of the Ministers of Security and

Interior of the Ischmian countries held in Managua, August

26-28 in preparation for the second formal meeting of the

Managua Security Conference countries later this year.

c. Explained in detail the nature of the Cuban

threat and the related policy objectives of the U.S., during

conversation in London and in Washington with Mr. Adam Watson,

newly appointed British Ambassador to Cuba.

United States Information Agency

a. The Agency's press service during the reporting

period transmitted 12 articles, commentaries, and back-

grounders on its wireless file service to USIA posts through-

out Latin America

for placement in the local newspapers and

the Voice of America Spanish broadcasts to Latin America

carried a total of 28 commentaries and features on the subject

of Cuban-based subversion.

These stories were designed to

alert people in Latin America to the dangers of this

subversion.

b. In response to standing Agency instructions to

give special attention to developments related to Cuba-based

subversion, USIA posts in Latin America were prompt in

reporting incidents and in providing editorial comments from

SECRET

## Page 13

SECRET

- 10-

the Latin American press, all of which was used in the

Agency's radio and press output.

The main developments treated in the Agency's radio

and press coverage included Castro's July 26 speech urging

revolutions in Latin America, the discovery of terrorist

weapons factories in Guayaquil, the Ecuadorean Vice

President's accusation of Cuban responsibility for terrorism,

the Cuban use of Grand Cayman as a way station for subversive

elements from Cuba, the expulsion from the University of a

Bolivian youth leader for receiving funds from Cuba,

Castro-trained guerrillas in Honduras, and Bolivian protests

against meddling by the Cuban Embassy in the miner's strike.

A Voice of American roving reporter in Latin America

provided several reports on the subversion picture in coun-

tries he visited.

c. In support of the Agency's effort or. Cuban-based

subversion, the publications center in Mexico began work on

three pamphlets during the period based on Castro's report

of his visit to the Soviet Union (showing that he contradicted

himself in some of his extravagant claims of Soviet progress),

the losses suffered by Cuban labor under Castro, and the

fate of political prisoners in Cuba. When completed, these

pamphlets will be

reproduced and distributed in quantity

throughout the area.

ANNEX A

CIA Intelligence Annex

1. Iravel to and from Cuba

Erazil

Chartered Cubana airlines flights between Cuba and

Brazil have become a major means of transporting non-Cuban

Lat in Americans to and from Cuba. The fire such flights

since late July have carried nearly 400 non-Cubans.

The firot of the recent series - on 25 July -

brought 71 Latin American passengers to Havana for the

26 July celebrations. The other four flights -- on 15,

22, 28 and 29 August - transported over 200 latin

Americans to Brazil from Havana. Some of the aircraft

involved returned to Cuba with smaller numbers of passen-

gers. Many of the 200 Latin American passengers had

been

delegates to the 26 July ceremonies, but others had

apparently been in Cuba for longer periods and some had

probably received training there. Of the passengers on

these four flights to Brazil, 75 were natives of

Caribbean area countries.

Their circuitous travel through

Brazil was evidently designed to help conceal the fact

that they had been in Cuba.

Costa Rica

Two Costa Ricans were among the passengers on a

chartered Cubana plane which was turned back to Havana

at Grand Cayman on 11 July 1963. One was Luz Marina

Hernandez Salazar, the only Costa Rican woman known to

have been sent to Cuba for training as a guerrilla

warfare instructor.

She had been in Cuba since September

1962.

The other Costa Rican passenger was Carlos Guillen,

former head of the Costa Rican Society of Friends of

the Cuban Revolution, who had been in Cuba since November

1962.

Ecuador

The CIA Station in Quito reports that the military

junta, which

assumed power in Ecuador on l1 July, can

be expected to follow the guidance of the Embassy and

the Station in controlling travel to and from Cuba and

the Soviet bloc.

The activities of Cuban subversives

in Ecuador, at least for the present, have been greatly

inhibited by the mass arrests of Communists and pro-

Cubans and by the outlawing of the Cormunist Party by

the junta.

Honduras

It is reported that the Honduran Communist Party

has issued orders to its members not to attempt to

travel to Cuba at the present time. This action is

apparently the result of the increasing vigilance of

the Honduran government and the greater implemertation

of stricter travel controls.

2. Movement of Cuban Propaganda

Guatemala

According to an unconfirmed report received in July,

a Bureau of Information of the Communist Party of

Guatemala is being formed in collaboration with Prensa

Latina and is to be managed clandestinely. It expects

to receive news by shortwave radio from Cuba and print

bulletins for distribution by radio stations. This may

indicate a pattern by which Prensa latina will attempt

to distribute on a more clandestine basis in other areas

in Latin America.

Honduras

It was reliably reported that in mid-July 1963, a

small coastal freighter landed 14 large boxes of Communist

propaganda on the northern coast of Honduras, the boxes

having been transferred at sea from a larger vessel. The

report has not been confirmed.

Movement of Guerrillas and Arms

Argentina

Extremist members of the Peronist Party, apparently

under the leadership of such figures as Hector Villalon

and John William Cooke, were reported to be receiving

encouragÃ©ment and promises of large surs of money from

Cuba in support of their efforts to train and orgarize

subversive groups in Argentina. Villalon has stated

tha: his plan calls for expanding and accellerating

subversive activities in Argentina culminating in a

complete take over within two years.

There is no indica

tion that Peron himself has agreed to this pian. It has

been reporter that leaders of the Communist Party of

Argentina have been greatly annoyed by the tendency of

the Castro regime to support the revolutionary Peronists

without having consulted the Communist Party of Argentina.

It is reported that the so-called Army of National

Liberation (ANL) of Argentina, which is a relatively

small Castrolst organization directed from Cuba by

John William Cooke, has in recent weeks been negotiating

for the purchase of arms and has been offered submachine

guns, bazookas and other weapons by two or three private

suppliers.

It was reported, however, that the ANL was

having difficulty getting enough dollars from Cuba to

make significant purchases possible.

Bolivia

The Bolivian Ministry of Foreign Relations on 23

August protested formally to the Cuban ChargÃ© d'Affaires

in La Paz against the Cuban Embassy support to the miners

during the recent crisis. Subsequently, however, Foreign

Minister Fellman informed the Cuban ChargÃ© that he need

not fear that the Government of Bolivia would break

diplomatic relations with Cuba. There has, in fact, been

no hard information linking the Cuban Embassy with the

present mining crisis in spite of some unconfirmed

reports of Cuban support.

Brazil

Cuban Ambassador to Brazil, Raul Roa Kouri, is

reported to have attempted to encourage peasant

league

leader Francisco Jullo to revitalize the leagues in

northern Brazil. According to some reports efforts are

being made to unify the leadership and bring dissident

elements under the general direction of Juliao. Other

reports indicate that, although the cuoan Embassy is

providing guidance and possibly financial support to the

movement, it had not yet resolved the internal dissension

in the leagues.

Colombia

From Colombia reports have been received of incre-

asing Cuban assistance, primarily in the for of training

courses by instructors

who have been trained in Cuba,

to the Worker-Student-Feasant Movement (MOEC). A small

guerrilla band encountered by the Colombian ammy in

July 1963 was broken up when five members of the band

were killed and two others captured. A small quantity

of arms and a considerable amount of books and pamphlets

on revolutionary warfare, photographs of Fidel Castro,

Camilo Cienfuegos and Mao Tse-tung, and bulletins of

the MOEC were found at the camp site. Recent reports

have indicated an increase in the terrorist efforts of

the MOEC and increased promises of assistance from Che

Guevara with regard to the training of additional MOEC

members.

Costa Rica

There have been a number of unconfirmed reports

alleging small-scale training of revolutionaries on

Costa Rican territory for guerrilla activity in

Nicaragua. For example, in mid-July an increased number

of guerrillas were reportedly being trained in Costa Rica

by Adolfo Garcia Barberena, well-known Nicaraguan

revolutionary leader and member of the FLN (National

Liberation Front - a Communist-dominated, Cuban-supported,

anti-NicataguÃ¡ revolutionary group). In early August,

Alberto Serrato, leader of the FLi in Costa Rica,

(reportedly left with a group of Nicaraguans for the

Costa Rican-Nicaraguan border. Another report indicated

that Hector Bogantes Zamora, Costa Rican agitator was

supposed to have left San Jose in mid-August for the

Nicaraguan border to supervise the passage of Nicaraguan

guerrillas from Costa Rica into Nicaragua. Bogantes,

who recently returned from attending the May Day celebra-

tions in Cuba, is said to have been assigned this

responsibility by the Costa Rican Communist Party.

So far as we know, the GON, which is normally well-

informed and highly sensitive to such activities on its

borders, has not made any complaints or otherwise signified

concern or awareness of these reported activities.

Enduras

The Honduran armed forces began to move against a

group of pro-Castro guerrillas operating against the

Nicaraguan Government and active in the vicinity of the

Nicaraguan-Honduran border. The Nicaraguan National Guard

has been conducting operations on its side of the border

against the insurgents since July. The dense jungle and

difficult terrain, however, will impede the efforts of

both forces to eliminate the guerrillas.

Information on the guerrilla force is scanty and

conflicting. It is apparently composed of members of the

National Liberation Front (FLN), a Communist-dominated

and Cuban-supported revolutionary organization active

primarily in Honduras and Nicaragua since the fall of

1962. The strength of the force is not known.

Nicaragua

A captured guerrilla of the FLN (National Liberation

Front - a Communist-dominated, Cuban-supported, anti-

Nicaraguan group) confessed that he was a member of a

group of 46 who entered Nicaragua from Honduras on 22 July.

He said that their mission was to establish a base camp

in the Isabella mountains, Department of Jinotega, in

order to indoctrinate the

peasants and to train them in

guerrilla tactics. He admitted that he had received six

months' guerrilla warfare training in Cuba and that other

FLN leaders had received similar training. He also said

that the FLN training camp in Honduras was near El Lagarto,

on the Patuca River.

4.

Transfer of Funds

British Guiana

In British Guiana, Guiana Import-Export Corporation

(Gimpex) received a one million doilar advance payment

deposited by the Cuban Alimpex Corporation for goods to

be delivered to Cuba in the future. Gimpex has, in turn,

loaned this money to the Government of British Guiana.

Cheddi Jagan's People's Progressive Party is the major

stockholder in Gimpex. Mohammed Kassim, Manager of Gimpex,

has indicated that Gimpex will be able to secure additional

loans from Cuba in amounts sufficient to tide the Jagan

government over any foreseeable crisis. It was also

reported that Gimpex plans to buy aircraft, spare parts

and other machinery in the United States for reshipment

to Cuba.

General

Reports continue to be received from many places

indicating that the suitcase full of currency is still one

of the most common methods used by the Cubans for trans-

mitting funds for use in supporting subversive activities

throughout the hemisphere.

Instances where such funds

have been confiscated by the police have occurred recently

in El Salvador, Panama and Ecuador.
