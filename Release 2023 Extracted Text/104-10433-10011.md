to have reached you beforo April I-

I had originally debated with myself whether to send anything at all,

considering my "informant" did not seem to offer anything new. How

ever, in viow of the admittedly "electrifying quality" of the subject,

I finally decided to rocord the matter.

Because of your lotter, I invited my friend to lunch today. We went

over the ground in somewhat more detail, as set forth below, but he

did not claim he was making world-ghaking revelations, and I do not

boliove he was.

He said he and a group of fellow students met Oswald one afternoon

(ho does not recall the date) when they came out of the Cineclub,

which I undoratood to bo at the bacuela do Filosofia (I am not famillar

with tho University of Merico).

llo deseribed Oswald as "raro" and

rxrux8707 "introvertido", a person who obviously had complexes and

problems.

Oswald was with the group during the remainder of the afternoon and

eveniny and all the following day. They paid for his meals during this

(It was of interest to me my informant said that, in addition to

rocognizing Oswald's photograph following tho assassination of Prosidont

ho oasily rocalled Oswald's name because both "Harvey" and

"Oowald" connotod rabbit to him, something I had not thought of.)

Oswald

ovidently had gone to the university tu look for pro-Castro students

who might, holp hin persuado tho Cuban Embassy to grant him & visa.

He

spoke littlo Spanish,

but indicated he vas from California, as wall as

He also scems learful of trouble with his former pro-Castro student

I gather

they are not altogether "former",. considering he says some of them

still visit him here from time to time.

Incidentally, he claims to have visited Cuba, to be well acquainted

with Raul Roa

and, to a lesser degree, with Castro.

He clains further

to have been friendly with one Maria Teresa Proenza, who I understood

him to say defected from the Cuban Embassy 1n Mexico City and may now

One item he "revealed" during our first evening particularly Intrigued

me. He seened subsequently, and plobably with justification, especially

fearful of the unpleasant consequences which might derive from any

publicity regarding it). He asserted he was the student who personally

the

an

issue when the Warren Commission decided it belonged

shown to the OSWALDs.

The Agency finally allowed the

picture to appear in

the report with the background

completely blocked out and with the agreement that

no

mention would be made about where it had been taken.

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the photo was taken in Mexico,

even though there has been a great deal of speculation

to that effect by several authors and journalists.

As

a matter of fact, one of the lawyers who worked with the

saying it was taken somewhere outside the U.s.
