1.

We would be grateful for traces on Nicole SzuLC, American

freelance journalist, age 27/29.

She apparently also works for center for

a group which carries out

research ato merican security and Mahal fo.

Her father was New York times Bureau

Cuban regime: by her own

account she has

come to Cuba for one

month at Cuban invitation to gather material on CIA operations

in cuba, past and present,

and to

"assist" the Cubans in uncovering

new leads to current CIA intelligence activity particularly among

the foreign community).

She was last in Cuba in 1921.

SZULC nade

her first approach to the Cuban Embassy in MEXICO CITY several

months ago with a request for tuban material on CIs operations.

The Cubans responded by inviting her to a clandestine-type meeting

in NEW YORK where she met Cuban officials accredited to the UN in

a car. At that meeting no material was provided but she was asked

to come to Cuba as soon as possible in order to carry out "joint

"progranne" for the next four weeks.

I met SZUIC first on 12 Novenber at REGIT's (Reuter)

appartment where she called to see him while. I was paying him a

brief, unheralded call.

I met her again by chance on 13 November

in the lobby of the Riviera Hotel where she and British businessnen

whon I was visiting are staying.

The sympathetic curiosity shown

by REGIN and me on the respective occasions was sufficient to get

her talking about the purpose of her visit.: At the same time REGIN

and I both made favourable comments on certain aspects of Cuban

development and this seemed to win her confidence.

Her evident

canacity lor self-delusion appears to enable ner to suppose that

other observars of the Cuban scene (except those possibly working

for the ciA whom she hopes to uncover) share her partiality towards

the Cuban system.

I did not, of course, disillusion her in my case,

and, although challenging some of her more outrageous remarks,

left her with the impression of a favourable view of Cuba.

She is,

however; seli-opinionated, intellectually obstinate and quite

incapable of objectivity when discussing Cuba…

She seems keen for

a further meeting no doubt as a stepping stone to the foreign

conmunity she wishes to penetrate) and I suspect is prepared

to 1

use her feminine charms along the way.

Apart fron traces I should walcome your comments.

Since she

will presumably be meeting DSE and DGI officials I would obviously

have to be circumspect about any further encounter with her, but

you may consider this a good apportualty to try and pick up

whatever details
