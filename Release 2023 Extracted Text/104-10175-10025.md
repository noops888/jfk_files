The Station feels that perhaps tie understated the degree

of concealment as outlined in reference B.

It is agreed that a

sophisticated cochnical search would probably find ihe device te

planted but all personnel at the station involved ultis this operation

agreed that such a search was most unlikely.

The case officer

dealing directly with LIRING-S also minimized the possibility of

-IRING-3 meking any kind of a searcil.

all of these points were

considered before making the Installation.

2. At the moment, be do not feel there is endunh reason po

justily the rises involved in anotier surreptitious entry.

will however remain alert and be prepared

to take corrective action.

Although LIRING-.3 and his wife moved back to their old

apartment on Tacubaya in early May, LIRING-3 uses the apart-

local Cubans might ask questions in this connection. LIRING-4's

father, incidentally finally succeeded in getting a

visa and is coming to Mexico City in the near iuture to

spend two or three weeks with his daughter.

The attached report dated 8 May indicates that

LIKING-3 may have found another local channel to the Guatemalan

28 April, 1967

Subject:

DOC. MICRO. BER.

Analysis of LIFEAT Iraific Relating to JIRIIG/3. fOI

the Feriod 19-26 April, 1957.

1. In reviewing the traffic for the period indicated Porton furié

valuaule confirmation of WIRING/3 and IIRING/4 contact ith Rames

Abreu, indicating that both persons complied vitä Routon's suggertions.

LIRING/3's telephonic contacts with Farique Morales in Guatemala City

confirmed reports given to him (Rowton) before and after the evezi.

The only item not reported to Rowton by LIRING/3 1s a dinner engzie-

ment which Enrique Morales bad in Guatemala City on 25/4/67 with "Iriendg"

of Morales' wife, Esperanza. SAN-10 (17-5) also reveals that IIiG/3

and liorales are engaged in some sort of deal for the purchase of purses

or briefcases (bolsas) either in Guatemala or San Cristóbal for sale

In Mexico City or import into the U.S. at a higher price. (LIRIUG/3

mentioned the opportunities in this line to Rowton previously, i hoW-

ton did not react favorably).

2. The following are Rowton's comments on specific portions of tse take

which will serve to clarify them in relationship to reports made to him

by LIRING/3 and IIRING/4:

LIRING/4 Contacts with Raniro Abreu: On 22/4/67, shortly aftar Rowton

Buggested that LIRING/4 recontact Abreu and attempt to effect arouga

him a reconciliation with the local mission, LIRING/4 telephased the

Embassy and attumpted to reach Abreu. From the content and toze of her

questions and remarks, it appears obvious that LIRING/4 has not had re-

cent contact with the Cuban mission. She ass when Abreu is leaving for

Havana, but is given no information. She tries sgain at abort 1900 and

2000, but there is no answer. She finallt sets through to seres on

14-13-26

who promises to come to her home between 1000 and 1100 the

following day (23/4/67). She has to give ibreu the address, indicaiing

that be is not fauiliar with the home addiess of LIRING/3 or/z.

SAN-10 (5.0,8.2,12.2) reveal that Abreu called or talked to IING/4

on the telephone three times on 24/4/67. IIRNG/4 makes referezce to

"so much analysis, so many thoories and Ideas" which apparentig vere dis-

cussed between her

and Äbreu at their 23/4/57 conversation. sucer re-

marks made both by LIRING/4 and Abreu indicate that Abreu 15, or Watas

to become enotionally involved with LIRING/4, wbo at least 'in vords ap-

earg to have encouraged him. thes

ge contacts were reported to soups

2.

1n substance by LIRING/3, although Rowton has not as yet had a chance

to talk directly with LIRING/4 to get her version of the conversationa

with Abreu. Apparently in order to put Abreu off (in bis anonous de-

B1g08) LIPIliG/4 teals him on 25/4/67 that her husband suspocts that

sonething is going on between shem. In roply to Abreu's anxious ques-

tioning, LIRING/4 states that her husband asked her whether she liked

Abrou and wbether Abreu like her, to which she said that the replled fi

the affirmative (this apparently was calculated to cool Abreu off

without alienating hin). Abreu's visit to the ppartment ind his pro-

poed luncheon date with LIRING/3 were confined by the latter in his

report to Rowton on 27/4/67.

Convergations Re the Birth Certificate: In SAN-10 (2.5) I.IRING/3 asks

bis Guatemalan friend (Jacobo jodriguez Padilla?) whether 1t natters 11

the firth contificate la for a person 10 years older? Jacoho replied

in the negative, but would prefer it of a person ten years younger.uI-.

RIiG/3 promises to have the birth certificate in his possession by

25-26/4/67. This is the first confirmation Rowton has had of a state-

ment made to him some two weeks previously that when ho went to pick us

the (false) birth certificate at Registro Civil on instructions of his

half-brother (and the lawyer Folendo Riojas) he discoverid that it was

for a person born in 1916 and hence useless for himself. LIRING/3 also

reported to Rowton that Jacobo had contacted bim recently and asked for

help in obtaining false papers for himself. The above conversation

therefore would indicate that WIRING/3 plans to give Jacobo the false

document originally procured for himself through his half-brother. LI-

RING/3, however, has not revealed this plan to Rowton.

SAT-11 (16.0) reveals that LIMING/3 informed his brother two days later

that he has spent over ten days at Registro Civil but 1t 18 "impossible

to got the birth certificate. Ibe book no longer exiests." He adds that

he has written his half-brother a lotter explaining everything. LIRING/s

reportud to Rowton that he had asked his half-brother to obtain an

"acta notorial" In lieu of brita certificate and hoped to have the doci-

ment goon.

Subject:

1. Ruwton met with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 4 May, 1957.

LIRING/3 reported that he had been working with the Secretarait of

Commerce and Industry to obtaintho license for the importation of the

plastic flowers and that be had told Enrique Morales Guerra to stand

by until the formalities of the license were completed. He added that

as a matter of fact he had not made any commitment to Morales and did

not feel under any obligation to continue to use him, even in the flower

business, especially if Roston had any further

reservations about him.

2. Regarding his friend Sergio González Marin of the Secretariat of

Commerce and Industry, LIRING/3 commented that, as he had reported pre-

viously to Rowtor, the latter had formerly been a member of the Communist

Party of Mexico, but & was no longer active. UIRING/3 added that his s15-

ter, dorever, cilriü

Coastler Marin, was a very active nember of the

Party and married tol a Raúlmoreno, who was also most probably a ember

of the Conmunist Party. LIatNG/3 continued that both Raúl loreno and

Silva and himself (LIRING/3) had a tutual friend Sergic valdez who had

excellent contacts in extreme leftist circles. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez was the son of the Siempre correspondent and associate of Alberto

Domingo, as well as fico Galán. According to LIRING/3, Sergio Valdez ia

not a formal party member and still a student uf art at the University.

LIRINE/3 stated that he knew nim farily well since be had been one of

his (LIRING/3's) students for several years. LIRING/3 added that Sergio

Valdez' teiephone number is 20-90-10, ext. 12.

3. In addition to the above, LIRING/3 recounted that about 2 May, 1967, in

a conversation with Raúl Moreno, he had learned that moreno is friendly

with the FAR responsible for Propaganda at the National University. LI-

RING/3 commented that such a person would surely know "Garcia" of FAR,

and that therefore he planned to arrange a neeting with him through Raul

Moreno at the first opportunity.

4. In preparation for a possible ICFLUITER examination of LIRING/3 on

9 or 10 May, Roston stated to him at the end of the meeting that be was

prepariig a number of questions that still bothered bin so that LIRING/3

could give a definitive reply that would close the matier for once and

all. LIRING/3 replied that he was anxious to answer any questions Rowton

might have and hoped that this would resolve any problem and dispell and

lingering doubts that Rowton

might still have concerning his bone fidea.

Monthly Report of Developments in the IIRIiG/3 Operation,

for the Period 1-30 April, 1967.

1. During tho month of April, Rowton was able, through valuable leads

furnished by LIFEAT intercepts, to gut strong pressure on IIRING/3 to

present accoylable proof of a number of staterents that he had made to

Rowton. At his meeting with LIRI5G/3 on 19 April, Rowton confronted LI-

RING/3 with suspicions be entertained concernitz the proposed acquisi-

tlon of a false birth certificate as well as the identity of "Garcia",

the PAl representative. The session, which lasted over two hours, shook

IIRING/3 so much enotionally that IIZING/4 became alarmed and telephoned

Rowton's answering service the folloring morning. Rowton was able to ex-

ploit this opportunity to talk privately with IIRING/4 and to lay the

foundation for an independent working relationship with her against tar-

gets of intercat in the local mission.

2. In addition to initiating a positive effort to verify LIRING/3's bona

fides and reliability, Rowton's confrontation paved the way toward a

closer and more productive relationship with hin in the future. LIRING/3

assured Rowton that be considered his work for Rovton the most important

thing in his life and was silling to do anything to prove that his in-

tuetions were nonorable and nis reporting reliaule. As a rasult Rontos is

currently in a position to challenge any or all of LIRING/3's statements,

and to give him much more specific direction than was possible in the

past.

3. The following are Rowton's comments on specific developments during the

month in summary form:

a) Developments with respect to Cuba: On 19 April, LIFBAI intercept

SAN-7(9.0) revealed that both LIPING/3 and LIRING/4 were virtually

Isolated from the Cubars. In the conversation with the Mexican Rojas

LIRIKG/3 stated that "he and his wife no longer have anythine to do

with those people", and LIRING/4, in conversation with the sane person,

added that she "feels like vomiting when she sees them". Both LIRING/3

and 14 admitted this situation to Rowton on 22 April when be talked to

each privately. LIRING/4 explained her dislike for the Cuban employees

of the mission originated in the "rude manner in which she was thrown

out into the street" some six nouths previously. LIRING/3 confessed

that he could not explain why his close frieads Arnol Rodriguez and

René Ochoa had not communicated with him over the past month, despite

his messages and telephone calls. He felt an uneasy suspicion that the

Julian Lopez alfair, as well as the Rico Galán letter, bad caused certain

elements locally and in Havana to become hostile toward him.. IlnüllG/3

noted that Lepeda had been presont when LIRITiG/4 had blown her top in

the Ambassador's office and that he (LIRING/3) had turred down Cepeda's

invitation to accompany hin to Havana shortly after the return of Jullan

Lopez. In any case LIRING/3 agroad that the best, or, nore candidly, the

only course of action opez to him was to play a waiting game and continue

his work with the Guatemalans in the hope that the Cubans, sooner or later

would recontact him. He stressed that only after he has established firm

and viable cover through the plastic flower business will he be able to

face a thorough interrogation by the DSE in Havana (which he expects,

dealt with

should he return at this time). He feels that he

unt enourh Greeks

to date ( Econonou, Frevolis, Batsakis, Gasdazlis, Arvanitis) in both Mexico

City and Guatesala City, to justify his relationship with Rowton on a

purely commercial level, should that become necessary.

LIR G/3 accepted

'Rowton'

s recoumendation that LIRING/4 overcome her

apparent visceral dislike for the Cubans in the mission and efiect a re-

conciliation with them as soon as possible. After Rowton's personal appeal

to her, she succeeded in recontacting Ramiro Abreu on 22 April, and re-

mained in almost daily contact with him until he left Mexico on 30 April.

Through Abreu she re-established contact witc Curbelo, Cepeda, and other

employees of the Consulate, inciuding inrique Cicard. This gave LIRING/3

an opportunity to chat with Abreu concerning his own situation with the

result that ibreu promised to get some word out to LIRIlG/3 concerning

the attitude of his friends in Havana. Abreu invited LIRING/3 back to

Havana, but the latter turned this down diplomatically (for the reasons

mentioned above).

b) Developnents with Respect to Guatemala: The identity of "Garcia",

the FAR representative, has continued to occupy the attention of Rowton.

An attempt by the Station team to surveilt Carcia when he allegedly picked

up the nedicine fron IIRING/3 on 28 March was unsuccessful (Roiton spottei

LIRING/3 leaving his house at about 0815, just as the team was taking pos1-

tions and before they could taentify LIRING/3). Anothor opportunity to

surveil LIRIiG/3; Garcia,as well as Enrique joralos, was lost on the even-

10g of 8 April, bocasus of the short notice Rowton has of the meeting.

Matters, however, have been simplified after.

the confrontatios of LIRING/3

by Baston on 22 April, inasnuch as LIRING/3 pronised to notify Rowton In

advance of the next neeting with Cercia, explicitly for the purpose of

Rowton's getting a look at Garcia to identify bin. In addition on 1 liay,

LIRDiG/3 inforaed Rowton that Garcia had telephoned hin the preceding day

to sèt a date for their next neeting on 18 lej, when Garcia stated he

would be back fron Guatenala. LIFEiT take fos, 30 April should confirm or

refute this statement.

During the montk LIRING,3 maintained contact with Jacobo Rodriguez Padilla

Alícía Echeverría as well as Carren Carrasco. LIFEAT Intercepts confinmed

LIRIXG/3 reports, at least as far as actual contact was concerned.

c) Developments with Respect to the False Birth Certificate: Uppa his ro-

tura from northern Mexico on 6 April, LIKING/3 reported that he had made

arrangements to obtain a lalse birth certificate for future use through

his half-brother and a certain lawyer named Folando Riojas(for a 2,000

poco teol, HIPaun intoragate arquaed Pauton's suspicions concerning the

role, if any,played by Riojas, and served as a biasis for Ronton's heart-

to-heart talk with LIRING/3 on 22 spril, LIRIUG/3 clained that the false

birta certificate produced by his balf-brother and Riojas was not suitable

since it applied to a person born in 1916. This appears to have been the

tauth, as indicated in LIRING/3's conversatica with Jacobo Rodriguez Pa-

dilla on 23 April (SAN-10(2.5), although Routen still has doubts concern-

Jing the existence and role plajed by Rolando riojas. Ilkewige, LIRING/3's

report that his half-brother was to provide bin with an affidavit in lieu

of birth certificate in the name of Alberto Zérate Vidal, (a name chosen

by LIRING/3 hinself), was proved to be true when LIRTüG,i gave Rjwton the

originalix of the court papers on 29 April.

d) Cover kspects of the IIRING/3 Uperation: Iuring the first week of April.

IIRING/3 traveled to northern Mexico (Sabines, juevo Loredo) and Del Rio,

Texas, and, in collaboration with his half-brother and a certain Sersia.

Arche of Villa Acuña, established a notional company ("Floriex") i1 Del

Rio as a bujer for the plastic flowers assembled in San Cristóbal. This

was done, according to HIRING/3, in order to satisfy the requirements of

the secretarlat of Conmerco, und Industry. A290 on 19 Apral, LIRING/3, ac-

Wallace B. Roston Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton met with LIKING/3 at the salehouse (Tacubaya) briefly at

1000 on 1 May, 1967. LIRIIG/3 reported that "Garcia" had telephoned

him on the preceding day to tell hin that he had to nase another trip,

this time to Guatemala and that he would be returning on 18 May, 1967.

IIRING/3 added that Garcia Indicated that he would see ITRING/3 on that

date or a few days thereafter, and planned to introduce him to a

friend who would be in a position to see hin nore frequently in the

future. LIRING/3 told Rowton he again mentioned the payment for the

medicines and Garcia assured him that it would be settled at their

next meeting.

2. LIRING/3 also reported that Abreu departed on 30 April, rather than

on 29 April, as anticipatei. He said that he had therefore had achance to

meet with nureü again. me lattor encouraged bin to keep in touch with

him and promised to get some sort of message to LIRTIG/3 from Arnol

Rodriguez and/or Cienfuego. According to LIRING/3 breu asked him whether

he would be willing to visli his friends in "avana again in the near

future to discuss his situation personally, indicatire that he would

arrange for an invitation as soon as he returned. ilaIliG/3 told Rowton

he thanked Abreu but stated that at the moment he was very busy with his

commercial obligations and could not fina the time. Ee assured Abreu that

as soon as he got things rolling in San Gristóbal and Guatemala, be

would welcome the chance to visit favana again.

3. LIRING/3 then stated that he and LIRING/i had talised over the matter

of ber father's visit at length, and had also talked again to him by tele-

phone(In response to his two calls), and had come to the conclusion that

It was more practical that LIRING/4's fatter come to Mexico City after all,

since a trip to Montreal was too costly and it appeared impossible to con-

vince LIRING/4's father that he should not come to visit his daughter at

her hone. LIPING/3 added that he planned to have IIRING/4 take ber father

on as many excursions as possible outside lexico City to keep his visit

as quiet as possible. He said that in any event lIFING/4's father could

not make the trip before 20 May, 1967, when his vacation would begin.

4. LIRING/3 then nenticied that both he and LIRING/4 felt that they should

returu to the Tacubaja spartment to live. le explained that LIRIiG/4 bad

curiosity of the landlady, sra. Sanchez. He felt that this had already

been accomplished and sna Sanchez was not likely to ask any further

questions. Also both he and LIRIG/4 were worried about suspicions that

slightly and appeared satisfied wiia LIRING/3's explanation that he bad

rented the apartment for sone friends who were out of the country tempor-

arily. LIRING/4 is not confortable in the apartment, especially since she

nay have to face her former colleagues frequently is she resunes ber work

In the Consulate. According to LIRING/3, she feels they are better off

in relatively nodest surroundings, since they have fever questics to ans-

wer and explanations to give. Their old apartment (tacubaja) also has

two separate bedroons ard vould be tore convenient when her father comes

to visit tüem. LIRING/3 stated that he could, of course, continue to

use the toya apartment to see loton and beet discreetly wit thon

tacts, as previously.

bagged.

S. In view of the above, Rowton suggested that LIRING/3 inforo lis friends,

particularly the Cubans, that the toyac apertment had been rented for

his Greek friends from Guatemala and Venezuela who planned to establish

a plastics factory here in Hesico and needed a place to stay during their

visits. LIRIIG/3 felt this would be acceptable, since by now he had g00d

working contacts with batsakis and Gasdaglis in Guatemala City and would

soon be seeing irvanitis and possibly others. Rowton also suggested that

if it became necessary to explain his contacts with the Greeks to the cu-

bans, he should say that his original contact was with Pandelis Econonou

ro the importa-lin of Metaras cognac (this is true) and that he had met

Stylianos Prevolis and continued to work through him on the recommendation

of Economou (when the latter returned to Athens).

6. LIRING/3 stated thit he planned to revisit his friends in the Secreta-

riat of Conmerce (particularly a señor Llamas of the Plastics Connittee)

to obtain the import license for tue first shipment of disassembled

flowers to San Cristóbal.

29 Apra1, 1967

Subject:

Wallace B. Rowton Meeting with LIRING/3.

1. Rowton ret with LIRING/3 at the safehouse at 1800 on 27 April,

and at 0845 on 29 April, 1967. At the first meeting LIRING/3 gave

Rowton the new letterhead paper of the Plastilor do San Cristobal

company and report.:l that he had been in telephonic contact with

Enrique fiorales in Guatenala City and has passed on to bin Rowton's

nessage instructing him, (as per LIRING/?'s suggestion) to contact

Mir. Constantinos Gasdaglis of the Metaloplástica Guatenalteca to be

shown through the factory and given some unassembled anaples of the

plastic floders. This had been suggested by IIRLiG/? inasnuch as Mr.

Angelo Arvaritis had not arrived in Guatenala City Irom Caracas as

anticipated.

2. At both meetines LIRING/3 reported almost daily contact with Ramiro

Abreu either pessonally or by phone. He stated that he had had a private

talk with Abreu, in which the latter attempted to snooth over the ap-

parent difficulties liring/3 was having with the Cubans, by stating that

nobody really had anything against LIRING/3. When the latter showed bis

dissatisfaction with such

a brush-off, Abreu mumbled somethibg about

the Julian Lopez affair and added that there were "certain thiugs he

"as not in a position to disouss". Abreu insinutated that Cepeda was

more or less hostile. although he himself did not share Cepeda's atti-

tude. At this point MRING/3 isserted the comment that when LIRING/4

blew up some six months agalon the day that sue was fired, in the An-

bassador's office, Cepeda was present, and he apparently resented the

action even more than the Ambassador. LIRING/3. agreed with Roirton that

in light of the current situation the best course of action vould be to

give LIRING,4 a chance to re-establish cordial relations with her forzer

colleagues, particularly Cepeda, since she had the advantage of being a

Cuban and former employee herself.

3. with regard to other comments made by Abreu, WRING/3 stated that he

definitely felt that Abreu was naking a pitch for direct and continuing

contact with him, even after Abreu returied to Havana. LIRING/3 stated

to Rowton that he gently brushed this off, stating to Abreu that he had

certain understaddings with Arnol Rodriguez and osmani Cienfuego and for

that reason did not feel free to enter into any operational relatiosbip

with anyone olse. He concluded this discussion with a comment that if

Abrou could somehow get a message to him from either Arnol Rouriguez or

Cienfuego designating Abreu as their liaison, IIRINGY3 would be glad to

accommodate. LIRING/3 added to Rowton that he gave Abreu a sketchy idea

of what he was doing in establishing co mercial ties with both Guate=ala

and Texas, ibreu appeared Intensely interested and when LIRING/3 showed

him the letterhead of the new"cospany" in San Cristóbal, Abreu gnapped

up the paper and envelope and slipped then into his pocket. LIRING/3 told

Rowton that he expressed to Abreu his istention of continuing his efforts

along the connercial lines, regardless of the lack of enthusiann shona to

him by the Cubans.

4. At the 29 April reeting LIRING/3 reported to Rowton that Enrique Morales

had returned safely from Guaterala City, after baving net with Constastine

Gasdaglis and obtained fron hin samples of the flowers. Since Ro::ton had

almost reached the conclusion that LIRIIC/3 has known Enrique Morales for

several years (contrary to his story thet he met bim through "Carcia")Row-

ton threw in at this point the comment that ne nad been checking ou du-

rales, through a Mexican Dunn and Bradstreet type firm he uses in business,

and found that Morales has a poor dredit rating, is married, and is an

artist by profession ( actual source of this info is LIFEAT intercepts).

IIHING/3 appeared surprised at the accuracy of Rowton's report and adaittee

that Morales was a painter, although he did not earn enough from his work

to live. IIRING/3 olso stated that Morales had used the 500 pesos pajsent

he had made to him to liquidate an overdue loan at a bank, but that he was

currently out of debt and in good credit standing.

5. At the same meeting IIRING/3 reportod that he had been in touch with

his half-brother regarding the false birthcertificate and informed his

half-brother that the one presented to him was for a man born in 1916 and

hence useless for his own as purposes. according to LIRING/3, his bother

proposed an even better idea, the procurement of an "acta notorial" in

Which it would state that the person named therein had never been regis-.

tered. LIRING/3 pointed out that this would be more valid legally even

than a birthcertificate since it would be issued by a court rather than

simply by the Rigistro Civil. He then added that he might fortunately

Pill two birds with one stone, but using the aifidavit in lieu of birth

certificate for himself and give the fals birthcertificate to his friend

Jacobo (Rodriguez Radilla) who had asked him to help procure a false docu

ment. Rowton agreed that this would be the best solution and ask wben II-

RING/3 bored to have the papers. He replied that his half-brother had al-

ready sent the acta notorial on the morning bus from Sabinas (Coah.) and

that he was to pick it up from the bus driver early that saue afternoon.

6. LIRING/3 then reported to Roiton that the Consulate had asked LIRIiG/4

to cone back to work on a part-time basis. According to lIRLiG/3, bota

he and LInIiG/4 dragged their feet on any connitment until they could re-

fer the matter to Ronton. LIRING/3 commented that the thought of LIRING/4

being again in such close contact with such types did not make him happy

but be agreed with Rowton that this perhaps would serve to re-establisn

his own relationship with then. LIRING/3 aditted that it had been very

convenient to have LIRIXG/4 inside the establishment, especially since

ahe could pick up messages for him and keep her ear to the ground and her

eyes open for gossip. Rowton replied that in view of this development he

felt that ke should have another private chat with üIRING/4 and asked II-

RITG/3 to inform her that he would be calling on her that afternoon at

about 1700. LIRING/3 discreetly stated that he planned to be out at that

time in any case seeing his chiären (by bis ex-wiie).

7. Rowton spent sone 90 minutes with LIRISG/4 at ber home that afternoon.

She reported that she had made out nuch better that expected with Abreu,

who came running when

she telephoned hin sortly after Rowton left her on

the evening of 22 April. She added that be came to the house that evering

in the company of Curbelo aml made a date to see her againthe next norning.

She commented that Abreu, who had always had a sort of crush on her, was

delighted and pleasantly surprised by her initiative. ie confessed that

he thought IIRING/4 wanted a visa to go bac's home, and was relieved to

find that sie was not in any difficulty. üRING/4, in her typical candia

manner, adiltted that abreu's interest in ber was probably personal, but

she felt that she had accomplished what Forton wanted in her own femicine

i Way. Rowton congratualted her and asked her to continue her efforts, parti-

cularly with Cepeda and the others in the nission.

8. LIRING/" then explained that on her visit to the Embassy, abreu, in the

presence of Cepeda and others, almost jokingly said they were understaffed

and why didn't LIRING/4 come back to help them out in the office. LIFIiG/4

told Rowton that she immediately showed interest but did everything sho

could Iron appearing overenthusiastic. Ste conmented to Ronton that one

sust not run after such people, but make them dance a bit first so that

they would appreciate: anything they get. IIRING/4 cuntinued that ske

replied to breu that she would think it over, but in any case would not

vant a repetition of the treatment she received last time. All sorts of

assurances were given to her, but,despite this she made no commitment

since she wished to talk the offer over with LIRING/3 and kowton.

9. LIRING/& also reported that she had set the new consul, Enrique

Cicard, and found him rather pleasant. She said that she piarned to

invite him to dinner on evening soon so that LIIING/3 could chat with

bIn. IIRING/4 then commented that the only problen with BIHX Cicard

would be fatall in the Pbess Office (as Rowton recalla) who was Cleara'a

roommate. She explained that Sarambu was a member of the Cosmunist Fariy

and appeared to be a tougi nut to crack. She surprised Rowton by adding

that Cepeda appeared easier to her, the orly problem with him was how to

find an opening - some common interest she could exploit. Also regard-

ing the part-tine work, she said that she did not take it too seriously,

since Aracell and Mirabal were coming back from javana and hence they

would not bo so short-banded, Rowton mentioned she micht also offer to

help the Mexican Rojas who had telephoned her recently. She agreed and

conmented that Rojas had told her that he had finally been invited into Ha-

vana for a brief visit...

•10. Rowtor then brought up the problem of LIRING/4's father. LIRING/4 con-

firmed what LIRING/3 had told Rowton that corning,

i.e. that her father

had just announced that he had succeeded in obtaining the visitor's visa

Iron New York and that when she had telepkoned hin suggesting they meet

1n San Antonio (to avoid his appearing in Mexico City at this time), her

father had balked, saying that if he were coming all the way to San An-

tonio he nught as well continue on a little more aid go to lexico City.

LIRING/4 explained to Rowton that she could not possibly get across to

her father the real reason she wanted to neet him in the U.s. (to avoid

arousing suspicions on the aprt of such types as Cepeda) and she had to:

let the matter drop. She added that there was also the problen of the

visa to the U.S. which she did not waut in her passport. Roston offerred

to obtain the visa tarough business friends in Houston ra:ker painlessly,

but LIRI G/4 insisted that this would be a needless riek in the eyes of

Copda just at a time when she might be redired. She concluded that the

only solution appeared to be kontreal where she could go without arousing

suspicion (she commented that Cepeda had told her that be intended to

visit Canada in the near future). She felt she could reduce some of the

expense by traveling part way by bus. (hoother tho ght that has occurred

to kowton is that she might travel via Havana, although ke has not

as get

mentioned this to either LIRING/4 or LIRING/3).

11. During the meeting LIRING/4 presented Rowton with the "Acta Motorial"

which LIRIliG/3 had mentioned to rowton that same morning. she said that

LIRING/3 bad asked her to show the document to Rowton whiche he already

Knew about. Repton took one of the three copies and told LIRING/4 that

he would study it at his leagure. The document is issued in apparently

proper legal form by Judge Rogelio Sanchez F., Secretary of the Civil Court

of the Third Iribunal of the first Instucne of the Judicial Distrcit of

Monclava, Sabinas, Coshuila, and representa an aifidavit of Elias Piña

Diaz and Antonio Rodriguez Lozano to the effect that a certain Alberto

Zarave Vidal sas born ? September, 1929 In Ejido Puente Negro of Sabinas,

the son of farique Zarate Reyes and Bertha Vidal de Zárate, but that bia

birth was not previously registered by the parents. The witnesses, Piña

and Rodriguez, stated under oath that they knew this to be a fact from

personal knowledge of the parents. In the document alias Piña Diaz was

described ao a Monica, married, satiro si abasolo, Doab emploged, rooá-

dent of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Col. San Luisito 179, Coah. Antonio Rodri-

guez Lozano is described as a lexican, widower, municipal employee, native

Ci Suenaventura, Coal, resident of Mineral de Nueva Rosita, Calle Dos de

Abril CK-825. Attached herewith is a copy of the alfidavit for station

and Headquarters files.

just how sophisticated and reliable LIRING-3 and company

were, that 1s, whether or not LIBING-3 night be working for

This point might not have come through

clearly in EXW-15337,

20 March 1967, and if so, we would

like to take this opportunity to enphasize that one of thi

reasons we have been

following this involved case so closely

КАРОК/PBRULEN - The LIKING-3 Operation

ACTION RIQUTEO. REFERENCES

ACTION REQUIRED: FYI

Forwarded herewith

as Attachrent One are five reports

prepared by lallace B.

on the LIRING-3 operation.

These

repurts are dated 13, 19, 22 (two reports) and 24 April 1967.

2. LIFEAT coVerage of LIRING-3's apartment pas started on

6 April. A review of the LIFEAT take

for the period of 6

April indicated to ROWTON that LIRING-3 may not have been telling

him the truth on a number of minor points.

One of these was

anather or not Rolande lTDIAS,

the duorn toredo later who can

provide false birth certificates (on the basis of which Mexican

passports can later be obtained), exists.

RONTON took up the question

of the lawyer and other points dealing with Enrique MORALES

and "GARCIA" with LIRING-3.

The latter appeared crushed that

ROWTON. had doubts about the sincerity of some of his statements.

He swore that the lawyer really

exists and offercd to give

ROWTON all pertinent details of his next meeting with "GARCIA"

so that RONION can have a look at the Guatemalan "from a distance."

Such an arrangement should greatly sirplity the tas of the

LIENDRACE team,

"GARCIA" and LIRING? meet.

LIRING-3 also admitted that his wife was becoming zore and more

upset about his "clandestine" activities, and that his relations

with the Cubans were at a low point.

After his meeting with

RONTON on 19 April, when the above was discussed, the LIEMBRACE

team folloned LIRING=3 from his old house frow used for his

meetings with ROWTON) directly to the Cuban Embassy. LIRING-3

later volunteered

visited the Enbassy to Rowton, giving a

satisfactory explanation.

3.

A review of the LIFEAT take from 12 to 19 April showed

that LIRING-3 had deceived ROKTON on a couple of additional

points.

One of these was that LIRING-3 called his Honduran friend

Rene OCHOA in Cuba,

when he told ROWTON that he phoned Arnol

RODRIGUEZ.

Faced with

the fact that the number he called was not

Arnol's (ROWTON pays LIRING-3's phone bills), LIRING-3 said that

OCHOA was the best friend he had in Cuba and

admitted that he

had not been in contact with RODRIGUEZ for some time.

As can be

seen

from his reports, a major effort was made by ROWTON to

convince LIRING-3 and

especially his wife that the two should

take the initiative and make an effort to improve their relations

with the Cubans in general and the personnel of the local Cuban

Embassy in particular.

It became evident in the process that

his lack of good relations with the Cubans has been bothering

LIRING-3 and has been partly responsible for his depressed moods

upset his wife.

The latter is particularly

which, in turn, the people in the Cuban Embassy for what she con-

disgusted with

siders

the poor treatment they

gave her husband prior to the

Tatter's last trio

to Cuba (Headquarters will recall that she was

fired at that time for

telling off the Cuban Ambassador) .

4.

There is little question that ROWTON played his cards

well with LIRING-3 and especially his wife who agreed to reestablish

contact with the local Cubans to help RONTON and her husband.

As

can be seen from ROWTON's last report, the Cubans were quick to

seize the opportunity to develop better relations with LIRING-3's

wife and, through her, LIRING-3. The latter was naving

lunch with

Ramiro Abreau Padron on 26 April as this dispatr., was being.

written.

Enrique MORALES, meanwhile, is in Guatemala to receive

instruction in the art of making plastic flowers from Angelo

ARVANITIS.

He carried with him a letter of introduction written

by LIRING-7.

It was necessary to clinch the plastic flower deal

which will

serve to cover LIRING-3's activities with the Guatemalan

rebels,

to use LIRING-7 to vouch for LIRING-3 with Angelo

ARVANITIS.

1n dealing$ with LIRING-3.

Forwarded As Attachment Two, under separate cover, is

a photocopy of a document from the Mexican Secretariat of

Gobernacion notifying LIRING-3's wife that the visa application

for her father, now in the United States, has been denied.

is not too surprising in view of the father's current nationality

and racial background.

64-36-96, after having alerted forales that iII G/ would be calling

for an interview. IIRING/3 described jorales as a joung Mexican, aged

about 35, married with a family, employed in some sort of printing

work, ara"non-politácal": farcia hag teld him that forales was a close

personal fricnò but not

üuring the period indicated, The conversation on sesh sides concerned

travel by lorales to Custonala as well as efforts teinc mado by Moraies

to obtain a military service card and passport. Ml this was reported

promptly to. Rowton by IIXI:3/3 excent the details re

the military ser-

vice card and the passport. Thore vas no mentio: oi Garcia, end only

one possible reference to kouton ("that man"-6/4/67: 31i-1 (4.5). II-

RIIG/3 shas told koton that he already has tola dorales that ne has

a partner in the plasic flower business with vace he must

certain details.

The only points in the conversations wit: lorales not already known to

Rowton are references to a carers, which liorales, syparently at JINING, 3

request, looked at and checked the price ($600) in Sears Roebuck. and

to "Handbags" (Bolsas). These are probably items that ülkING/3 and

Morales are arranging to purchase in san Criatóbal at lor cost and sell

in rexico City (IIKING/3 mentioned this to Rowton at one podnt). Kowton

cannot explain the refcrence to the corera, but thinks it may be for

Garcis.

Anotber item not understandable to Forton is = riference by

There eppears also a mysterious reference to a "hruse" made by loreles

on 12/4/57 that "oton carnot explein. ¡orales stales that ne rouid

probably be coina"to the house"that night. 1I:inG/3 doos not undor-

stanà and asks," cere?" Do wich torales siarly replies, "to the

house". MIRIC/? replies simply,

"oh,es." This could be a referense

to sorething like the "Casa de las Americas" rather than a safenouse.

B) Conversation concerning the (ralse) Birtace silicate: 1Ix110/3

reported to Roton that he had arranged througo a luovo credo laszer

naned Rolando Ricias, recoumended and intogauced to him by his hali-

brother, to obtain a birticertilicate with mách he cod apply for

a false rassport. This had been ursea on hirty both ismail Sucres

de la Paz and Sarcia himself to conceal travel into cuba and Quate-

mala. IIRING/3 stated to howton that he had seen instructed by fiojas

to appear at the Registro Civile of lexico Üity and the birtacertifi-

cate liculd ba tiren to hin by an official ivertified to sim only by

number. - IRING/s added that no name had as get been determined, since

it would be necessary for the lavyer to find an unused birticertificate.

I.IrING/3 reported that the lawyer had demanded a 2,000 peso fee and

that, since he had only 500 pesos to space, his half-brother loaned

him 1,500 pesos en

the spot. IIING/3 asked Porton for this amoint

on 7/4/5? so that ne could reimburse his half-brother, and tier on

second thought, since it was a bit urgent, asted rowton nimself to

cable the noney with the messae "I's repayiis the loan. Thank you".

There nay be deception here inasmuch as in bis conversation with his

half-brothor IItmic/3 staies "Don't pay any attention to the text,

which is 'I thair you for the loun'". lo reference is made to a lavyer

or

Rolando Riojas. Furthermore IININC/3 teils zis half-orother that

he went to Recistro Civil but the certificate had not as jet arrived.

He asks the two nines of the parents. "is bali-brother roglies civing

that 11200/3 is pazine hi: the 1,500 pesos, after taring put in a claim

the matter, on at least ober the way for close questioning by Routon.

C) Conversations with an unidentified oraz: on 11/4/67 and 12/4/57 an

whether she will be "there" the next doo, hen she menlise that che rill

Report dated 12, April covers meetings with "GARCIA"

of the FAR and Enrique MORALES Guerra recently introduced

to L-3 by GARCIA to help him with the plastic flower business.

The Station did not have

sufficient advance notice to have

GARCIA and MORALES surveilled.

In connection with paragraph

5 of that report dealing with Alicia ECHEVARRIA, ROWTON has

been trying to have L-3 meet Alicia to use her with the PBRUMENers

as a

"source" for some items of information passed L-3 by

ROWTON.

Alicia, who drinks like a fish and is frequently

under the weather, seems to have a difficult time remembering

what she tells people.

ECHEVARRIA, GARCIA and Jacobo

I] ING/3 used the assumed name Juarez in leavin[ the message).

2. LIRING/3 stated that he had left lie:ico City by train on the evening

ol 31 Marcu, 1967, and arrived in Saltillo the folloring day. Le tock a

bus fron there to his destivation, Sabinas, and met his half-brother at

his home. He reviewed with his half-brother the problem of octaining a

jiuonou flu Cho Secsutradad of Connoras ad Trasatro as Sittinad 49

his by his friend Sergio Gonzalez Marin. Fis half-orother suscested that

they both contact a close friond of his, a certain jercio Arche, in

Villa Acuña, who, he explained, worked as an alectrical engineer in the

local radio station and knew all the ins and outs of trade, both legal

and illegal, with the U.S. He then drove IIRING/3 to Villa icuña and they

cortinued their discussions in the presence of Arche. The latter finally

recommended that be set up a fictitious company at once in Del Rio, Texas,

that could issue a letter guaranteeing purchase of the complete pro-

duction of the factory in jan Cristóbal ( Plastiflor de San Cristóbal)

to satisiy the requirements of the Secretariat of Commerce and Industry.

Ee made it clear to iIRING/3 that be, with the help of LIRING/3's half-

brother, would really sell the flowers through legitimate companies in

both del Rio and Houston, Texas, but this would take time and some bar-

gaining. iccording to LIRING/3 all three agreed to the sussestion of

Arche and the latter proceeded immediately to Del Rio to carry out his

plan. He returned the following day and reported that he had vithout

difficulty recistered the fictitious corpany, baptized "Floriex Co., in

Del kio by paying a snall (*20.00) fee, and at the same time obtained a

Fost Office Box (739) in the sane city as the mailing address. 1IRIi3/3

RInG/3 Inserted here parenthetically that ooth his half-brother and ser-

gio Arche were progressives and rould not object io any insinuation that

HEHORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT : Tape Recording of LIRING-3/ROHTON Meeting

REFERENCE: HIMA 31310, 8 Scptember 1967

'1. Subject tape consists of a 75-minute recording of

a meeting between Wallace B. RONTON and LIRING-3 at the

LIRING-3 safehouse on 20 January 1967 (this safehouse is now

no longer being used as such but rather is a residence for

LIFING-3 and his wife).

2. Following are facts extracted from a quick run

through of the tape:

a. LIRING-3 made a long distance telephone call

to kuby SUAREZ de Rodragucz at telephone 30-67-04 in Havana. ber a

He placed the call from the safehouse phone 14-18-56.

HAH The call was zade 1I bustonele on

connection with a possible

forthcoming trip of LIRING-3 to Harena, It was

developed

during the call that Ruby was the wife of Arnol Rodreguez limf

and that their daughter was seriously ill. This information

hush

apparently was previously known to. LIRING-3. who used the

1llness as a pretext for the call. Ruby had asked

LIRING-3 to obtain medicine for the daughter which was

known

as NECCRAM. LIRING-3 advised Ruby that he was unable

to locate any medicine by this name and asked for the

formula dif the medicine or the name of the

Tabel producine

1t.

During the conversation LIRING-3 said that he expected

aterade

to be in

Hervana within 15 to 20 days.

During this neeting

ROwTOr set up a 5, 000 pedas cashung fund with

LIRING-3.

c. During the conversation the names Navarrete

(Carlos) and Jacobe were mentioned. It is believed that

artists and leftist friends of LIRING-3.

d. Another name was

mentioned, that of slax

SANTANA although theming of the reference was unclear.

(Max Santana

a weil-known Cuban exile in Mexico City

who was formerly a labor leader in the pre-Castro era.

He is sonewhat of a lehistle rascal and has to make

his living the best he can, but he is also the representative

of Carlos

PRIO, a former president of Cuba, in Nexico.

The CUIS bas several times expressed interest in Max

SANTANA to double agents handled by the Station.)

e. An interesting item was dropped by LIRING-3

in connection with an alleged statement by Fidel Castro

that the young lexican Communist Party members working

In Cuba were "algo burgues". The remark was interesting

in view of the strained relations

between PCM and PC.

f. Another interesting remark dropped by LIRING-3

was that the Cuban leaders are highly unhappy "con el embaggle"!

This is interesting in light of independent reports we have

had that the Cuban Ambassador was anything but a happy man

when he returned a few days ago fron his two month vacation

in Cuba.

g. Several telephone calls occurred during the

course of the neeting or just afterwards. One of these

involved an apparent inquiry by the person calling in as

to the name in which the phone was registered because

LIRING-3 said that the telephone was in the name of Maria

Sanchez. Another telephone call of interest occured during

the meeting. It was apparently made by a young lady

calling in connection with an

anticipated neeting. with

LIRING-3. As the tape ran out LIRING-3 apparently was

waiting

for the young lady's

arrival.

speculate on their sotives for encouraging the creation

of the supply channel, we can be certain those motives are

Inimical to the interests of the United States.

So far it has not been possible to confirm IIRING-3'8

contacts with the FAR or PGT in Guatemala or in Hexico,

the nature of his contacts with the Cuban Embassy in Mexico,

or with Cuban officlals in Cuba.

We know that he has

traveled to Guatemala, to Cuba, and has visited the Cuban

Embassy, but have only his word on

what transpired after he

arrived.

at these places.

On the other hand, we have confirmed

that he has withheld information from us, e.g.,

the fact

that his wife worked in the Cuban Embassy and

that his

father-in-law resides in

the United States.

It 18 partially for this reason therefore, that

¡eadquarters is particularly anxlous that LIRING-3'g

with "Garcia" should be confired and "Garcia"

of course, if "Garcia" 1s the faR

representative in Mexico and

1s in contact with the Soviets,.

then 1de=t1fylng him

ra an imoortant objective in itself,

apart from the establishment of LIRING 3'8 bonafides.

5.

Given the difficulty of confiruing LIRING-3'8

accounts of contacts inside Cuba, inside Guatemala, or

even inside the Cuban Embassy,

Headquarters sees the

LIRING-3 - Garcia contact, in the favorable operational

climate of Mexico City, as providing the opportunity to

obtain the

confirmation which is so much needed in this

operation.

B.

While it is understood that Station 1s as

appreciative as 1s Headquarters of the importance of

1dentifying Garcia, we wish by this dispatch to emphasize

the sense

of urgency which we consider proper for this

identification eifort.

We urge that the Station cousider

survelllance of

the earliest possible neeting of which

it has sufficient advance knowledge to nount coverage.

is also suggested, stuce Garcia may travel to the Soviet

Union and this next meeting with LIRING 3 may be quite some

time in the future, that the Station explore all possible

Investigative means to Identify Garcia which could be

Initiated without walting for a surveillable meeting.

Possibilittes which have been discussed here inelude:

periodic surveillance of LIRING-3; LIFEAT and LINUD

coverage of LIRING-3; passage of photos of Guatenalang

who could possibly be Garcla to Rontos who, 11 a suitable

explanation for his possession of the photos could be

devised, could show them to LIRING-3 for identification;

Including "Garcia" in a listing of allages known

used by FAR members, and asling bIREBELl to identify

the user; or, obtaining a detalled physical description

of Garcia for possible Identification by LIREBELl,

Guatemala Station, or Guatemala Station assets.

in LI-I: C/3 Cperation.

1. During the month kowton continued to meet with lIkING/3 regularly,

on an average of three times per reek, for about one hour, a: the safe-

house and (later in the month; at IlnlnG/3's pernajent residence. L1-

RING/3 continued to accept Roston's guidance and direction virtually.

without question. Cr 15 February Poton prepared the draft of a project

outlining targets and objectives in order to soliäify lubark's relation-

ship with iIRING/3. In order to facilitate financial arrengements with

LIRING/3 a revolving fund of 5,000 pesos was given to him by Rowton to

be accounted for periodically against receipts.

2o bevejo dents mild respecü ic Guva:

Durine the reporting period IlkINGI3's relationship with the Cubans

deterioratedfor reasons not as yet

fully understood either by norton

or LIRING/3 himself. It wiil be recalled that, folloving his passing

of sensitive information on the Lopez arrest, LIRIIiG/3 was invited

to lavana to discuss further collaboration.

Eis subsequent visit,

however, was not as fruitful as exrected, despite the fact that he

finally net with Cienfuegos through the intervention of his friend

•Arnol Rodriguez. In lieu of a specific nissicn for the Cubans, as

both Il IIG/3 and Rovton hoped, he was brushed off on an apparenly

IIKING/3 felt strongly that he

should establish relationships nito the Guatemalan rebels on his

own ( tarough Jacobo Rodricuez), more or less ignoring the cubans,

and particularly the

DSE, in the nore that the Cuvans would inevi-

tably recognize the merit of his efforts and take him into their

-

confidence. At howton's urging, however, LINIG/3 agreed to write

his friend Arnol Rodriguez a letter explaining nore fully his posi-

tion and inforning him that he was in any case moving ahead with ihis

plan to help the Guatenalä: rebels. This apparently did the trick,

since lodriguez rassed a message to him through the Cuban Ambassador

that he as invited back to lavana for further discussions. LINTNG/3

expressed a treat deal of self-satisfuction at this development, but

felt be should continue with the FiR representatives in order to have

nore concrete data to discuss vita the Cubans when he did return to

Havana. He therefore returned to Guatemala in order to advise the

FAR ropresentatives that he had succeeded In obteining the medicine

and radio tubes they bad ori. l.ally asred for.

In February, however, he received word from irnol rodriguez througa

a diploratic courier that he should not return to Havana until he bad

received further Instructins from Arnol Rodriguez himself. subse-

quently, on 15 February, LIKING/3 learned from the chauffeur of the

Cuban Abassador that Julian Lopez had alleged that LIRIliC/3 had o3-

tained the information regarding his arrest fro. the Mexican police,

and, by insinuation,

was collaborating with the lexican authorities.

The cueuffour added that lINI. G/3 should be aware that there were cer-

tain elesents, including Cepeda, in the local imbassy hostile to bin.

This report led IIRING/3 to check with the Cuban Consulate re the

status so bio vioa fanthorized in curlo canual, ly danol courigued, auù

to his surprise he learned that the visa had "rur out" and would have

to be renewed in the event he desired to travel to Cuba again.

This devslopment left IIRIIS/3 perplexed and disturbed, as well as more

annoyed than ever with the bureaucratic shenanigans of the DsE. LIMiNG/3

telt genuinely outrsted silice he in his own mind had only the best of

intentions in his offer to help the Cubans and in general the revolu-

tion in Central inerica. IIRING/3's first reaction was to ignore the

Cubans completely and proceed unilaterally with his collaboration rith

the Guatemalans. lie was encourared in this by corments made by the

FAR contact in Mexico City to the uffect that the Cubans vere difficult

people to deal with and sometimes even FiR found it best to ignore then.

kowton, however, urged IININC/3 to redevelop nore cordial relatiors

with the local mission, since any hostile elemerts there coula cause

him endless embarassment and annoyance. Rowton also advised LIRING/3

to continue his development of Ismail suarez de la Paz, who appears

to have a direct channel to irnol Rodriguez, and who himself has often

complained of the inefficiency and ineptnoss of the Cuban bureaucrats.

During the latter half of the month LInG/3 made nore frequent visits

to the bassy and chatled cordially with Abrew. is of 28 February, bow-

ever, no further messie has been received from irnol Rodriguez to

clarily LIRING/3's current relationship with the Cubans.

arranced for 20 February, idcutified hinself is the lAR liaison ibo

would be seeing him more or less reularly in the future.

The FAR

liaisos, who stated his nine vas Garcia, explained that he was plaz-

nug a trip to the Soviet Urion in the near future, and was ansious

prior to his departure to have LIRIlig/3 meet with three other comrades

preferably in San Cristóbal when the medicine and radio tubes were

being delivered. IIRI:G/3 agreed to make the trip, since at the sere

time he could arrange the rental of a suitable house in the area for

future contacts. LIRING/3 therefore made plans to iepart with the

supplies for san gristóbal on 1 liarch.

LINING/3 had not informed the Cuban Embassy of his newly developed

liaison with FAR, but has indicate in a general ay to irnol Rod-

riruez toat he is engaged in support activities for the revolution in

Guatenala. He hopes to clarify nith the FAR more precisely what nis

own relationship with the Jubans should be with roard to their activi-

ties, especially in light of the fact that the fAk representative nas

informed him that direct aid is now being received from the Soviets and

certain of his activities are not being made known to the Subans:

In general in his dealings ith the Cuatemalans, LIninG/3 feels more

comfortable since his rclationship with them is uncomplicated at the

moment by such antecedents as the jopez affair. He is inpressed by the.

efficiency and profes:ional approach of fAR and in undoubtedly. In-.

fluenced by the relative ease with which he can roforn for them in

During the month of February, IIRING/3 presented a formal reguest to

the Dirreción General de Comercio through his friend Sergio González

Mom 184- Maris for the establisinent of a suall factory to assemble the plastic

flowers produced by the Metaloplastica de Guatemala. In anticipation

of a request by the Secretariat for details and assurances that the

flowers will be exported to the U.S. and not compete with local pro-

Who

duction, IIRI G/3 re-established contact with his half-brother who

lives in Sabenas and has excullent connurcial contacts with firms in

San Antonio, in the hope of solllelting his help in finding an American!

importer who will contract to purchase the entire pooduction of the

factory once it is set up in liexico. At the same time LIRING/3, on

Kowton's suggestion, will investigate the possibility of establishing

a modest factory in the bouse he plans to rent in San Cristóbal.

Negotiations with local

authorities in that area would be much simpler

thün in lexico ity and at the same tine the factory would provide

excellent cover for the safebouse.

If and when the flower project materializes, arrangements can easily

be made by IIRING/? to have the first shigment sent from Guatcuala

City by truck to San Cristóbal. A qualified lexican can lilerise be

sent to learn the technical details of assembly at the retuloplastica

plant in Guetemala City.

The entire commercial cover plan has been accepted enthusiastically by

FAR since it, presents to them the invitino prospect of a viable legal

network operating from texas to Guatemala City. LixiNG/3 reezizes the

delicacy of the future relationship with retaloplastica and IIRING/7

and has pinocü üd vuipurtuont as nuch se pnosible, at least for the

present; his activities on benalf of fis from those of a purely com-

mercial rastare.

3. During the month it was necessary for llßING/3 to nove his funily into

the safehouse, which he had rented in his oin name, in order to disabuse

the landlady of her growins suspicions that the apartment was being used

for some unorthodox purpose. IINING/3 explaired to the landlady that be

had been havine some domestic proolems vith his iife, but that things bad

been patched up and that they were now able to resume their married life

together. this has apparently satisfied the suriosity of the landlady..

Anotber saîchouse, under cover of an art studio, will ve located for fü-

ture neetings between üIRiNC/3 and Rowton. The oririnal plan to nuritor

the safchouse from the apartment below has been abandoned in view of the

undesirubility if the couple currently residing in the proposed IP.

Reallotically, much of LIRING? expense

should be added to this total, sinoe

I-d saan funation has been to support LIRING-3 op.

LIRING, op has occupied Bayof portion ROWTON time oves past joar, Plus time

tron other Station and ileadquarters personnel in support. It 18 an expensive op.

Has producod fivo dissens. Tuo of these later proven false, one proven to

be rasically true (by LIENVOY), on other two have no furthur info either way.

LIRING-3 has also reported cordiderable other info which comes under heading

of positivo intol, but was not dissened because at the time he reported it

1t was doubtful, known to be false, praguentary, ate.

Over the past year it has not been possible to verify eten one soothere

Importest statement or clain of the many rade by L93 (persons he has talked to,

actiona he has taken, Information he has obtainod, atc.). I-3 has claimed

actione and coliacts ranging fron Nexico City to lavana, to natanala vity,

to Texas, and points in between. while we know he traveled through these

areas, nothing really conclusl-ve or key is confirmed. On the other hand,

several of his claima aro known to be falso.

Given or inability to check-out I-3 statenents, now salla conclusion or

valuation of op 1s possible. A good bet would be that les has completely

fabricatod 90% of his Information and claired actions. His motive voudd be

money, since this op has paid off very well so far for him.

A good bet would be that he suspects Rowton is US Intelligence, based on

the requirements lovied on his, the ready supply of money,

the clandestinity

a April 1967

LIRING/3 - Norris K. UPHLETT Chronology

Carlos JURADO Delmar, a Mexican artist and existentialist,

is an unwitting ifformant who has Mexican far leftist political

convictions.. He has been assessed by his handler as unfriendly to

the U.S. and not a candidate for recruitment. JURADO's wife, Mirian

CHICHAY, a Chinese-Cuban, worked in the Cuban Embassy in l'exico City

until November 1966 for LIPING/1 and LIRING/2. PONTON Pretends to

be a Greek businessman interested in developing lucrative, semi-legal

husiness with Cuha. JRADD may have the impression that RAmN is

really somehow connected with Soviet intelligence - a notion ROTTON

Cotties.

has not attempted to disab

a He has convinced JURADO

that to be successful the two of them mist be fully avare of all the

realities of Cuban politics and commerce. JURADO, who lived in Cuba

for a couple of years

following CASTRO's accession, has maintained

friendships with some well-placed contacts in Cuba. He has made

three trips to Havana in connection with his relationships with

RONTON, Who obtains information from JURADO by eliciting and direct

questioning.

As a result of the injection of J.TADO by Station Mexico

City into the sensational JULIAN LOPEZ Diaz/Guatemalan Arms Suggling

case, JURADO was asked by the Cuban Embassy to help the fOC with their

sensitive astivitées in Mexico and to go to Havana for

a briefing

on what he cAuld do. To inject JURADO into the case, Station Mexico

City furnished him with some theretofore undisclosed infornation on

the arrest by 'exican authorities of LOPEZ Diab, a Cuban diplomat, Thi

inger alles

• allegedly exisits from a Guatemalan reporter who had obtained it fros

a member of the Guatemalan Communist party. In Havana, MRADO

discussed the case at length with his friend and contact, Arnol

RODRIGUEZ Camps, a fomer Vice-linister in the cuban Foreign Ministry.

He also told RODRIGUEZ details of a plan to form his l'exican and

Central American contacts into a network which could support clandestines

asts, Cuban operations. PODRIGUEZ appeared to br impressed, according

tO JURADO's story, and introduced JURADO to Osmani CIENFUECOS, Chairran

of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Central Conmittee of the Cuban

Communist Party (the body charged with the responsibility for

impiadenting Cuan Subversion in Latir Morier,). MDAM ronnrted

that CIENFUEGOS expressed appreciation for JURADO's offer of assistance and

stated that Cuba is interested in exporting subversion to Central

America to harass the Inited States.*

CIENFUEGOS reportedly went on to say that the tubanstrusteal JURADO

but not his contacts about who they krio nothing. He further.

explained that one untrustvorthy link could blow the entire effortt

and and then suggested that JillAD be given the opportunity to test the

sincerity of his contects. RODRICUEZ reportedly suggested that

JURADO arrange a deal to barter Cuban Nickel ore for weed killer.

(Cuban Nickel ore is already being offered in Mexico by other dealers and

Mexican-made weed killer is readily available

on the open market

in Mexico).

## Page 190

Despite Headquarters suggestions that JURADO go slowly in setting

-EMAT STI!

up his support net to the Guatemalan guerrillas, BE RONTON sett him

to establish contact ishut with them on the !'erican/Guatenalan border

in early Decenber 1966. JURADO established contact with a mah in

Mexico tity who gave him a letter ef introduction to a woman in Cuatemala

City. The woman was to carry the letter to Cesar MONTES, Guatenalan

guerrilla leader and explain thut he could wif trust JURADD and should

take advantage of his offer. At the same time JURADO sent a letter to

RODRUGUEZ in Havana explaining that he could not make his comercial

contact witting of any arms passed through the proposed channel.

tie also sent iniontion on weed millers and roquested letails

for possible consumating the deal.

In mid-December JURIDO again traveled to a town on the

Mexicans side of the Guatemalan border and cantacted the guerrilla

representatives. He reported that he was taken "black" across the

border to Guatemala City where the guerrillas told him of some of

their problems in obtaining material, specifically & mentioning their

need for sone radio tubes and mecical supplies. JURADO conmitted

himself to providing those items along with a concrete proposal for

regular contact. The guerrillas reportedly told JURADO that they

could handle the goods from the Mexican side of the border to their base

camp in Guatemala.

At this point the !lexico City Station proposed to mount a

paralles operation involving Norris K.UPIILETT, a 33 year old Greek

who was recruited in 1952 by RCYTON to penetrate the U.S., Greek, and

Cuban Cammunist Parties. UPHLETT perfoemed adequately inthese tasks

including ael but the last two years of aver five spent in Cuba.

PONTON sent IMPHLETT to guatemala in late February 1966 on a

"business development" trip to estahlish contact with elements who

could be used as support elements for subversion including clandestine

esupply of guerrilla groups. It has propsoed that these elements woul

an EDA deputy in Athens. UMILETT is to exploit this relationship

in an effort. to land a job in the husiness as a cover to assist the

Creek in clandestine activity.

In nid-JanuaTy 1967 JURADO reported that the Cuban Mirassador had

called him aside at a party to teil him that RaRICE? cabled the

Embassy to request JRAN's presence in Cuba for additional discussions.

Rather than jump on Havana's cormand, JURADO called RODRIGUEZ tO

infom him he would have to make another trip to ruatemala first.

JURANO reported that he was approached by another Guatemala Comnist

ito claimed, in confidence, that he was part of the FAR netherk

in Mexico and had been advised that massive Soriet aid (in exoess

of: $200,000) was available to the FAR "direct)," but with qualifications

that would in effect place the FAR under complete Soviet control. He

explained that it was for

this reason that the FAR was raising funds

on its own by such neans as bank and train rotheries, in Central America.

## Page 192

At the end of Januazy JPADO reported he had made contact

with the FAR representatives in ruatemala City and had riade arrangenents

for permanent liaison in 'lexico City and Havana. He was firen contact

instructiors, which sould he initiated by the FAR repsesentatives, and was told

instant to passthe supplois (that he had carmitted hinsel! to

providing) to the contact man in 'exico City.

A special envoy from Cuba visited JURADO the day after he

returned from Guatenala for the ostensible purpose of passing on

some advise and guidance of a security nature. RO:TON speculated that the

Cuhans - particularly RODRICUEZ - were afriid JRADO had taken offense

at their treatment of him on his last rixited visit to suha, and sent

someone to salve his feelings. The envoy gave JURADO a lot of advice on how

to handle himself with respect to the Cuban Embassy persornel,

American intelligence, and on security and tradecraft in general.

On 15 February lEDPERA, the Cuban Embassy chauffeur anda

friend of JUFADD, met with the agent to tell him some rumors he

had heard involving JURADO including the statement that there were

certain "hostile elements" toward JURADO in the Embassy. RETON

cautioned JURADO not to be too aloof with the Embassy causing them

to react unfavorabley toward him for no reason after kirts than

that they were out of touch with him.

On 20 February "carcia" the TA representative in "exie t

City because of "the incredible network of agents run by the North

Americars throughout the city." tie said that the FAR didn't have an

urgent need for the supplies because they were adequately suppléed

by the Soviets and Cubans but that the FAR had no objections to

JURADO dealing with Yon Sosa's 5-13" Noverber which is not so well

supplied. "Garcia" said he was scheduled to travel to the soviet

Union and wanted to discuss fall the aspects of Jules support

operation so that aditivies could nove ahead in his absence. "Carcia"

contrasted the "bother" of dealing with the Cubans with the seethics of

relations with the Soviets.

On 2 March JURADO traveled tothe Mexico/Guatemala border

part of

town of San Cristobal to deliver/the m supplies to the representatives

of the FAR guerrillas. "Carcia" showed up and he and JURADO went

to a thon nearet-the Guatemalan border where they transferred the

goods. "Garcia" said he would take possession of the refeigerated

drugs in 'exico City after retuming from the USSR. The FAR rep-

resentatives explained, Chey had a fairly sexi seterk in Texas for.

the acquisition of arms but were having trouble transporting them.

They indicated JURADO's plan was better than arything they have going

and would probably acopt it. Fefore he left for ISSR, "Garciz"

called JRADO to tell him that Cesar MONTES and Yon SOSA had patched

up their differences and the Guaremalan guerrilal movement rould move ahead

ALYSIS AND COGENTS

INTENT OF TIE OPERATION: To provide inforantion: " Cuatemalan

insurgency; Cuban - and perhaps - Soviet support of subversion

in Guatenala; the use of Mexico by the Cubans and Soviets

to support Guatemalan insurgency; identify people, pin-point

locations, and establish metliods of operation of insurgents

and their support nterorks in ruatemala and Mexico.

i. ESTABLISIMENT OF SUPPLY NETORK - PATON is having

LIRING/3 establish a supply network in l'exico and fuaionale to pass

materiel to the insurgents in luatemala. The supplies could

originate in either the U.S., fu':a, or by sea from any countrie

In doing this, members of existing support networks are not being

identified - only the aliases of some of LIRINr/3's contacts.

This network could tery well operate parallel to other such channels

and he would not learn any nore than he are learning now. In fact,

He could conceivably assist (uatemalan insurgency and get little

or nothing in rethrn -- and should the operation go awry this agency

would be hard put toexplain the circunstances. You can be sure the

leftiats would have a field day.

We are not adverse to providing

some materiel as long as le get something in return.

20. "IRING/3'& REPORTINE, - None of the ifformation LIRINT/3

has reported has been corroborated by other sources. Mly the

existence and presence of

some of the contacts has been coffined by

technical operations at the Station, but not the infomation. So

far we, and PONTON, have no choice but to believe most of what

LIRING/3 tells us. formoN's capability in the Spanish language is

only adequate and one taped meeting showed that LIRINF/3 spole right

ovor RovioN and domiaated the conversation. i It is conceivable that

LIRING/3 is controlling the entite operation and that PrITON

is not able to discern this. Also, because of the unusual nature of

their relationship and Routhuge enver mummy is not ablo to question

LIRING/3 too deeply in some areas and not at all in others. And

we are assuming that RONTON's cover is effective.

onecteri

3. SURVEILLANCT - The LIRING/3 operation has been going

for over a year now and the only surveillance of the agent has been

an abortive attempt at tapping his telephone and an audio device

in the safehouse in which he and his wife are now living. His phone

should be tapped constantly, his mail should be intercepted and read, he

should be surveilled for a couple of weeks to establish his pattern

of activities, photographs should be taken of him and his contacts,

and he sould be investigated to find out where his money comes

from, where it goes, what his wife does all day, etc.

4, SUMARY - After a ye, the operation is dot paying off

as it should and the agency and ROWTON

are cormitted to a situation

that could hackfire in

several ways, Steps should be taken soon to confirm

LIRINC/3's access and information and to establish beyond the

shadow of a douht his bona fide. Headatarters is rot at all convinced

that 1) LIRINC/3 believes RA:TON's cover story, 2) That LTRINC/3

is in contact wilith the FAR, 3)

that the opposition is not playing

A, L-3 SHOULD NOT BE WORRIED OVER TREATMENT

MENDIA SAID EVEN HE, A SPECIAL ENVOY, HAD EXPER-

IENCED DIFFICULTIES WITH THEM AND L-3 MUST UADER-

STAND THEY BUREAUCRATS WITH LITTLE OR NO COMPETENCE.

HE CITED REYNALDO CEPEDA HERNANDEZ WHOM HE DESCRIBED

AS A GOOD MAN BUT ONE WHO SEES "FANTASMAS EN

TODOS LADOS" AND DREAMS UP IMAGINATIVE REPORTS

FOR HAVANA. ECHEMENDIA TOLD L-3 TO HAVE PATIENCE

AND MATURITY AS HE HIMSELF HAD BASED ON YEARS OF
