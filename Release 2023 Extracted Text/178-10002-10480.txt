In Cone, 23 April 1963
THE WHITE HOUS

he was giving the Special Group this afternoon a study showing the results
of 51 days' reconnaissance over Cuba and that this was disturbing when the
four principal targets were analyzed. There were 59 occasions when
weather precluded any readout of what was going on in these four Soviet
military camps. Some of the camps were not seen for five or six days in
a row and in one instance for as long as 12 successive days. Mr. McCone
then read from the memorandum on reconnaissance over Cuba dated 23 April
1963 and said he would provide the Board with a copy.
The DCI then reported that James Donovan during a nighttime drive
to Veradero had passed a convoy of 25 very large trucks, the type generally
carried on railroad flatcars. Mr. McCone stated that an examination of the
photography for that day and the following day provided absolutely no trace
of the convoy. Dr. Land stated that the DCI's previous statement may have
provided the answer as to where this convoy might be. The DCI said he
planned to recommend low-level flights in order to provide more information.
:
10. At this point Mr. FitzGerald was asked to give his presentation on
operations in Cuba. He commenced by displaying the chart which indicated
the number of resident agents, illegal teams, legal teams, shipboard agents
and penetrations of Cuban installations. He noted that the number of illegal
teams had risen to three as a result of a successful operation on Sunday,
and one of these teams had as many as 100 subagents with extensive coverage
in the province of Pinar del Rio. Dr. Langer asked what the subagents were
looking for, and Mr. FitzGerald replied that their coverage was mostly
military. Mr. Murphy asked if these agents were all strictly collecting
intelligence, and Mr. FitzGerald replied that this was their primary purpose
at the moment, but the illegals could create a resistance net if this was
desired. He pointed out that the policy at the present time precluded attempt-
ing to develop a large scale dangerous activity.
Mr. FitzGerald pointed out that the penetration of Cuban installations
were mainly diplomatic installations and that some 14 Cuban diplomats were
our agents. Mr. Clifford asked how the information was gotten out of Cuba,
and Mr. FitzGerald replied that it was mostly by secret writing transmitted
to Mexico City by mail and then forwarded to Washington. He said there
were four radios in Cuba and that we now had a greatly improved medium
speed transmitter that was quite small, the size of about two cigarette cartons,
and it could get a message off in just 60 seconds. He said that there was a,
smaller and better transmitter currently in the process of development.

Dr. Land asked if the loss of this transmitter would compromise others.
Mr. FitzGerald replied that it would not compromise any other agents
except the one apprehended, and the DCI noted that it would simply com-
promise the instrument.
Mr. Murphy asked concerning the quality of substantive reporting,
and Mr. FitzGerald noted that the 1,040 reports looked impressive, but it
was quite true that this was not a true indication. He said that some of the
reporting was very good, and there were two Cuban ambassadors on the
payroll who provided some first-rate reports and were closest to the bone
in what Castro was thinking. Mr. Murphy asked if we had Castro's
immediate entourage penetrated, and Mr. FitzGerald said his sister worked
for us but that she didn't alway's have inside information. He pointed out
that the 665 reports from resident agents were primarily on military targets,
and the intelligence community felt they were really worthwhile as a supple-
ment to overhead reconnaissance. General Doolittle asked if an illegal
team was two men and Mr. FitzGerald replied "yes". Mr. Murphy asked
whether these agents provided information on Soviet troop strength and
equipment, and Mr. FitzGerald replied in the affirmative. Mr. Clifford
noted that with just two illegal agent teams in Cuba at this time we were
back to where we started from in 1962. Mr. FitzGerald commented that the
casualty rates were very high and referred to the charts "Legal Resident
Agents in Cuba" and "Illegal Agent Development".

Mr. Gray asked if the modest number of agents was a result of
policy or operations. Mr. FitzGerald replied that this was primarily a
result of operations and noted that it was not the result of lack of effort, but
because of the high attrition rate and the dangers involved. He went over
the lists of what had happened to the agents that were put in. He noted that
it was presently planned to carry out approximately five operations a month.
Mr. Mürphy asked if there was evidence of organized resistance in Cuba.
Mr. FitzGerald replied "yes", but they were now small bands scattered
throughout the island. He noted that Castro had broken up the large country-
wide resistance networks last summer. He then produced the chart entitled
"Illegal Infiltration -- Exfiltration Operations" and commented on this.
Mr. Murphy asked if the groups on the island committed sabotage, and
Mr. FitzGerald said the policy presently precluded major sabotage operations
and limited it to "subtle sabotage". Mr. Murphy asked what constituted
"subtle sabotage", and Mr. FitzGerald described it as tying a rock to a wire
and throwing it across high tension lines.

11. The Board then turned to Mr. Cottrell and asked him to describe
the work of his group. Mr. Cottrell said the President had become con-
cerned there were so many government agencies dealing with so many
Cuban groups, and he had set up the group under Mr. Cottrell to coordinate
all of this activity. He said that his immediate group consisted of a repre-
sentative of Defense and CIA, and there were additional committees or
groups reporting to them. He outlined the general policy guidance under
which they were operating and under questioning from Mr. Murphy stoutly
denied that the policy was basically defensive in nature, and it was
directed toward getting rid of communism and Castro in Cuba. It was
further explained that CIA's activities were coordinated through this group.
:
12. Dr. Killian then asked Bruce Clarke to give a brief report on the
situation in Cuba, and with the aid of photographs Clarke analyzed the
present Soviet troop strength on the island and explained how these figures
were arrived at. At 12:00 this session was recessed to permit the presenta
tion by DIA.
