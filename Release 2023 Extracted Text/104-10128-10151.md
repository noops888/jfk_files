#348295

DATE: 13 June 1969

c/1s14

Reference is made to memorandum of 12 June 1969,

on/cerhara HOLLANDER, #428 596.] According to a notation

by DCS on their listing of available reports regarding the 1963

Conference of the International Federation for Automatic Controls,

held in Basel, switzerland, one of the sourges on the conferenc

apparently was D. Do"PIDHAYNE, of Aerospace, Corps, who was

related in some way to HOLLANDER, or to the HOLLANDER

debriefing by DCS.

2. Denny D. PIDHAYNY, #409 988 - BZ, and C-300562

Or has been of past interest to DCS, to SR Division, under the

AE-HOLLY Operation, and to DO/SR. File indicates an unresolved

question as to whether PIDHAYNY is identical to a Communist of

the same name in Michigan.

3. In December 1963, 0O/C advised PSD that PIDHAYNY,

who had been in correspondence with Soviet scientist Alexis G.

IVAKHNENKO, reported that IVAKHNENKO, mentioned he had

been a next door neighbor of the American defector, Libero

RICCIARDELLI, in Riev. In October 1963, IVAKHNENKO had aske

that PIDHAYNY write a welcoming letter to RICCIARDELLI, who had

left the USSR for his home in Massachusetts, and that the Soviet was

interested in learning of RICCIARDELLI's "destiny" after he arrived.

It was obvious from the content of the report that RICCIARDELLI was

continuing in correspondence with IVAKHNENKO after he returned to

the U.S.

4. DCS suggested in this connection that the former

defector might be a valuable source of information on

IVAKHNENKO, having lived next door to him for a few years.

5. As of 1966, PIDHAYNY was still in communicatior

with IVAKHNENKO, and copies of the correspondence were to

be turned over to the FBI through PSD.
