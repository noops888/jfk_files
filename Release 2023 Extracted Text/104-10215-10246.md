(a) HKi=w=1607, 30 Karch 1956

(b) HKH-n-1505, 28 December 1955

DATE 17 April 1956

Regarding reference (a) the Station concurs fully with the proposed pronotion

of Arthur G. Vaivada and desires also at this tine to bring to the aucention

of Headquarters the merits of granting Vaivada steff status either

concurrently with the promotion or as soon thereafter as may prove feasible.

The agent himself has expressed a keen interest in acquiring such status,

for a number of obvious reasons.

As a contract agent, Vaivada has not been

entitled to the standard step increases that accrue to regular S employees.

Horeover he has not had the benefi of recent legislative increases in basic

salary rates,

such thai his salary, originally set 16 August 1954 at the then

W-9 level,

is still $5050.00 per anmum.

Perhaps of more importance than

the foregoing considerations is the fact that this agent has been and is

losing out in terms of the retirement, health insurance,

and other nore long-

tern advantages availicle to staff personnel. The agent has several tines

expressed to the case officer his concern, as a family nan, over the fact that

he is not receiving retirement credits with his years of service. Vaivada's

expressed career interests lie in continued employment by XU BARK,

nore

especially in the area

in the field, and in

vier of his qualities of character and nigh level of performance for Ki BARK

the Station has no hesitation in recoumending to Headquarters that he be

awarded the desired conge in status.

In view of the agent's present salary level it is recommended that the

prosotion iron his preseni grase be to the equivalent of a GS-10 at a per

anmin salary_of_5,915.00. If Headuarters concurs-in-the recomendation-

that the agent be granted staff officer status,

the agent would move up to

the GS-ll grade at-tbat time.

rived from productive labor based on tre standard vark

week for the perticular trade or industry, exclusive cl

overtime shall be considered in corputing

the rate of

all allowances payable under this paragrach."

It is further provided by 36 Uo So vode 1952, Fue-

ket Supplement 336 that:

"No eligible veteran shall be jeld an educetion and

Inasmuch as a combination of factors lead to the conclusion

that it rould be unwise to attenot to exert other influence in an atienot

to have BIRADIAL

as vell as the time element which may be involved, the matter ras discussed

vath other representatives of it who desired to take the agent over in

connection with PB Success.

4o

Arrangements were set up for Agent to meet the Chief of the Guatamalan

Station. Subseguently, on 8 Decenber 1953 Agent SIRADIAL was introduced

in a secure marner, to It. E. Fobbing, by the writer. Hobbing will in the

Intediate future be handling EIRANIAL in connection with certain operaticnal

matters and as of I December 1953 BIRADIAL will be chargeable to PB Success.

5.

In accordance with the privisions of the project, BIRADIAL was paid $350.00

for his November salary; $93.00

and $468.00 for his per dien to cover his period of time while in Covert

felt he could be of best service to the gency regerdless of the difficulties

In view of Agent's past successful record with this lgency, in view of his

attitude, his future possibilities and his conparatively limited salary:

Instructor's Connents:

VAIVADA appears to be a hard, conscientious worker. He is quick and

alert of mind and possesses maturity of judguent. Subject studied the

training material with enthusiasm and expressed the desire to improve

himself. VAIVADA displayed an excellent understanding of tradecraft

techniques as portrayed in his written work. He has the ability to apply

theory to practice.

His goal was to improve himself to the best of his

ability, as his past experience in the field had been on a trial and

error basis.

His experience in South Averica might account for his

unhurried thinking and action, but it will undoubtedly assist him in his

future operations as he simply refuses to become ruffled or panicky.

It

Is the belief of this instructor that VAIVADA 1s well qualified for his

proposed field assigment.

occasion of his visit to Hashington last lovember and made cemain oral

cormitments on behalf of the Division.

to cormitment, borever, was very

specific and all were cleared with the Division in advarce.. Xy partici-

pation in

the matter was, of course, oxing to the fact that I had

recruited funanoid originally and enjoy his confidence.

Hunanoid in the past has pursued his activities on behalf of

this organization as somewhat of a profitable avocation. His perfomance,

nonetreless, has teen outstanding fron the point of vier of iritiativi

production and understanding of operational principles.

He kould now

like to make it a career but lacks sufficient irfomation upon which to

base a decision and, being partially aware of the uncertrinties involved,

insists upon maintaining an alternate vocation.

In pursuit of this latter

objective, he plans to move to Fuenos hires in June or July of 1953 and

establish hirself there on a perranent basis.

His inquiries were to

ascertain what effect these plars would have upon his present and future

relationship with this organization.

stipulating only that he remain in his present location until after the

negotiated here at that time.
