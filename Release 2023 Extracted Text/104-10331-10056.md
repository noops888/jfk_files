Re:

CIvil Action No. 94-1909:

Keenan te Deptuof Justiare et ale

Dear Kirsten:

he cIA has, through yau

suggested that it might conduct

diitional searcias for records pertainin

to my client,

IZUrAnCE P. Keenan, 1f MI. Keenan furnished additional Intormation

which enabled it to conduct such searchar.

Although Mr. Keenan be.

lieves that the intoruation which ha initially furnished the cri

was sufficient to have located sone records pertaining to him, he

ls providing the following additional information in hopes that the

CIA vill now be able to locate responsive records.

Hit. Reenan states that on or about June 1951, la completed a

series of CIA application forms for employment.

At that time,

resided in the 1600 block of connectiout avenue, N.W.

My. Keenan

was encouraged to subnit these applications by two CIA women em-

ployaes who resided at the sane location.

After Reenan completed these applications, he was intervieved

at length as a prospective cIa aiployee.

At the conclusion of the

Interviews, Keenan and the CIA officer who conducted the intervlew

were unable to reach agreeneat on a starting salary, as the cials

offer was too low for Reenan.

Basad on the CIl's interest in

Keenan as a prospective employee, it is clear that at a minimum, it

should have a 201, file on Reenan.

For six years keenan was an IBI Supervisor.

For six and a

half years he was Foreign Assistance Inspector In Southeast Asia.

During thase periods he had freguent contact with CIA representz-

tives in investigativa matters of mutual interest.

Because of

this, there should be sumarous referencas to reenan lu CIA files..

As an FBI supervisor, Reenan played a role in the FBI's laves-

tigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. This

Is evidenced by the following documents:
