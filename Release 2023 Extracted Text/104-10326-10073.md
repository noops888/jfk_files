JTHE WARNING FLAGS RAISED BY SUBJ'S CONTRADICIORY FEELINGS

ABOUT NWBOLTON,

HAVE-TED-FUR-TO-CHANGE-ITS-PLANS-FOR HIS USE.

INSTEAD-OF USING HIS

SPECIFICALLY RESERVED FOR NWBOLTON WITH A SENSILIVE IELD ASSET

AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED, HQS WILL RESERVE IT FOR APPLICATIONS OF

MUCH LESS SENSITIVITY.

IT WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT YEAR,

AS OUR CONTRACT WITH SUBJ STIPULATES AND FOR WHICH HE HAS BEEN

PAID HIS TAXABLE FEE.

BUT AFTER THAT IT MAY BE DROPPED.

HIS MOVE

MONTHLY-ACCOUNT-INGS-AND-REPLENISH-THE-REVOLV-ING-FUND-FROM-WHICH HE-

PAYS HIS L

ACCOUNT'S MONTHLY BILLS in.
