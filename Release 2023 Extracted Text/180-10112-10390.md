MEMO OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN

WM. GEORGE GAUDET AND BERNARD FENSTERWALD

AT WAVELAND, MISSISSIPPI, MAY 13,1975

Gaudet is 67 years of age and in poor health. semi-retired.

Writes for local newspaper.

During WW II, Gaudet worked as secret agent in latin America

fOI Nelson RockefelleI, Coordinator of. Latin American affairs under

switched to CIA in 1947 and worked for them until 1969. DurIng

this time he published Latin American Newsletter and Latin American

Report, which he claims were. 100% commercial ventures and not CIA

fronts. However, he travelled constantly in Latin America and

combined his commercial.work with his CIA assignments; the latter,

according to him, were basically uncompensated (some expenses were

picked up by cIA) and done for patriotic purposes. There were 3 others

in the New Orleans area who did likewise.'

Gaudet is a right-winger; generally disliked JFk.

Kept his CIA activities very secret, not even telling his wife.

•Only told FBI in 1963.: No one else.

Latin American Newsletter cost $15.00 per week. Both the CIA

and the KGB had in excess of 20 subscriptions, which means that each

of them "subsidized". Gaudet to the tune of more than $15, 000 annually.

a star

AS tO JFX slaying, believes Warren Report is a fairy story

which shall become completely unglued very soon. Believes anti-Castio

forces involved. Personally believes they had a right to hate JFk.

Thinks plot was hatched soon after Bay of Pigs and came to fruition

in 1963.

As to having the Mexican Iravel Permit serially next to Oswald's,

Gaudet explains that it was complete coincidence ant that he never met

Oswald. He backs and fills on whether he flew to Merida.or Mexico City.

What is of more interest is the fact thathe was interviewed thiee times

by FBI about it. Before telling them anything, he checks with "Bill";

the CIA station chief in New Orleans, who, in turn, checks with Langley.

It is decided, that Gaudet should answer questions re Mexican trip but

nothing more, and FÉI promises to keep Gaudet's name to, itself and

save his cover.

Apparently," they did so until 1972 when his name was

(inadvertently?) declassified.

Gaudet says the fBI report about his having reported. on Ruby's

buying paintings fIom Borenstein is a complete fabrication. : He didn't

know either Borenstein or. Ruby and he wouldn't volunteer the time of day

to the FBI.

In last week, FBI has called and is going to re-interview

Gaudet.:. For whom?

Gaudet says

he never met oswald, and that he only observed him

upon occasion. Question mark on this?

In any event, he describes.him

"miserable little

creature who would do anyting for noney."

Believes ho was being financed by someone, Most

seriously doubts:if

he could have pulled off the rifle fire in Dealey Plaza, as LHO was

terribly nervous and disoiganized..

Doesn't really admit knowing what he was up to.

an office in a building immediately across

street from trade Mort?

Knew IHO went to mexico by bus.

Gaudet described the CIA set up in New Orleans

in detail.

Large offices with approximately fifty people. Similar

"to CIA

Unlisted phone.

New Orleans office headed by "Bill", lawyer, prominent

family, debutante daughter.. (Since learned

that "B111". is

William Burke and office is in Masonic Bldg.)

/ Ke

CIA New Orlears had closed circuit to Langley:

CIA only paid Gaudet's special travel expenses when their

tasks couldn't be

done on his regular trips.

Gaudet was once flown to Langley to brief. CIA on Latin

American affairs.

Laughs when he thinks of Rockefeller as head of Commission

to study either CIA or Dallas.

Ferrie knew IHO and Shaw, but Shaw wasn't CIA and had nothing??

to do with Dallas.
