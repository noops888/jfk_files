SUEJECT: Reassignment - Arthur l. Valvada

: Headquarters Desk

THROUCH: Chief of Station, Havana, Cuba

While at Headquarters in the early part of ray 1957, it was verbally

agreed that I return to Cuba for about one year, security permitting.

2. While my operational work in Cuba fron August 1954 until February

1957 was concentrated on communist targets in the Chiversity of Habana, 1t

should te pointed out that my dities during that period also involved many

contacts with subversive oppositionist elements.

then goverrrental persecution

increased during February 1957, two of my key agents were lost, one of them

by goverrmental assassination, so that I was obliged to leave Cuba temporarily

perding clarification of the security factors involved.

During my three

months'atsence in PEPRIME the local situation deteriorated; and after my

retura ny position was less favorable than it had been as a newcomer since I

had lost assets tut had retained the cumlative security hazards of three jears

of cultivation and recruituent efforts.

The University was, and still is,

closed. Our commist penetration efforts are continuously barrassed by

official persecution of the target group.

3.

Since by June 1958 I shall have spent four jears in Cuba, I believe

It appropriate to subbit this letter at this time requesting that Headquarters

begin to study the possibilities for reassignment about June 1958, or prior

to that date if recessary. As to future assignments, I have no reservations

or special recuests.

I am willing and repared to travel to any area

consistent with my qualifications.

Generally speaking, and for obvious

security reasons, I an interested in getting out of the Central Anerica-

Caritkean area if possible.

It may be recalled that I was denied an Argentine

visa in 1953, for purely tecbnical reasons. This situation may be changed,

and I sould not be opposed to a tour in argentina, Chile, or any of the South

American repablies.

In this matter, the nature of the new project or

assigntent would take precedence with me over personal preferences as to

particular area of assignment.
