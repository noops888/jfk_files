And to-refresh your menory, Lee Harry Oswald visited

Mexico City in September and early October of 1963, and CIA

surveillance there picked up the fact of his visit to the

Soviet Embassy.

And I want to show you Director Mesage Number 74830

of 10 October 1963. Principally I am Interested in the fact

that on the third page of that you are the authenticating

Officer. And I will give you a chance to perruse the message.

Mr. Karamessines. Actually I am the releasing officer.

Mr. Johnston. You are the releasing officer?

Mr. Karamessine. That is right. I don't know who some

of the other people here are, because their names are not

listed. The only name that has been left on here is my name

as releasing officer, right?

Mr. Johnston.

Right. Then the originating unit is

what on that message?

Mr. Karamessine. WH-3, Mexico.

MI. Johnston. What you your capacity be as reviewing

officer of that message?

Mr. Karamessines. To make sure that it wasn't violating

any particular policies of ours, particularly since it was

dealing with a man who at least had been American, and might

still be an American. And we were taking an

interest in this

fellow even though he wasn't an American. And normally we

wouldn't do that, unless there was good

reason - as there

obviously was in this case, because he had been a Marine, and

had defected, officially defected to the Soviet Union, accord-

ing to this message in 1959.

Mr. Johnston. We are operating with a zerax copy of the

message. But is that a copy of your signature on the third

page?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And with that is it fair to establish

that you at least read the message and knew of the activity

on the date you read the message?

Mr. Karamessines. I read the message. And it concerns

a Marine defector to the Soviet Union who apparently, accord

ing to the incoming message to which this was a response,

was trying to get in touch with

some

Soviets or Cubans in

Mexico. That would be the extent of my interest in it at the

time. And I would have ascertained that this certainly was

a legitimate interest of the CIA in an American, as an

exception to the general rule.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know of any operational interest

that the CIA had in Oswald?

Mr. Karamessines.

No, never at any time to my knowledge.

Mr. Johnston. Were

you aware that in the fall of 1963

the CIA took an interest in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee?

Mr. Karamessines.

I didn't know that.

MI. Johnston. Were you later aware of it?

Mr. KaranessinesT have seen allegations of that.

don't know whether that is true or not.

MI. Johnston. But you had no involvement in any

contemplated action or operation?

Mr. Karamessines.

No, absolutely not.

MI. Johnston. Were you knowledgeable of the CIA progarm

operations directed against Cuba?

MI. Karamessines. Generally, in very general termg, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And those were run by whom at the time

In the fall of 1963?

Mr. Karamessines. They had had the Bay of Pigs the

previous year, right?

MI. Johnston. No, 1961, April and May of 1961.

MI. Karamessines. That is right, 1961. I don't know

whether the Cuban activity has been -- my recollection doesn't

permit me to say with assurance that the Cuban activity had

been transferred back, had been transferred to the wi Division,;

or if it continued to function as a special staff of some

kind, I don't recall. But it was one or the other.

Mr. Johnston. Was Mr. Fitzgerald the Head of the Cuban

Division?

Ms. Karamessines. He was at one time, yes, before he

became DP at one time, he was in charge, yes.

Mr. Johnston. And did he have a unit called the Special

Affairs Staff charged with Cuban operations?

ME. Karamessines. General Cuban matters?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. Counterintelligence semponsibility,

In a case like that, would have been an Integral part of the

special Staff, with the assistance and the contribution and

the general staff supervision of our Counterintelligence Staff,

the senior Counterintelligence Staff.

Mr. Johnston. And that would have been --

Mr. Karamessines. Mr. Angleton's Office.

Mr. Johnston. Mr. Angleton's Office. Was the Special

Affairs Counterintelligence separate from the general

Counterintelligence Staff?

Mr. Karamessines. I would have been. How much of it

they had, I don't know.

Mr. Johnston. Who coordinated the Special Affairs Staff

counterintelligence withe Counterintelligence Division?

Mr. Karamessines. They just coordinated directly, I

would imagine. I don't think we had an additional officer

appointed to the former coordination function. They would have

been required - normally that would be the sop - to

coordinate their actiong with the senior Counterintelligence

Staff.

Mr. Johnston.". Was it SOP for SAS to inform the

Counterintelligence Stafs of all -

Mr. Karamessines. I don't know that. I was not very

close to the whole Cuban activity. It was an activity that had

been given birth while I was abroad. And it had its disaster

in late 1961. And I was brought back in 1962 as a DDP in

March. And my guess would be that it was a conscious decision

not to involve me too closely in the remnants of the other,

activity.

Mr. Johnston. Moving to the assassination of President

Kenney and the day of the assassination, how was the matter

and the problem and the investigation if any, of the assassina-

tion handled immediately upon receiving word? Was there any

task force created to handle the matter?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall the creation of any

task force. But I do remember that because the counterintelli-

gence Staff was responsible in any case for conducting our

liaison with the other American intelligence security agencies,

especially the FBI, the Secret Service, that the Counterin

telligence Staff was designated, to my best recollection now,

as the focal point for the receipt of requests for information

from

these other agencies, and

for responding

to those

requests for information. And as a result of that, as far as

I can now recall, all communications going out to Secret

Service or FBI in response to requests for information were

directly by that Staff, or if the content warranted, they were

brought up the line for review and signature by Mr. Helms or

myself in his absence.

MI. Johnston. And again, just so that we are clear, when

you refer to Counterintelligence Staff you are referring to

MI. Angleton's operation?

Ms. Karamessines. Yes, I am.

MI. Johnston. What about the Cuban Counterintelligence

Staff, how were they staffed in the Investigation?

Mr. Karamessines. You mean SAS?

MI. Johnston.

Yes.

Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. I don't know if they were still in

answer to yque

question, but my assumption would be that

anything they had to contribute would have been funneled into

the Counterintelligence Staff.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever specifically - do you

recall asking them to make a contribution yourself?

Mr. Karamessines.

I?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

instructions.

Mr. Johnston. Did you ever participate in meetings or

see correspondence in which Mr. Helms directed Mr. Angleton

to perform those functions for the Counterintelligence Staff?

MI. Karamessines. No. But MI. Angleton certainly was

performing them, and he wouldn't have stepped in to take over

the activity if MI. Helms hadn't made it plain that that was

the way he wanted it handled.

Mr. Johnston.

Who was Mr. J. C. King in this era?

Mr. Karamessines.

He was at this time, I belleve, the

Chief of the Western Hen sphere Division.

Mr. Johnston. For the Deputy Directorate for Plans?

Mr. Karamessines. Right.

Mr. Johnston. And to the best of your recollection, who

was Jack Whitney?

Mr. Karamessines. Well, I know Jack Whitten as an Officer

of the DDP. But what capacity he was serving in at that

particular point, I don't remember.

Mr. Johnston. Was he at that time involved with SAS?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't know.

Mr. Johnston. Was MI. King?

Mr. Johnston. And operational control of SAS was -

Mr. Karamessines. It would have been in the nads of the

Director of SAS, MI. Fltzgerald, who would have been

responsible to Mr. Helms.

Mr. Johnston. Directly to Mr. Helms?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. Did Mr. Fitzgerald respond through you to

Mr. Helms?

Mr. Karamessines. Not to these matters.

Mr. Johnston. We have touched before

MI. Wallach. Is there a reason why he didn't respond

on those matters?

Mr. Karamessines. I had explained before you came in,

I think, that I came back here in March of 1962, after the

collapse of the Cuban thing, and the changes that had taken

place, and the place was in a bit of a turmoil. And my

instructions were to look after the day to day business.

MI. Johnston. Off the record a minute.

• Mr. Karamessines.

My charge from Mr. Helma was that in

view of the turmoil that had been taking place in the Agency,

and specifically In the DDP, that we needed more than ever to

get back to normil operating, in othur words, to bring people

down off the chandliers.. We had a change of guard, Mr. Bissell

had been removed, and Mi. Dulles had been removed, and Me.

Helms had been brought in as Deputy Director for Plans. And

the idea there was that we were going to get back to basic,

classic Intelligence and counterintelligence operations, and

we were going to be done with some of these high flown ventures

• that just get us into trouble, some of these

ridiculous things

that had beer happening prior to that time.

When I came: back. my charge from Helms was, look, you

see the general running of the DDP, the day to day, normal

functioning. We have got Fitzgerald . I think it was

Fitzgerald - and he will be worrying about Cuban things.

He was a senior officer, don't forget. When Mr. Helms

went up to the Deputy Director of the Agency, Mr. Fitzgerald

was selected to be the DDP, not I, even though I had been the

Deputy to Me. Helms.

Senator Schweiker. (Now presiding)

When was that that that happened?

Mr. Karamessines. 1965•

So that my job was to get matters back to the kind of

procedures, controls and phase by phase, and step by step

administration that I vas familiar with, and which had fir

functioned, I thought, very well all through the fiftles, when

I was serving for the most part back in Headquarters most

the time at all.

In 1959 when MI. Bissell took over he changed a lot of

things. And controls became very loosey goosey. And I think

the Agency and the Clandestine Service suffered quite a bit

from that short but for me devastating interval in the history

of it.

But what Helms tried to do was get this thing back on

track. And I was supposed to help him do this. That is why

he brought me back, when my tour of duty was nearly up.

Senator Schwelker. You were excluded from the chain of

command?

MI. Karamessines. It was simply made clear that this

was a, Special Staff whose only job would be this, and I

didn't have to be all that concerned about it. That didn't

mean that I couldn't know what was happening there if I wanted

to know. But I had my hands absolutely full with things that

I had to deal with myself. And here was a very senior fello:

with a staff of his own dealing with just this special thing,

which was-an outgrowth and a result, or whatever you want to

call it, of the Cuban operations, which I knew nothing

about.

Senator Schweiker. And how did the White House

coordination or liaison go with that Special Affairs Section?

their ball of wax.

Senator Schweiker. Like Alpha 66, would that have beet

under them?

Mr. Karamessines. Anything relating to operations

directly or indirectly suppored by the CIA against the Castro

Government, landing agents, small boat infiltrations,

screening fellows down in Miami, working with the Immigrati

and Nationalization, FBI, very closely. All of this

was

Mr. Wallach. Who In the Counterintelligence Staff?

Mr. Karamessines.

I don't know, I can't put my finger

on it. But sAs had a good part of that, because SAS, don't

forget, had to protect itself against the activity of the GI,

the Cuban Inteliigence Service. And we knew that the DGI

was very active, particularly In Canada, in sending fellows

down into the States as agents through Canada. And ever so

often SAS, through its activities in Miami would pick up

reflections: of DGI activities and report these of course intr

Counterintelligence and the FBI.

MI. Johnston, Let's go back to the investigation of che

assassination. Do you recall the incident with Sylvia Dura,

who was the Mexican employed by the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico

city?

MI. Karamessines. From the Cuban Cougulate?

Me. Johnston. The Cuban Consolate, that is correct.

Do you recall that you received information that Sylvi

Dura was going to be arrested by Mexican authorities?

Me. Karamessines.. Yes, I have a recollection of that.

I don't recall the circumstances, but that rings a bell, i!

that is what you mean. And she was going to be arrested and

questioned, is that right?

Mr. Johnston. That is correct.

That is less clear, as to your account.

Mr. Johnston. My question is, first of all, were you

ever told or do you know whether Sylvia Dura was a contact for

the Agency?

MI. Karamessines.

No, and I don't believe she was ever

- I have no knowledge and

do not believe she was ever a con-

tact for the Agency, for the CIA.

Senator Schweiker. Let's ask the same question of

Alvarado.

Mr. Karamessines.

He was that nut that you mentioned

earlier that came in, and gave them a tall story which turned

out to be false.

Senator Schweiker.

Was he ever an informer or source of

information?

Mr. Karamessines.

The answer is no as far as anything

I ovor hoard from anybody.

Mr. Johnston. Do you recall ordering Mr. Whitten to call

off the arrest of Sylvia Dura, proposed arrest of Sylvia

Dura?

MI. Karamessines. Do I recall ordering Mr. Whitney to

Mr. Johnston. Let me show you, then, a cable which

apparently was sent out after - by way of background, prior

to this cable going out, Mexico City had cabled

and said,

Mexican police have already arrested Dura, 80 we can't call

off her arrest.

on out of

Mexico City against Castro, would they have

fallen under the

Mr. Karamessines. It could have happened either way.

In other words, they could have been handled by the Special

Affairs Section in close coordination with

the Wi Division,

because it happened to be not in the

Mr. Johnston. Let me just put to you, though, my review

has

not necessarily been comprehensive, but this appears to be

the only flash message sent out in the course of these events

Mr. Karamessines. I would be surprised if you didn't

find others, number one. And number two, even though it is

a flash message, and I read it, I couldn't possibly recall with

whom I might have discussed

it at the time, who brought it to

handed to me by my secretary, I don't recall the circumstances.

But it is

a very natural and very proper

and quite under-

standable operational message, given the great interest that

we had in what this woman might be able to tip us off to if

we could continue listening secretly to here conversations

with others. She might call Aunt Tillie living in. Guadalajara

We are also hopeful that we could get to talk to her or

question her ourselves, or arrange for the

FBI or Secret: Service to do it.

Mr. Johnston. And they also put to you that this

message indicates the existence of a question at CIA of Cuban

responsibility?

Mr. Karamessines.

There was a question at that point

after the President was killed

of anybody's responsibilities,

starting with the Russians, because Oswald had been a defector

to the Russians, and then going right away to

because_ they

were palsy walsy

the cuban,

and even in touch with the Cuban

Consulate in Mexico.

These were natural suspicions at the time and we would

Mr. Karamessines. No, Ilassune that, I don't know it,

Mr. Karamessines..: Yes.

Mr. Johnston. And you do know the Western Hemisphere

Division was involved?

Mr. Karamessines. Right.

MI. Johnston. But you only assume htat SAS was involved?

Mr. Karamessines.

That is right. SAS's business was

an offensive role, responsibility, to send agents - their

counterintelligence intelligence was a very limited thing

designed to protect their own activities

against penetration,

whereas this had much wider scope. This was talking: about

some fellow who had been a Marine, and had deserted and gone

to the Soviet Union, all of these things. And then when he

shows up in Mexico he is not within SAS's perameter, he is

within WH's perameter.

MI. Johnston. Did you ever ask Mr. Helms whether SAS

had gotten involved in the investigation?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall asking such a question.

whom apparently were either identified or suspected Russian

intelligence officers.

Mr. Karamessines. I didn't suggest, sir, that we might

be damaging our tap. What I was suggesting was that by

arresting her they were taking her out of her office, her.

living quarters, and putting her under arrest. And this would

reduce and eliminate indeed our chances of hearing her

that with is the way the first sentence, is worded! "The

arrest of sylvia Dura is an extremely serious matter which

could prejudice all freedom of action on. the entire question

of Cuban responsibility." It doesn't say specifically the

thing that. I would sharte with you as the logical thing to be

concerned about, it seems more concerned about whether we have

to come to. some conclusion. we may not want to come to relating

to Cuban responsibility. And I am puzzled by that for two

reasons.

Number. one, it doesn't express the things.that.you

would logically say, which is what you mid, and number two,

why are we more worried about our freedom of action as opposed

to finding out what happened?

MI. Karamessines. I can answer that very quickly, I

believe. I see what you are driving at now. I can easily see

a situation in which we wouldn't want the Mixican Government

or any other

government to know

what Sylvia Dura may have to

say about Oswald or the President's assassination, assuming

she had anything to

do, we wouldn't want anybody else to know

until we had had a chance to

focus on it ourselves and decide

what our Government, what position our Government was going

to take about it.

Let me put the case this way, if I may. Let us assume

that Sylvia Dura is hauled in by the Mexicans, and she says,

fellows, it is very

simple. I know, because she was hired --

because this Mexican, ex-Marine, was actually hired by the

If any action it felt it would wish to take in the situation.

As it turned out; we never had that kind of Information.

So

it was a moot question.

Mr. Johnston. Let me ask you two specific areas.": And

my question will be whether. they came to your attention. Were

you aware that the CIA received information that on the

afternoon of the assassination an unidentified passenger landed

at the airport in Mexico City on a two engine aircraft, boarded

a Cuban aircraft bound for Havana, bypassed customs and rode in

the cockpit of the Cuban aircraft that afternoon?

Mr. Karamessines. Was I aware of that?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.

Mr. Karamessines. No, at least I have no recollection

of it. Somebody might have mentioned it at the time in

passing. What was the significance of it?

Mr. Johnston. I just wondered whether you would

attribute any significance to it.

Mr. Karamessines. No, none at all. The DGI had quite

a lot of freedom of movement, freedom of action in Mexico in

those days.

assassination?

Mr. Karamessines. First of all, I never heard of this

report. Let's start to that. And secondly, I aidn't under-

stand you to say that it was a DGI officer that got on the

airplane, you said somebody got on the airplane and sat next

to the Cuban pilot and took off, without going through

customs.

Mr. Johnston. I am sorry, I did not tell you that they

held up the Cuban aircraft.

Mr. Karamessines. You see the difference now? You know

the story. He gives me a couple of tidbits and then you get

excited because I am not excited, see?

Senator. Schweiker. The Cuban aircraft was held up for

1700 hours to 2200 hours awaiting this passenger. That was

the information the CIA received. And the passenger arrived

on a twir. engine aircraft, bypassed customes, and went into

• the

Cuban airlines craft and rode in the cockpit. So he was

basically unidentified arriving under those circumstances.

Mr Johnston:

As of November, 1963 what knowledge did

you have about CIA plots to assassinate foreign leaders?

Mr. Karamessines.

None.

Mr. Johnston. And as Mr. Helms' Assistant you had not

bee Informed?

Mr. Karamessines.

: No:

MI. Johnston. Have you read the Senate Select Committee

report on Assassinations?

Mr. Karamessines. No, I have not.

Mr. Johnston. According to the information the Senate

received, in August of 1963 MI. Helms told MI. McCone about

certain CIN' plots against Castro. Were you at that meeting?

Mr. Karamessines. No, I was not.

MI. Johnston. Do you know of that briefing or that

report to Mr. McCone?

Mr. Karaméssines. No sir, I did not.

MI. Johnston. When did you first learn that the CIn

had plots to assassinate Fidel Castro?

Mr. Karamessines. You will find this surprising, but

It is true. At about the time that a fellow named Bill liarvey

retired and went out to work as a lawyer in the Midwest, or

shortly thereafter, he gave an interview which was published

in one of the columng. And he then mentioned the names of

Roselli and some other guy.

Senator Schweiker. Giancana?

Now, when I read that I asked a couple of questions about

It, what are you talking about.

And a couple of fellows

around there who were knowledgeable and had lived through this

period - and I was then not in the States, I was overseas -

told me that they had tried to do something - at the White

House request, incidentally - they had tried to do something,

but it hadn't worked, and that was it.

Senator Schweiker.

Had you heard any talk about what

role Bobby Kennedy did or didn't have in that situation?

MI. Karamessines.. Yes. What I was told - and this

was absolutely hearsay - was that Bobby Kennedy wag the one

that was pushing for this, and that he was reflecting his

brother's desires.

Senator Schweiker. Did he use a desk over at CIA

Headquarters during this period?

Mr. Karamessines. Not to my knowledge - I think I wouid

have known if he had, but not to my knowledge. Remember, I

was not in the building, I was overseas from 1959 to March

1962. So what was happening in that period I just don't know.

He might have had a desk.

But I never heard that. And I

didn't know of it.

Mr. Johnston. Were, you, aware that Harvey and Roselli

: Mr. Karamessines: No, I was not:

Mr. Johnston. Do you know the crypt AMLASH?

MI. Karamessines. Yes, I have seen it. I don't know

whether I have seen it. in Congressional reports or in the

newspapers or in the office.

MI. Johnston. In the fall of 1963 when you were serving

as Mr. Helms' Assistant did you ever see any documents with the

crypt AMLASH on them, any reports involving AMLASH?

Mr. Karamessines. I am sorry, but I simply cannot

answer that question. I don't know. I may have, or I may not

have. But there were

thousands of crypts, and I couldn't

possibly remember. And what AMLASH! means right now I haven't

the vaguest notion.

Senator Schweiker. The answer you gave a moment ago was

as to the time frame when you learned about the

assassination

attempts relating to a column by Bill Harvey, the Army:

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

Mr. Johnston. What year was that?

Mr. Karamessines. That must have been around -- my best

recollection would have been about 1964, somewhere in there,

late 1963, 1964, or maybe even 1965.

Not at all.

We had Cuban policy reviews from time

permission, that would not have surprised

Did you discuss with Mr. Helns or anyone

else the decision to make the CI Staff the point of, contact

Mr. Karamessines:

*I don't recall such a discussion. It

may have taken place, butal have no recollection of It. But

making the CI Staff a point of contact for the warren

Commission would have been a perfectly natural thing to do.

Mr. Johnston.. And you have talked about it previously.

But why was it?

MI. Karamessines. The reason that it would have been

the natural thing to do was because this matter, the

assassination of the President, concerned primarily the FBI,

the Secret Service and other agencies having a plain undisputed

unambiguous domestic security responsibility, and the Secret

Service of course, having the explicit responsibility for the

protection of the President. And we were organized in the

DDP so as to concentrate or focus our liaison activities with

the agencies I have just mentioned in the CI Staff. So that

seems a very natural place in which to vest this reponsibility.

Mr. Johnston. But that left a hole from the CIA stand-

point because of the SAS counterintelligence being separate

from the CI Staff?

Mr. Karamessines. Not necessarily. Because the CI

Staff, as a sendor staff, had responsibilities which transcended

logical connecting ppint, because of the dealings with both

the pro and anti Castrol groups, in view of Oswald's

connection first with the Fair Play for Cuba Committee 2 and

second; with allegedly/some of the anti Castrol Cubang?:

Mr. Karamessines: Not really, because SAS's expertise

on any of this would have stopped dead after the first name

or two: It was the CI Staff

that had the counterintelligence

files which would support the extensive investigation which

was conducted. SAS could never have done it because it didn't

have the files with which to do it. It wasn't its responsi-

bility.

Senator Schweiker. But Jim Angleton comes in and tells

us just about the same story that you are telling us, which

was the compartmentation they had, and the Cuban activities

per se really weren't under his province, they were over at

SAS?

Mr. Karamessines. Cuban activities, that is correct.

In other words, the Cuban activities means the conduct of

operations again Cuba largely, that is what it means. And

these operations were being conducted out of SAS largely, to

a smaller extent the Wl Division, but largely SAS. Angleton

was right.

Commission.

Mr. Karamessines. The SAS, if that is what you are

focusing on, sAS's charter, if that is what you mean, I don't

know when they were put into business as SAS: For a long time

It was known as the Cuban Task Force W, that i8 it. And later

they were called SAS. I don't. know when they were created,

or when they became one or the other. But I do know this,

that their responsibility was the conduct of what you might

call offensive operations against Cuba, intelligence and action

operations against Cuba. And that was their charter.

The President was assassinated by a fellow who has some

contact with the Fair Play Committee in Miami, and he is in

touch with the Cuban Consulate in Mexico, and he is a former

Marine. I don't see how that would tie in with SAS at

all,

in the absence of some indication that there was a tieup. But

I don't see the connection at all. And therefore I don't see

why one would get concerned about SAS not having been paraded

up to appear before the Warren Commission.

And I will tell you this. My clear recollection is that

there wasn't anything that we could provide the Warren

commission as far as we were concerned that we didn't provide,

anything we were asked for, everything we could put in.

Senator Schweiker. Well, hypothetically it was certainly

one of the most logical motivation factors to have purgued as

an investigative unit.

Mr. Karamessines.

I suppose.. But

In any case, any

information the Warren Commission asked for, or any of the other

agencies asked for they got, and I think the record will show

that they got in spades. I took the Warren Commission down to

the Registry of our building and explained to the Chief Justice

and to several members of the Commission how it was that we

were able to report as promptly as we reported on Oswald being

in touch with the Cuban Consulate in Mexico whenever it was,

September or October.

And he couldn't understand how we could

have gotten that report out so quickly. And I showed him how

it is done automatically with the machines, and so forth.

Senator Schweiker. One of the Senators asked Director

IleIms when he was before the committee why he didn't provide

the Warren Commission with information about the assassination

attempts against Castro. And he said he wasn't asked. I don'ti

quite reconcile that with what you are just telling me, although

I know you can only speak for yourself, obviously. But it

just strikes me as peculiar that a key question like that was

a matter of being asked. So that is why I think there is a

And. Angleton said he had virtually no source,

and the FBI had very little." So the only people with a

not locked off somewhere in another building with no allowed

were checked against their files continually. And this guy's

name, the information on Fair Play for Cuba and all that

business that we had, I will bet you money came from SAS's

files very likely. You see what I mean? This was accessible.

The only question you are raising is, why didn't somebody go to

the Warren Commission -- and that somebody should

have been

kill Castrol a couple of years ago or last year, or whatever

it was. Isn't that what you are asking? I can't answer that

Mr of Ka

#rots of files have notatlons like that.

Mr. Johnston Dated December 1963?

Mr. Karamessines. That doesn't mean anything to me.

I wasn't aware of that. "It doesnitamean anything to me

because there are lots of files that have a stamp on them which

says, please don't take out of this office, you pay consult

them. That 1s not significant to me at ail..

Senator Schweiker. That is a routine procedure, you say?

Mr. Karamessines. It is not a routine decision.: But

tome it doesn't have any special significance.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware of the 1967 IG report on

assassinations at the time it was being prepared?

Mr. Karamessines. No, I was not.

Mr. Johnston. Were you talked to by the Inspector

General?

Mr. Karamessines. No, I was not, to my recollection.

MI. Johnston. Were you informed about MI. Helms meeting

with the President on the report?

MI. Karamessines. No. I was not.

Mr. Johnston. Do you know that there was such a meeting?

MI. Karamessines. No, I did not. You are talking about

a meeting between Mr. Helms and the President in 1967 dealing

with assassinations?

Mr. Johnston. Yes.,

Mr. Karamessines.

The answer is no.

Mr. Karamessines. No, I have not:

Senator Schweiker. They really compartmentalized that

operation.

Mr. Johnston. Let me just once again recap: Were you

knowledgeable of the course of the CIA investigation of the

Kennedy assassination? You have indicated throughout your

testimony today that 'you were kept abreast of those.

Mr. Karamessines.

I was kept abreast of the activities

that were taking place to support the investigation being

conducted by the FBI and the Secret Servic, of the Kennedy

Assassination.

We were not conducting a separate, special

investigation of the Kennedy assassination.

But we were trying

to get as much information as possible from our overseas posts

that might throw any light whatever on who Oswald was and why

he killed the President, and who put him up to it if somebody

put it up to it. And I was fully familiar with the fact that

we were knocking ourselves out trying to get to the bottom of

those questions.

Senator Schweiker. In your recollection again, who

the senior staff and could have at any time have gone to SAS

and said, we want this and that

and that, check your files and

give us this or that. They were the senior staff.

Mr. Johnston. Were you aware in 1963 --

Mr. Karamessines, Let me say one other thing. Mr.

Angleton very properly would say, SAS had its own thing, and

I didn't have much dealing with SAS. He didn't.

He is sitting

up here somewhere. But Mr. Angleton doesn't always know what

the eight or one guys under him or doing, SAS and all these

others. But then thing float up to him. And he gets a report

let's say, on Oswald, or somebody. It doesn't say, we have

got this from SAS's files. He just sees a report, it came from

the files.

So I can't fault Angleton for feeling as he does.

Senator Schweiker. I am not faulting him.

And you do know what the western Hemisphere Division did. But

you have testified that you don't know what sas did.

Mr. Karamessines.. I did not say that I didr.'t know what

they did. What I did say was that I was certain that SAS

would have contributed from their files, or from agent contact

in Miami, to the effort that was being made. And this would be

true of any other of the operating divisions. We might have

had a reflection of some activity in Timbuktu, or in some

South American or African division.

Mr. Johnston. You have previously testifed that you

AMLASH.

Mr. Karamessines. I did not.

Mr. Johnston. And you said you did not know that on :

Senator Schweiker. Going back to the structure of

understanding your functional definition of flow of lines of

authority, JMWAVE, would that have been under you, or sAs,

or how would JMWAVE have tied. into this functional breakdown?

MI. Karamessines. JMWAVE was the Miami extension.of

activity against Cuba headguartered in our Headguarters, which

took place - in the Cuban

invasion, you know, they had a

station down there, I don't know whether they called It INVAVE

at that time or gave it some other name. But there was a

group down in Miami, in that area, two of three groups,

probably, when they

mounted the Cuban invasion In the Bay of

Pigs in 1961: And there continued to be an installation, one

a local agency of some kind, and he had instructions, and his

instructions were, you go in and the receptionist will

recognize you, you just walk right by her or him and walk down

the hall and go in Room 407. We don't happen to have a

listening device in 407, and he comes and goes and all we do

Is get a picture of him. We don't know who he is. Sometimes

we can find out who he is by working with the locals. They

will help us. Other times if he makes repeated visits, then

you have got a chance to surveil him as he leaves and see where!

would you mind a few more minutes?y

Mr. Karamessines Nomit is allsright.

Mr. Madigan:

It is kind of an adjunct to this AMLASH

thing.

Mr. Karamessines:

Okay.

Mr. Madigan. I want to ask you a few questions, Mr.

Karamessines, about a couple of areas that are involved

tangentially with the AMIASH situation, in that they take

place in the same time perlod, the first of which is with

regard to Howard Hunt. And as you may know, the Agency had

been trying to determine for sometime what Hunt's assignment

was In Spain in 1965, And that is the first area that I want

to ask you about. And my first question would be, do you

yourself know what Hunt was doing when he was assigned to

Spain?

Mr. Karamessines. Yes.

MI. Madigan. As background I might recall for you that

he was as you know a staff employee up until June of 1965,

when he was assigned on a contract basis over to Spain, until

November of 1966, a 14 month period. And you were Assistant

DDP, I think at the time.

Mr. Karamessines.

Mr Fitzgerald had wanted us. to have

36678

an operational capablilty in Spain, divorced from, totally

divorced from, the official statión in the Embassy. He

anticipated quite properly that one of these days Spain would

kind of begin coming apart at the seams with the death of

Franco, and that it would be necessary. to have someone who knew

794 230008

the language and who could get along with people, and who could

reasonably pass himself off as a retired former Service officer,

79100-2

and one who could write,.

for example, as Hunt could write and

did write.. And

Hunt fitted the biil. And It colncided with

a period in time when Hunt's services weren't being, let's say,

eagerly sought in other parts of the Directorate. And this

seemed good solution. And he was sent to Spain for just that

purpose.

Mr. Madigan.

And what was the purpose, to do what?

MI. Karamessines. The purpose was to establish himself,

to fit into the community, and hold himself available for

operational tasks as they might be given him to do at some

point in time.

Mr. Madigan. Who did he report to?

Mr. Karamessines. He would report back to the offices

of DDP.

Mr. Madigan. Did he report to someone in particular?

MI. Karamessines. Yes, he reported to the DDP and to me.

Mr. Madigan. The DDP, then, would be Mr. Helms?

He wrote' a couple of them, which were

checked by us at Headquarters before they were sent to the

publishers.

Mr. Madigan. Was that part of the reason he was

sent

over there?

Mx. Karamessines. Yes, that was part of the reason he

was over there. As I indicated earlier, he had a job of

setting up out in the boondocks - he would act as a retired

Government Service fellow. who was supplementing his income by

conducting an active: business which we could prove to the

Spanish authorities if called upon to do so with a publishing

firm, that he was writing novels, books. And he did. indeed

do that. And he wrote several books. I don't know how many

he wrote while he was in Spain. He may have written one or

two.

Mr. Madigan. I think three.

Is that a normal practice with regard to: the Agency?

for that?

MI. Karamessines. No, I don't recall what the arrange-

ments were. But I think the understandingwas that if there

were any royalties of any significance we would talk about

how they should be split up.

Mr. Madigan.

The documents also indicate that he had

done some writing for Allen Dulles, and

that this was sort

of a promise that had been made that he would be allowed to

go abroad and write books.

Mr. Karamessines. I am not familiar with that.

the Franco people:

Xou are talking about officials of the intelligence

service of Spain, is that what you mean?.

Mr. Madigan. What about the opposition, the underground?

Mr. Karamessines. No, he was not instructed to go out

and seek contacts, he was instructed to hole himself ready

to serve as a servicing depot, a safe house, an intermediary,

If we wanted him to be an intermediary, or if a station

spotted certain situationg in which it could not act but had

to have somebody outside who could act, so that it wouldn't

rub off on the station, he would be available. for that kind

of task.

Mr. Madigan. The Chief of Station over there at the

time indicates that Hunt never did any operational assignements

for him.

Mr. Karamessines. That is correct.

- Mr. Madigan. So these theoretical items that you listed,

such as providing safe house, and so on, he never did any of

those?

so that he would bo avallable to do them if the situation arose.

And Mr. Fitzgerald felt very strongly that the Spanish

situation was going to develop faster actually than it developed

in the event.

Mr.. Madigan.:

There are quitela few Agency documents

that contain the opinion that, as you may know, the Agency

looked into this matter and found that there was no operational

purpose for him being over there, and that he was

simply over

there to write spy novels to increase the image of the Agency.

Well, that would come from individuals

who hadn't directly heard from Fitzgerald. I did. At the

time of Fitzgerald's encumbacy he had studies made, and they

were available at the Agency, and this was very far sighted

of him. Several of us felt that we ought to do this and

studied matters on the suggestion of situations and what we

would be confronted with as a Government and as an intelligence

service in Spain, Portugal, Ethiopia, Liberia, about eight or

10 or 12, areas. And

Spain was practically at the top of the

list. lle felt pretty strongly about it, and he felt this

would be one move where we would begin positioning ourselves

for the eventuality.

Mr. Madigan. What was the reason, then, that he was moved

out of there after a year?

correctly I don tremember, now

Mr. Madigan. Let me ask you some questions on another

matter. And that is about a fellow by the name of Jack:

Valenti. And you may have covered some of: these in your

questioning. Did you have any knowledge while you were at the

Agency of any dealings that the Agency had with Jack Valenti?

MI. Karamessines.

None whatever. You mean Jack Valenti

in the White House?

Mr. Madigan.

In the Motion Pictures?

Mr. Karamessines. None whatever.

Mr. Madigan. Do you know of any involvement between

the Agency and Valenti concerning the assassination of

President Kennedy?

MI. Karamessines.

None whatever, no information, no

knowledge -

. Mr. Madigan. No meetings?

Mr. Kazamessines.

No. What are they? I am curious.

Mr. Madigan. These are just a bunch of random questions

I have. I am trying to complete our record here.

In 1971 and 1972 periods do you have any dealings with

Cuban exile activities in Costa Rica in the DDP?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall any. But we may have

had. You don't mean personally, do you, you mean the DDP?

Me. Madigan. Do you have any knowledge of any generally?

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall any myself.

Mro, Madigan®

Do you ever, recall, being advised of or

learning of an effort in Florida' to recruit peopleifor costa

Rican exercises under the guise of the Agency, some people down

there who were claiming to be representatives.of the CIA when

7.02;

In fact they weren't, having to do with the Cuban exile

i movement in Costa Rica?

Y022

M1222 2217

Mr. Karamessines. I don't recall.

Jumping back to the '65-'66 Spain period,

Mr. Madigan.

did you have any involvement yourself, or to your knowledge

13d2kt

did anyone in the DDP have any involvement with this fello

that I mentioned earlier, Manuel Artime?

Mr. Karamessines. I never knew the man, never met him,

so I didn't have any involvement with him. And I can't tell

you now who in the DDP actually worked with him or handled

him or saw him or dealt with him. You mentioned earlier that

Hunt did, and I am quite sure that he did. I wouldn't be

surprised if Fitzgerald didn't know

him pretty well, because

Fitzgerald had been

intimate with Cuban activities.

And there would be a number of other DDP officers dating back

from the time of the Bay of Pigs situation and before who

would have been ware of Artime or might have worked with him

or handled him. But I never

did.

MI. Madigan. Did you ever know -

Mr. Karamessines. I wasn't in the States during that

period, remember that, I was overseas.

Mr. Madigan Y

165rand 667

Mr. Raramessines. No, I am talking now about the: Bay

of pigs period, when Artime and all the rest of these guys

came out of the woodwork, and that is how they came on the

blitzkrieg. I wasn't one of the fellows available to be in

touch with Artime.

Mr. Madigan. But you were in the DDP in the '65-66 a0.:

period?

Mr. Karamessines.

Yes, I was in legdquarters then, yes.

MI. Madigan. Have you any knowledge whatsoever about

an effort to try to

promote the Agency's image by having some

of these novels Hunt wrote made into motion pictures and

television shows?

Mr. Karamessines. There was a lot of thought going to

trying to push some of these CIA novels of Hunt's. But

nothing ever came of it as far as I know. I belleve Mr.

Helms of somebody up the line decided against it.

Mr. Madigan. And you didn't have

any personal dealings

with him?

MI. Karamessines. No sir, I did not.

You mean did I deal with the motion picture people?

MI. Madigan. Or the IV people?

MI. Karamessines. No sir, I did not.

Mr. Madigan. What time frame do you place it in your

recollection hearing about this?

Meo Karam

nes

I guess It would have been 165-66,

'In there somewhere

Mr.. Madigan. How about '72; that late?

ME. Karamessines.

I don't recall anything in 172 on

that, no sir. If something happened, don't remember it.

I certainly never went around and tried to get anything like

96 22 2y

that put into moving pictures.

There would be speculation

once in awhile that the Director of something would say, the

Bureau

does it, the Defense Department does it, and maybe we

ought to crank up a program or something like that. And llunt

used to think that this would be a good idea. And whether

he was in touch with some people or not I just don't remember

now. He may well have been,

Mr. Madigan. How do you know that Hunt thought it was

a good idea? Did he talk to you about it?

Mr. Karamessines. Sure, absolutely.

Mr. Madigan. That is all.

Mr. Johnston. That is all. thank you.

(hereupon, the interview was concluded at 4:25 p.m.)
