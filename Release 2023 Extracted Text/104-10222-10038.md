Promotion to GS-16

Mr. Bagley is without question among the best

of the most eifective and highly motivated mits in the

The troup has developed i high level of sub-

stantive specialisation which it applies to CS coverage

I consider Mr. Bagley an outstanding officer to

still greater responsibilities

in the future.

He is fully .

qualified. for promotion to GS-16.

I urge that he be promoted

now in recognition of the work he has done so

B.

The physical divisions within the official

component of the Station have separatod personnel

against

the target difficult.

These divisions

could

and should have been corrected.

• Mr. Bagley has not always seen eye-to-eye with

Headquarters on matters of method and emphasie, a

phenomenon which has impaired operational progress.

We accept that esch Station. Chief, has the right -

Indeed; the duty to hold indepondent vlews and to

resolved more ensily had Station reporting to Head-

quarters been less parsimonious.

3.

To sum up,

Mr.

Barley's abilities to conceptualize and

to bulld viable models is truly

outstanding, as is the exhaustively

thorough mamer of his staft work; his capability: to translate

his concopts into productive human ondeavor has beon less.

impressive. In spite of his considorable social and diplomatic

skills,

Mr. Bagley Is essentially a resorved person

who finds

some difficulty in communicating with his subordinates.

In spite of the problems

noted, problems which we

perhaps overstress as a result of our high expectations,

Brussels station has made good progross during/ this period and

Mr. Bagley's performance has been STroNG.

I agree with the fitness report's own suggestion that

the "problons" it noted were overstreaged:

Its negative

contont outweighs

the positive by nearly three to one and is

omphasized by 1ts. format and sentence structure.

Because.

Strong.

Mi. Bagley assumed his duties as Chief of Station on

13 September 1967.

It 1s too early to assess the results of

his stewärdsbip; he established in advance a timetable for

building up

not yet clear to what extent these assets are going to be

productive against major

that Bagley has tackled his job with originality, energy, and

A good indication of these qualitios is that,

alone among our European Chiefs of Station, Bagley has himself

two years.

Bagley's accomplishments must be mensured in light

that he has had a weak Deputy Chief of Station,

and that several of the officers in his small Station have

been of quite modest calibre.

The restaffing of the Station

which is taking placo this summer should result in a con-

siderable leap forward:

3.. On the personal side, Bagley has all the qualities

which we could ask for in a Chief of Station.

He is totally

dedicated, incisive and articulate, a pleasant companion and

a gracious host.

I rate his overall performance as Strong.

the

operating instructions which were accepted in the Clandestine

Services

as a basis for an expanded effort against the overall Soviet

These directives are representative

of tho depth of his experience in this field for they cover problems

In whatever he has undertaken in this regard,

the

quality of imagination is probably the most outstanding but his work

Mr. Bagley is an exceptionally skilled olficer in the CE field. His knowledge

of the Soviet intelligence services is almost unique in the Agency. After accomplish-

ing the assigned task of reorganizing his Branch Into a streamlined and operattonally

implementation of an aggressive effort on 2. world-wide basis against the Soviet

Intelligence services. Although in his present position only four months he has

shown considerable imagination and initiative.

He carries out his managerial duties

in a proficient manner. He does howerer tend to avoid necessary but perhaps

unpromising tasks. Inclined to be intolerant of those who do not meet the high

standards he sets for himself, Mr. Bagley can be uncompromising in professiona,

is the most outstanding all around officer in the Station. Further, he is ideally

suited to the peculiar requirements and operational situation of Switzerland. In my

opinion he has been periorming consistently at a level above his present grade and all

members of the Station, including myself, have learned much from him professionally.

lo Subjest has completed a tho-year tour at VOR and after home leavé

has returned here for another two years.

2. Subject has a notauly orderly mind, unusual intelligence, and a rp-

markable interest in his work.

He is able to handle i variety of tasks at

one tine. Although Subject has had a varlety of agent-handling experience,

unfortunately, he has not had the opportunity to, handlo many agents.. lo intend

to correct this in the next few months by having him handle a series of opera-

tions during the developmental atarco.

We bellove this will rive hin the

experience and depth necessary to support his alrendy good theorotical knowlodgo.

and unron 1s

He also tends in other rays to diaregard the human elements ever present in

Intelligence operations.

However, there Is no question in my mind but hat

additional experience will cure both of these very minor lanlts.

3. I have every reason to belleve that Subject will bu ready for important

operational assignments elther in Mashington or in the tiold after another too
