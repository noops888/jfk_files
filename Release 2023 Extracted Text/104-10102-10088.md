nection, it should be pointed out that this emotional state appeared to stem,

in part, from his inherent suspicions that his wile (21 years of age and rel-

atively attractive) was being unfaithful to hin. All Indications are, however,

that A-7 has no real basis for these suspicions; other than those conjured up

in his own mind.

In any case, he requested if it might not be possible to wire-

tap his wife's house in Miami, so that he could have daily reports on her activi-

and inpossible to accouplish at this time without tieing up considerable

persounel.) A-T was later told this after ve assured him that his suspicions

vere groundless where his wife was concerned.

Following this initial meeting with a-7,

it was apparent to both

r. Pekich and the undersigned that time would be needed to restore agent's

confidence in our capability to support his efforts in any future projected

assignment in the field.

Moreover, A-7's emotional state, which appears to

sten from his problems with his in-laws and his concern about leaving his rile

alone, must be fully resolved before attempting to dispatch him again.

6. In later debriefing session held from 3 to 15 Hovember with A-7,

considerable more light was thrown on the nature and scope of his operational

activities in Cuba.

As previously indicated in paragraph 1 of this report,

A-7's activities are summarized as follows:

ALPANIC-7 Operational Activities in Cuba:

In line wath his projected mission to parenize resistance arouns

in devana and Pinar del R10 for nounting sabotase operations against

key target installations and assasination of prominent Cuban Conminist

members in the Castro entoureze, A-T appears to have made some process

in this direction from the time he arrived in Cuba in early August 1900

to his subsequent estiltration 5. Novenber.

Upon arrival in farena,

A-7 degen a series of meetings with leaders of the CA, Trigle-A aid DO

with a view to establishing some degree of rapport in the furtherance

of his own personal objectives.

b. Internal Assets Developed in Cuba Eor Future Grerational Use:

In attempting to sift out specific assets developed by 4-7 during

his activities in Havana, three of the more proninent individuals with

whom A-7 wes in direct contact should be listed.

(1) (Benito PUNANDEZ:

orner of the lAuto-Marts and (Auto-Centro

Garages) in Havana.

A-T used FIRMANDEZ for planning the

selection of suitable Id's and DZ's in both Piner del Rio

and friente provinces, location of safehouses in Fevana and

use of his garages for storage of ams and military equipment

which A-7 anticipated would be dispatched to him.

in Tuvana, but felt he could resolve these differences upon

his oim return.

c. Problens Encountared by d-7 mile operating in Cuba:

Some of the nore significant problems encountered by A-7

during the course of his operations in Havena are as follows:

Security:

In this connection, A-7 stated that despite

the disguise given him, he had to be constantly on the alert

from the danger of being picked up by G-2 or Castro police

during the course of his numerous operational contacts. Fe

sited several examples where he believed he was under sur-

veillance by the opposition and subsequently succeeded in alluä-

ing this surveillance.

He complained that his disguise, (hair-

piece and mustache) rapidly deteriorated in the Havana climate

and as a consequence he was lorced to abandon this disguise towar

the latter part of his stay in Havana. Similarlj; he was forced

to change his quarters continually, by noving from one safehouse

to another as a security precaution, since he felt that it as

generally known in Cuban circles that he was operating in the

Havana area, and that he was probably already under the sur-

Hateriel Support:

In the course of these debriefing

sessions, one of A-T's chief complaints was thet despite ais

urgent messages sent through his cut-out (AIRD 1) to the Station

that arms and other military equipment were sorely needed by!

his groups in Havana and Piner del Rio, no action tras taken to

implement his requests.

As a result, A-7 felt he was losing face

with his followers and

this was one of the primary factors for

retuming to the States to discuss this aspect with Headquarters.

(3)

leed for Direct Communication:

a-7 stated thet rithout the

services of a iT operator tho could be in direct communication

with us, he is fully convinced that any subsequent return to cis:

in an operational capacity vould be ineffectual.

would be one of the conditions laid on us-that wen he returned,

choice in taking over toe operations in this area against Castro targets.

In any case, a decision has been reached that A-7 should not be diapatched

without a trained i/I operator who can be relied on to ront closely on

operations with A-? inside the country.

8.

Case Officer Corments:

Despite A-7's tendencies to operate on

a grandiose scale,

his disappointment in the lack of support received on his

initial mission to Cuba; and his display of emotional instability at times,

it is believed that his

efforts can be properly chenneled to work effectively

for us in Cuba.

His motivation appears to stem from his personal ambitions

to make his mark on this counter-revolution against Castro, where he can

assure himself of a priminent position in the future government to be formed

in Cuba after the overthrow of the Castro regime. A-7 has imagination and

the till to succeed. His weakness is his inability to hide his personal

embitions fron others tho may work with him and who may have altogether dif-

ferent motivations and sense of values.

Hence, it is beliaved that 4-7

will encounter problems in handling peole recruited or assigned to him in

the course of his activities inside the country.

APUG-1 can be sited as

a good example, there a clash of personalities has apparently already taken

place.

In view of this, A-? will have to be dealt with firmly and must ce

convinced that the success or failure of his projected mission will depend

on his ability to develop confidence and loyalty among his followers once he

is inside the corntry agaia.

Similarly, A-? must resolve his personal problan

dealing with his wife and in-laws, which has had an adverse effect on him

personally since his return, and may affect his operations inside Cuba.

The

next several reeks will, therefore, need be devoted to re-establish A-T's

confidence in our ability to support his efforts in Cuba, once he is sent

back, and working out his family problems to obviate any adverse psyccolo-

gical effect which may be detrimental to his operations im Cuba.
