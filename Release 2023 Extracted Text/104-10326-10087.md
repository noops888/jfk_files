AS HQS IS AWARE,

STATION CONTINUES IO CONDUCT JOINT

TELTAP OPERATIONS WITH

TAGAINST THE RUSSIAN AND

CUBAN EMBASSIES; HOWEVER,

THE TAKE ON THE CUBANS IS VERY

WE ARE CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF INITIATING A

UNILATERAL TELTAP OP AGAINST THE CUBAN EMBASSY AND SEVERAL

THUS, ANY OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF WHERE TELTAP

TAPES ON OSWALD WERE DERIVED WOULD HAVE DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON

CURRENT LIAISON RELATIONSHIP. THE L

I SERVICES AND

SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CONTINUE TO BE SENSITIVE RE THE

NWBOLTON RELATIONSHIP, AND THERE ARE THOSE WITHIN THESE RANKS

WHO QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT THE MEXICANS SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING

MORE THAN A FORMAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NWBOLTON. STATION BELIEVES

THAT ANY EXPOSURE (WHETHER OLD OR NEW) AT THIS STAGE OF THE

LIAISON RELATIONSHIP (A NEW REGIME IS COMING TO POWER) WOULD

FORCE THE MEXICANS TO REASSESS THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH US AS

WELL AS QUESTION OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A DISCREET AND

PROTECTED RELATIONSHIP.

(IT WOULD ALSO GIVE OUR DETRACIORS THE

EXCUSE TO FURTHER REDUCE OR COMPLETELY BREAK OFF THE

GIVEN THE HIGH INTEREST OF POLICYMAKERS IN

NARCOTRAFFICKING, TERRORISM, AND COUNTERINTELLIGENCE IN MEXICO,

THE PRESERVATION OF STATION LIAISON EQUITIES IS PARAMOUNT AT

THIS TIME. STATION ENCOURAGES HQS IO CONTINUE TO DO WHATEVER IS

POSSIBLE TO KEEP THE LID ON THE BOX RE PREVIOUS JOINT OPS WITH

THE MEXICANS.

3. RE THE NOO INVOLVED IN THE TRANSCRIPTION OF THE
