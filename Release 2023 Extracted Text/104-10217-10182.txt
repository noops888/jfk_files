2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992
27 January 1965
General Carter:
I have checked with Tom K. on the status of the Menoyo case.
It is being pursued actively by Roberton's staff and Tom K. The Army
has a very peculiar story it has been telling us. Long ago, back in 1963,
they coordinated with us a plan to infiltrate a radio operator to make
contact with groups in Cuba believed to be dissident. They promised
to keep us posted as infiltration developed but never did. They now say
that they had believed the radio operator had infiltrated but had thought
Menoyo remained in the United States. They say they were as shocked
as we were to find that he had gone into Cuba. This either shows great
ineptitude or (as Tom K. thinks most likely) they are not coming clean
with us. To apply the pressure and to clear the record, Tom has
insisted that ACSI provide a formal report and chronology of this
business and when this is received and analyzed Tom will be in touch
with you as regards actions to take. Obviously the case has a direct
and ominous bearing on the status and future of our own operations.
Also, want to alert you to another case just beginning to
emerge which appears once again to be a case of lack of coordination.
This one involving the Army and a Swiss diplomat first recruited by
the Army in coordination with our Station in Korea sometime back.
The Army however has since worked with the Swiss including poly-
graphing, retargeting, etc. without coordination. The matter is being
investigated.
