OLTMANS questioned by the Amsterdan police on the charge

dismissed for lack of evidence.

OLTMANS' former wife, Freida (now married to Peter BIE-

LING), claimed she had met OLTMANS while she was on vacation in

Holland. He claimed he was employed as a reporter for the United

A, 3140 press in Amsterdam. She later determined

that he was a teletype

job and he began to work as a free-lance writer.

committed acts of lewdness with-his (complainant's) under-age

son during the summer of 1954. Inquiries into the matter failed

to reveal

any evidence of any offense having been committed.

When interrogated, and also when being confronted with

each other, both the persons concerned denied any act of lewdness

having taken place between them. There was, however, evidence that

OLTMANS' conduct toward the boy had been somewhat strange, which

caused the latter

to discontinue his association with OLTMANS.

As there was no evidence of any homosexual relations

having existed between the persons concerned, the Chief Commissio-

ner of Police, Amsterdam, was of the opinion that the matter should

not incriminate OLIMANS and should not be used in deportation pro-

ceedings against him.

[FBI FR (New York), 11 March 1963 - DBA 35747.]

1956

As correspondent for De Nieuwsgier, OLTMANS covered the

visit to Indonesia of the Soviet Chief of State, VOROSHILOV. At

several mass meetings the Russian President severly censored The

Netherlands, he pleaded for the immediate transfer of New Guinea

to Indonesia, and posing as the great supporter of the young state,

he in this way assured the Communist Party of a resounding election

victory not long after. As a result the relations between Indonesia

and The Netherlands deteriorated considerably.

(Haagse Post, 15 April 1961.]

Early 1956

OLTMANS learned that SUKARNO planned to pay a visit to

Italy and he asked his papers whether they would be interested in

an exclusive interview. The response was negative.. At the same

time, however, OLTMANS contacted the Agence France Presse which en-

gaged OLTMANS, at a daily fee of some 30 guilders, to cover SUKARNO's

visit to Rome. The then 32-years old OLTMANS, contacted SUKARNO dur-

ing a reception at the Indonesian Embassy, and he managed to inter-

view SUKARNO. This interview made a great hit with the AFP which

asked OLTMANS to cover SUKARNO's trip through Italy.

In those days, OLTMANS got the firm conviction that he had

to fulfill a mission: a new formulated meeting of the interests of

The Netherlands and

Indonesia. He wanted to go to Djakarta to make

a thorough study of the problems and after paying a number of visits

he secured financial aid (10,000 guilders) of some six Netherlands

enterprises with interests in Indonesia. Moreover, he entered into

arrangements with some

papers, for which he could write articles as

their foreign correspondent.

In Djakarta, he soon met numerous Dutchmen, including

Professor P. N. DROST (who after having served in 1950 for one year

with the United Nations Human Rights Division, discontinued his ser-

vice because of unsatisfactory cooperation). During a visit which

he paid to DROST, OLIMANS discussed with him the position of the

Dutch in Indonesia, their dissatisfaction with the policy pursued

in The Hague, their desire to emerge from the Indonesian-Netherlands

impasse and in this connection also the New Guinea issue. He made

the suggestion of expressing all these desires in an address to the

States General; Professor DROST himself was enthusiastic over

it,

and that very evening, he drafted an address which was stenciled

with the cooperation of a Dutch enterprise in Djakarta, and within

some days was signed by 300 Dutch nationals.

The address, which invited Parliament to set talks with

Indonesia going again and to assume a more accommodating attitude

towards SUKARNO because otherwise sharp measures were to be expec-

ted against Dutch nationals and interests in Indonesia, was used by

the Indonesian representative to the United Nations to weaken the

official arguments.

In The Netherlands press

a storm was raised

against the signatories

to the address

and especially against the

journalist OLTMANS who was cited by DROST as the initiator. The

papers for which he acted as foreign correspondent terminated the

contracts.

[Haagse Post, 15 April 1961.]

1956

OLTMANS claimed during an open session before the Senate

# 13170

, Subcommittee, on 30 November 1962, that he interviewed SUKARNO in

Role, although the editor of De Telegraaf, the

leading Dutch news-

paper, forbade OLTMANS to interview President SUKARNO.

Inasmuch as OLTMANS had not been very successful in his

#13166

writings in Holland, he went to Rome where he was able to wangle an

invitation to a reception for SUKARNO at the Indonesian Embassy.

He

then contacted the representative of a leading French newspaper and

offered to do a story on SUKARNO for that newspaper. This offer

was accepted, and OLTMANS subsequently attended the reception for

SUKARNO, where he presented SUKARNO with a silver ash tray. Appar-

ently through this meeting and subsequent meetings SUKARNO permitted

him to travel with the press entourage from Indonesia which was tra-

veling with SUKARNO. He later became the only Western newspaperman

who traveled with the SUKARNO party as it made its way around Europe,

on state visits and this travel included a visit to Yugoslavia.

He

was unable to gorto the USSR as he was unable to obtain a visa and

to get a seat on the airplane. Frieda BIELING stated that despite the

cordiality of Indonesian newspapermen toward OLTMANS there was a

certain amount of jealousy exhibited by these newsmen because of

OLTMANS' close personal contact with SUKARNO.

[FBI FR (New York), I February 1962 - DBA 796.]

OLTMANS subsequently returned to Holland where he started

to contact various Dutch industrial corporations whose holdings in

Indonesia had been seized or were in jeopardy of being seized by the

Indonesian Government. He was able to convince some of these indus-

trialists, particularly a Mr. REINKENS, the President of Unilever,

that because of his close relationship with SUKARNO he would be able

to arbitrate between the industrial empires and the Indonesian

Government for adequate compensation for their properties. In addi-

tion, he had

also made arrangements with the Amsterdam newspaper

OLTMANS' efforts to bring about some type of rapproche-

parently failed and in February 1957, at which time Frieda BIELING

was in the United States, she received a telegram stating he was

coming to the United Nations to do press work for the Indonesian

Government. At the time he arrived, the whole question of Dutch

control of New Guinea was being brought before the United Nations

and she presumed that this was the reason for his arrival in the

United States less than a month after their marriage. On theday

of their marriage, ten minutes after the ceremony, he had left her

and she was walking through Greenwich Village in New York City by

At one time her father had determined that OLTMANS had a

police record for molesting young boys in Amsterdam, Holland, and

that he had been under psychiatric care with his uncle, a well-known

Dutch psychiatrist, for homosexuality. Subsequently, by chance, she

read

a diary which

OLTMANS traveled to The Netherlands. After paying a

de Witteberg, and organized a meeting of

some well-known members of

Parliament, of the Council of State, industrialists, and financiers.

This meeting actually took place on 16 October 1957. OLT-

MANS opened the meeting and warned about an impending Irian action

unless early talks were initiated with the Indonesians. At the con-

clusion of the meeting OLTMANS received 1500 guilders to cover expen-

His services in making this speech were obtained through a New York

many stining remarks regarding the United States and expressed opi-

nions of a definite anti-Netherlands nature. He referred to the

Netherlands Government as stupid

stated The Netherlands should

Government considers him a traitor. It was observed by this source

that OLTMANS is accepted in the well-to-do circles and that listen-

specific prearranged itinerary.

His reputation at the United Nations leaves many ques-

tions unanswered. He is socially ostracized by the Dutch de-

legation and fellow Dutch newsmen at the United Nations for

his openly pro-Indonesian public stand in the question of

Dutch Guinea.

He is not permanently accredited to the United Nations.

Ostensibly he works for an obscure Dutch monthly magazine but

fellow Dutch correspondents say they have yet to see one story.

written by OLTMANS in it.

When he applied some time ago for membership in the

United Nations correspondents Association, he could not pro-

duce a single clipping to demonstrate his journalistic activi-

tẻes.

OLTMANS claims he writes also for a syndicate in the

United States, the identity of which is unknown. His main in-

come seems to be derived from public lectures in the United

States on international politics, especially matters touching

on Asia in general and Indonesia sepcifically. He claims he,

grew up in Indonesia and therefore knows the conditions there.

Despite the fact that his material does not seem to be

printed anywhere, OLTMANS travels extensively. He shuttles be-

tween Europe and the United States quite regularly (at laast

once a year), was in the Congo last year, recently returned

from Cuba and now is planning a trip to Eastern Europe. Those

krowing his personal and financial status do not believe that

he could pay for all this even if his stories were selling.

15 April 1961 (date of article):

"What is activating Willem OLTMANS whose spirit made

itself felt during the last few days when LUNS had talks in

Washington? Is he 'an agent of SUKARNO?'

"The fact that he is continually hard up for cash is

an argument against this assumption. When he is in The Nether-

lands he is in the habit of getting free rides from city to

city. His many air trips were made possible by the fact that

he is married to a ground stewardess of an American aviation

company and consequently can travel virtually free of charge.

In recent years he is making his living by means of lectures

throughout the United States in behalf of the 'lecture office

Colston Leigh', and in this manner strongly influences

Ameri-

can public opinion with regard to New. Guinea. He himself says

'Whatever I do, write or say - my only objective is to see

Dutch prestige restored in Indonesia'. But his presence, his

knowledge of Indonesian politics and politicians, his connec-,

tions with Dutch trade and industry cannot be argued away. No

less than the fact that when LUNS carried on talks in Washington,

Kennedy appeared to be very well informed about the divergent

Fleet might become involved in Dutch-Indo dispute over New

Guinea. Press also subsequently noted White House denial of

any such statement to OLTMANS.

"?. Regarding foregoing Department may be interested

to know that OLTMANS, a contributor to Dutch left-wing weekly

Vrij Nederland, frequently lectures in US to various club au-

diences, etc. In reputable Dutch political and press circles

OLTMANS is generally viewed with disfavor because of his alle-

ged 'loose handling' of the truth. Embassy understands that

the Dutch Foreign Office had considerable record reflecting

unfavorably on OLTMANS' general behavior. It is known that

OLTMANS considers himself a warm and close personal friend

of SUKARNO (some say this is or was more than platonic) and

that he hold view that New Guinea should be ceded to Indonesia.

OLIMANS told reporting officer in May 1960 that he had recently

seen SUKARNO in Vienna and that he, OLTIANS, was convinced that

hostilities regarding Karel Doorman visit were going to happen

and (presumably for this reason) US should give full support

to Indo policy re New Guinea. If one is to believe all un-

favorable remarks and aspersions one may hear about OLTMANS in

Netherlands, it may well be that he is actually in pay of SUKAR-

NO. If this true and if OLTMANS is as

devious as pictured, it

is not impossible that his account of alleged White House state-

ment about possible US military involvement in New Guinea dispute

was deliberately made in order to produce expected denial. A

US denial of such a statement would on the balance appear help-

ful Indonesian cause as OLTMANS sees it. Embassy assumes OLTMANS

will attempt to see SUKARNO in US."

the Cuban Revolution. The CPMUN further advised that OLTMANS is

At this meeting, VERRIPS told OLTMANS that he was sorry about

their past misunderstandings and that he wished to advise OLT-

MANS that he had now moved into a residence around the corner

from OLIMANS' parents.

OLTMANS advised (on 25 November 1964) that inasmuch as

he never knew the reason for VERRIPS' original threat (see

1961 entry above) and inasmuch as VERRIPS was a very personable

individual, OLTMANS became very friendly with VERRIPS and as a

result of this friendship learned the following information

from VERRIPS:

VERRIPS fought against the Nazis in the underground in

Holland during World War II. After the war he went to Moscow

and obtained espionage training in the Soviet espionage train-

ing center in Moscow. He subsequently worked in Southeast Asia

and evidently defected to and worked for the "Security Intelli-

gence Agency" of the United States. VERRIPS claimed to OLTMANS

that he was not employed by the CIA at that time and that he

was being paid a $500 a month pension by the Agency. VERRIPS

also stated he had access to a United States passport in the of-

the contents of his file which he believed

VERRIPS.

OLTMANS advised (the FBI) that when he learned that he

was being investigated by the INS he contacted VERRIPS, who had

previously advised him that he (VERRIPS) had access to informa-

tion in the office of the United States Attorney General, and

requested VERRIPS to attempt tw determine the nature of the in-

who was absent from the United Nations since March 1964, ap-

pears to be very cold toward OLTMANS and apparently does not

OLTMANS presented a one-hour exclusive interview with

Jim GARRISON, New Orleans District Attorney, on Dutch television,

at prime time on 22 February 1968.

GARRISON explained that President KENNEDY was murdered

because his concept of detente was detrimental to the "military-

industrial complex". He repeated well-known thesis that KENNEDY

was a victim of a plot by CIA, who made common cause with the

military-industrial establishment, with vested interest in keeping

the cold war going. GARRISON also stated CIA conmitted to the

Asian land war while one of President's last orders was for troop

reduction there. He predicted that the President who brings the

United States to the brink of peace will suffer same fate as

KENNEDY.

When queried about the reason for the program, especially

made for a European audience, GARRISON said the growing CIA in-

fluence on United States media made it impossible for him to be

heard in his own country.

OLTMANS, said to be a linited States citizen, is charac-

terized by his former colleagues as someone "more interested in

shady politics than in journalism".

Author's comment: The most damaging aspect of this pro.

credible to elicit rather favorable comment in the TV reviews

from such generally well-informed newspapers as Nieuwe Rotter-

damse Courant, among others. Several Dutch viewers also commen-

ted on the credibility of his person and presentation. Likely

that Dutch television will try to sell this program to other

European stations.

the introduction to The Generals is exerting considerable

pressure to make him nevertheless denigrate SUHARTO. OLT-

MANS obtained his information in the following manner:

Senator TOWERS of Texas has had a confidential agent in Djakarta

for a number of years, the main reason being that Texas had en-

tered into considerable commitments with the new regime (cereals,

rice, and lend lease). TOWERS wanted to know whether his aid

was going to the right places. The confidential agent's re-

ports were sent by TOWERS to the head of the American Chamber

of Commerce for Indonesia in New York. The latter is a good

friend of OLTMANS and it Is from him that OLTMANS has managed

to get hold of the necessary information in the form of photo-

copies.

In New York, OLTMANS had an unexpected visit from an

acquaintance from Djakarta • a young man, a homosexual like

OLIMANS, who works for Indonesian military intelligence.

though this Indonesian spent a few days with OLIMANS, he did

not succeed in persuading OLTMANS to abandon his plan. The

young man left with the warning that OLIMANS vould be in dan-

Upon his return to Holland, OLTMANS asked the clair-

voyant CROISET, of Utrecht, whom he consults regularly. CROISET

told OLTMANS that he could go ahead, because they would not get

at him anyway.

American solicitors have formed an "Association for the

Investigation of Assassinations" in Washington. OLTMANS was of-

join. Moreover, CROISET saw that the Soviet Union had something

ments concern conversations between John Foster DULLES, former

Dutch Foreign Minister Josef LUNS, and former Dutch Ambassador

to the United States, J. H. Van ROIJEN,. on the topic of New

Guinea and Indonesia.

According to source, OLTMANS is currently attempting to

embarrass and discredit LUNS. OLTMANS already has inspired a

recent anti-LUNS article entitled "Has Luns Mis-led Us?", writ-

ten by one Joris van der BERGIN and printed in a sensationalist

Dutch newspaper Vrij Nederland. Source speculates that fnu

JONES mentioned above, may be former US Ambassador to Indonesia,

Howard JONES, as source has established that OLTMANS and Howard

JONES met in September 1971, in Boston. Given his background

of being a leftist, anti-American journalist, should OLTMANS

obtain the abovementioned classified material, source feels

OLTMANS would use it to ... embarrass [publicly] all parties

concerned.

The popular Dutch morning newspaper De Telegraaf repor-

ted today that "Hague circles" believed that Soviet diplomats

in Holland were engaged in activities aimed at discrediting the

former Foreign Minister, Josef J. M. A. H. LUNS, who is now

Secretary General of NATD.

The report is one of a series of recent developments

which have placed LUNS in the center of controversy in connec-

tion with secret archives in The Hague which he left behind

when he gave up his position as Foreign Minister to work for

NATO.

The Telegraaf report was accompanied by a photograph

showing a Soviet Embassy car parked outside the house of Willem

OLTMANS, who describes himself as a journalist.

OLTYANS has applied to the Dutch Attorney General for a

prosecution of LUNS, allegedly for having misled" the Dutch

Government during negotiations with Indonesia on former Dutch

New Guinea. The Dutch Government yesterday refused OLTMANS'

request:

De Telegraaf clained today that OLTMANS was "on good

footing with the Russians" and had already been to Moscow trice.

The paper said that OLTMANS had talks last night at his home, in

Amsterdan "with a number of left-wing personalities on such sub-

jects as NATO and LUNS". The report added that three represen-

tatives of the Soviet Embassy in The Hague, the Political,

Cultural, and Press Attaches were also present.

Their behavior indicates a rather obtrusive interference

with Dutch affairs and Hague circles say it is certainly unu-

sual, the paper said.

De Telegraaf said Hague circles pointed out that the Russians

would be very interested in discrediting the new and active Secre;

tary General of NATO. In that function LUNS has already displayed

great energy in the way he has tackled the Malta problem, which

was threatening to be lost to NATO.

The surprising presence of the three Soviet diplomats

in OLTMANS' house last night indicates possible Soviet attempts

to exert influence in the current campaign against the person

of the Secretary-General of NATO. The paper added that it was

too much of a coincidence that the three Russians called on

OLTMANS just before he is due to give his press conference in

The Hague tomorrow morning.

COLTMANS has announced that he had cabled LUNS asking him

to attend the press conference so that he couls accuse him pub-.

licly of "misleading" the Government and (former) President

SUKARNO of Indonesia. LUNS is due in Holland anyway tomorrow to

join other prominent KIM guests for its inaugural flight to Hong

Kong.)

man for the Soviet Embassy in The Hague told ANP:

"The report is a barefaced lie and a libel on the

staff of the Soviet Embassy and is devoid of foundation. Such

a publication is a pure invention on the part of the gentlemen

of the Telegraaf, who dream of harming the Soviet Union in some

way or other and disturbing relations between the Soviet Union

and the Netherlands in some way. That does no credit to thís

newspaper, which specializes in this kind of anti-Soviet fabrica-

tions.. The Soviet diplomats have hitherto never interfered in

Dutch domestic affairs and are not doing so now. The presence

of the diplomats at OLTMANS' cocktail party, which was also at-

tended by many other Dutch journalists, was purely purely a mat-

ter of routine.

The diplomats received an invitation for this

party in December last year".

[Dutch News Service, 19 January 1972.]

20 January 1972

In a press conference in The Hague on 20 January 1972,

OLTMANS announced he was suing De Telegraaf for taking unauthori-

zed photographs of his house and for implying he was a Soviet

stooge.

OLTMANS also suing the editor of the respected Nieuwe

Rotterdamse Courant in whose company a De Telegraaf photo-

grapher came to his home... Sensing his charges against LUNS'

Indonesian policy dated, academic, and not catching fire, OLT-

MANS threw on some current fuel. He claims former Ambassador

Van ROOIJEN warned Queen about LUNS' prevarications last year

and this led Prince BERNHARD to seek to prevent LUNS from be-

coming NATO Secretary: General.

Parliament still in recess and no Parliamentarian has com-

mented publicly on the charges, but leftist Volkskrant front

pages Koreign Affairs Committee will consider matter 1 February

and decide whether Parliamentary investigation useful. Spokes-

man said not only OLTMANS but several youth groups pressing for

inquiry. Soviets have maintained a judicious silence about en-

tire affair since Embassy issued a statement denying connection

between the presence of Soviet guests at OLTMANS' home and his

anti-LUNS campaign.

a mental hospital suffering from a persecution complex and

undergoing heavy shock treatment.

According to OLTANS; the manuscript of the book is in

reached for comment, but OLTMANS said he was told RUSSELL has

the book in his office files. He reportedly has not read the

manscript.

De MOHRENSCHILDT :

"How would it hit the media if I came

out and said I felt responsible for OSWALD's behavior?

OLTMANS

"You mean what OSWALD did? Shot or

not shot, he was involved in the shooting.

You have

De MOHRENSCHILDT: "I realize that and I don't want to

incriminate myself directly, but I am convinced that

what OSWALD finally set up we completely agreed upon.

OLTMANS

: "But you were in Haiti on the day of

the assassination.

De MOHRENSCHILDT: "Yes."

OLTMANS said he asked de MOHPENSCHILDT if he were ready

to make a statement. He said the professor replied, "Yes, but

never in America. I am be followed. I find my house all the

time searched. So I am scared to death. I first must get out •

of the country". OLTMANS said he called his Dutch television su-

perior and was told to bring de MOHRENSCHILDy, to Holland. As

OLTMANS tells it, de MOHRENSCHILDT had several changes of mind

but finally said he was ready to go. OLTMANS said they drove

to Houston, left de MOHRENSCHILDT's car there with a man named

Bishop College and a close friend of the OSWALDs. OLTMANS fell

into the habit of visiting George and Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT

in Dallas two or three times a year.

In January 1976, de MOHRENSCHILDT wrote OLTMANS that he

was preparing a book lI'm a Patsy, I'm a Patsy] and sent several

pages to the Dutch reporter. By June the book was completed,

but Jeanne de MOHRENSCHILDT told OLTMANS she was upset when she

read it.

A Dutch journalist said he testified (for second time]

under oath [in a close hearing] that a Russian emigrant who ap-

parently committed suicide earlier this week had claimed to be

part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy.

The television newsman, Willem OLTMANS, said George de

MOHRENSCHILDT told him the alleged conspiracy involved Texas

oilmen, Cuban exiles, and CIA and FBI agents.

OLTMANS said de MOHRENSCHILDT claimed he was a middle-

man between H. L. HUNT representing Texas oilmen

and Lee Harvey

OSWALD. The journalist said he gave the committee 'the name of

an FBI official, not [J. Edgar] HOOVER, who might be important.

The Dutch journalist said de MOHRENSCHILDT told him

Cubans had fired at Kennedy at the same time OSWALD did and

said he gave the House Assassinations Committee the name and

picture of one Cuban he believes was involved.

OLMANS, who testified for more than three hours in a

closed sessions of

the House panel investigating the Kennedy

assassination, later declined to tell reporters what evidence

he had to support the claim.

He said he gave the committee a taped interview in

which a Cuban exile named Loran MALL claims he was offered

$50,000 in the office of ilman Lester LOGUE to kill Kennedy.

In Dallas, LOGUE called the allegation "ridiculous"

and said he would meet with his pawyers to discuss suing OLTANS

for libel:

After OLTMANS testified, reporters asked subcommittee

chairman Richard PREYER (D-N.C.) if he believed the story. "Ask

me that question again in a few months", PREYER replied, "Mr.

OLTMANS was very specific on some things which can be corroborated

but not as clear on others".

The journalist said in at least two news interviews

before his committee appearance yesterday that de MOHRENSCHILDT

wavered between insisting the whole story was true and indicating

he made it up

to seel a book. But OLTMANS who is said to be wri-

ting a book on the assassination himself, told reporters after

his testimony that de MOHRENSCHILDT never told him he had made the

story up.

OLIMANS said de MOHRENSCHILDT mixed socially with Dallas,

oilmen and other wealthy people and became a friend of HUNT a.

multimillionaire oilman now dead.

"What Mr. de MOHRENSCHILDT said was that Mr. OSWALD was

acting at his guidance and instructions", OLTMANS said in an ABC

interview. "Mr. de MOHRENSCHILDT indicated that his ties up-

wards were towards H. L. HUNT... and downstairs to Lee Harvey

OSWALD"•

The manuscript of de MOHRENSCHILDT's book, I'm a Patsy,

sidered himself responsible for OSWALD's actions.

U. S. sources said RUSSELL intends to hold on to the de

MOHRENSCHILDT papers. Behind the scenes, officials are waiting

for a decision on whether the House committee will obtain the

documents by subpoena or whether the FBI will seek access to

them by court order.

nature. of the OLTMANS testimony before the subcommittee headed

by Rep. Richardson PREYER (D-N.C.) "this is hearsay twice re-

moved", he said vehemently.

Other members of the Congress implied that the value

of OLTMANS' testimony was in doubt since four of the alleged

conspirators are dead: de MOHRENSCHILDT, oil millionaire H. L.

HUNT, OSWALD, and

RUBY. But OLTMANS told newsmen after the

hearing that the committee asked him for, and will get, all the

letters he received from de MOHRENSCHILDT over the past ll years.

"De MOHRESNCHILDT told me that OSWALD acted at his (de

MOHRENSCHILDTSS) instructions and that he kned OSWALD was going

to kill Kennedy". OLTMANS said.

"OLTMANS also told the committee:

- That OSWALD and the late H. L. HUNT were "very

close";

- That a Texas geological engineer named Lören HALL

claimed he was offered $50,000 in the office of a Dallas

attorney named Lester LOGUE for the assassination of

Kennedy.

- That de MOHRENSCHILDT told him he had discussed the

assassination of Kennedy with OSWALD "from A to Z".

OLTMANS said he gave the committee the name and picture

of a Cuban veteran of the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba who was

part of the conspiracy. The motivation of the Cuban exile cony,:

spirators for killing Kennedy, according to OLTIANS, was their

conviction that the President had betrayed them at the Bay of

Pigs.

..In still another dubious excursion, the committee has

now labeled a man who not long ago emerged from a psychiatric

ward, George de MOHRENSCHILDT, as a "crucial witness" although

he had just committed suicide. Neither the Assassinations Com-

mittee nor its staff ever interviewed the man, a White Russian

who had befriended the OSWALDs in Texas in 1962.

In fact, House investigators possess little more than

a Dutch television film tape and one tape cassette "allegedly"

containing a conversation between de MOHRENSCHILDT and Dutch

journalist Willen OLTMANS.

In a spate of interviews since de MOHRENSCHILDT's

death Tuesday afternoon, OLTMANS has been quoting him as saying

he was a middleman between Texas oilman and OSWALD in a baroque

kill-Kennedy conspiracy, which also seems to have included anti-

Castro Cubans and a trucking firm executive.

Curiously, by OLTMANS' account, de MOHRENSCHILDT did

not come up with the story until February -. more than 13 years

after the assassination but only a few weeks after his release

December 30 from the psychiatric unit of Parkland Memorial Hos-

pital.. And although OLTMANS quotes de MOHRENSCHILDT as saying

OSWALD took instructions from him, that is somewhat difficult to

square with the fact that the de MOHRENSCHILDTs were in Haiti

at the time of the Kennedy assassination and had been there for

about five months. They told the Warren Commission they last

saw the OSWALDs in April of 1963 and, the Commission found, '.

"they never saw either of the OSWALDs again".
