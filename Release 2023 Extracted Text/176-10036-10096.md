INITIALLY, THE INFLUX OF AMERICANS AND-THEIR STATIONING IN THE

PROVINCES WAS WELCOMED, WITH THE THOUGHT THAT AMERICANS THUS

LOCATED WOULD COME TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFICULTIES CONFRONTING

THE VIETNAMESE, THEREBY ENABLING THEM TO INTERPRET VIETNAMESE

PROBLEMS SYMPATHETICALLY AND WITH MORE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SITUATION.

THIS HAS NOT PROVED TO BE THE CASE IN ALL INSTANCES.

•3: PRESIDENT DIEM HAS RECEIVED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER. OF

COMPLAINTS AND STATEMENTS OF IRRITATION FROM HIS MILITARY AND

CIVILIAN CHIEFS. ABOUT PROBLEMS OF RELATIONSHIPS: WITH AMERICAN

COUNTERPARTS,

AMONG OFFICIALS COMPLAINING WAS MAJOR GENERAL

TON THAT DINH, CONMANDING GENERAL, II CORPS, WHO COMMENTED THAT.

THERE WERE TOO MANY AMERICANS IN SOUTH VIETNAM.

COMPLAINTS. HAVE

ALSO COME IN FROM THE JOINT GENERAL STAFF. NHU SAID THAT ONE

ADVANTAGE OF THE AMERICAN PRESENCE AT ALL ECHELONS WAS TO HELP.

KEEP VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS HONEST AND TO STIMULATE THEM INTO

BETTER PERFORMANCE, AS VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS DID NOT WANT TO LOOK

BAD IN THE EYES OF FOREIGN OFFICERS: THE VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS

WERE AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH RESPECT TO THEIR AMERICAN OPPOSITE

NUMBERS, BECAUSE THE AMERICANS CONTROLLED THE MEANS, 1.E., THE

FUNDS AND GOODS, AND THIS CONTRIBUTED TO THE SENSE OF INADEQUACY

AND INFERIORITY ON THE PART OF VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS.
