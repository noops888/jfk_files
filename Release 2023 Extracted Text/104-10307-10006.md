WILAT TARGETS WAS THE AGENCY ABLE TO COVER AND WITH WHAT

FREQUENCY AND CONTINUITY?

The following remarks apply to agent coverage only, that is,

coverage by means of individuals on the island of Cuba, or elsewhere

in the world.

Audio devices or telephone taps on Cuban installations

abroad or Cubans living abroad have produced intolligonce which has

served operational

ends, In other words, information which has pro-

vided critical data used in the spotting, assessment and recruit

mont of agents.

Due to the standard security measures taken in

most official installations, these technical operations have been

able to provide only a limited anount of positive intelligence.

general, agents have produced infornation essentially in accordance

with their known access at the time of rocruitment.

Responsibility

for many of the agents dealt with during the prosent reporting period

was simply assumed by TIW from past efforts against cuba.

In many

instances, these agents hau been recruited strictly on an "availa-

billty" basis, and indeed had no particular access. A major effort

was made at the inception of Tri to winnow out those persons who

could make no contribution and to redirect those who could.

This

process of redirection, which was conducted via time consuming and

generally inefficient S/W channels, rosulted in the conversion of

a number of heretofore unusable agents into sound, pertinent report-

ing sources:

Though, in most instances, TEW operations officers

had never had personal contact with these agents, they succeeded

in inducing many of them to spot, develop and recruit sub-agents.

This technique succeeded, despite the obstacles involved in

vetting candidates and advising agents via S/W means.

In regard

to the recruitment of new agent assets during the reporting period,

TEW was able to be guided by specific, priority needs. Accordingly,

the many new assets acquired were chosen because of specific access

to target personalities or institutions. The assigned targets and

extent of coverage are indicated below.

A. Military

During the reporting period, in the latter half, the Agency's

major effort to obtain intelligence from agent sources, centered

on Cuban military affairs.

The reporting obtained covered matters

ranging from military policy to detailed OB.

Almost every agent

contributed to this effort, with the consequence that the coverage

of military matters was wide-spread and continuous.

Despite the

fact that 95% of this information was provided via S/W much of 1t

fron totally untrained sub-sources who had no military experience),

such was the detail and volume of the data, that our agents were

able to give us highly significant information on troop and materiel'

movements, location and nature of military sites, etc.

The follOw

Ing agents

able to produce intelligence on cuban political attairs at the

ministerial level and above.

This intelligence was derived

essentially from sources who had but limited access to persons of

high rank or in key positions.

This type of access placed a premium

on Agent elictation skills and the ability to distinguish between

rumor and fact, plus an aptitude for remaining afloat in dangerous

waters.

of intelligence irom Agent sources on the Cuban sugar, ofl and trang-

summaries.

In a number of instances, this intelligence was pro-

vided by agents who had direct access to this information by virtue

of their jobs.

We also have been able to get continued reporting

on general economic conditions and foreign trade.

period. The key military, political and economic targets were

clearly defined and assiduously pursued by TIW. The immense

pressure of time must continuously be borne in mind if the attack

on the Cuban problem is to be granted its full perspective..

Even

before TIl assumed responsibility for collection against Cuba,

it was clear that intelligence on soviet,

Satellite and Chinese

Communist Cuban policy and maneuvers would be formulated and

planned at the highest level in the respective governments.

Equally clear was the fact that the clandestine search for in-

sights into the Cuban policies of these governments would enjoy

only as much success as the clandestine search for any intelligence

regarding any policies of these governments.

Time restrictions

alone ruled out the hope that adequate coverage of these key

deniod aron targets could be achieved.

As & consequence, every

facet of the TEW collection program was geared to the search for

top priority Cuban intelligence; from sources in the free world

and on the island every agent or agent candidate was evaluated in

terms of his access to such intelligence.

Translated Into

espionage terms, this meant that every agent or candidate was

examined sharply to determine whether and how he could help

penetrate the GOC, the Cuban armed forces or the managerial

policy levels of the Cuban economy. Below is an account of the

success of this effort; it will be seen that most major target

areas were under direct, specific assault.

candidate provided highly valuable information throughout the

sunmer of 1962. Though the information was obtained Indirectly

by the agent it was but a portion of what he could produce..

Thus

the ultimate aim of the operation was to effect the candidate'g

direct recruitment.

The drive toward this goal continues, and

though we aro optimistic that the 6 months effort thus far in-

vested will result in

bofore dispatching him to Cuba, he has attempted to carry out

his instructions.

By October he had succeeded in eliciting

significant information from the target,

and was confident his

full recrultment was simply a matter of time.

One inhibiting

feature affecting the pace of this operation is the fact that

the agent lives in Santiago while his relative, the target, 1s

a resident of Havana.

Unquestion: bly the full recruitment of

the targot could help fill an important gap in our reporting

on GOC activities.

(b) In June 1962 TIVY obtained a lead to a

person very closely related to fidel CASTRO.

Throughout the

summer extensive but necessarily circumspent negotiationg were

conducted to bring this person to Mexico where full recruitment,

training and briefing would be possible.

The negotiations

culminated in success. The agent was met and trained by Agency

personnel in September

and early October and dispatched to Cuba

on 15 October with the

specilic mission of reporting on the

thoughts, plans and activities of the CASTROS and otner leading

GOC figures.

Since the target, prior to recruitment did not

possess the kind of political awareness which would have led him

systematically to observe those GOC personalities to whom he

had matural access, the Agency was denied any prime political

intelligence from this source during the reporting period.

(c) Throughout the summer 1962, TFW

received various reports, the tenor of which were that ernesto

'Che' GUEVARA would like

to defect from Cuba.

Each report proved,

upon closer inquiry, to be groundless, untll

we learned in late

September that a Mexican Industrialist had claimed GUEVARA had

asked him in 1961 for assistance in leaving Cuba.

Though many

of the facets of this disclosure tallied with other known data,

exploitation of this exceedingly important lead was hamstrung by

the inability to aline a qualified agency officer with the widely.

travelling Mexican.

This lead illustrates well the frustrations

Involved in pursuing high-level targets within a rigid time

franework, and with a limited number of avallable personnel.

It also tilustrated the need to persist, when the target is

of

sufficient importance, in the follow up of "far-out" leads.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES, EITIIER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE, IN

THE AGENCY'S COVERAGE CAPABILITY, WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THE

PERIOD.

The initial, significant change effected by the Agency to

increase

and improve its Cuban intelligence coverage capability

was to ostablish a Cuban Task Force at Headquarters and to

staff it with experienced intelligence officers.

These officers

were selected from

other operating Divisions within the Agency.

Many of them spoise Spanish and all of them have had extensive

experience in various intelligence assignments both at Headquarters

and in the flold.

This newly created Task Force was charged with

the responsibility to direct, advise, support, and/or coordinate

all phases of the Agency's intelligence operations directed

against Cuba.

At the same time, the Task Force Field Station In Miami was

strengthened considerably with increased numbers of experienced

staff officers and facilities for mounting intelligence operations

against the Cuban target.

This concentration of experienced

personnel into the Cuban

Task Force, both at Headquarters and

at

the Miami Field station, was a positive and significant effort to

increase the Agency's intelligence coverage capability in order

to satisfactorily fulfill the priority requirements and tasks

which had been levied on the Agency as a result of the Communist.

In addition to setting up within the Agency an organization

operations directed against Cuba, all other operating Divisions

within the Agency were directed to give top priority attention

to

the development of intelligence operations against Cuba, This has

resulted in the diversion of certain assets who had the

WILAT SUPPORT FOR COLLECTION FACILITIES-WAS REQUIRED

FROM OTHER AGENCIES? HOW WAS IT SECURED FROM THEM? WAS IT TIMELY

AND EFFECTIVE? WHAT, IF ANYTHING, WAS LACKING?

The conduct of intelligence collection operations often

has depended on timely and effective support from other U.S. govern-

ment agencies.

Several government agencies provided support to

Intelligence operations directed

against the Cuban target on both a

regular and a standby basis. In fact, each and every request for

policy approved support was granted and carried out rapidly and

effectively.

For example, the Department of State has expedited the

Issuance of visas on selected cases at our request as well as granting

visa walvers to individuals of operational interest to the Agency.

In addition, Foreign Service personnel interview, debrief, and attempt

to establish the bona-fides of potential intelligence assets who

voluntarily contact a U.S. Embassy or Consulate. This is often done

alone and some times in collaboration with an agency officer prior

to introducing the agency officer for further development and ex-

ploitation as the case may require. These types of support are

provided regularly by the Department of State and contribute consid

erably to the effectiveness of many complex intelligence operations.

Another U.S. government agency which has given invaluable

support to the Agency's Intelligence collection operations 1s the FBI.

The FBI has provided biographic data, Investigative reports, and

operational leads to individuals of

interest.

known or potential operational

This support has been maintained on a regular and continuing

basis.

Close llaison relations between the FBI and this agency are

maintained at Headquarters and at various Field Stations. This close

liaison has resulted in a better understanding of the needs and

requirements of each Agency in the successful accomplishments of

their separate responsibilities as well as providing a rapid channel

for providing support and assistance when requested.

The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service has facil

itated the entry into the U.S. of persons of operational interest

to the Agency; and has provided guidance and support for cases which

VII. AGENT SUMMARIES

The scope and nature of the Agency's Foreign Intelli-

gence operations is most clearly seen in the character, personal

ambition and caprice of the human material present, namely the

agents involved.

The following sketches of the individual agents

engaged in these oporations have been compiled in recognition of

the vital ingredient which these human beings bring to an apprecia-

tion of the Agency's FI operations.

It will be noted that a

majority of the agents work, or have been worked, out of Miami,

the city which has been the center of anti-Castro Cubans, the

major pool of potential agents, since 1959.

Other geographical areas are represented in mathematical

sequence, in fact according to the number of Cuban exiles in

residence at a given place.

This same mathematical order applies

with reference to the jobs

these agents hold.

Thus, if a Cuban

has a function, the performance of which is important in sustain-

ing the island, hence important to the Cuban Regime, the Agency

has sought the

services of this man as its arent. For this reason,

several agents are in the employ of the

Jand of

24

businesses.

aiplomat now accredited to

the Regime In Havana has been examined

by the Agency as a prospective agent. Forty percent of these diplo-

mats were approached.

Of this number about one half took our bait

and have accepted assignments which range from marginal involvement

in "intelligence" (e.f:, using their diplomatic immunity to carry

our materials), to active participation in our operations.

Finally, one type of Cuban who played an influential,

though limited, role during the past six months was the defector

(who is not mentioned elsewhere in this paper). The defector 1s
