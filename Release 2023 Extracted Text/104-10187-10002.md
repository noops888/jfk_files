While 1t was tritially conte plated to place the Leaved

photographic and physical curveillance coveraõe from 1600-1430 hours

on weekdays and frun 0y20-1300 hours or weekends. These chances vero

dictated by the followins consideratiors:

1.

The new LINCUSIn bullding Offers a nuch better vantaie poirt

for both photographic and prycical surveillanco than does the

present complex wilch houses the LILNiIC and LININED lases.

theretoro,

tho Station felt tint. the personnel occupying this

and also those able to provide tre sost thorough and couplete

Because it was apparent thit the coveraic of the Lutuck

the Station desired to stefi the row base with personnel of lonjo

range potential. LInIrY-6, row clost to yeers old, does not

possess this potential; horever, the LILNIC agent compleis

happily.coxbines experienced percorel with youthful ajents.

3. Fliallo, the social and Pirancial status of the LIltIc

signed. and dated coples are retalned In Station files.

LIMOUSINE and his wife appeared and sighed the agreement, with

Robert L. EASBY acting for OOYOKE. It will be noted that the final

torms were somewhat more favorable than Headquarters had authorized.

Station had ample opportunity

to study the plans and they

were so ideal from both the operational and living standpoint that

can therefore

on change me foregust dor completion is serit about

begin almost at

I July.

-3.

Consideration had been given in the Station to installing

line-feed switchable transmitters In the two lower apartments in

view of

their

probable attractiveness to FUSTEAL personnel. However,

It is Station's vlew thät given LIMOUSINE's close involvement with

KUBARK on a number of matters it would be well nelther to have. too

much FISTEAL interest aroused in the bullding nor

to give them the

opportunity to observe the pattern of LIFEUD/6 at such lose range.

With reference to paragraph. 5 of the memorandum, Station will

probably.decide to. have LIFEUD/6 draw upg/normal contract with

LiMOUSINE and pay him his rent, which will be passed by LimousinE to

station at regular intervals:

The question of how to route an

apparently normal transaction around LIMOUSINE's bookkeeper has not

yet been resolved.

AIDE MEMOIRE

sUsT sale of tauriD property to LINCUBIN

In 1955 KUBAR purchased the LOTTiD property (215 ag. metro of Lan

and house) 1n Mexico City for $12,000 and then spent $3,500 for replro and

renovationa to accomodate KUBARS operational reguiremento.

Because of Ite Idest location directly across the street snoo the

USR Sobaday, this property which was for sale was purchaeed 8o KUBARK could

establ1ah.control over this spectfle piece of property at that time.. For

reasons of aecurity, legal title for LIMITED vasvested In agent LIMOUBINE

who acted as the cut-out vehicle. A statcuert of trust 15 on file at tbe

Station in which LIHOUBINS acknowledges XUBARK's true ownership of the

property. LlAlton bas been usia operationally vita outstanding success and

presumably sithout comprocise, and 1t 18 WH's Intention to continue using

.1to

It recently developed that part of the WilliED house crumbled, and

all

• the

house ma round to de in a dimilar state of diarepalr. Repairo and

Linited remodelling,

houever costly, did not seem to be econonically

feastble, and in addition certain other operational and security considerationa

seemed to dictate the need for a ney kind of structure-a higher building so

our angle of survelllance could be laproved, and the addition of a couvercial

Interest on the ground level to provide à delly Ploy of people (such as a

bank, retail store, etc.) frection of a comercial building is vitin the

zoning restrictions of the district.

The coat for ne constructlon of a sultable bullding has been

estimated upvarde. of $55,000: Although the property 10 located in a BLouly

deteriorating district,

nonetheless the proposition is bankable. With land

includod (appraicad at: $14,500 to $15, 000), a 10cal bank 10 1111148 80 1000

80% of the neu constructica cost us 855,000.

WOOSINE vould not vesture lnto such a construction progras on his

own account at this time. de vould, hovever,

folloy through with 1t as an

accoamodation to KUBARK If the teras vere equirable. Accordingly, he has

Indicated be vill be willlag to put up 20% of the construction cust from bio

ovn runds, borrow the remaining 80$, and then affered to pay KUBARK

180,600 penis or $14,448 (appraised value by bank) for the 215 sa setres of

Land. Nothlag would be paid for the old building, since little, 1f anything,

could be realised fron the sale of the old building and the cost of razing it

vould far exceed the sale of the salvage naterialo.

Since much of litoUsIng's cash funds would be tied up in financing

tbe new

construction, he effered to effect payment to KUBARK at the rate of

4,300 редов ог $344.00 per nonts over a 38 year period with the first payment
