Erssiaent, of crico as particularly cora hile curing the past year ir

making arrangements for the trip of Iresident jennedy to lexico fron 2: June

to 1 July and at the time of the duvan crisis in October 1002. The Chief of

itation was givor permission to give President Lorn alcos a special bric-

inr on Soviet missils bases in Cuba and special photographs were shotn to

him. In vie: of rioxico's important position in the "neutralist non-inter-

vention" camp of Latin American countries, the ready access to Fresident

LOPEZ Mateos, through the doj who has built up an excellent rapport, is an

invaluable asset for ODYOkE policy makers. The present Anbassador has chosin

to use this channel on several occasions.

3. The station passes to the Fresident FBRAND material after proper .

editing. These are riven him promptly so that the information will be

tinely, and he has shown great interest in this weekly briefing. In fast,

he has asked for special briefings, and one such report on the India-Red

Chinese border war was prepared for him. On his trip to the far East in

October 1902, he asked for special briefings on communism and important

personalities tho vere communists or pro-communints in three countries he

plamed lo viall; Indonesia, Japon, and India. They were Deepered by

11/IUG and fortarded to the station for translation and passage to the

Iresident.

il. The joint tap conter thich provides coverage of 30 lines, is one of

the most inportant sources of positive intelligence and CI infomation for

lexico. The Station is provided with the take from these lines on a daily

vasis. Thore is a iUBARK Staff Agent, Arnold I. AREHART (ps), tho spends

equipment and for controlling LUBArk interests in this phase of the Froject.

with regard to events which might be considered as bearing on the

security of this project, the Station reported that on 15 June 1902, at

approximately 0?30, the concierge noticed tro men standing directly across

the street from the lf and who scened to have an unusual intcrest in the

activity of the Lf. After avout an hour both got in an automobile and con-

tinued to watch the building from the car, and from tine to time appeared

• to in taking notes on the comings and goings of the installations, as "ell

as making notes on the cars used by the personnel of the It. They attempted

to follow one If employee when he left for lunch. Later that day, LENVOY-2

and LIENVOY-l, approached one of the two surveillance men and asked for an

explanation of his action that day. They also asked him to identify himself.

He showed them a driver's license with the name liariano VERA Gonzalez. This

infornation nas checked at the Department of Traffic and found to be the

license of another person.

The Traffic Department was staked out to deter-

mine who, if anyone, night show an interest in the nanes and addresses of

the cars used by LP personnel. On the loth of June, an agent of the jecret

Service.of the Folice Headquarters showed up and tried to obtain information

about the orner of the license plates on LIENVOY-2's car. The stake-out

employee and Secret Service man checked the traffic files, but the information

was not there. In conversation with the Secret Service man, information was

gained which led the Station to suspect that he was a member of an investi-

gative group headed by a Mexican whose aim is to obtain political information

for Mexican politicians.

Since the I5th, no further attempts to place the

Lp under observation have been noted. Any problems such as this can be

handled, if necessary, by the COS and his government contacts since this is

a joint venture.

6. During the past project year, there have been 236 disseminations

based on LIENVOY and LIENVOY-2 information: 200 from the former.

and 30

from the latter. LIENVOY reporting covered such topics as:

a. Activities of Mexican leftists

such as Lazaro CARDENAS, Jorge

L. TAMAYO, Vicente LOMBARDO Toledano.

b. World Peade Council.

c. Soviet and Czech activities in Mexico.

d. Activities of Soviet and Czech officials in Mexico.

REQUEST FOR PROJECT LIENVOY RENEWAL

A. Current Objectives.

The objectives of this project remain the same as those stated in

the last renewal request.

The project continues to provide the Mexico

Station with a smooth and rapid channel to Mexico's highest political

figures.

The Principal Agent continues to be a close associate of Pres TOPEZ

Mateos

• The intercept center has undergone no major changes during

the past year.

1. RIDM-6 Objectives Priority A, 1. a; Priority A, 4, a, b, c;

and Priority B, 2 and 3 continue to be effectively covered

by this

project. Cordial and friendly relations continue between

Government of Mexico leaders and the Chief of Station, Mexico.

During the past year, the Chief of Station, Mexico, at the

request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico, has held a number of covert

mectings with Iresident to convey ODYOKE policy matters.

The

Chief, ODACDD, remains pleased with this access to Mexican officials.

2. All Soviet and Czechoslövak

installations in

Mexico City are covered by this project. The Case Officer

for Soviet Operations and the Case Officer for Soviet Satellite

Operations rely heavily on this prodact for operational leads

and data to support double agent operations.

3.

All major anti-PEPRIME elements in Mexico City are

covered by this project.

4. Targets of opportunity which appear to be hostile or

critical to PBPRIME or to the present Government of Mexico are

covered by this project.

All major objectives of the project are being effectively realized.

B: Changes.

At a yet to be determined date, it is planned to move the intercept

center from its present location.

Iwò reasons are behind this move:

1) security, since the present base has been used for almost three years:

and 2) to provide the center with more mobile equipment. Such equipment

is now under consideration by KURIOT and when it becomes available, an

amendment to this project will be forwarded requesting approval for the

transfer of the intercept center.

C. Intelligence Production.

The activities report forwarded to Headquarters each month lists

the intelligence reports received from this project. During 1962 there

were 534 intelligence reports produced by this project which were

forwarded to Headquarters through 1 December 1962. All of these

concerned RMDM-6 reporting priorities and current requirements levied

by Headquarters and the ODACID installation..

•In addition, this project produces a large amount of information

which 1s not disseminated on a current basis but is reported to ODACID,

ODENVY and other ODYOKE agencies in reply to a steady stream of routine

file trace requests.. These file trace requests mn into the thousands

to to the chooste

each month. It would be difficult to determine the exact percentage of

the information produced by LIENVOY; but in many instances involving

prominent Mexican Government officials, large portions of the file came

to us through LIENVOY coverage.

D. Effectiveness.

The LIENVOY project provides the Station with a channel to the

highest level of the Mexican Government which is both effective and

rapid as well as covert. The Station continues to receive the daily

"resumen" highlights from the thirty (30) lines covered. A high

percentage of current intelligence is disseminated from these daily

reports. In addition, full transcripts are received on Soviet and

Czech

lines and on any of the thirty targets we may request. A food

part of this is personality data useful only to KUBARK and in some cases

to ODENVY. In addition, the project provides a support mechanism for

covering targets of interest to KUBARK or other ODYOKE agencies.

E. Problems.

There have been no significant security, cover, control or liaison

problems during the past year.

F. Liaison.

From a liaison point of view, the Station believes that this project

contributes reatly to the present friendly attitude of the Mexican

Government Icaders toward ODYOKE policies.

The ltaison remains

clandestine in nature though contacts between the Chief of Station and Pres LOFE?

Mateos are usually made at the request of the Chief, ODACID, Mexico.

G. Interagency Coordination.

The Chiof, ODACID, Mexico, 1s the only ODYOKE representative in

Mexico outside KUBARK who is

aware of this project. His role has been

J. Annex.

The equipment and Headquarters technical support furnished this

project during the past year has been commendable. A project amendment

will be submitted requesting additional equipment for the transfer of

the intercept center as soon as modifications and estimates are known.

K. Emergency Conditions.

Should a crisis require the evacuation of the KUBARK staff agent

working inside the Intercept Center, contact can be maintained with

LIELEGANT at his clandestine apartment.

This address is retained at

the Mexico Station. If the contact is not made by Willard C. CURTIS,

the use of his name should be sufficient introduction. LIENVOY/2 could

be contacted in the same manner at his home in Mexico City.
