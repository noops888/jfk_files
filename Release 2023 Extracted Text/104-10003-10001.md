2023 RELEASE UNDER THE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS ACT OF 1992

SE 21

20 March 1964

MEMO FOR THE RECORD:

14:1

Oswald.

2. Enlargements of the picture were made by Graphics Register

and the Duke Street printing plant on 13 March, and 00/C was called

for details on the picture, its source, etc.

The picture was

compared with photos of Oswald provided to us by the FBI (D-33 #16,30)

and known to have been taken in the Oswald apartment in Minsk during

1952.

This comparison showed that person appearing to be Oswald in

the picture from Graphics Register was wearing a plaid short-sleeved

sport shirt with a pattern identical to that on the shirt Oswald

was wearing in the pictures furnished by the FBI.

Further checks were made with 00 on 16 March and that

office's approvalifor an FBI contact with the source of the picture.

On 17 March, the picture was shown to C/SR/CI, C/SR, DC/SR and Ed

Golloway.

It was agreed that I should draft a CSCI transmitting

the picture and information to the FBI and a letter transmitting

the same to the Warren Commission.

I prepared both on 18 March

and received an OK on both from C/SR/CI. I hand carried both to

Ray Rocca, C/CI/R&A who approved the GSCI but made certain minor

changes in the text of the letter to the Commission.

4. On 19 March, Ray Rocca relayed to me C/CI's view that

transmittal of the picture to the Commission should be delayed

ending receipt of the results of an FBI check made in respons

o our CSCI. Note: CSCI asks FBI to contact source of pictur

and obtain details re taking of picture, persons in it etc.

According to Rocca's note, C/SR had been called on this and agreed.

5. CSCI sent forward 20 March 64.
