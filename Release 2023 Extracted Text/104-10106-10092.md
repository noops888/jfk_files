(Payment of Certain Funds

I. This memorandun submits a proposal

The proposal is to immediately pay Yuxiy Ivanovich Nosenko

$28,500 in back salary in settlement of an igency commitment

to him and to authorize a subsequent one-time paymert of $10,000

to him directly or as a contribution to his retirement for

identisying a ranking British official, William Vassall, as i

recruiied Soviet agent.

2.

Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko is a 48-year-old former

Soviet intelligence officer who is currently employed as an

independent contractor by this Agency.

Mr. Nosenko has for

some time been of the opinion that he is entitlod to $28,500

in back pay. This amount represents the di fforence between

the salary actually paid to him during the 1 March 1969 to

1 March 1975 period and the $25,000 per year which was promised

to ug tn in ghời nan

At the

time of his defection, Mt.

returned to

an intelligence officer with the Second Chief Directorate of

the KGB in Moscow.

Mr. Nosenko worked in place in the Soviet

Union until January 1964 when he returned to Switzerland.

"At

that time Mr. Nosenko decided to defect

and requested political

asylum in the United States.

4. Mr. Nosenko defected in Switzerland on 4 February

1964 and was brought to the United States under Public Law 110

on 11 February 1964.

At the time of his defection, certain

financial commitments were made to Mr. Nosenko.. These

commit-

ments were substantiated in a conversation with him on

7 February 1964 and were documented in a 10 February 1964

memorandum to the Acting Deputy Director for Plans from

Mr: David E. Murphy, Chief, Soviet Russia Division (SR Division).

This

memorandum stated as follows:

"First,

I assured Subject [Mr. Nosenko] that I.

was satisfied that he was genuine.

Based on

this and assuming his continued 'cooperation'

I said we would proceed to make arrangements

to bring him to the States.

Second, I con-

firmed

our agreement to pay him $25,000 for

each year in place ($50,000) plus $10,000 for

his part in the Vassall

case and our readiness

to contract for his services at $25,000 per

year.

Third, I explained the polygraph he

would be expected

to take as final proof of

his bona fides."

5.

Shortly after his

arrival in the United States,

SR Division

encountered serious difficulties in attempting to

establish the bona fides of Mr. Nosenko. The SR Division con-

cluded that Mr. Nosenko was not what he claimed to be and thus

was not a bona fide detector.

As noted in paragraph four of

Nosenko was held undor highly secure conditions

Attachment A installation from April 1901 until October 1967;

In October 1967 the primary responsihility for Mr. Nosenko was

transferred from SR Division to the Office of Security, which

conducted a thorough review of the developments in this case.

The conditions of confinement of Mr. Noseato were progressively

Also, despite the difficult period through which

Mr. Nosenko also provided

There renains to be paid $28,500 (less federal income

tax) in salary arrears for the period 1 March 1969

to 1 Narch

1975 (see Attachment C) and $10,000 outstanding for the Vassall

case. (He has never requested the latter amount but the

obligation still exists.) Although Mr. Nosenko signed a

quitclaim for the period prior to 12 July 1973 (see Attachment D)

and may have legally waived his right to back salary prior

that date, the earlier payment of $125,000 for the period

1964-

1969 recognized our commitment to Mr. Nosenko to honor all:

agreements and established a precedent for paying him the total

salary difference.

We also believe that we have a moral obli-

gation and that this obligation should be met.

This matter is being brought to your attention siuce

Mr. Nosenko believes he has

valid claim to cited back salary

for the 1969-1975 period and

in connoction with the current

transfer of full responsibility for Mi. Nosenko to the Counter-

It is, therefore,

recommended that you approve the expenditure of $28,500 in full

payment of back salary for Mr. Nosenko for the period 1969-1975:

Of the

$28,500, $27,667 can be paid for out of the FY1971 unobli

preferably could be incorporated

cration by the Countcrintelligence Staff..

If approved, these

transactions would represent a fulfillment of all commitments to

Mir. Nosenko as of this date and would sorve to fulfill outstanding

Nosenko prioi to his transfer to the

Direcior of Central Intelligence; this action is contzined iu

2. Mr. Yuriy Ivanovich Nosenko, a 45-year-old, foriaer

USSR, attended the Institute of lnternational Relatiors, Moscow,

from 1915 to 1950; was affiliated with Russian Naval Intelligence

4. In the early debriefing of Mi. Nosenio, it became

apparent that he was a parucularly complex individual. To permit

expensive and prolonged debriefing, arrangements were made to

accommodate MI. Nosenko under highly sacure conditions at

ISOLATION, where he remained from 1964 to 1967. These tight

security arrangements were dictated,, during the initial phases at

least, by the additional need to provide Mr. Nosenko with

continuing personal protection, since there was the distinct

possibility that he would be targeted for execution if the Soviets

should discover his whereabouts.

5. Since October 1967, the primary responsibility for Mr,

Nosenko has been in the Office of Security, which conducted a

thorough review of prior developments in the case. Mi. Nosenko

was moved to the 'Washington, D. C. area in late 1967, and the

case passed through various stages of phased normalization, as

he was given an increased degree of freedom and independence.

MI. Nosenko was actually resettled on the economy in April 1969;

he obtained a divorce from his former Soviet spouse in Septernber

1969; and he later married an American girl in October 1969.

During the period from October 1967 to April 1969, Mr. Nosenko

did not receive a salary, but he was provided with a moderate

amount of spending money.

6. As of April 1969, MI. Nosenko signed a one-year

contractual agreement for $16, 500. 00, including a clause giving

assistznce to him in resettlement expenses in the amount.of

$8, 000.00. In March 1970, Mr. Nosenko signed a new contract

for tro years at $18, 500.00 per annum. At about this same time

he was provided with certain financial assistance, $20, 000.00

being for the down payment on a new house, and $5, 000.00 for

othes related household expenses. Mr. Nosenko's contract vas

renewed at the new iate of $19, 500. 00 per annum on i March 1371,

aud the contract was again renewed in February 1972. ai the sclary

0£ $21, 000.00 per annum,

?. in analysis of this case clearly indicates fat ir.

Nosenio has been an extremely valuable source, one who has

idenated many hundreds of Soviet Intelligence Officers, and ne

has otherwise provided a considerable quantity of useful information

on the organization of the KGB, its operational doctrine, and

methods. At least a thousand formal memoranda have been

forwarded to the Federal Bureau of Investigation based on dat

from Mi. Nosenko. He has conducted numerous special security

reviews on Soviet subjects of specific intelligence interest, and

he lias proven himself to be invaluable in expioring counterintelli-

gence leads. He recently authored a book which is of interest to

the Agency. In effect, Mx. Nosenko has shown himself to be a

Productive and hard working defector, who is "rehabilitated" and

favorably disposed towards the Agency.

8.

In the course of a recent meeting with Mi. Nosenko,

he brought up the subject of his missing salary, covering the

pe:1oa from April 190÷ to March 1969 Mr. Nosenko readily

admitted that be. is living very well at the present time, but he

is not in a position to save any moxey for the future. He also

expressed deep appreciation to the Agency ior the financial

assistance which was provided him through the years, and he

considers this to have cancelled out the original Agency

obligation of a lump sum payment in the amount of $50, 000.00.

ivir. Nosenko, however, still feels quite strongly that he is

entitled to be reimbursed for the salary which the Agenay did

not provide him over a five-year period. He understands, of

course, inat income tax would have to be deducted from this

back salary of $25, 000. 00 per annum.

9. In summary, the original oral agreement with IMr.

Nosenko is fully documented and supports his claim; his resettie-

ment since 1967 has been relatively smooth, with no significant

security problems having developed; and he continues to function

at the present time as a highly productive and useful source of

information on the KGB. In view of these various considerations,

it is requested thai this payment of $125, 000,00 to MI. Nosenko

be approved. These funds would be paid out of unliquidated

ohligations applicable io lapsed appropriations (Fiscal Year 1970

and prior years--"y" Account).
