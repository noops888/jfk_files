to be something incomplate with that answar of mine, however.

there is no question in reading the documents that I road this

morning, which I had not seen in the batter part of fifteen

years, that a man did go out from Headquartars and was provide

with material which you mentioned and had a discussion along

these lines with the Chlot of station.

lie did not, howevar, go out with instructione to the Chief

of Station without furthar rafarance to Headquartara to set

about assassinating Lumumba.

Mr. Baron. In your answors that we have just reviewed in

your first examination, you indicated that you had no knowlerus

of a mission by Dr. Gottliab to the Congo and that there was

nothins in your experience in the Agency that would really bear

on the question whather such a mission was undertaken or what

the character of it was.

Has the review of the documents torlay refreshed your

I was marely tolling you, at that time, what I could

Mr. Baron. To move to the parlod when you ware Chlet of

tho Africa Division and Richard Bissell was DDP in the summer

6

of 1960, did you have conversations with Richard Biasell where

7

the subject of the assassination of lumumba aroso?

8

MI. Twoody, Yas, I did, In lace, the first conversation,

9

as I racall it, that I ever had on the subject was one he

1.:

initiated with me, and, as I think i told you, i do not recall

-.-

oxactly what was said, but there was no question about lt but.

what Mr, Bissall was saying to me was that there was agreement.

:: ¡ policy agrooment in Washinaton, that Lumumba must be remover

from the position of control and influance in the congo or that

:: l the Corgo was going to be in serious trouble and thus Africa,

at that stage of its development; and that among the possibil

i:: ities of that elimination was indeed assassination.

In tarms of the dotail of that conversation with Mr. Hissell.

Ms. Dallas, which implind to me there was pollay agreement in

Washington. When I say polley agreement in Washington, I cannot

ba more specific because I navar knew any more specificity. '

however, 'it was perfectly clear that the Agancy felt that it

had some aort of policy consensus in Hashington about the need

for the removal of Lumumba. When I aay removal, I mean by

whataver means; this does not necessailly have to be confined

to assassination, a political way of doing it, or anythin

alas.

Mr. Baron. It did not exclude

assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. No, indeed it did not.

MI, Baron. You are referring to the cable of luaust lath

from Allan Dullas to the Chief of Station in tho Condo. llar

Mr. Baron. In your talke with Mr. Dissell, where the

subjact of the assassination of Lumumba was raisod in any

5

fashion. did Mr. Biasell move

from this general laformition

6

to you that the subject had been opened at very high lavels

to asking you to procoad to axplore means to getting access to

6

Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him?

Mr, Tweedy. The purpose of his conversation with me was

to Initlate correspondence with the station for them to explore

:: with Headquarters the possibility

of this, that la assassina

tion, or irdead

any other means of ramoving Lumumba trom power.

:: In other words, the purpose of thei

exercise was to tall the

:: Station what Headquarters had in mind, aiving it some idea o!

::' the policy hackground

of it, and than to have the station

start roviowing possibilitias, assets, and discussing them with

i: Headquarters ir detail in the same way that we would with any

:overation, whether it was as sensitive as this, or loss so.

It was, in other words, the initiation of quite normal

: operational dialoque between loadquarters and the field, apar:

from the fact that it was

an unusual subiact.

Mr. Baron. At some noint after the serias of conversations

:. With Richard Bissell, did you have a conversation with slanes

Mr. Baron. As best you can recall, what instructions 11d

Mr. Tweedy. This is very general, but I think it covers

injit: to assist the Chief of Station In his operational plannino.

¡ for this particular purpose.

MI. Baron. Would that plannina have included plannina for

MI. Tweady, Specifically, I do not think Dr rottria!!

would have beon there to discuss Constitutional means of over-

throw of Lumumba. He was there for one purpose only, He las

a tochnician. Ha had this material with him. He was thus

Having reviewed this cable early thla morning, is it your

MI. Tweedy, Yes, I do.

5

Mr. Baron. That this was a report from the Chief of

station to yoursalf informing you that the top priority plan would

6

be to recall an agent from Stanleyville and ask that agent to

infiltrate the entourage of Lumumba where he could assess the

MI. Tready, That was one of the things that was being

explored. The other thing explored and constantly under review

was the whole altuation of Lumumba and were there other alter-

7

Mr. Baron. Turning now to Tab 9 of tha Senator'a books,

8

this is the cable of Octobar I which you received in the fyes

lie was to continue, in your mind, at least up

until the point where he had determined there was a leasible

6

means of assasainating Lumumba?

7

Would that be correct?

8

Mr. Tweedy, I would put it more broadly than that. I

would say that he was to continue to explore it to determine

whather or not there was a feasible means.

He perfectly well

axpariance, what you think aa a professlonal of the men in tha

CIA, man and women?

IT. Tweedy, I came away from a carear in intelligence in

March of 'y3 with rather strong convictions. I might preface

my remarks here in answer to your question, Sanator, by saying

I was in intelligence during the War, I was in Naval Intall1-

8

gance. This was not oss, but I was in Intellinence. It alao

determined mo, ll the circumstances permitted, to make a

of making the right contacts and so on ard so forth, aventual!:

:. it worked and I apert a career in CIA.

I have two vary strong impressions o! that exparience.

i: Ouo of them has to do with my colleagues, the personnel of the

1:, " agency, who I found to be a remarkably talented aroup.

The

16

second was, and it was something that I think all of us were

have gone over today. As you have reviewad them and as you

recall this timeframe, and giviny un

some assistance in Inter-

prating what the documents say, is there any other matter that

bears on the question of the discussions surrounding the

Lumumba casé that we have not gone into that have come to mind

as you think about the circumstances of this case that you think

will bo holpful to this committos in understanding, lf you will,

both the question of the flow of authority and indoed the scous

of what was intended?

Mr. Twoody. From the time that this was flagt broached in

¿ï me by 1r. Bissell, I do not bolinva I discusged this matter

1: i

with anybody aise but Mr. Rissoll, cartainly Mr. Gottleb

" he wart out on this trips certainly now that t've been reninder

1i

of his tasking by Mr. Bissall, Mr. D'DOnnell; obvlously, the

i:' Chief of station; and my Dabutv.

1:-

I sover discussed it over with Mr. Helms. I suppose i

!: did discuss it with Me, Dulles. I think it was much more that

i 1 knew perfectly well that mr. Dulles was familiar with it

i rather than I sctually had any conversation with Mr. Dullys on

2: it. 1 think those were all conducted by Mr. Rissell and passe!

i: down to me. I do not think I probably had any.

Ir. Smothers. Let mo understand the reference to Mr.

a @Donnell? Are you saying you probably discussed it with him?

MI. Tweedy. No, I think probably I did not directly, I

was perfactly aware of hia knowledge of it, but at thin point

I cannot recall having discussed it with him.

To put it diffarently, thare was no reason for me to,

because I would have had nothing to say to him that I way not

saying to Mi. Blasell, who in turn would have passed it to

MI. Dulles, as he aaw fit. And in any event, that tnleas

Invited by Mr. Dullas, I would not have jumped the chain of

command.

Mr. Smothars, I have nothing further.

Sanator Huddlaston. Mr. Schwarz?

Mr. Schwarz. This 1s the only killing ineident you know

of?

MI. Twoody. The only killing incident I know of. It 1s

the only question of assassination which (a) I knew of, or (hy

1 have avor played any role in.

Mr. Schwarz. You refer to the special channel of cable.

the FOBROP.

Did you ever use the YOprop in any other operation?

tion. He could have attomptad to assassinate 500, 100 peopir

MI. Tweedy, I will not gainsay them, but I think thay are

not think it had anything to do -

Mr. Kirbow, You were Chief of the Africa Divialon?

Mr. Tweedy, I do not think it had anythina to do whatsoever

Mr. Schwarz. Both In the sense that this is the only

special treatment of tho cablas, it was a matter of signifar:

::' Mr. Tweedy, Yes, it was a matter of stonificant importance.
