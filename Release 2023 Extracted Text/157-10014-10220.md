MEMORANDUM FOR: The Review Staff

VIA

SUBJECT

: Deputy Director for Administration

: Senate Select Committee Request

(Jack Anderson)

--

1.

Reference is made to a request from The Honorable

Howard H. Baker, Jr:, United States Senate, (Review Staff

75-3115) for clarification regarding a missing copy of a black

briefing notebook concerning the surveillance of Mr. Jack

Anderson.

Reference

is further made to a previous memorandum

from the

which

Director of Security (0S 5 8665) dated 2 October 1975,

responded to several

questions posed by Senator Baker

concerning

Mr. Jack Anderson.,

2. The black briefing folders referred to by Senator Baker

were prepared shortly before the Office of Security initiated

surveillance coverage of Mr. Anderson and his associates.

At

the time of their original preparation, a total of six (6) black

briefing notebooks were created.

These

six black briefing note-

books were labeled as follows:

Headquarters one of three;

leadquarters two of three; Headquarters three of three: Wash.

ington Field Office one of three; Washington Field Office two

of three; and Washington Field Office three of three.

The three

Headquarters copies were maintained in Headquarters while the

three

field office copies

were retained by the Office of Security's

Washington Field Office.

3.

The six briefing notebooks were created for the sole

purpose of maintaining a ready reference by both Headquarters

and the Washington Field Office from which to brief those Agency

employees involved regarding the background and status of the.

Jack Anderson case.

It is extremely important to note that the

six briefing folders were intended to remain as exact duplicates

of one another; and when created they were duplicates. As the

surveillance of Mr. Anderson progressed, weekly surveillance

summaries and other data pertaining to the case were written

and were filed within the master copy of the briefing notebooks.

The master copy is labeled "Headquarters one of three" and was

kept current as

the weekly surveillance summaries were prepared.

The copies of the weekly surveillance summaries which

were written were

also intended to be filed within the remaining

five (5) copies of the briefing notebooks (two at Headquarters

and three at the Washington Field Office). In practice, however,

the remaining five copies were not kept current with the Head-

quarters master

copy (Headquarters one of three) apparently due

to the press of business.

None of the black briefing notebooks

would have contained information not found within the master

copy, and, in

fact, the remaining copies contain considerably

less information than the master copy.

5. At the present time,

the Office of Security can account

for only three of the black briefing folders.

The three folders

which are accounted for (Headquarters one of three, Headquarters

two of three, and Washington Field Office

one of three) were

reviewed by Senator Baker on 29 September 1975.

Extensive

attempts

to locate the three missing black briefing notebooks

have met with negative results.

In addition to conducting a

thorough physical search for the missing three copies, the

three current Office

of Security employees who would be the most

knowledgeable concerning these notebooks were interviewed.

three employees (Mr. Curtis R. Rivers, Mr. Thomas J. Sweeney,

and Mr. John B. Cryer) cannot specifically recall the disposition

of the notebooks; however, all three employees speculate that the

three missing copies were probably destroyed sometime following

the termination of the

surveillance of Mr. Anderson, in view of

the fact that the missing notebooks were simply incomplete copies

of those notebooks presently on hand.

6. While the three current employees referred to above

cannot recall the disposition of the missing three notebooks,

they are familiar with the content and purpose of the notebooks.

These three employees are readily available should Senator Baker

wish to interview them concerning the notebooks. It should be

noted that Mr. John K. Hutchinson, former Assistant Special Agent

in Charge, Washington Field Office, who is now retired, would

In Senator Baker's referenced request, the briefing

notebooks

are referred to as a "three-volume set." It is

emphasized that although there were three

Field Office, none of these volumes were sequential in nature
