Mrs. Anna Tarasoff
2819 Gainesville Street, S.E., Apt. 202
Washington, D.C.
Dear Mrs. Tarasoff:
We wish to inform you that the preliminary processing of
your application has been accomplished and that you may enter
on duty immediately on a temporary basis at Grade GS-4, sal-
ary $3415.00 per annum as Clerk.
Your temporary appointment will be subject to taking an
oath of office, signing a loyalty affidavit, and completing a med-
ical examination which will include determination of physical
health and emotional stability. If you enter on duty based on this
preliminary processing, you will be assigned to the Interim Assign-
ment Section pending the completion of the full processing and a
final security interview. The Interim Assignment Section is a
"pool" where you will be doing clerical work of a routine nature.
Should anything of an unfavorable nature arise during this period,
your employment will not result in a permanent appointment; other-
wise you then will be placed on duty in the position for which em-
ployed.
If you are interested in this temporary position please call
Mrs. Sandra Finci on Executive 3-6115, extension 2781, as soon
as possible to advise her of the exact date you will report. We
would appreciate your selecting a Monday. You may prefer to await
the completion of the full processing: which will require about 60 to
90 more days. In any event we would appreciate your calling Mrs.
Finci promptly and informing her of your plans. In the meantime,
it is requested that you submit three passport-size photographs of
yourself as soon as possible.
Please report to the Receptionist at Curie Hall at 8:15 a.m.
and ask for Mrs. Finci on the reporting-for-duty date that you
establish with this office. Curie Hall is located at the intersection
of 23rd Street, Independence Avenue and Ohio Drive, S.W., with
entrance on Ohio Drive.
14-00000
Employees of this Agency are entitled to the regular United
States Government leave and retirement benefits.
The gross salary quoted will be subject to deductions for
Federal income tax and 6 percent for the United States Civil
Service Retirement Fund. In addition, the benefits of low-cost
group life insurance are available to Federal civilian employees.
The enclosed pamphlet outlines the features of the program and
lists the amount which will be deducted from your salary each pay
period for this term insurance. This insurance is not obligatory.
However, if you do not wish coverage, which is automatic, you
should sign a Waiver of Life Insurance Coverage form at the time
you enter on duty.
You will not receive a pay check for approximately four
weeks after you enter on duty.
If you have any problems, Mrs. Finci will be glad to discuss
them with you when you call.
Very truly yours,
G. M. Stewart
Director of Personnel

EVALUATION AND BACKGROUND DATA (Include education and work experience)
Miss Tarasoff is the wife of Boris Tarasoff, FDD employee. She first made application
shortly after her husband's EOD while she and the children were still in California.
Attempts to have her tested and interviewed on the West Coast were unsuccessful.
The family is all now gathered in D.C.; the children are in school; arrangements
have been made for the care of the children during the lags between the end of
the school day and the end of the parents work day.
Test results are very interesting. It would appear that Mrs. Tarasoff should be
able to do a most adequate job in a clerical job of the most deadly routine nature.
I'm quite sure such positions are available in the Agency.
Mrs. Tarasoff apparently has a reasonably good command of Russian, both spoken and
written; I gathered that some of the household conversation is carried on in that
language. HOWEVER, I gave her absolutely no assurance that we would be able to
utilize this skill.
She is interested in employment as soon as possible and I discussed an Indices
Clearance with her. The Pool, the temporary indefinite appointment, et al. were
described in lurid detail. She is willing and interested.
Personally, I found Mrs. Tarasoff to be a very pleasant little woman. She is slight
and slender with reddish hair; smiles easily and appears as easy to work with.
GS-4 Clerk agreeable and recommended.

EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION
After my discussion with the field representative, I wish to acknowledge the existence
of the following conditions of employment:
A. Qualifications:
(1) Upon my arrival in Washington I understand I will be tested to determine
(a) my general aptitude; (b) my typing skill if I am being considered for a
typing position, the minimum standards for which are 40 words per minute net
speed; (c) my stenographic skill if I am being considered for a stenographic
or secretarial position, the minimum standards for which are 80 words per
minute accurate transcription with at least 40 words per minute net typing
speed.
(2) I understand that should I fail to meet the minimum standards as outlined
above I will be given an opportunity to receive refresher training. As soon
as I am able to meet the prescribed standards I will then be assigned to a
position within the organization. If, within a reasonable period of time, I
should fail to meet the minimum skills requirements, I understand that I will
be assigned to a position not requiring specific skills if such a position
exists. (For example: An individual initially selected as a Clerk-Typist
who is not able to qualify fully as a typist would be assigned to any avail-
able clerical position.)
B. Initial Placement:
I understand there are initial placement procedures, including the testing
and refresher training outlined above, that may require a period of several
weeks before I am given my specific job assignment. I have had explained
to me the operations of the interim assignment group where I may expect to
receive the testing and refresher training mentioned and where I will work
pending my specific job assignment.
C. Overseas Possibilities:
(1) I have not been promised an overseas assignment. I understand I must dem-
onstrate fully my abilities while on a Washington, D.C. assignment after
which I may be considered for whatever positions may exist for which I am
qualified. The decision to assign me to an overseas post rests with respon-
sible individuals in the Washington office.
(2) I understand that from past experience of the organization I may expect to
remain on a Washington assignment from 1½ to 2 years before I may be consid-
ered for an overseas post.
(3) I understand that overseas assignments in the clerical and general adminis-
trative categories require, for most positions, typing and stenographic
skills.
D. General:
I understand that any eventual assignment to a professional type position, if
I am qualified for such by specific education, training, or experience, will
depend upon the existence of a suitable vacancy and that no promises to the
contrary have been made to me.

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY
WASHINGTON 25, D.C.
Applicant Information
Sheet No. 1
To all persons applying for employment
with the Central Intelligence Agency:
This paper is the first step in applying for employment or consultant
status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed
beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the
conditions stated below:
General Considerations:
1. The National Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th
Congress) which created the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the
Agency the responsibility:
a. "to advise the National Security Council in matters concerning
such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies
as relate to the national security;
b. "to make recommendations to the National Security Council
for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-
ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national
security;
c. "to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the
national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination
of such intelligence within the Government...;
d. "to perform, for the benefit of the existing intelligence
agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National
Security Council determines can be more efficiently accomplished
centrally;
e. "to perform such other functions and duties related to
intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security
Council may from time to time direct."
The special character of this national responsibility requires the Agency
to maintain correspondingly special employment criteria which may be
different from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern-
ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive res-
ponsibility borne by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the
investigation of applicants prerequisite to their acceptance is a time-
consuming process which, in addition to loyalty and security checks,
includes evaluation of competence, physical and emotional fitness, and
availability of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.
This is called "clearance" of an applicant.
2. Investigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents
his clearance perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware,
perhaps something which only the special employment criteria of the Agency
make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-
clusive and final so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of
specific reasons is made to the applicant.
3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon
which an applicant can insist. Offer of employment which is subject to full
clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an
unsuccessful applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency. Acceptance
of employment upon the condition of clearance is at the applicant's risk,
taken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants
are not cleared.
Statement of Understanding and Agreement
I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Consid-
erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence
Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-
erations.
I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2.
