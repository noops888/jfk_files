DISTRIBUTION IS GENERAL AS THEY ARE CONSTANTLY MOVING ABOUT IN

SMALL MOBILE UNITS AND SHIFTING THEIR BASE LOCATIONS. A FRENCH

•OFFICER, FNU BARON, WHO FORMERLY SERVED IN INDOCHINA BUT NEVER

IN ALGERIA. HAS BEEN GIVEN OVERALL COMMAND OF MERCENARIES. ALTHOUGH

HIS HEADQUARTERS IS IN KIPUSHI, HE IS NOW SPENDING MOST OF HIS TIME

TRAVELLING ABOUT KATANGA INSPECTING HIS COLLEAGUES AND TRYING TO

CONSOLIDATE HIS COMMAND STATUS (FIELD COMMENT: ACE 673 REPORTED

A FRENCH COLONEL GARDY, WHO MAY ACTUALLY BE THE SAME MAN AS

"BARON", HAD BEEN PROPOSED FOR THIS FUNCTION. QUE TO THE BITTER

• JEALOUSIES BETWEEN THE VARIOUS NATIONAL GROUPS, IT IS NOT SURPRISING

THAT THE "COMMANDER" MUST GIVE HIS ATTENTION TO PERSUADING HIS

COLLEAGUES TO ACCEPT HIM AS THEIR LEADER). JOSEPH SMAL, BELGIAN

DRESSED IN MERCENARY UNIFORM HOLDING A BOMB NEXT TO A KATANGA

MILITARY AIRCRAFT. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BAR HE KEEPS A PICTURE

OF BARON. MORALE AMONG TRUE MERCENARIES AND EUROPEAN VOLUNTEERS IS

CURRENTLY HIGH: THEY SUPPORT TSHOMBE WITH NO RESERVATIONS AND ARE

CONFIDENT THEY CAN SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND KATANGA AGAINST UN OR CNA

ATTACK.

6. THE PRESENT ACCENT WITHIN THE KATANGA AIR FORCE (KAF) IS ON

TACTICAL USE OF PREDOMINANTLY SMALL AIRCRAFT. KAF STRATEGISTS

VIEW JET AIRCRAFT AS TOO FAST FOR A SMALL COUNTRY LIKE KATANGA;

ALSO KATANGA CAN NEVER HOPE TO MATCH JETS AVAILABLE TO THE UN WHICH

CAN APPEAL TO THE WHOLE WORLO FOR REINFORCEMENTS IN EVENT ITS

SUPERIORITY IN NUMBERS WAS CHALLENGED. THE KAF VIEWS ITS EXPERIENCE

WITH SMALL AIRCRAFT DURING THE DECEMBER FIGHTING AS USEFUL; IT

WAS ABLE TO DROP SMALL BOMBS EFFECTIVELY FROM LOW ALTITUDES AND

OUTMANEUVER UN JETS. THE KAF PRESENTLY HAS THREE DOVES AND IS

TRYING TO GET MORE (FIELD COMMENT:. ACE 673 ALSO REPORTED TWO OR

MORE DE. HAVILLAND DOVE TWIN-ENGINE UTILITY TRANSPORTS AVAILABLE TO

THE KAF). IT IS ALSO TRYING TO ACQUIRE MORE SMALL PLANES. PAUL

KOLWEZI AIRPORTS; THE KAF ALSO DEPENDS HEAVILY ON USE OF NUMEROUS

SMALL GRAVEL AND SAND-SURFACED AIRSTRIPS LOCATED IN THE BUSH

THROUGHOUT KATANGA. IT DEPENDS PRIMARILY ON THE UNION MINTERE DU.

HAUT KATANGA (UMHK) WORKSHOPS AT JADOTVILLE TO FABRICATE, REPAIR

ANOTHER IS INSTALLED IN AN: AMBULANCE EQUIPPED WITH A LARGE AERIAL

JUST OUTSIDE KIPUSHI: AFRICAN SOLDIERS WERE OPERATING BOTH. THE

DEFENSE MINISTRY HOPES TO BE ABLE IN CASE OF HOSTILITIES TO MAKE

USE OF KATANGA CIVIL AND UMHK TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES BUT

EXPECTS' THE UN WILL IMMEDIATELY CAPTURE OR RENDER THESE USELESS AS

A PRIME MILITARY OBJECTIVE. THE MINISTRY HOWEVER IS COUNTING

HEAVILY ON UMHK WIRELESS AND SIGNALS COOPERATION OUTSIDE ELISABETH-

VILLE IN AREAS NOT CONTROLLED BY THE UN. A STRONG INTERNATIONAL

WIRELESS FACILITY HAS BEEN INSTALLED IN KOLWEZI: IT IS IN DIRECT.

STRONG CONTACT WITH KATANGA REPRESENTATIVES IN BRAZZAVILLE AND WILL

BE USED AS THE GOK'S MAIN POINT. OF CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD.

8. ARMY STRATEGISTS BELIEVE THE RHODESIAN AND SOUTH AFRICAN

GOVERNMENTS WISH TO HELP KATANGA MILITARILY BUT ARE UNABLE TO DO

SO OPENLY AND DIRECTLY. THEREFORE THE ARM, WITH GOK COOPERATION.

IS SEEKING BUSINESSMEN FROM THOSE COUNTRIES WHO CAN SETTLE

TEMPORARILY IN KATANGA AND ACT AS INTERMEDIARIES IN BUYING AND

SELLING MILITARY ITEMS AS THEIR OWN PROPERTY. GIRON IS THIS TYPE

OF AGENT. THE ARMY HOPES TO OBTAIN ARMS, AMMUNITION AND AIRCRAFT

FROM RHODESIA AND SOUTH AFRICA THROUGH THESE BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES.

ITS INSTALLATIONS HAS OVERT AND COVERT ASPECTS. UNIFORMED AFRICAN

INTENDS TO IMPLEMENT THIS PLAN IF IT FEELS FORCED TO DO SO, THE GOK

SEES NO NEED AND SO HAS NOT PLACED GUARDS ON THE DAMS. MERCENARIES

PRIVATELY ASSERT THEY COULD ALSO EASILY DESTROY ALL UMHK MINES

DESPITE UMHK OBJECTIONS. HOWEVER THEY AGREE WITH THE WISDOM OF THE

GOK PLAN BECAUSE THEY HOPE TO EVENTUALLY BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE A PEACE

SETTLEMENT WITH THE UN AND REALIZE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE LITTLE

WITH WHICH TO BARGAIN WERE UMHK ASSETS GONE.

11: ACCORDING TO A DEFENSE MINISTRY OFFICIAL, ARMY TACTICS

IN TIME OF HOT WAR WITH THE UN WILL BE TO FORGET ABOUT ELISABETH-

VILLE WHICH IT DOES NOT WISH DESTROYED AND WHICH IS DIFFICULT... TO

DEFEND. INSTEAD ALL ROADS AND BRIDGES OUTSIDE THE CAPITAL WILL BE

DESTROYED.. THEY HAVE ALREADY BEEN MINED AND CAN BE QUICKLY BLOWN

UP. THE ACCENT IN ALL ARMY TRAINING SCHOOLS IS ON MAQUIS WARFARE

AND GUERRILLA TACTICS. ARMY LEADERS ARE CONFIDENT THEIR TROOPS

FIGHTING FROM. THE BUSH, FROM AMBUSHES AND FROM EVERY TREE TOP, CAN

ACTUALLY DESTROY UN FORCES WITHIN A SHORT TIME SHOULD LATTER COME

OUTSIDE OF ELISABETHVILLE. THE ARMY IS ALSO PREPARING ITSELF FOR
