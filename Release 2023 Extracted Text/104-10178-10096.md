MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Luda Clementa POSADA-Carriles

REFERENCES: 2. Memo for Rocord, 26 June 1967, by LRH,

samo subjoct

•. Williamson/Henso Telephone Conversation

28 June 1967

1. In my meeting with the Department of Justice today, 1

confirmed that POSADA-Carriles was our man. I outlined the pro-

liminary information we had developed on the transactiona between

him and one Lefty Rosenthal.

2. Justice was advised that our information discloaed that

POSADA-Carriles had passed stlencers and grenades, to Rosenthal

during July 1965, and that in October 1966 he had furnished pencils

and fuses. I also stated that it was our understanding that POSADA-

Carriles was in contact with FDI/Mlami and that it had been adviaed

of these dealings. Juitice was told that the items involved were not

of Agency origin. It was emphasized, however, that this was our

preliminary conclusion and that we would undertake to verify it.

3. Justice acknowledged that FBI reporting disclosed

POSADA-Carriles as lts contact but apparoutly the details are some -

what vague. To make a lederal case against Roderthal because of his

suspected Involvement in the bombings, is will be necessary to show

that the iteme used were obtained through interstate commerce. A

preliminary reading suggests prosecution under Title i8 Section 337.

Out of concern for the allegation of entrapient, Juntice asked that

ma supply assurera to the following: (a) did POSADA-CarTlOa

volunteer blesalt so the FBI or did it approsch him initially:

- (0) who intoraad ibe FBl of the July 1965 doal - tho Agency or

¡POSADA-Cartilei; (e) 00 what date was thia information givan:

fd) dimilarly as regarde tho October 1966 transacilos, the dato

the information furnished and by whom; (e) what were POSADA-

Capriles courced for the isema or their componenta; (f) were

those: soürces within or without the State of Florida? And inclo

dentally were to awaro that supposedly POSADA-Carrilos realiser

a "profit" for furalähing the October 1966 iseme and that he tolod

without succeas to turn it into tha "company"? While I agreed to

undertake to astain the information rnquested, I suggosted that

much of it mig's be readily avallable from the FBI. Justice cos-

coded this and lasenda to have further discussions with is.

B. Daring the couras of the meeting the interesting

hypotheria was suggedred to the effect that POSADA-Cartiles

might have brea "moonlighting" for Rosenthal, and only when ho

began to feel lie pressure did he start reporting to the Agency and

5. Uoder etriclly controlled conditions with POSADA-

Carriles acting as a conduis, Justice is considering the possibility

of assloting Rosenthal to obtain his needed items, whereupon he

will be arrested immediately for possession. I told them while we

might be williag to have POSADA-Cartiles so used we were under-

standably concerood over the adverse comment thai our employso'8

involvemens could generato.

6. Oe a raatter that may be related: one Alhert LARRAIN

Nisestro la alleged to have admitted to POSADA-Carrilos that he has

been involved in the bomblage with Rosenthal and to have said more

axplosives were seodoi. LARiAIN Maestre is a luzitive under a

•sarcotics endietent having formerly resided at 153 East 57th Struet,

New York, New York. Do we have any information on this person?
