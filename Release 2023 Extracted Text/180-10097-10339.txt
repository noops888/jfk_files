The significant questions and answers of the interview
are as follows:
Ω.
What were your duties and responsibilities as Chief
of Soviet Operations with the CIA during the period
1954 until 1962?
A.
Responsibility for Soviet operations, programs, policy
and personnel.
Ω.
Did you direct all programs within that geographical
A.
Q.
A.
area?
Not entirely.
I had knowledge of all programs. How-
ever, some were administered by other divisions. An
example would be the U-2 program.
Did you ever hear the name of Lee Harvey Oswald prior
to the assassination of John F. Kennedy?
I do not remember hearing or seeing the name prior to
the assassination of President Kennedy. However, it
is possible as I was usually provided a list of
American defectors.
Ω.
You do not remember seeing the name Lee Harvey Oswald
7
on the defector list.
A.
No.
Ω.
Were any Intelligence projects in operation in 1959-62
involving the use of American defectors in the Soviet
Union?
A.
Not to my knowledge.
However, Central Intelligence
might have run a deception operation.

Q.
How was information gathered on American defectors in
the Soviet Union during that period?
A.
Information is obtained, if possible, from sources
and assets within the country.
Q.
What sources did you have within Russia at that time?
A.
We only had one or two CIA people at the American
Embassy at that time and they were under very deep
cover. They did utilize third country nationals as
sources..specifically, third country journalists.
Q.
Did you ever use American journalists or State Depart-
ment or Embassy personnel?
A.
Not to my recollection.
Q.
Do you know Priscilla Johnson McMillan?
A.
No.
Q.
Do you know Alexis Davison?
A.
No. Who was he? If you could tell me something about
him, I may recall.
Q.
Are you familiar with the Penkovsky case?
A.
Yes.
Q.
Was Davison used as a cut-out for communication with
Penkovsky?
A.
No, now I remember. He was the Embassy doctor.
was not the regular contact. If he was co-opted by
Davison
the CIA, it was an emergency situation.
Q.
Was Davison declared persona non grata by the Russian
government because of his assistance in the Perkovsky
case?

A.
I am not sure. He may have been. I just do not
remember.
Q.
Was Davison co-opted by the CIA to establish contact
with Lee Harvey Oswald?
A.
No not to my knowledge. Lee Harvey Oswald was not
a CIA agent or source.
Ω.
Would you have known it if another Division in CIA
was using Lee Harvey Oswald?
A.
I think I would have been informed. I certainly would
have known about it at a later date. There is no way
the CIA could have kept something like that a secret
for this long a period without the information circu-
lating in CIA circles.
Ω.
Was any intelligence ever developed during this period
of time about a possible threat to Presidents Kennedy
or Eisenhower involving the Soviets?
A.
No.
However, I do remember hearing about threats to
Kennedy after the Bay of Pigs. I placed no evidence
to the stories.
Q.
Do you remember who told you about the threats?
A.
No.
Q.
What type of analysis or evaluation was conducted
after Powers' U-2 was shot down in the Soviet Union?
A.
I believe that the story Powers told was the truth.

Q.
The Bartleman Board was established and had hearings
on the subject. Perkovsky verified the conclusions
of the Board.
Q.
Would Lee Harvey Oswald have knowledge of the U-2 pro-
gram as reaio-radar operator at the Naval Base at
Atsugi?
A.
He would not.
Q.
What was the scope and focus of KGB recruitment of
Americans in Moscow during the period of time that LHO
was in the Soviet Union?
A.
Anybody they could get.
Q.
Did the KGB contact Lee Harvey Oswald?
A.
They probably did.
Q.
Did the CIA have access to any KGB personnel during
1959-1962?
A.
We did, but I don't remember their names at this time.
We had Penkovsky and Popov; however, they were both
GRU (Russian Military Intelligence).
Q.
What conclusions were drawn about damage to the Soviets
after Golitsin's defection?
A.
Immediately after Golitson's defection, he gave us
the identity of KGB personnel conducting espionage
operations. His information was very valuable. However,
the value of his information decreased greatly thereafter.
Angleton sincerely believed in Golitsin's bona fides.
Golitsän was one of the very few Soviet defectors that
Angleton did not think was a double agent.

Q.
Do you think Nosenko was a double agent?
A.
I don't know. Just because Nosenko lied about his
rank and his involvement with the KGB does not neces-
sarily mean he was a double agent. Most defectors
lie about the value and amount of information they
possess to obtain your support and assistance.
Nosenko may not have been aware of KGB activity which
may have been conducted by the KGB personnel under
the First Secretariat.
Nosenko was under the second
Secretariat which dealt with internal intelligence,
but not foreign intelligence.
The above questions and answers were paraphrased by
the writer and they are not necessarily in the order asked or given.
However, the meaning is unchanged.
