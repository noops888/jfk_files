DETAILS:

SEGRETI

wx.

Morriman Smith,

sentor White House correspondent,

reported Garrison alleges David William Terrie was associated

with a group of anti-Castro Cubans which trained at lake

Pontchartrain,

Louistana, during the pertod 1961-1962.L On

Tobruary 23, 1961, CIA confidentially informed this Bureau

that in connection with a sensitive CIA project directed

against Cuba, one phase of which tnvolved the training of

Cuban extles, CIA would initdate a training operation at

(Camp Belle Chese, located a short distance south of New Orleans

and Lake Pontchartrain. CIA advised that this camp had been

a deactivated Naval base but would be reopened by CIA under a

Department of Army cover. CIA further advised it would be

training from 15 to 40 Cubans at a time for a period of about

ive weeks.

We, of course, did not investigate CIA'e activittes

at Comp Belle Chase, Louisiana, and ow tiles contain no

information that David Willian

Perrie had any connection with

this CIA operation.

In July,

1963,

we received information from several

sources that a number of Cuban refugees had come to New Orleans

from Mant, Florida,

through the offorts of Rudolph Davis,

reportedly

to attend a training camp after which they would be

sent to a training camp in Guatemala.

Sources reported this

group became disenchantod

and returned to Miant shortly after

thelr arrival.

We interviewed Rudolph Davis in this matter and he

indicated he seted as a coordinator between the Movimiento

Democratica Cristiano

(mC), an anti-Castro organtzation and

the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the

delegate for this anti-Castro organization in New Orleans.

stated he came to New Orleans in Auguet, 136%y and an early

1963 made Intends with persons in the lumber business in

Guatemala with whom he formed the Cuatemalan Lumber and Mineral

Corporation.

Davis said he brought appronimately 19 men to

New Orleans

to train for lumber cutting work in Guatemala,

added that when the men learned they wore to work in a lumber

industry and were not recruited for military operations against

Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami:

Our

11 les

contain no information indicating that David William

Ferrte or lee Harvey Oswald had any contact or connection with

Davis or the anti-Castro organization which Davis represented. U
