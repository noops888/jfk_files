DurIag PAUPEROS' TDY at Headquarters se discussed the

necessity of having QRPHONE/l undergo an intergire seven day

STrAINLAL training progran to be conducted by DAITCHMAN. It 18

our opiaton that in order for this tralning to be ol saxinum

benefit, QRPHONE/1 and DAITCHMAN ought to be enscoaced 1n a

safehouse facility which provides security, comfort and an

atmosphere conducive to learning.

It is laportant that the

training be conducted in & locala which viil alloy arpione to give

Therefore, re recousen that LCPIPIT

MEHORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Final Contact with ORPHONE/l 1a New YOrk ClEY

1.

As arranged prevIOuBly, I set with ORPHONE/l al

the NOHOLD safesite in New York Clty fron 1000 bours to

• 1230 26 July.

The meeting vas lntended to wrap up loose

ends, convey

our decision to pursue the STFLIAflAM prograa

(providing QRPHONE/l binself was anenable), and to sake

clear that we

expect measurable operational progress ulthis

the next year.

2.

Although QRPHONB/l bad been debriefed on 24 July

by other Headquarters officers regarding his trip around

HOCORK, I asked hiu to review 1t ajilo for uy information

so I could put 1t clearly in perspective as it related to

our plans for hia in the coming year.

I'll not bother with

the detalla bere because such have already been written for

the record alsoubere, but suffice it to say that ORPHONB/l

was both pleased and relleved at the reception he got frou

his old contacts because of the reflection these receptions

had on his oun bons fides.

ORPHONE/1 his Impressions of 1t all, his reaction to the

STILIMPLAN proposal, and whether he would accept its

demanding obligations.

ORPHONE said he certainly would

and that he found it a real challenge to his intellect and

his operational skills.

The tedious rudy of the dialectic

vould not deter him.

His only concern was how he should

actually play 1t as

he developed relationships with

appropriate party members and,

ultrastely, the Chineso 1n

SMORANGE. I pointed out he needn't concern binself with

the last point bacause that would be part of the purpose

of the ten-day training progran in SHORANGE In September

which rould be glven him by the Headquarters STFLIuFLAH

officer.

I said the training would require total energion

for teD days straight, probably in some secluded beach

house on the coast where all involved could reside full

t100.

He said this would present no probleu cover-vise;

he rould siuply toll his laully he had gone to the continent.

I Bald that PAUPEROS rould be working out the detalla of

this with bin, probably after bis return from vacation.

4.

I sald that given ARPONS l's past performance,

his credent.lalg with the radical left, and his apparent

Interest In vijorously purguind the STFLIMPLAM prOgran de

expected to ba able to measure in six to eight montha the

11kellhood of his being able to achieve all the STFLIMFLAN

objectives based upon the progress he would have made by

thes aith bis Chicou contacts.

Should it appear that the

STFLINFLAN OperatIOn would not succeed no mould be discussing

alternativa courses of action with him by the end of the

увах.

He did say that of all the countries in Europe where

bIS STFLIMPLAM and radical left potential 18 probably the

best, Italy vould be first and Denmark second.

5. I told QRPHONE/l that his meeting with PAUPEROS

WOGEAR Review of African Liberation Movements

In general, the author has done a reasonably good job

describing the ristorical development of the various African

liberation movements, especially when one considers the con-

plexity and number of splits and mergers that have occurred

within and among the movements over the years.

There are

several glaring inaccuracles, however,

in the author's con-

clusions about the current position and effectiveness of the

several Portuguese African liberation movements.

Regarding Angola, the author characterizes the sPha as an

1deologically-orlented group (1.e.,

Soviet doctrine) that has

failed to grasp and utilize to its

advantage the tribal realities

that exist in Angola.

The author fails to acknowledge, horever,

that the MPLA has had some success,

albeit limited, in building

& movement that is national and multiracial in character rather

than tribally oriented.

Despite its urban intellectual leader-

ship, the MPLA has had some success winning local support in

rural eastern Angola.

• By contrast, GRAE ranks a poor second.

From inception,

1ts primary base of support has been the large

Angolan refugee

population of Bakongo

tribesmen who live in southwestern Zaire.

Although the organization has won some support among Bakongo

kinsmen across the border in northwestern Angola,

it has failed

to broaden its base because of its thinly disguised regional

and tribal make-up.

moreover,

Roberto's unwillingness to

delegate authority

or compromise have produced chronic disputes

at the leadership level.

The author's conclusion that GRAE is

& formidable force to be reckoned with in the future of Angola

is contradicted by the fact that the MPLA is by far the

largest and

most effective of the

three nationalist groups

opposing the Portuguese in Angola.

MOZAMBIQUE

• The present FRELIMO leadership does not appear to be in the

state of disarray in 1972 that the author believes it is.

Although some differences undoubtedly persist, the present

leaders seem to have closed ranks somewhat since the departure

of Simango in late 1969.

For the present, any internal squabbles

that may exist are not noticeably affecting FRELIMO's fighting

abilities inside Mozambique.

Notes on QRPHONE by Harvey B. DAITCHMAN

1.

Revolutionary Image:

Discussed. briefly how it is

obtained. Pointed out there

is a pattern to it which is dis-

cernable anong revolutionaries.

It is usually issue oriented

in the beginning, the war being one of the key issues, and it

sradually evolves into a desire to engage in practical

activities

•which usually expressed best on a continuing basis through work

in an organization.

Also connected with this process. is

the

gradual development of a different "outlook."

It is usually a

ntxture of idealism

and

Marxisn-Leninism-socialism-lao Tse-tung

thought. Usually unstructured but developing.

• It is possible in this stage to move from one group to

another without any particular approbation being attached for

this transience. This is particularly so if one starts way

outside a M-L-ist group and moves inward towards it. Quite

& different thing to start in a M-List group and go out.

Also in development of a new outlook one comes to study

a variety of revolutionary literature.

This can tase one into

different areas, anarchism, GW advocacy, revolutionary nihilism,

socialisn, Marxist-Lenism, etc. However, to get to latter

1t must be done logically.

2.

Tightly Structured Op: Emphasis upon tight, controlled

., contacts which

seek to accomplish a specific purpose--collection

of info not necessarily one nor always one.

Purpose is to lay

ground work for future developments.

Purpose to establish certain

contacts which can be later used in

either positive or negative

fashion.

Structured conversation is also essential.

It too

should

seek to accomplish something, directed so as

to be useful

to future development of op:

e.g., desire to have an explanation

for an action to be undertaken later--so bring up in conversation

with someone so that can use that conversation later as explanation

fox Interest in a subject, knowledge of a subject, etc. It 1s

checkable.

study:

Most important aspect in opening phases of op.

Without correct study and without development (understanding)

of "correct outlook" one will always be a dilettante to the,

outside looking in,

someone who is useful to them "under certain

conditions," but not someone who is reliableideological tool,

revolutionary.

This is really the key, the

1t will open doors that cannot otherwise be entered.

•4.

Contacts:

Those to be exploited now and those to be

used in or for future time.

In the beginning the contacts which

are developed are to be used as a means of building his

justification for having begun the serious study of

are aware of 1t.

conversations will be later used when he

explains how and why and when he became interested.

5.

Diffuse Nature of Op: In beginning op has a diffuse

nature.

It is necessary to make many contacts.

Some will be

more useful than others, but all have potential for use in

one circumstance or another.

Since we have no way of knowing

how or from whom the Chinese collect their intelligence, seek

or otherwise spot budding revolutionaries we can assume

that some one of bis acquaintances will report his interest

in Mao, etc.

He can assume that through some of his activities

Chinese will build up his dossier so that at a later date when

we go directly to the Chinese for help they can look in their

dossier and see that x number of months ago, etc., various

things were reported. Etc.

6.

Ops as a Process of Development: Permit no diversions

or detours which might become permanent.

This would include

targets of opportunity, etc.

Must always maintain correct

operational line and cannot reach target by following various

diversionary tributaries in the temporary interest of collecting

marginal intelligence.

Must be prepared to sacirice diversionary

tasks in pursuit of main goal or objective..

•If tangential

things are folled up we then have a different op, and a new op

line, must be cautious with this. Ops line serves as guide for

whole op from beginning to end.

as to insure forward development of op.

Tactics in Op: Must always be carefully thought out so

Something must be seen

emerging or useful, or having potential future value for develop

ment of op, otherwise it is pointless to undertake it.

Tactics

are details. Details are most important aspect in day to day

running of op.

They must be paid attention to, must be contrib

utory,

must be carried out in correct sequence, and we must keep

In mind that at one or more points it is these details which will

be subject of the scrutiny of the opposition.

Agent Profile - QRPHONE/L

QRPHONE/l is an American citizen and a singleton agent

who has been a recruited asset for some seven years.

He has

Xtensive contacts among leftist, radical, and

relations with many such figures for operational purposes

in spite of a formal disassociation sone years ago.

Originally a nember himself of a radical pro-communist

group, his disenchantment with internal personal and

political dissension in an orzanization to which he had

firmly committed himself led later to his acceptance of an

operational relationsbip with the Azency. Although targeted

after his recruitment at the plethora of new left and radical

elements in Europe, essentially for intelligence collection

purposes, QRPHONE/l has recently been redirected towari the

Chinese Communists with a view to ingratiating himself and

seeking tbeir guidance and support as he demonstrates an

interest in more effectively acting on their beball. Our

ultimate objective is to precipitate invitations to Mainland

China which will lead to successively higher echelons of

contact within the Chinese Government.

To prepare ORPHONE/l for this demanding task, extensive

retraining, assessment and remotivation were recently

accomplished and selective recontact was made by him with

his more influential and pertinent communist contacts.

Reactions to QRPHONE/l's allesed desire to more fully count

himself to the communist Chinese cause and the assistance

rendered thus far bj

these coununist contacts are encouraging

indicators of the potential success of this agent to achieve

our goal.

QRPHONE/1 has produced numerous intelligence reports

on communist and radical targets in addition to his covert

action functions as a journalist and author. His long-term

tenure with the Agency will be determined in part by the degree

of success of his new Chicou directions.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with QRPHONE/1

On 24 July 1972, Andy Ness (in alias as Andy),

Frank Falko (in alias as

Frank) and the undersigned

(in alias as Ken) converged on the OTR safesite in

New York City to meet with QRPHONE/l in order to debrief

him on his trip through WOCORK.

2. The discussion was started by having QRPHONE

relate the details of his trip on a city by city basis

describing the people he met and his reception by them.

It should be noted here that several of the individuals

that QRPHONE was to have seen were out of town or

unavailable, however, QRPHONE will correspond with these

individuals

NEWARK

QRPHONE met with Leibel Bergman at his home

and stayed overnight (14-15 July) as his guest.

QRPHONE told Bergman that he had decided to make

a full-time commitment to the study of Marxist-

Leninist (M-L) doctrine in order to become more

proficient in M-L theory and would like to join

the RU to

further this ambition.

Bergman's reaction,

according to QRPHONE, was enthusiastic.

gave QRPHONE some M-L literature (which was the

same as the literature Andy gave him

several

weeks ago to study) which he felt would be helpful.

Bergman stated that if QRPHONE was really interested

in becoming involved in the M-L movement he should

return to NOCORK because that "was where all the

Inconsistencies were." Bergman invited QRPHONE to

is pleased with the current development of the

RU.

He said that the recent trip to China by

several RU members was successful and that the

trip had been pleasant for them.

QR PHONE

commented that it appears that Berguan does not

have the same control of the RU that he formerly

had, although he is regarded as the "guru" of

the RU.

NEW YORK

ORPHONE said that Richard Ward is attempting

to sell the English language rights of

Prince Sihanouk's book My War With the CIA.

Ward had been trying to get Lyle Stuart to

purchase the rights but Stuart's antipathy

toward Wilfred Burchett,

• "that old Communist"

according to Stuart, was too great.

Burchett

apparently wrote the forward and Stuart doesn't

want to publish anything with his name on it.

QRPHONE, in our presence, called Stuart and

convinced him to at least read the manuscript of

the book before he turned it down.

South Vietnamese presidential candidate Truong

Dinh Dzu, who ran in the 1967 South Vietnanes election

on a peace platform and who is now in prison.

ORPHONE said that this student has amassed a large

collection of books on intelligence, that the

books are expensive and that he doesn't have any

idea where the money to buy the books came frou.

He also said he doesn't think Truong has

asked if Truong was in any way involved with the

recent attempt to hijack a plane to Hanoi. QRPHONE

stated that Truong knew the hijackers and might have

known something about the attempted hijacking

apartment.

vacation in Japan.

He did manage to see

FNU Boggs, who is apparen: ly

no longer involved

with radical organizations

but who is acting as a

clearinghouse for black and white radicals.

QRPHONE characterized Boggs as less doctrinaire

and less dogmatic than he had been in the past.

Boggs' feeling about the black radical movement

1s that it is in considerable disarray.

ORPHONE saw LPWEAKLY/l who told bim that he.

LPWEAKLY/1 told QRPHONE that if be went he would,

that QRPHONE knew about LPWEAKLY/l's plans.

corroborate the fact that Block had recently

been to China. QRPHONE spent some time with

Don Wright, who was a member of the RU delegation

to China.

Earl was in the RU delegation to China where he

must have caused some embarrassment to the

delegation by his naivete. He attempted to meet

African revolutionaries, particularly members of

the MPLA, which he didn't realize were Moscow-

oriented.

QRPHONE went to the Martin Luther King

Center for Social Change, formerly the Martin

rom Porter, the head staffer of the organization.

There was recently a split in the Center and the

Executive Director, a Dr. Scott, was forced out

of office.

The office is still vacant and,

according to Porter, will remain so for the

lumediate future.

The reason for the continued

vacancy is apparently to allow Coretta King and

other members of the Board of Directors to

Porter is a former

writer for Freedom Ways Magazine.

QRPHONE said

that Porter knew of him but didn't say exactly how.

QRPHONE told Porter he would consider writing a

that the Center is going to establish a foreign

an old CP member.

next year with regard to securing entre to the Chinese.

QRPHONE was told that once he

was proficient in M-L

he would be expected to go out and test his knowledge

with various individuals and organizations in order to

gain access and become known to the Chinese.

Andy

emphasized it wouldn't be easy, that QRPHONE would have

to be diligent and patient, but that in the end, if he

was successful, the benefits would be many. QRPHONE

accepted this.

ompletion of Training Report for ORPHOKI/1

Draining Program "SHAW"

REFERENCE:

- so.

1. ORPHONE/1 was trained covertly in New York from 22 June to

14 July 1972.

There were sixteen sessions for a total of eighty-seven

training hours.

2. This was a happy reunion of trainee and instructor. Less then

two years ago, PHONE was given three days of reports training (Please

see Completion of Training Report dated 19 October 1970). Just as then,

PHONE was totally engrossed in every training session from the moment

of his arrival to the moment of his departure. Remembering that the

Instructor does not eat lunch, PilONE brought & sandwich with him daily

end took this lunch while Ilstening to the instructer. Thus, every

minute of every day was made to count.

The only time lost was three hours for

and on the

several phone calls he had to make daily to check for calls to his cover

office, then follow up with calls to those persons who had called his

office and had left messages to be called back. At the most, these calls

took half an hour. On some days, they took far less.

4. His cover organization work took up a considerable portion,

everyday, of his free time with the result that he could not do any

casing to speak of for subsequent preparation of commo plans for exercises.

For exemple, told early on to prepare two dead drop commo plans, he

was not able to come up with anything till the last week - end then

with only one written one and one that he reveived orally. As a result

he had to be given time during the training day to write reports of

his comtersurveillance exercises and one of his agent developmental

exercises.

After one such exercise, asked 1f he wished to take time

out during the training day to write his report he said:

"No, tonight

I will make time to write it."

And he did. And it was a good report.

On each Sunday, he vent out of town to visit his aged Grandmother.

Xe used the travel time to read tradecraft books (he read seven altogether).

F,

Stunt!

On Tuesday, July th, his publisher appointed him baby sitter for the

publisher's teen age son and there vent any hope of getting eny casing

done that day. At leest one time, he mentioned that he did not zo

to bed till two that norning and as he had left the afternoon before,

he had stated that he had meetings starting at jour-thirty that afternoon.

With all that, he nevertheless was fully alert and attentive every minute

of every training session.

6. In his developmental recruitment series of exercises, his

Instructor played the role of operations officer -- and a real durio-

dumb he was. In such circunstances, PHONE had to do all the thinking,

all the planning, all the casing for neeting sites, all the analyzing,

all the preparing and pointing for the recruitment.

It was pure joy

to watch this man, aiter each meeting and again before the next one,

go to work on the problem. He lnew where he was, knew where he wanted

to go, knew hot to get there.

When Ir. Rod Sweet, during the critique

at the end of the series of exercises said:

"He did a beautiful job,"

PHONE had earned that accolade all by himself.

The instructor's only

contribution had been in the teaching of the subject of Agent Acquisition.

7. At this point, the instructor wishes to execute a lou bou in

the direction of Mr. Sweet: He played his agent role excellently well

and made the exercise & meaningful one for PhonE.

The three trips to

New York by Mi. Sweet must have been very taxing, particularly in vien

of his immediately upcoming ThY trip, but they were efforts well spent.

8. No man, of course, is perfect.

Bach has an Achilles heel, &

weakness, or an all-too-human trait, at the very least. Our PHONE has

He has a very quick mind. He knows it. And knowing it, he relies

on it, counts on 1t.

This, in turn, leads to a snall failure in seli-

discipline. For example, told to write out his plan for the recruitment

pitch, he came in with six words (maybe not that many) scratched on a

3 by 5 leaf torn out of his pocket notebook.

He then proceeded, fron

these few words, to run off his plan without a single pause for en

un, hi, er, etc. It was as though he was reading a definition from a

dictionary, so smoothly did his mind and thoughts run. He prepares

everything in his mind, it appears, and does not like to write out

that which he feels he should not have to write out.

to heve so facile a mind, a bit of discipline, to write out in full

so important an act es a recuritment pitch, might one day save griel

when an error vould have been spotted had the entire plan been written

out then looked over for possible flers.

9. Ints small flaw, the instructor feels, accounts in considerable

measure for PHOrt's failure to bring in a written dead drop plan till

the last days of the program.

PHONE felt he could just as essily report

In fact, the other dead drop (he hed been asked to do tro)

on which he reported orally, he discussed as though the peper was in

front of him and he was reading from it. Nothing was missing - area

description, access, hours of availability, the opposition, pros and

cons as to suitability -- it vas all there.

He just didn't like to

write out that upon which he could report orally.

10. In writing reports on the two counter-surreillance exercises,

he dashed those off in jig tine. No pause for thining, no pause to

look up at the ceiling or out the window.

to reconstruct, to remenber -- just an IBs-type printout.

1l. The instructor sets down this reluctance on our hero's part

to write out certain things, not to downgrade him, but to alert desk

end field officers toat if they must have a certein report by a certain.

time, and they wast it in writing, they must be fir.

For exemple,

after the second meeting in the developmental series, the instructor

said: "I must have that report first thing in the morning. Do you

want to take time out from this afternoon's training session to do it?"

And, as already reported above, PHONE preferred to seve the training

time and he answered

"I will make time to write it". In this case,

time was of the essence because Mr. Sweet had to see the report before

When PHONS feels that an oral

report is adequate he finds it a little difficult to bring himself to

find time to make a written report. Told definitely that he must write

a report and given a deedline, he meets the deadline and the report is

everything it should be.

12. His reports on his recruitment meetings, iT. Sweet said, were

excellent. No jumping to conclusions, no padding, no misinterpretations,

no omissions.

13. The surveillance team captain, reading PHONE's report on his

actions during the countersurveillance exercises, carvelled at the

completeness, total accuracy of description of the surveillants PHONE

had made, including their ages (but always made each man an inch or

two shorter than the actual height -- which PHONE admitted he does

constantly), and the total recall of every move, every street crossing,

every compass direction. (In the first countersurveillance exercise,

sprung on PHONS vithout a moment's prior notice, he made one of his

tHo surveillants.

In the second one, with plenty of time to prepare,

he made all three of them.

These were two different teams from the

New York Office of Security).

Concluding his admiration of PHONE's

reporting, the surveillance tean captain said to the instructor:

"You

should be very proud of him".

14. In both exercises, the surveillance teans criticized the

rapidity of PHONE's novements. He walks very rapidly from place to

place, then spends time to browse in & book shop. Then off again at

a high rate of speed to his next stop.

They also criticized his looking

both ways while crossing a one way street. They felt it made him aypear

tall conscious. These are a typical Hew Yorker's habits. The instructor,

also a New Yorker, 1s guilty of the identical actions. We are highly

kinetic in our novements and as for looking both ways while crossing a

one-way street, we follow the old karine Corps adage:

"There's always

one S.O.B. that doesn't get the word". By sheerest coincidence, when

the Instructor was on his way to the safesite to deliver the surveillance

tean's report, he violated his own rule of looking both ways ir. crossing

& one-way street and was bowled over by a hippie on a loaded bike --

going the wrong way.

Only the large heavy filn case the instructor

vas carrying kept him from being knocked flat.

15. Nevertheless, PilOt is now fully cognizant of the appearance

that his actions create and will watch it in the future.

16. One last note on the counter-surveillance exercises: He

chose his positions well and he camouflaged his actions beautifully.

One escample:

the Instructor called the surveillance team for & quick

feedback on

the first

exercise and caught the men just as they returned

to their office. They got on different phones for a three way conversation.

They reported one incident as follows:

"So rapid were PHONE's sovements,

that

when he net a friend of his, he hardly paused to speak with him,

just waved him off". The second surveillant:

"37o, It didn't look like

that at all, to me.

To me it looked like this Indian-looking person

stopped PHONE and asked him for directions and PHONE ERve them and just

went

about his business".

PHOle's orm report, khich he wrote up before

he learned about the two different interpretations of the Incident:

"_- where I stopped a foreign-looking man, apparently Indian in origin

and asked hin for the Museum which I knew perfectly vell is on 55th

Street.

I turned around as he pointed south to 55th Street and spotted

the same man in the grey suit, nor holding his hat in his hand".

17. In the second exercise, there were two items

the team was surprised to note in PHONe's report that PHONE even had

the name of the book that the surveillant picked up when he followed

PHONE into a book store.

Second, when the exercise was over, the team

compared notes and decided that PHONE may have made two of them but

could not possibly have made the third man.

The team captain, on reading

PHONE's report, was stunned to see that PHOTS had indeed made the third

man also, but good.

18. PHONE had an elicitation exercise (in addition to the develop-

mental acquisition series) with ir. Harry Webster, an instructor in the

New York office.

After relating the fine job that FiOil had done, Mir.

Webster's report concluded:

"A first rate performence by PHONE, who's

obviously been around - both covervise and for real".

19. His choice of neeting places with his agent could not be

faulted.

For one, he chose in Bast Side restaurant (where diplomants,

es NIr. Sweet held himself out to be, would properly be seen diring).

pitch.

21. In operational and intel reports, he did very well.

He very

successfully separated the operational from the intel info and the

source comments from the positive intelligence.

22. Instructor's Observation: PHONE 18 & proud man, both as an

Indiviaual and as an operator.

While he was very discreet about it,

very circumspect, he did, nevertheless, let the instructor know that

he has, on occasion been handled with something less then pure genius.

this,

like the previous item, is noted not to down-grade PHONE, but to

alert both desk and field officers that this man, being very sure,

positive, definite and strong, hopes to be handled in a manner that

would have those same words apply.

23. In sum: A very good nan.

24. In an effort to evaluate the effectiveness of the training,

ve would appreciate a detailed evaluation report in July 1973 Ixom the

field station.

This report should indicate the extent to which the

training has made the trainee a more useful and effective asset and

should evaluste the performance in each area of tradecraft in which

training was conducted; negative as vell as positive comments are

solicited. The field station's report should also include the trainee's

own comments. Please ask the field station to slug the report wOlOld/

AGENT EVALUATION

NAME:

ORPHONE/ 1

PROJECT:

ORPIONE

DATE:

18 January 1971

STATUS: Contract Agent (Under

a Memorandum of Oral

Agreement)

Q/1 does free lance journalism and

1s an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

and Palestinian groups.

Q/l's access derives from his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and

His personality is

easy-going and his attitude positive. If his efforts are not

always totally successful - leaving us with tantalizing bits

of information and many uranswered questions - this is generally

due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable

to elicit more information on a given subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Ql does a solid and workmanlike job

as a journalist.

He has acquitted himself well both as a

representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.

Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and

in this connection the operation profits particularly from the

energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself

has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: ORPHONE/l's attitude is positive. (See below

under Motivation. J

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/1's attitude is good. He has made

an effort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to

understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former

cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This 1s a subject on

which a good deal has beensaid over the course of this operation.

The following points can be made on the subject of @/l's

motivation:

A. His basic image of JKLANCE is positive.

в.

This

image of JKLANCE as a powerful, professional

organization has

been enhanced in Q/l's case by the

circumstances of his agent relationship, which require

very professional handling.

Indeed Q/l has probably come

to isold a rather

glamorous

"storybook" image of JKLANCE

and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE

effort.

This

is

a very human trait and should not be

exaggerated in his case, but every one of the wild anti-

JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to

accentuate the feeling on his part of being a member of

a very il'pressive outfit.

c. In his political evolution over the years, 21

has becone active in at least two "causes".

In both

instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy

and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally

harmed as a result.

The product of this situation has been

& certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political

outlook.

(In other circumstances this night be called

political maturity. Ql now tends to view political trends

as a detached observer rather than a participant.

D.

Following on the foregoing thought is the fact

that he is an American (and does not consider himself

disloyal).

Given his citizenship and his disinclination to

feel "involved" in the currents of the radical leftiklance,

has been perfectly willing to accept employnent by

to report on those currents.

He does not give any indication

that he views this as "squealing" on his friends - indeed

the contrary seems to be the case.

E.

On a more mundane level, it must be realized that

Q/1 was recruited at a time when he was in serious financial

straits.

He was without a job and was living off the charity

of his wife's family.

JKLANCE has given him a job, paid

him reasonably well and regularly,

and has enabled him to

be independent of his wife's family's charity.

F.

Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination

of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1

clearly likes his work.

He enjoys dealing with international

Issues and political subjects.

He enjoys the travel and

the opportunity to exercise his language capability.

In

short, the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which

he has been able to live appeals to him.

In assessing the relative importance of these

several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-

signed would stress that C and E were probably

causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more

B and F have arisen since recruitment and

probably play an important role in his current motivation.

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Ql's wife is not witting of his

JKLANCE affiliation.:

She was allowed to believe that he was

working indirectly for the Chinese.

She certainly is aware

of the past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at

Q/1, but as far as Ql can determine (and this is not a subject

on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she

continues to accept the Chinese story. It should be added

that Mrs. Ql is British and is the holder of some rather

typical

"left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes.

It should also be noted

that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety

of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.

Certainly the whole subject of Q/l's activities is one which

Mrs. Q/1 views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed --

lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that

Mrs. Ql seens to accept as legitimate the small amount of

money received from Q/l's cover and to regard this as a genuine

stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/l has a very pleasant

personality and responds well to Case Officer handling.

a most willing asset requiring no special handling care - other

than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a

sensitive asset such as @1.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to

accept guidance and criticism

-- provided it is constructive.

If anything, he may sometimes be too willing.

occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls

to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational

considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.

However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon

him.

In

this connection it should be recalled that his ability

to respond fully is usually restricted by

the nature of his

relationship with his informants; i.e., since he

is only eliciting

the information from unwitting

informants he is rarely able to

press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has

signed recruitment documents and a security pledge.

We hasten

to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never

been any instance in which either he or his handler has had

occasion to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q1. has a good sense of personal security and his

handler makes an effort to build upon this at every opportunity.

As cited above, @/l's

enthusiasm sometimes leads to his failure

to consider all aspects and implications of a given situation.

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of @l's

aifiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,

and an extra discrsion lo dii's cover situation.

He have no

indication that any of

these allegations are based on any proof,

nor have they produced a significant reduction in his number of

contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 is a self-starter and can

work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADHINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: Q/1 poses only a minimum administrative

burden.

He is not overly concerned about his administrative

and financial position, allowances, payments, etc.

He merely

expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him.

However, on the

rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,

he can be very upset.

REPORTING:

Q/1 is a journalist by training. He is an effective

reporter - both in terms of ability to elicit and writing

style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q1 is quite energetic and can continue

his etforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES:

In addition to his (native) English, Q/1 can speak French,

Italian and German. AuPEROUGH

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q/1 is quite willing to travel - and even

enjoys it!

The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this

agent,

Case Officer.

with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab

we can make at this enignatic subject.

MENORANDUM FOR: C/CA/B3

SUBJECT

: Chicom Aspect of QRPHONE/l's

Operational Potential

prognosis regarding QRPHONE/l's mobility (i.e. his

possible move to another European city or to Africa),

his agent recruiting capability (preceded by additional

training), and the prospects of making himself attractive

to the Chicons (again preceded by appropriate training).

In pursuit of the latter item I talked at length

today

with Mr. Andrew Ness, the FE Division expert on

long-range Chicom and CP penetration programs.

I de-

scribed in detail QRPHONE/l's background, current status,

and

the variety of plans we have in mind

and received

Ness' reactions as follows:

FREEL

The butterfly characteristics that QRPHONE

has demonstrated thus far will never result in his

becoming of interest to either the Chicons or the

for any operationally meaningful purpose.

while the Soviets would perhaps see him as potential

FI source, the Chicons would not even do that.

B.

Chicom officers abroad are still totally

obsessed with Communist doctrine and its strategic

and tactical application to a degree significantly

more zealous than their Soviet counterparts.

Therefore, in looking at potential foreign assets

the Chicoms discard persons of shallow substance as

far as their knowledge of Communism is concerned.

They are interested in only those who have a serious

intellectual understanding of Communist doctrine and

a serious revolutionary goal.

of whatever coloring floating around Europe are seen

as only of marginal use to the Chicoms and certainly

not the

sort that they would take into their confidence.

c.

To become of long-term operational use

to us in the sense of exploiting his possible

long-term use to the chicoms, ORPHONE/1 shouLd

do two things:

join an existing "acceptable"

organization such as the Trotskyite Party or a

black radical party and, at the sane time begin

a serious study of Marxist/Masist doctrine.

AS

he gets into this program (preceded by some ten

days training and close Headquarters direction)

he should begin to seek out Communist intellectuals,

party members, leaders of radical groups,

etc., to

ask questions

about

the dialectic, seek

additional

guidance, borrow books and so forth.

In doing this

he will in time come into the attention of the

professional spotters the Chicoms have and begin to

develop the sort of bona fides that the Chicoms,

in time, will find appealing.

He should also in

this period seek out Chicon officials with the

same requests for help.

The key here is to

demonstrate not that QRPHONE/l is simply sympathetic,

with Maoism or any other Comrunist shading but that

he is a dedicated serious revolutionary.

D. A quicker way to come into the Chicon spot-

light might be for QRPHONE/l to join the Black

Panthers, the SDS or one of the other radical groups

with which the Chicoms are already known to be in

touch.

He will obviously have to sweat out a period

of probation in joining any such group until he

divests himself of his tattered leftist reputation

and those JKLANCE accusations.

Ness feels that a

successful passing of this baptismal period will

depend solely on QRPHONE/l's willingness to plunge

wholeheartedly into a serious study of the terribly

boring and lengthy volures of the dialectic.

As he

demonstrates his capability to move more deeply into

this field to the satisfaction of the "spotters" he

will be accordingly provided additional help and

encouragement by Chicom contacts and officials.

E. The Chicoms will be looking at him as a

possible asset in their long-range

targetting of the

American revolution, hense QRPHONE/l's utterances

ought to

be couched

in terms of his ultimate aim of

contributing to and participating in the American

revolution.

In other words the Chicons would see

little or no use for QRPHONE/l operationally in

Europe or

Africa (just as we would assess and recruit

& Thai for operations in Thailand not in Nigeria).

F. Ness falt that should we pursue the above

as a long-term operational goal for QRPHONE/l, the

city in which this takes place is almost irrelevant.

He could do it perhaps as well in an African setting

as in Europe and his cover status i.e., with

IPWEAKLY, really makes no difference

because the

Chicoms would

test the fibei

man himself and would

not ve deterred by his external trappings.

In answer to my question, Ness said he would be

happy to meet wIth QRPHONE to assess bis potential in this

area and then, assuming we all decided to go ahead with

such redirection, Ness could train him and guide him

thoroughly enough to get him well on the track by spending

some seven to ten days with him on a concentrated program.

SECLET

1÷ DEC 1978

MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Chief, Covert Action Stall

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

ORPHONE

Your Memorandum, Same Sabject,

Dated 29 November 1971

- 1. What follows below are some initial commenta of mine on

the referent memorandum, per your reguest. We really feel in

Branch 3 that for a varlety of reasons, we need more time to

deliberate on ORPHONE's future operational actluity than the

previous two weeks. Partly this is due to extended absence by the

case officer in charge who has been plagued with a recurring

Illness--I belleve you are famlliar with this. It ls also in part

attributable to the Section Chief's being new to the positlon and

having bla time absorbed by matters of current priority. So if you

don't mind, we should like to address ourselves further to this

subject following the Christmas holldays. At that time we should

like to Initiate some meetinge on this matter both with yourself

and with other area components including representatives from

CI Staff.

2. Background: Your memo, of course, was triggered by

an earlier one of mine which proposed that ORPHONE become

operationally engaged in attempting to establish a black Communist

cell

The purpose of this would be twofold..

namely, to exacerbate relations thereby between the Sovlet Union

and mainland China through varlous low-key covert action undertakings.

and in the process to further enhance QRPHONE's own credentials

as a Maolet activist. This tentatlve assignment, it should be noted,

arose because Branch 3 personnel had become Increasingly aware of

the possibility that ORPHONE's project status might be terminated

in the not too distant future. While it is true that in the immediate

proceding month or so, we have benefited from his intelligence

reporting, It is all too clear that over the past two years, he has

been of diminishing utility to CA Staff and other area divislons. In

discussing his future with his recent case officer, Miss Chatelan,

her recommendation was that unless something could be found for him

In the near future, we should give segious consideration to terminatlag

Lidd

his services during the coming year. Thus my foregoing proposal

arose from a deslre on my part not to terminate an asset of proved

capabilities without giving the agent in question suitable opportunity

to become useful once more.

3. CI Type Revlew/ORPHONE Personal Securlty: Your memo

makes out there have been frequent security reviews of ORPHONE's

security sistus, and you question the efficacy of our doing still one

more. On this let me point out that in making such a security assess-

ment, we would be doing so in response to a current request by the

ares division concerned whose cooperation we need to direct this

agent. One hardly needs stress that such a request probably should

• be honored in the Interests of maintaining good relations even If its

fulfiliment means redundant work. But apart from this, the case

offices also informs me that the case file does not contain any general

summary of the alleged security breaches Involving QRPHONE and

thelr Implications vis-a-vis his activities. It is true however that his

security status has been revlewed for each annual project review and

that assessments of his security status were made following each

-alleged breach, but no up-to-date summary exists. As for our oun

gut feelings on his personal security, one hazards that he ls still in

pretty good shape. I agree with you that many of the past charges

leveled against him are of the same ilk as those leveled against other

loftlet colleagues(who do not have any Agency assoclation) by their

rivals. And as for the structure of his case officer relatlonship--

that Is, having him handled by a deep cover officer from an adjacent

country--this would appear to be secure in the extreme (so much

so that one would advocate that it be dropped due its operational

Inelficiency.)

4. Location: We tentatively agree that in all likellhood

should not be the venue for our proposed operatlonal undertaking due

the location

however, might do very well.

If not

perhaps you or EUR Division might suggest another

locale. As for the question as to whether or not the

statlon would

want him permanently, only time and his own : perational success could

determine this. One hazards that If QRPHONE were able to make bis

way with some good local leftists and had promise of developing some

kind of relationship with mainland China representatives, the station

might come to regard him as a capital asset.

SECIET

## Page 61

SEG.C.

5. Substance: You noted that ORPHONE... "cannot just

simply show up and start a leftist nuclel..." Why not? Others

have. He la a well-known leftist in intellectual circles in Europe

and has written mady articles in praise of Mao. This should do

for a start. As for what he might have to offer local leftisto..

money, energy and Ideas will do. A great deal of money, of courso.

la unneeded, but some is. We can supply it. As for ideas and

onergy, he has both. Concerning the "bullt-In jealousy, anlmoalty,

ete. " which such action would llkely engender on the part of local

slal leftiats, this may of may not occur. But ls this such a calamity

If it should occur? Are not leftists usually fighting among themselves

anyway? In any case, we have sothing to lose by trylag to salvage

this agent.

What we have to lose by not trying ls an agent asset of

proved worth.

6. Credentials: You say in effect that ORPHONE has sot

been known as an actlvlet but only as an Intellectoal. (Frankly, the

distlaction is not very important in my mind.) Be that as it may, he

has written many articles on leftist subjecte and has talked to

Innumerable leftists around Europo over the years. True, he has

not been involved in such actlong as street demonstrations, but we

would not like him to be so personally Iovolved in the future ln any

case.

What we would want him to do is to write pamphlets, Informally

recruit assoclates to his group and provide a little money to the group

as might be regulred for varlous undertakings. Aside from the

organizing and funding, actually this is not very dilferent from what

he has been doing--except that it will be in one place for a change.

7. Book Dispatch Sale: You may be very correct in saying

that shopping him around to European stations by book dispatch is a

poor way to sollelt useful tasks for ORPHONE. But again, I took'..

my lead from C/EUR/CA who mado a request along these lines.

Certainly sending book dispatches wouldn't hurt any. I Spence is

willing at some future time to visit various field stations and to

atterapt selling ORPHONE's services personally, we wouid be happy

to have him do so. We, of course, don't know when he wiil be

avallable to do so, and time is passing.

8. Concludia, Comment: I really feel that me should relate

to you in some detall the success which Andy Ness once had with the

Kind of undertakiag which we have proposed for ORPHONE. Il may

Interest you. On the other hand, it may be perfectly possible that

the situatlon which Andy Ness once manipulated is not applicable to

But

I we ara sot to channal bla energies in this direction, it is incuribuh:

upon us to think of something else for him to do before we begin

thinking about writing him off. And so when you suggest that. .

"the first order of business ls to undertake a basic assessment

of the projoct..." I agree. And to this end, we should like a couple

of weeks more before coming to you with some general concluslons

of ours about the current viability of thi case and some future

alternative course of action.

advised that the primary reasons for QRPHONE/l's dwindling

productivity are as follows:

A. Key centers of activity of the radical left

In Europe are London, Paris, and Stockholm.

different reasons QRPHONE/l's access in these three

capitals is either circumscribed or off target.

His reputation among(target

groups of interest to us

has

been so tarnished that he has not taken into their

confidence significantly enough to be of value.

Although he has a multitude of contacts among

the left, virtually all are shallow, periodic, and then

very brief when they do occur.

Even his correspondence

to the more important radical leaders, which used to be

quite informative, has fallen to almost nothing.

Because his contacts are so cursory, he has

been unable to develop a close and continuing personal

relationship with any one of them in order to develop

the intimate confidence so necessary for operational

exploitation.

His cover has always been thin and thus has

circumstantially

at least lent credence to the periodic

allegations of his being & JKLANCE agent.

Close case officer direction has been made

very difficult. because of the echelons existing

between QRPHONE/1 and LCPIPIT, coupled with relative

infrequency of field case officer meetings.

F. What contacts he has within the African

target, for example, are rendered virtually useless

because his case officers are unfamiliar on & timely

basis with Africa Division requirements and also

miss valuable operational leads simply because they

do not recognize them.

(This is no fault of the

case officers because

they obviously have little

opportunity to keep abreast of such requirements.)

G. The somewhat artificial nature of his trying

to portray a pro-lao stance may help him a bit with

similarly inclined but renders him ineffective

with other political shadings among the left.

2.

With all of the above in mind and without belaboring

the history of this project, the following recommendation is

offered and has been concurred in informally by CI/SO and

Africa Division officers with whom I have talked.

Accepting the fact that QRPHONE/l's operational

utility in Europe

is minimal, I propose LCPIPIT be

directed to begin making arrangements for his transfer

PCS to Africa and, hence, his operational control

transferred to Africa Division as soon as feasible.

B.

From the point of view of MICHAOS requirements

and Africa Division's own requirements, both elements

jelt QRPHONE/1 could best be exploited

It is one of the to most active cities in Africa for

the radical left, it is a hot-bed of both Soviet and

Chicon shenanigars, and it is politically vital to

East African stability.

c.

However, because of QRPHONE/1's well-known

association with two exiled

politicians

opposition

and current reports that these

oppositionists are plotting the overthrow of

in the near future.

and his police might well conclude that QRPHONE

represents the advance probe of the coup plotters and

promptly throw him into jail.

Both to give QRPHONE/l time to cleanse his

tattered inage and because there are almost as

important operational tasks in Hest Africa, the idea

is to move him (1)

PROJECT ORPHOYE

PART A. CHARTS REQUESTED

Chart I: For the period FY 1967 through FY 1971

provide the number of disseminated reports according to

the subject field of the report.

The headings would be:

Fiscal Year, African Independance Movements, Anti-US

Demonstrations, European Maoist Groups (etc., or whatever

other subject fields you wish to set up).

Chart II: List the specific events or organizations

against which covert action was in fact undertaken and

give the number of QRPHONE reports which were submitted

on such events/organizations.

PART B. QUESTIONS FOR DISCUSSION

What is the basic reason for this being a CA

Staff project (other than history)?

To provide multi-

tasking for FI purposes of general U.S. intelli-

To provide CA operational information

for possible DDP use?

2.

As regards FI reports, which have lately been

described as being of only

marginal interest, the main

criticisms appear to be a lack

of depth and detail.

CA Staff's counter to this has been that ORPHONE goes as

far as he can, and can go no further through elicitation.

Have these depth/detail criticisms been valid?

Is our

defense valid, or could he reasonably be expected to

elicit more depth and detail than he does?

If he can go no further through elicitation and

we wish to keep him on the Fl path, what is implied?

develop and run agents himself?

work for an organization of intelligence interest

How realistic would either of these lines of

pursuit be?

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CA/B-3

SUBJECT:

ORPHONE

REFERENCE:

Your Memorandum, Subject: ORPHONE

Operations in Europe, Dated 24 November

1971

1. I made some notes in the margin of referent memorandum upon

first reading it. However, since these are too brief, I thought it best

to let you have my thoughts on this matter in fuller form.

2. As you may know, we had tried for years to give QRPHONE more

meaningful assignments, but there are certain facts about him and the

operation today which simply cannot be ignored. It seems to me that

I your memorandum takes inadequate account of these factors.

a.

Security: RODIGAST's and QRPHONE's personal security

cannot be faulted, in my judgment. However, that has not protected

QRPHONE from accusations of being CIA, which have haunted him

throughout the years. This is such an endemic charge in the milieu in

which he operates that I feel certain he would have had the same charges

leveled at him whether or not the Ollie Harrington incident had happened

b. Location: Apart from the efficiency

there are a number of good reasons arguing against the desirability of

ORPHONE'S

for a meeting, let alone being stationed

/ there (e.g., protection of RODIGAST' s identity, the Harrington incident,;

and the location there of

I cannot imagine why he would

consider it, or why we should advocate it.

SECRET

A different cover for a move to

might be developed,

but not that of a Maoist developing new cells.

Station is glad to

have him come there and give them "grass roots" reports whenever

he visits, but would they want him permanently??

c. Substance: More generally, ORPHONE cannot just simply

show up and start forming nuclei -- there are already Maoist nuclei --

the various Marxist-Leninist parties (miniscule though they may be)

that existed, and they continue to exist with of without Chinese help.

If he were to have something to offer them - money, preferably --

they might welcome him with open arms.

Otherwise he will encounter

built-in jealousy, animosity, rivalry, and a source of accusation all

over again.

d. Credentials: As a Maoist intellectual (or an intellectual

Maoist? ?), ORPHONE can travel all over. As a Maoist activist, he

has only minimal credentials. The only group he is actively involved

with is Manchanda's insignificant group-- and even with that he has

never carried a placard, and I doubt if he has even helped them with

making up a placard.

He has helped them with their press releases,

leaflets, etc.

In short, with the written word, not the deed. By

nature -- which we must also take into consideration -- QRPHONE

is no longer a "doer" -- if he ever was one. And I doubt very much

that he can at this stage in his life become a "doing" radical.

We would

be misusing his natural talents, which could still serve us well, in

favor of dubious undertaking.

In effect, the proposal (if I read it correctly) is to have

QRPHONE develop a group which would serve to distribute anti-Soviet

material. I cannot judge if that would be worth the cost ($40, 000? ?)

but I doubt it. I also do not know enough about the "Andy Ness"

operation to comment on that aspect, particularly as to its feasibility

in a sophisticated European community.

e. Book Dispatch Sale: Shopping him around to the European

Stations is the wrong approach, in my judgment. In the first place,

any Station likely to have a use for him is already extremely well up

on ORPHONE's background. There are only

Stations really

heavily involved in anti-CP ops (in which field I suppose this would fall),

and those

have former CI/ICG men who know QRPHONE well:

ORPHONE has talents and abili-

ies and weaknesses which can best be explaiped/ sold in person, nol

hrough dispatch. I think, that the way to do it, if at all, is by Spenc

during a visit to these Stations.

f. "CI-Type" Review: A review of the file will show how often

this has been done, and how thoroughly. (I can understand Horvath

asking for a security review -- he had no background knowledge of the

operation that would have given him this information. ) I do not know

what you now expect to find. In all frankness, and unless CI Staff feels

the need for yet another review and is willing to undertake it, I would

consider a Stati-internal review pretty much a waste of time.

3. Having gone around this problem several times in the past

several years with CI Staff and the pertinent area division: (as the

files will clearly show), I am most doubtful that any of them will consider

ORPHONE of sufficient interest (current or potential) to pay what it

costs to maintain him. We may be able to justify it since we attempt

(as no one area division would) - and to some extent succeed - to target

him on a multi-divisional basis. In light of these considerations, and

since I have developed serious reservations on the long range viability

of this operation (in terms of the cost-effectiveness factor), I believe

that the first order of business is to undertake a basic assessment of

the project. After some internal discussions, this will also, of course,

entail consultations with the CI Staff and at least

area divisions.

4. I will appreciate receiving your comments by mid-December.

24 November 1971

HEMORANDUM OF MEETING

SUBJECT: QRPHONE Operations in Europe

1. Mr. Leo Horvath, EUR/CA, and myself briefly

discussed prospective QRPHONE operations on 8 November.

During the discussion I outlined to him a general proposal

which had been bruited about during my recent TDY at

LCPIPIT in mid-October.

In substance,

this proposal was

that following QRPHONE's forthcoming trips through

Scandinavia and Africa, he then repair to either

for an extended period of time.

In either of

these locations he would then attempt to identify and

to enlist the cooperation of various unwitting çontacts

in the left sector of the student and youth population,

who could assume in time the trappings of a Maoist study

group.

QRPHONE would have excellent cover for doing so

inasmuch as he is

an established writer of the Maoist

stripe.

His relationship with these contacts or followers

would not be set in the routine JKLANCE operational con-

text.

Rather, he would guide and motivate such contacts

as would an alleged covert representative of a Maoist

group, and would claim to have been a member of a larger

such

group say, in Britain.

He would, of course, imply

to his followers that he is attempting to develop a

similar nucleus in

or whenever, as

good Communists should.

2.. Operational activity would be of a twofold nature.

First,

exploitation of the prospective group of Maoists

would follow along lines of a typical black Communist

celt, emulating the kind of notional movement which

Mr. Andy Ness developed in the Middle East some seven or

eight years ago.

Hopefully, these unwitting followers, in

turn, would each recruit two or three other sympathizers

who over time could distribute anti-soviet literature and

perform other low-key CA operations, as directed by the

Station,

and which could be attributed to the PRC.

Presumably their actions would result in some local

embarrassment to the USSR

and the PCI.

Second, ARPHONE,

himself, would no doubt enhance his own Maoist credentials-.

Stations had

sufficient case officer strength on hand to direct and

support a tricky operation of this type which might have

only marginal utility, in their view.

As for

probably come upon QRPHONE's "black net" in time, and

could conceivably pose security problems for him.

& general dispatch

an alternative, Mr. Horvath proposed that CA Staff wilte 9 folionalit

apat and indicatins that the stare would take to see to sahe fi

greater use made of ARPHONE's capabilities on the

Continent.

ce that one let prove then and one t

service that QRPHONE might provide them and suggest

the means for accomplishing it.

Mr. Horvath also asked

that, prior to forwarding the

dispatch, a security review

be conducted of this

case.

He did comment that, if the

security

review indicated

no severe compromises of

ORPHONE's cover or personal security, it would be a

pity not to make greater use of this agent's notable

contacts in the European leftist community.

4.

Accordingly, I agreed with Mr. Horvath's two

recommendations; namely, to conduct a security review of

the case and, subsequently, to forward a blanket dispatch

to the Field,

if appropriate.

I mentioned that we would.

still like to raise the possibility of a black operation

posed no objections.

4. The charge is made that ORPHONE is too thinly

spread and there is a recurring urge that his targetting

be better focussed.

Can he in fact be better focussed

on a multi-divisional basis or would focussing,

in

practice, result in his being narrowed down to a primarily:

divisional target?

Granting that the CIA label is somewhat in-

discriminately used for character assassination in the

conspiratorial fringe in which QRPIOVE has been operating,

Isn't he in

fact stuck with this label and in view of

the international

character of this conspiratorial

fringe, won't it turn up wherever he goes?

In this milieu

is there really much chance he will be given any signifi-

cant information (and not deception information) by anyone

who will do so because he wants the information passed

to CIA?

6.

When he was looked into in April 1968 by a

Chicon official, what do we suppose to be meant by the

officials finding that it was not clear if he was

completely reliable in a Marxist-Lenist sense?

How eagerly

sought-after are travelers to China

now-a-days?

What is

forecast as to demand for such

travelers

by next summer?

8.

With a reportedly anti-US, white, British wife

and 3 suall children, how really mobile is QRPHONE in a

Pes sense? If we should move QRPHONE and family to a new

location for a trial period and it didn't work out,

wouldn't resettling him have considerable complications?

In how many languages does QRPHONE have verbal

and written fluency?

10. What are the current clearance limitations upon ;.

our use of QRPHONE?

11.

One gathers from the project renewals that

ORPHONE'S CIA status is known

that Rodigast was under some suspicion.

QRPHONE has

entrance at the border by the Swiss

authorities.

Does anyone doubt that in view of the

groups and individuals he contacts on his travels he

has a dossier in each of these countries?

Does anyone

doubt that in many of these dossiers the alleged CIA

connection is recorded?

In view of this,

isn't it a

fact

that probably the safest place for him to be contacted

is London, in spite of whatever tradecraft he and

Bodigast may practice?

In spite of a rapport and back-

ground knowledge clements which he undoubtedly benefits

from with Rodigast, are these factors worth the extra

handling complications? Doesn't this handling method

essentially double the cost of the operation?

12.

What were the reasons for the break with "Fair

Play

for Cuba?" the break with Verges?

DOeS ORPHONE

have a power base at all among Acerican negroes (SNCC

doesn't like him and it is recorded in the renewals that

blacks and revolutionaries sense that he is not "sincere")?

13. Can't we determine right here at Headquarters

the degree of intorest

in having

a rather low-level propaganda operation involving anti-

Soviet propaganda ostensibly emanating from pro-Chicom

sources?

Now that the PRC has decided to go "legit,"

what is our best estimate as to the likelihood that they

w1ll lose interest in previous and current pro-Chicom

fringe groups?

Other than on the above, if we asked ORPHONE

to become involved in depth with one of the groups he

1s in touch with, wouldn't he have to act "more Royalist

than the King," and wouldn't he be the first to come

under suspicion in case action against the group pointed

15. If he could not take covert action himself

through

such a group to what extent are we now or

potentially likely to become involved with covert

action by other groups against:

- African liberation novements

What are QAPHOVE's real talents? Why hasn't

Is it because of the

targets we keep pushing him on?

What is meant by these

allusions to ORPHONE'S

"work discipline?"

Do his talents

possibly point toward some covert action use in a role

where the CIA label is relatively less important?

constitutional problen with their responsibilities to IDEN.

The idea

of passing out political inforuation on exiles is repulsive to him."

If should be noted for the record that JAGUAR itself has not given

such an explanation to JELANCE, but, knowing JAGUAR's bureaucratic

position and its traditionally conservative role in the SAURANGE

Cosmity, It say bo tbat JAGUAR in fact is tius inhibited.

•So As to QRPHONE/L, SMOVID on 15 June 1970 followed up his March

2970 complaints to JADüIN about QRPHONE/l's contacts with expatriates

in London.

SHOVID expressed JAGUAR's concern about aRPlinhE/l's security

and 18s view that QRPHONE/l's information was of icarginal value.

SHOVID

exphasizing that ho vas exprossing a view personally endorsed by

SHUrSILON, outlined three possible options:

vithdraw QFPiONt/l from

the country; stop running and tasting ORPHONE/l as

an agent; or have

JAGUAR take OvEr the running of ORPHONE/1.

(ORPHONE/1 subsequently was

instructed to stop pursuing his SMORANGE targets.)

Thus JILANCE is styalod. The question is whether there is

anything that can bo done

to inprove the situstion.

The une new factor

in the equation that possibly could be used to reopen the discussion

with a vion to aacliorsting the situation is the fact that there non

is a different IDEN than when the February 1970 SMOTH explanation was

offered.

Even though JAGUAR has not specific..lly given that explana-

-ELon,. to JEANCE, tho Station, uithout reference to SUTHl's explana-

rosunably could clect.to reopen the discussion in terms or i

possibla change of atmosphere sinco the change of IdEN.

such a dis-

cussion at least should give an indication of whether

he would appreciate

recalving bandon Station's viers on this subject.

Ono final point that should be noted is that MCGRILLEN, in

forMarding the above-mentioned JAGUAR report on 24 December 1970,

montionod that visiting ZIBET officor Jerchy !:. FREYMARK recently had

Biscussed those JULANCe require scats in London with SMOVlit was

and SHEVICT end that it was MCGILLEN's understanding that

to selected

targets on which there is evidence of coup plutting or subversion."

MCGRILLEN added that he looked forward to any followup questions based

on tho abovo criteria that Headquartors wanted the Station to submit to

JAGUAR.

FREYMARX's recollection of his talks with JAGUAR is at slight

vardenco with ACGRILLEN's account.

FREYMARK recalls that he had agreed

STATUS:

Agreement)

Q/1 does free lance journalism and

1s an occasional contributor to several magazines and newspapers.

'OVERT JOB DESCRIPTION: Singleton agent targeted at the radical left

ncluding Maoist, African liberation

and Palestinian groups.

Q/l's access derives fron his many contacts in these circles.

PERFORMANCE OF COVERT DUTIES: Q/1 continues to perform well and

without posing problens for his handler.

His personality is

easy-going and his attitude positive.

If his efforts are not

always totally successful - leaving us with tantalizing bits

of information and many unanswered questions - this is generally

due to operational circumstances in which he was simply unable

to elicit more information on a giyen subject.

PERFORMANCE OF OVERT DUTIES: Q/1 does a solid and workmanlike job

as a journalist.

He has acquitted himself well both as a

representative of his cover firm and in his free lance activity.

Occasional prompting on this subject produces added effort and

In this connection the operation profits particularly from the

energy and knowledge of the deep-cover agent handler who himself

has faced similar cover demands over many years.

ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: ORPHONE/l's attitude is positive. (See below

under lotivation.)

72120150513

ATTITUDE TOWARD COVER EMPLOYER: Q/l's attitude is good. He has made

an eriort to discharge his part of the cover arrangement and to

understand the weaknesses and problems which plagued his former

cover organization. He is approaching his new cover arrangement

MOTIVATION IN ACCEPTING JKLANCE RELATIONSHIP: This is a subject on

which a good deal has beensaid over the course of this operation.

The following points can be made on the subject of Q/1's

notivation:

A. His basic imago of JILANCE is positive.

• SECRET

## Page 95

B. This image of JKLANCE as à powerful, professional

organization has

been enhanced in Q/l's case by the

which require

circumstances of his agent relationship'as probably come

very professional handling.

Indeed. Q/1

to hold a rather glamorous

"storybook" image of JKLANCE

and of the importance of his contribution to the JKLANCE

effort.

This is a very human trait and should not be

exaggerated in his case,

but every one of the wild anti-

JKLANCE stories which he heard probably only serves to

accentuate the feeling

on his part of being a member of

a very impressive outfit..

C. In his political evolution over the years, @1

has become active in at least two "causes".

In both

Instances he saw these causes undermined by petty jealousy

and factional struggles and in both cases he was personally

The product of this situation has been

a certain disillusionment with "causes" and a cynical political

(In other circumstances this might be called

political maturity.) Q/l now tends to view political trends

as a detached observer rather than a participant.

Following on the foregoing thought is the fact

that he is an

American (and does not consider himself

disloyal).

Given his citizenship and his disinclination to

feel "involved" in the currents of the radical left, he

has been perfectly willing to accept employment by JKLANCE

to report on those currents.

He does not give any indication

that he views this as "squealing"

on his friends -- indeed

the contrary seens to be the case.

On a more mundane level, it must be realized that

Q/1 was recruited at a

time when he was in serious financial

He was without a job and was living off the charity

of his wife's family.

JKLANCE has given him a job, paid

him reasonably well

and regularly, and has enabled

F.

Having accepted JKLANCE employment for a combination

of the reasons set forth above, it must be added that Q/1

clearly likes his work.

issues and political subjects.

the opportunity to exercise his language capability..

short,

the rather sophisticated and cosmopolitan life which

he has been able to live appeals to him.

In assessing the relative importance of these

several factors which make up Q/l's motivation, the under-

signed would stress that C and E were probably the immediate

causes of his acceptance of recruitment while A and D were more

underlying. B and I have arisen since recruitment and

probably play an important role in his current motivation.

WIFE'S ATTITUDE TOWARD JKLANCE: Q1's wife is not witting of his

JKLANCE affiliation.

She was allowed to believe that he was

working indirectly for the Chinese.

-She certainly is aware

of the

past JKLANCE accusations which have been leveled at.

Q1, but as jar as u1 can determine land this is not a subject

on which he can come right out and ask a direct question) she

continues to accept the Chinese story.

"It should be added.

that Mrs. Q/1 is British and is the holder of some rather

typical "left" anti-JKLANCE attitudes. It should also be noted

that the relationship between the two is fraught with a variety

of problems thereby adding to the complexity of the situation.

Certainly the whole subject. of Q/l's activities is one which

Urs. O/l views with misgivings and which is simply not discussed -

lest it lead to acrimony. Mention should also be made that

Ars. Ql seems to accept as legitimate the small amount of

noney received from Ql's cover and to regard this as a genuine

stringer relationship.

RESPONSE TO CASE OFFICER HANDLING: QRPHONE/1 has a very pleasant

personality and responds well to Case Officer handling.

a most willing asset requiring no special handling care -- other

than the normal professionalism expected in the handling of a

sensitive asset such as @l.

WILLINGNESS TO ACCEPT INSTRUCTIONS OR GUIDANCE: Q/1 is willing to

accept guidance and criticism -- provided it is constructive.

If anything, he may sometimes be too willing.

occasionally exceeds his sense of security and it then falls

to his handler to bear in mind security and/or operational

considerations which may affect his pursuit of a given target.

However, this should not be over dramatized.

RESPONSIVENESS: Q/1 is most responsive to requirements levied upon

him.

this connection it should be recalled that his ability

to respond fully is usually restricted by the nature of his

relationship with his informants; l.e., since he is only eliciting

the information from unwitting informants he is rarely able to

press for all the desired details.

JKLANCE CONTROL: Q/1 is dependent upon a JKLANCE salary and he has

signed recruitment documents and a security pledge.

to add that Q/l is not a handling problem and there has never

been any instance in which either he or his handler has had

to allude to these control factors.

PERSONAL SECURITY: Q1 has a good sense of personal security and his

As cited above, Q/l's enthusiasa sometimes leads to his failure

OTHER SECURITY AND COVER SITUATIONS: The past allegations of Q/l's

affiliation with JKLANCE, many pre-dating his actual recruitment,

add an extra dimension to @l's cover situation.

We have no

indication that any of these allegationg are based on any proof,

nox have they produced a siguificant reduction in his numver of

contacts.

ABILITY TO WORK WITHOUT SUPERVISION: Q/1 1s a self-starter and can

work well for extended periods without supervision.

ADHINISTRATIVE REQUIREMENTS: QI poses only a minimum administrative

He is not

overly concerned about his administrative

and financial position, allowances, payments, etc.

He merely

expects JKLANCE to do the fair thing by him. However, on the

rare occasion when JKLANCE has failed to perform as he expected,

he can be very upset.

REPORTING:

style.

PERSONAL ENERGY AND ENDURANCE: Q/l is quite energetic and can continue

his efforts on a sustained basis.

LANGUAGES:

In addition to his (native) English, @1 can speak French,

Talian and German.

WILLINGNESS TO TRAVEL: Q1 1s quite w1lling to travel -- and even

enjoys it!

AREA KNOWLEDGE: Q/1 is quite widely travelled in Europe and Africa

and consequently has acquitted an extensive area knowledge.

ADHINISTRATIVE AND FINANCIAL ABILITY: Ql's present operating context

does not provide an adequate basis to evaluate these talents.

areas, however.

WEAKNESSES; PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL: Q/1 has no major weaknesses,

either personal or professional which inhibit his operational

The existence of his "reputation" as a JKLANCE asset --

which is believed by some and rejected by others of his contacts

1s a definite limitation on his employment.

÷. CAREER POSSIBILITIES: Ql has mentioned to his handler that he hopes

to be able to make a career of his relationship with JKLANCE.

the combination of the security factors operative in this

case and the unlikelihood of @l's continued access to targets

of interest over a prolonged period argue against his being

regarded as a career asset.

COMMENTS OF SUPERVISOR: This is another thoughtful evaluation of this

agent,

and reflects the views of the agent handler as well as

of the

Case Officer.

I doubt that we have really divined @l's motivations for working

with JKLANCE, and this evaluation should be read as the best stab

vo can make at this enignatic subject.

4. ORPHOR/1 quite quickly got into the spirit of the training

and by the end of the first session was obviously enjoying it end

appreciating the opportuity to learn to write our way.

He pointed

out that his big problen is having to retein suostantial amounts of

information in his head for two or three weeks, then put it all down

the night before he reets his Case Officer:

Fron his conversation,

it appeared that organizing a report had never occurred to him before

und he several times said "no one ever toid de aout this", "this is

the first I've learned of this, etc." These things were said in happines feder e

at having discovered ways of improving his reporting and simulteneously

making his reporting less of a chore and nore oi a joy.

For the record we are forwarding, u/s/c,

a copy of the

letter to QRPHONE/1 from his Paris lawyer which outlines the

status of QRPHONE/l's action against Jacques Verges.

As Head-

quarters will recall this letter was used by @RPHONE/l to

good advantage in conncction with his recent trip to algiers.

The letter says, in effect, that Verges has proposed a settle-

ment of the matter and has agreed to pay this settlement in

Algerian dinars.

Needless to say, QRPHONE/l has yet to receive

payment.

Nevertheless QRPHONE/l's purposes are well served by

this attestation of Verges' expressed willingness to pay, with

its implied admission of guilt.

At their most recent meeting ORPHOTE/ reported to RODIGAST

during his recent visit to

• The loss occurred on 8 November in the departure lounge at

Airport as QRPHONE/1 was waiting to board AP 822 for London

(leaving at 1755 hours) • ORPHONE/1 had shown his passport to the im-

migration officials when he entered the lounge.

He then went to the

duty free shop to purchase a bottle of Scotch and a carton of cigarettes

for his wife (she smokes Galoises). He presumes that his passport slipped

from his pocket during the process of producing his wallet to pay for

these items.

At any rate he did not discover the loss until the flight

was airborne.

2. QRPHONE/l had no difficulty re-entering Britain using his Home

Office Certificate of Registration.

He reported the loss to Air France

immediately but as of his meeting with

RODIGAST on 13 Novenber it had

not been located.

On 10 November QRPHONE/l went to the U.S. Embassy in London

and obtained a new passport (the number of this passport is IDENTITY -

w/s/c) :

We advised CHALEMSKY, of Paris Station, of this loss during

his visit to ICPIPIT on 14 November.

• All of the above ligures are tax free. In addition, as of 1 May 1969, Subject

was given an additional $50 per month (also tax free) as our contribution

toward some form of losurance againet the future (endowment, lump sum

cash valus, or whatever the Fleld and he finally selected). This appears on

the books as a salary inerease. However, although to his ultimato advantago.

It doea reBult ln a small déeroado in take-borno pay since Dil la aino required

to make a contribution to the payment of the premiam.

2. In additios, Ol's MOC also provides for $10, 000 indemnification in

case of death, or payment of $600 per month up to $10, 000 to his mlle la case

of his total Incapacitation or disappearance while employed by CIA. Allowance

had originally been made for this provision when he seemed to have an excellent

chance for travel to Peking; this year me included the provision as a general

benefit, not tied to say particular type of hazardous travel alone. Finally.

this year's amendment to hle MOC also included a severance bonus of one

month's salary for each year of satisfactory service. We placed $3, 200 la a

speclal escrow account to cover his previous four years' service, and are

providing in our Project renewals for each year's required deposit to that

escron account. Please note, however, that this benefit has not yet been

sarfaced elther to ORPHONE/l or to RODIGASI, by decision of ICPIPIT (a

decialon which I believe was wiso).

3. It le my foeling that the proposed salary lncrease of $250 tax free

por month is way out of line. I bellere that paragraph 3 of the reference,

comparing@/l with a hypothetieal GS-12 is a rather speclous and unrealistic

asgamest. Q/l, although an Americas, is as agent, and sothlag more, and as

you note la your penciled comment the question of quarters, allowances, and

perlodie stop Increase ls not relevant. In addition, ubile I do sot subscribe

to some of the criticisms that have been leveled at his productios, the fact

remains that I bive not seen any marked improvement during the past two

years la the guallty of the material he provides us. No time goes on and

the realistle criteria of what lo disseminable and what is not are applied

more and more to his production, and this production in turn remains at lta

present lovel of superficiality, we will see less and less of it qualily for

dissemination. Since he is an Fl agent, this has considerable significanco,

although it of courso does not present the full picture of his capabilities. His

operational Intelligence has been received with mixed evaluations; usually

his Initial coverage of a subject is very well recelved and often whets the

appetito of the rocipient for more; somehow, however, that "more" sever

seems to materialize - they get more of exactly the same caliber, but

little more in terms of depth of reporting. Perhaps the fault lies la ORPHONE /L.

In which case we should realize early that what we have here is not a truo

Fl agent, but a sort of "operational Intelligence butterlly." Perhaps, on the

other hand, the fault lies In RODIGAST'& handling of the man, not in terms of

the personal relatlonship which RODIGAST has been able to build up with him,

but maybe even because of that relatlonship. I remember when I first talked

with RODIGAST I quickly realized that he felt he knew more thas Headquarters

as to what was important for Qll to cover and what was not; I am sorry l

missed RODIGAST on his TDY here and when I was In London, and that his

home leave has been postponed, for I had hoped to determine for myself

whether RODIGAST still feit that way. Whitever the reason, I am by no means

giving up on Q1, but will continue to try to narrow down his targets so that

he will have a falr shake at showlng what he can do when he ls not allowed to

cover the waterfront.

4. What the above paragraph ls leading up to, ls that I do not in all

honesty feel that he has done anything to really deserve a promotion, except

bulld longevity sInce the last one, and perhaps not follow up (actively) on that

namspapor job offared to him (bis preference, in any event). However, I do

realize that a man must have an lacentive, and would like to propose that we

suggest to ICPIFIT that a more realistic increase might be in the neighborbood

of $100 a month, and that the severance bonus mentioned in paragraph 2 above

might now be surfaced both to RODIGAST and to Q/l as a new benefit.

SUMMARY O7 OPERATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS DURING PERIOD:

pursuant to plans

developsa as a rcsult of Mario R. LUEBBERI'S IDY, ORPHONE/l made a

continuing effort to deepen his contacts with various African person-

alities connected with the "London group". Although som? progress has

been made with persons who seen of secondary importance, QRPHONE/1 still

is unable to gain the confidence of the central characters such as Dennis

Phombeah and Oscar Kambona.

2461822270

ORPEONY's one week stay in the U.K. was a week of intense activity for

QRPHONE/1 and saw his local "credentials" put to a most demanding test.

ORPHONE/ performed extremely well throughout the week. See OELA - 51297

for details.

Sce OEPA - 2037, 2099 und 2123.

Following

an overature from a U.S. newspaper QRPHONE/1 made a quick trip

to New York to consult with Headquarters officers regarding the impli-.

cations of this overature on his RVROCK status. See ICPIPIT 4222 and

Through two unwitting female informants ORPIONE/l was able to obtain re-

porting on the Algiers Cultural Pestival. See DELA - 51298.

RROEONE/1 has continued his monitoring of the activity of various African

liberation novement figures in London.

2.

SPECIFIC MATTERS OF OPSPATIONAL SECURITY AND COVER: ORPHONE/l's vacation

in Italy with his

family produced a marked improvement in his domestic

situation - with its consequent impact upon the cover and security of the

entire operation.

This renains a matter of concern and one which will be

carefully monitored.

QRPURE is now entering into a more meaningful overt correspondence with

ORPHONE/, including discussions of his participation in the

Of ORPURE.

A new means of funding QRPHONE/l's salary is being sought to replace BIKNEE,

which is no longer functioning due to unrelated problems encountered by the

principal agent of

that operation.

• For a review of the security implications

of this matter (which are thought to be minimal) please see DIRECTOR 46178.

ESTIMATE OF AGENT'S CONTINUED DEGREE OF ACCESS TO TARGETS: QRPHONE/1'g

access to his various targets remains substantially unchanged.

EXTENT TO WHICH AGENT FAS BEEN ABLE TO SERVICE ASSIGNMENTS. INCLUDING

INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTION: QRPHONE/l has approached all his assignments with

enthusiasn and energy. He has fulfilled these assignments to the maximun

degree feasible - given his cover and the unwitting informant-type nature

of his relationship with his many contacts. ORPHONE/1 mixes every effort.

to overcome this limitation and in this regard a plentiful supply.of back-

ground information greatly facilitates his elicitation of added details

However, this linitation is one wnich will always

be with us in the case of ORPHoNe/l and it is one which can sonctimes be

particularly frustrating. During the past quarter ORPHONE/1 has been the

sourco of 11 intolligence reports prepared ly ICPIPIT/reports.

SPECIFIC REQUIRE ENTS LEVIED UPON AGENT FOR ENSUING PERIOD:. ORPHONE/ 1

will make a trip to Italy in late Septenber and early October in order to

survey the situation within the Italian new left/radical sector.

This

trip is one which has been requested by Rome Station. (The trip will have

been completed by the time thir. report is received by licadquarters.)

ORPHONE/l's contact with an official of the Eritrean Liberation Front led

to a IDY by AP Division officer Geoffrey B. DRANSTON to brief ICPIPIT on

the ELF and to discuss possible opsrational exploitation of this contact.

ORPHONE/l's trip to the United States has been deferred until spring 1970

by which time any possible repercussions from QRPEONY's roturn will be

relatively unlikely.

An effort will be made to explore the operational possibilities posed by

ORPHONE/l's existing (or potential) contacts within the Arab liberation

movements. Headquarters views on this matter were requested in OEPA-2044.

A re-scheduling of ORPHONE/l's trip

has been proposed and

Hear?guarters and

have been asked for guidance/requirements.

ASENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO ASSIG KENTS LEVIED INCLUDING MOTIVATION,

PERSONAL SECURITY.

ORPHONE/l's response to assignuents, like his

performance, continues to be enthusiastic and energetic.

The connents

made in previous quarterly reporting regarding his security and motivation

remain valid insofar as RODIGAST and ICPIPIi are able to judge.

AGENT'S PERSONAL RESPONSE TO CASE OFICER HANDLING OR CRITIQUE OF HIS

REPORTING TECHNIQUE:

ORPHONE/l has a very pleasant personality and

lates easily to others. This is a positive factor in his elicitation of

information from his many contacts and also makes dealing with him a

pleasant and uncomplicated experience.

ORPHONE/l accepts case officer

handling - including direction and criticisn - well and in a constructive

The same holds true of critique of his reporting Please see pre-

vious reporting on this subject for added details.

ADMINISTRATIVE MATTERS, INCLUDING PROVOTIONS, TRAINING: A new means of

funding QRPHONE/1's salary is now being devised. This has been the subject

of several items of correspondence between Headquarters and ICPIPIT.

plan to consult with the

representative

on this matter.

ORPHONE/1 has had some purely overt problems with his Chicago bank (an

apparent error in his statement, etc.) He is also being charged very high

service charges for the performance of routine transfers. If he is not

able to resolve his problems with this bank it may be necessary for him

At ICPIPIT's insistance QRPHONE/1 has begun to invest a portion of his

monthly salary in a reputable Mutual Fund of his choice.

As previously reported, we related to JAGUAR the incident

In which Lionel Morrison is believed to have searched

• ORPHONE's papers while the latter was out of town.

As you know, there have been some indications in the past

which might be taken to suggest that Morrison was a JAGUAR

contact - he works for the Daily Telegraph and seens to

be in touch with

and on one occasion provided

ORPHONE with a report (on ORPEONY) which came almost

simultaneously from JAGUAR. Clearly, this does not add up

to much of a case, and we could hardly conceive that JAGUAR

would be involved

in the harrassment of QRPHONE.

Even if

there was no JAGUAR contact with Morrison, however, we felt

it might be possible that JAGUAR could add to our understanding

of this peculiar development fron sources available to their

own net.

JAGUAR's reply is as follows

crypt for QRPHONE):

1. As addresses are aware QRPHONE/1 has officially been

denied entry into Switzerland since 16 December 1963.

This order

was issued in connection with his employment with Identity A.

which was then receiving money fron the Chinese--in violation of

Swiss neutrality.

A similar order was also issued at that time

for Identity B, who was the Editor of Identity A.

2.

It is now

some six years later and QRPHONE/1 (at least

overtly) is employed as a legitimate journalist.

He is not a

member of any group which is proscribed by the Swiss authorities--

although, of course, he maintains contact with a wide variety of

leftist

individuals

in pur. uit of his operational tasks.

ORPHONE/1

has noted that Identity B has been allowed back into Switzerland--

in connection with his defense of Arab terrorists and feels that

if the Swiss are willing to do this for Identity B then they should

also lift the ban on his entry into Switzerland.

ORPHONE/ 1

obviously feels personally about this,

and it may be that future

operational benefit could be gained if QREHIONa/1 were again able

to enter Switzerland.

3. We are forwarding under separate cover a copy of a report

written by QRPHONE/1 following his contact with the Swiss Embassy

in London on this matter.

We are also forwarding under separate

cover a copy of the letter which he sent the Embassy in which he

formally states his request that the entry ban be lifted.

4. You will note that the Swiss Embassy suggested that

ORPHONE/1 work through the U.S. Embassy on this matter. We have

told oRPHONe/l not to do this, but rather to deal directly with

the Swiss. If he needs certification of his status as a working

journalist we suggested that QRPHONE/1 obtain this from the appro-

¿site gzofessioral organization (of which he is a member) in

5. We presume that the Swiss Embassy in London will be

forwarding QRPHONE/1's letter to Bern.

We will appreciate being

advised of any Swiss action, or statements, on this case which

may come to the attention of 3ern Station.

Any advice which Bern

Station can offer regarding QRPHONE/l's pursuit of this matter

will be welcome.

6. Of course Bern Station should continue to be guided by

the contents of DIRECTOR-69543 in any dealings with the Swiss

concerning ORPHONE/ 1.

МИСКОНЫМ

On 12 March 1969 QRPHONE/1 was granted an extension on his

British visa valid until 15 Pebruary 1970.

2.

Since ORPHONE/l's file at the Home Office indicates an

interest on the part of JAGUAR in his case, JAGUAR was consulted

prior to the issuance of the extension. (This is not unusual in

the cases of persons such as QRPHONE/1 and does not necessarily

imply an "agent" status.

Of course WOFIRM is not mentioned at all

in this file.) In coordination with London Station it was decided

that a re-newal of QRPHONE/l's one-year visa was preferable to the

granting of permanent resident status--which would normally have

been the case.

We quote from the appropriate memorandum from JAGUAR

to London Station on this matter:

"The choice was between:-

an extension of two months

b) an extension of one year i.e. a repeat of what

was granted to him last year

that his temporary residence should be made

"unconditional" which would be the normal

procedure if there were no special considerations.

Our feeling was that for QRPHONE/l's cover purposes (c)

would be undesirable; if his friends got to know of it

they might think he was being treated over-generously in

view of his contacts with leftwing revolutionaries such
