The new 21-man cabinet ap-

pears to be a coalition of Arab

nationalist elenents including four

members of the moderate wing of the

Baath Party.

The regime is still

dominated by the military, with eight

cabinet posts.

b.

The new prime minister,

Tahir Yahya, is sympathetic to the

Baath

Party, and both the Baathists

and the Egyptians feel they can

trust him.

c.

The political affiliation

of eight of the new ministers is

not known, but the key interior post

is in the

hands of an anti-Baathist

nationalist.

a. Defense Minister Nasution

has been ordered by Sukarno to make

conciliatory statements on Halaysia

while on his trip abroad.

The Dutch charge who re-

ported this explained that Nasution

was chosen for this job because

Sukarno was irritated with the ultra-

tough line the defense minister has

taken.

The Belgian ambassador

thinks these papers are probably

genuine.

He says the Russians have

made the mistake of underrating the

Congolese and have stumbled into a

surete trap.

The Congolese also picked

up two

Czech diplomats but have since

released them.

This morning they

arrested the correspondent of the

Soviet news agency.

Haile Selassie is planning

to withdraw all Ethiopian troops

from the Congo in January, according

to the commander of his ground forces.

b. The two battalions of

Ethiopians provide the guts of the

UN operation. They had been slated

to stay until June and are likely to

be very difficult to replace.

c. The Emperor reportedly

ordered the withdrawal on grounds

that the troops are urgently needed

in Ethiopia, particularly in view

of the Soviet military accord with

Somalia.

d. Our ambassador has asked

to see the Emperor, as well as the

prime minister and

foreign minister,

to press for reconsideration.

This sort of harassment

stopped in the spring of 1962 when

It now appears that Presi-

dent Arif's role in last Monday's

coup in Baghdad may have been vir-

tually that of a bystander.

Whatever Arif's role may

have been, the coup was primarily

an effort

; by the Iraqi Army to cur-

tail the activities of the extreme

wing of the Baath Party. The Baath

is an Arab nationalist political or-

ganization, active throughout the

Arab

world, which has been ruling

Irag and Syria.

The coup group has not

Syrian Baathists have wel-

15,000, and probably closer to

18,000,

intervening 13 months, leaving, very

roughly, 4,000 to 7,000. Those re-

support. Prince Sihanouk has said

he believes neutralization of South

Vietnam to be the only way to keep

his country and the rest of the area

from falling eventually into Commu-

C. The French feel the same

way.

Indeed, Souvanna Phouna re-

the French were urging him to sup-

of our clandestine sources, the North

As part of the same campaign,

the North Vietnamese have told the

French they believe sentiment is

growing in the US for withdrawal of

US forces.

They reportedly plan to

keep the heat on to encourage it.

Hanoi is at the same time

trying quietly to encourage the belief

that it is ready to be reasonable.

Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-

As is usual in Laos, the

tentative agreement for a cease-fire

fear stepped-up nationalization),

and the military, where the Us re-

neighboring South Vietnam and Thai-

to advantage in past difficulties.

the greater the possibility of major

Vietnamese Communist forces

kept up their high post-coup level

of

activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action

was an attack early yesterday morn-

ing against a US special forces train-

ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

C .

When the smoke cleared after

a sharp fight, four US soldiers were

missing and

at least 35 South Vietnamese

were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the

Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-

porting a government operation in

the extreme south, and damaged twelve

more.

Two more Americans are missing

in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-

gime's troubles with the ambitious

General Ton That Dinh continue.

f. He is still angling to get

control of the important strategic

hamlet program and has yet to give

up command of the Third Corps, which

the generals assigned to another of

their number earlier in the month.

This corps is of particular signifi-

cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

NOTES

A. Oswald

Press stories to the effect that Lee Harvey

Oswald recently visited Mexico City are true, accord-

ing to our information.

Oswald visited both the

Cuban and the Soviet embassies on 28 September.

He

was trying, we are told, to arrange for visas so

that he could travel to

• the USSR via Havana. He

returned to the US on 3 October.

B. Brazil

"A new round of military promotions and re-

assignments will be made public today. The present

instability of the Brazilian political scene is re-

flected in the numerous reports of coup plots which

this event has precipitated.

C.

Soviet range. in-

D.

Algeria

We have a report from a good clandestine

source that a group of army officers is plotting

with Defense Minister Boumedienne to overthrow en

Bella. A growing estrangement between the two has

been apparent for some time, but this is the first

good indication that Boumedienne is making commoi

cause with those who wish to turn Ben Bella out of

office.

Australia - Communist China

Pelping has signed con-

grain to be delivered early next year.

We had been

expecting the Chinese Communists to enter the market,

since they had another mediocre grain crop this year.

Peiping has been buying close to five million tons

of grain for the past several years.

F. * Congo

We hear that the Soviet Embassy in Leopold-

ville had booked 75 places on a flight to Brussels

last Saturday.

There is still no information on-

whether

any Soviet Embassy officials have actually

departed, however.

G.

Berlin

There was no new harassment of Allied ac-

#cess routes to Berlin over the weekend. A total of

16 flares were fired last evening near

Tempelhof

Airfield, but we connect these with Communist ef-

forts to prevent escapes from East Berlin.

German police were observed stringing barbed wire

in the same area a short time later.

H. Laos

The neutralists claim to have made significant

gains in their limited offensive in the Vang Vieng

area.

They have not, however, been able to dislodge.

of the town's airport.

1. Iraq-Syria

a .

The shaky new accommodation

between the two countries following

the recent coup in Iraq has been

threatened by Syria's action in grant-

ing asylum to Ali Saleh Saadi, the

exiled leader of the extremist wing

of the Iraqi Baath.

b. Saadi had arrived in Syria

unannounced following a brief stay

in Madrid. On Friday, Iraq sent a

message asking Syria to expel him on

grounds that sheltering him was a

breach of agreement.

c. Both regimes continue to be

troubled with internal dissension

with affairs in one deeply tangled

with those in the other.

d.

In Syria, as we mentioned

yesterday, the Baathist regime is

split between moderates who desire

a broadening of the government's

power base, and a doctrinaire faction

which wants to keep all control of

the government in Baathist hands.

e. In Irag, the pull is more

away from the Baathists.

Two minis-

ters have threatened to resign unless

the government adopts an openly pro-

Egyptian policy. Nevertheless the

government feels secure enough to

ease up on curfew and transport re-

strictions imposed since the coup.

JFK Act 5 (9) (2) (D)

govern-

ment forces had finally secured Vang

Vieng and its airfield, long held

by the Pathet Lao. They also told

of the capture of Ban Namone farther

south on Route 13.

b.

The neutralist, rightist Lao

Army, and Meo tribal guerrilla forces

hope to sustain their coordinated

clearing action until remaining Pathet

Lao pockets in this area north of

Vientiane are cleared.

C .

Such operations in Laos

have often been followed by a Com-

munist riposte.

We have a few in-

dicators that

something could be up

on the Communist side, but these are

so far very tenuous indeed.

South Vietnam

a.

According to press reports,

Viet Cong attacks on Sunday

wiped

out two of the government's strategic

hamlets in the central highlands about

250 miles north of

Saigon.

b. More than 1,000 inhabitants

in the hamlets--who are minority

tribesmen--are missing and possibly

have fled into the mountains.

They

abandoned a significant quantity of

weapons to the Viet Cong.

c.

These attacks not only sug-

gest continued erosion of the govern-

ment's programs to win over tribal

support, but also signal that stepped-.

up Viet Cong pressure against the new

regime is spreading to the north.

C. The Soviet note was designed

to make a record, showing that the

USSR exercises "control" of the auto-

bahn and that the recent incidents

resulted from US refusal to comply

with "existing procedures."

the Peasant Party, one

Inonu probably would not be prime

The military are working

b. This year's harvest was

clearly very bad. The weight of

evidence suggests that Soviet grain

stockpiles have been far drawn down

this year and are not sufficient to

protect the country from another

poor harvest.

c .

Our estimate is that total

grain production each year since

1958 has been well below that year's

level of 125 million tons, while

the population has continued to grow.

a. We have seen

signs of extensive slaughtering in

anticipation of fodder shortages

during the winter.

This runs counter

to Khrushchev's oft-stated plan to

build up the livestock industry.

e.

We have also noted that

the extensive wheat purchases weaken

the USSR's gold reserves at a time

when it hopes to expand its imports

of machinery for a huge chemical

fertilizer program.

f.

In addition, we have seen

signs of stringent measures to pro-

tect the grain supply, accompanied

by public discontent in some areas

over the absence of bread.

Czech President and party

boss Novotny has gone to Moscow,

evidently for economic talks, judg-

b. Novotny's background of

Stalinist excesses have put him on

the wrong side of Khrushchev. They

also have given rise to control

problems, particularly in the frac-

tious Slovak party where pressures

for liberalization have made their

mark.

Party problems and Novotny's

leadership may thus also come under

review.

d.

A curious sign of the times

is the fact that, although President

Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential

flag has remained up

at the official

residence.

. It might simply have been

an oversight, but the symbolism will

not be lost to the people in Prague.

Cambodia, as expected, has

asked the Geneva co-chairman to call

the Geneva conference participants

together (in Djakarta) to discuss

measures "to ensure the internation-

ally guaranteed and controlled neu-

tralization of Cambodia."

Venezuela

The country's six presiden-

tial candidates have

swung into the

home stretch of their campaigns.

So have the terrorists, who are

still

trying hard to sabotage next Sunday's

vote.

b.

There is little doubt that

the terrorist effort has all-out

Cuban support.

Castro looks on

Venezuela as his prime target in

Latin America and would do everything

in his power to prevent President

Betancourt from finishing his term.

C.

So far, the terrorists have

tried to intimidate the candidates

by harassing political rallies, bomb-

ing their party headquarters in

various cities, and threatening them

with assassination. They have tried

to scare voters from the polls by

creating a general atmosphere of law-

lessness. Kidnappings, like the one

yesterday morning of Colonel Chenault,

are part of the pattern.

d. The government counterattack

is under the personal direction of

Betancourt, who is as determined to

finish out

his term and turn over

power to a freely-elected successor

as Castro is to prevent this.

doubt that the army, hobbled by poor

a. Sihanouk has signed an ac-

A similar agreement with Hanoi is

in the works.

b. These lines are significant

largely as gestures by Peiping and

Hanoi to bolster Sihanouk's sense

a.

President Betancourt is

still determined to hold the national

elections next Sunday, barring a

major catastrophe such as the assas-

sination of one or more of the lead-

ing candidates.

b.

A party cannot substitute

a candidate

for one who does not

survive until election day; the re-

sults of an election held after an

assassination would be challenged

in the courts and probably voided.

c.

Most observers forecast

victory for Raul Leoni of Betancourt's

Democratic Action Party. However,

the election of socialist Jovita

Villalba of the Republican Democratic

Union is a possibility.

d. About one quarter of the

registered voters are youths going

to the polls for the first time, and

they may push up Villalba's total:

Also, the Communists, who have said

they

will boycott the elections, may

vote for Villalba if they believe

their votes will defeat Leoni.

e .

In any event, the period be-

tween the elections and the inaugura-

tion in March will be a bad one.

c. Papadakis is probably ask-

ing the same price for its action as

Basil Mavrolean did recently--removal

of its ships from the US blacklist.

Papadakis operates 19 ships totalling

more than 200,000 tons.

d. Mavrolean's vessels account

for almost half the present British

tonnage calling at Cuban ports and

are the largest single element of

free world shipping to Cuba.

e. The outcome of Mavrolean's

offer is not yet clear.

President-elect Pak Chong-hui's suc-

in

winning control of the unicameral legisla-

ture in Tuesday's elections improves prospects for

smooth operation of the new constitutional govern-

pend

on Pak's willingness to rule with moderation.

If he interprets this victory as a popular mandate

to pursue an aggressive authoritarian program, he

could provoke serious unrest.

President Sukarno's visit

the Indian ambassador to Djakarta.

He assumes

its

purpose is to head off Philippine recognition of

Malaysia.

Thailand Prime Minister Sarit appears to have

Rwanda-Burundi

Prompt action by Burundi security

forces appears to have halted the march of tribal

refugees on Rwanda that we reported yesterday.

There is little doubt that the refugees, who carried

only a handful of modern arms and were poorly organ-

ized, would have been badly mauled by Rwandan troops

vif

they had crossed the frontier.

Election campaigning ended

at midnight, but boosters for the

about streets of Caracas in defiance

of terrorist threats to shoot anyone

who ventured out for the next three

days.

Trinidad to custody in Venezuela.

d. Moscow, for its part, has

apparently stopped thinking about

another gathering of world Communist

party representatives.

e. The feelers it put out

after

the conclusion of the test-

ban treaty were received coldly by

some of the fraternal parties. They

felt such a meeting could only make

matters worse with the Chinese.

f. Indeed, Peiping saw this

to be Moscow's purpose, and when

the idea failed to take hold, the

Chinese took it to be a setback for

Khrushchev personally.

g.

Their reaction to Khrush-

chev's subsequent call for a cessa-

tion of open argument was to press

the offensive, and this they have

been doing in roundly abusive terms

since.

NOTES

A.

South Vietnam

Plans are now afoot to shuffle

South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General

Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best

of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV

Corps) area.

General Dinh, the ambitious Minister

of Security, is still resisting pressure to relin-

quish command of the III Corps area, and is not in-

volved in the current shuffle.

B. Cuba-USSR

There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,

5,000 of these military, according to a bloc offi-

cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana.

The

figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to

7, 000.

Some withdrawals continue.
