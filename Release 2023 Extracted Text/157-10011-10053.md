Mr. Schwarz. Reflecting a minute of the meeting on May

3Id, Present:

General Taylor, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson; Mr.

Gilpatric, General Decker, General Lansdale and General

Craig; Mr. McCone, and Mr. Harvey.

Here I would like to read into the record the entirety

of paragraph 2, which is: "Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on

progress to date, with agent teams and in the general field of

intelligence, including the Opa-locka interrogation center and

the Madsid clandestine interrogation center. He outlined

various difficulties encountered and said the three agent teams

had been infiltrated and the five W/T sets are in place.

Approximately 72 actual or potential reporting sources are

also in place. A significant development is that Major Duque

has refused to allow agents responsive to him to be dispatched

on purely intelligence-gathering missions. (This sort of

attitude had been forecast earlier as a possibility, but it now

assumes particular importance in view of Duque's stature.)"

All right.

Now, having marked these three exhibits, Mr. Harvey, they

surround your visit to Miami when you passed the poisoned pills

to Roselli for assassination purposes.

Now you have testified that when you were in Miami you

did a lot of other things. Could you first state what they

are?

operations, and that I had been previously been

Station in Berlin for a number of years. The only time the

007 comment was ever made to my knowledge was at a Special

Group (Augmented) meeting, and the sort of facetious comment

by the then-Attorney General, why can't you -- and this was a

part of his sort of favorite author was Ian Fleming, and so

on -- why can't you gentlemen get things cooking the way 007

does?

That's the only time I ever recall that being made, or that

type of reference being made.

As far as this business of the firearms is concerned, the

only incident that ever happened on that is the one that I

mentioned a moment ago, gentlemen. There was one occasion wher

as I recall I was at lunch and was called from the Director's

Office and told to go to the White House because of a meeting.

I did happen to be armed at the time, and it occurred to

me as I went in downstairs at the White House that it was most

inappropriate for anybody except the Secret Service officer to

go up to the White House offices armed, so I checked the sidearn

that I had with the Secret Service officer at the desk, and I

picked it up on the way out.

That is the only incident, as far as I know, not only as

far as I know, it is the only incident that ever happened which

even remotely resembles the question you raised.

documents we discussed previously.

After you called Frank Hand about the 13 August memo Eröm

Lansdale, did you talk to anyone else about the part that

you desired excised from that memo?

MI. Harvey. Yes;,I probably mentioned the particular memo

and the excised parts to several people, Mr. Smothers, and

starting with the Director, I am not sure I mentioned that to

him personally or not.

Mr. Smothers. The Director, you mean Mr. McCone?

Mr. Harvey. Yes. If I did not, then I am rather sure

that I briefed Walter Elder to brief the Director on this.

I may also have discussed it with the Director personally.

The memorandum that you have in the record was written

to Helms. I believe that was in part confirmatory of an

oral conversation I had with him. I probably would have

mentioned it, or possibly may have mentioned it to two other

individuals who very possibly could have seen the memorandum

before I did. One wöuld have been Sam Halpern and the other

would have been truce cheater, who is my deputy.

But now on this last answer, Mr. Smothers, I'm just

telling you it would have been logical had I done so. I do

not have any firm recollection.

Ma. Smothers. Do you recall if you discussed it with

any of the other addressees?

Mr. Harvey. No, I do not believe that I did, although
