MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Houston
SUBJECT:
John K. Greaney - Trip Meeting
1. The following people met in my office on 18 February:
03
(Eugene Milligan))
03
Kenneth Heinonen) Central Cover Staff
(Richard Umstead)03
Raymond G. Rocca, CI Staff
Ward K. Greene, Office of Security
John K. Greaney
It was a good meeting. No disagreement on any points. John is
the team captain at Milligan's request. No polygraph unless
03 Roberts volunteers for it, and even then this will be sent back
to Headquarters for approval before it happens.

2. The question was raised whether John should give
a general picture of the problem involving (Roberts to Dave
Murphy. Ward Greene, Gene Milligan) and Ray Rocca objected
strongly (Milligan stated that he had filled in John Hart. This
was satisfactory to all concerned. Subsequently, John met with
someone recently returned from Paris who indicated there were
active plans being worked on in Paris for utilization of Roberts) 03
and he thought it would be very helpful if Murphy were filled in.
John was then requested to discuss this with Hart, which he did.
Hart specifically requested that John give Murphy the general
picture since it could affect plans, both as to utilization and
building cover arrangements.

Gene Milligan Milligan called later and still indicated he thought
it inadvisable for John to talk to Murphy. I informed him of the
above, and he said this changed his position, that John Hart's
interests were paramount.
4. In view of the other strong objections, I leave with you
the question of whether you wish to notify Howard Osborn and Ray
Rocca that John plans to fulfill Hart's request unless cable notifica-
tion to the contrary reaches him.

Mr. Houston:
A little addition to Mr. Warner's note to you regarding
Mr. Greaney's trip. It was agreed that unless there was something
startling, no reports are to be sent on their interrogation of
Roberts.
