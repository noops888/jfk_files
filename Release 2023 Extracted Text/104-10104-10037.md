THAT IF PROGRAM MEETS THEIR STANDARDS IT SHOULD BE BROADCAST.

BELIEVE THIS IS OPTIMUM PRACTICAL COURSE IN AVOIDING BOTH

APPEARANCE OF ANY PRESSURE ON WNYW AND ANY UNNECESSARY

ADVERSE REACTION BY AMSTRUT-2 AT THIS MOMENT.

3. CONCUR REF PARA 1 RE IMPORTANCE OF AMSTRUT-2

CONTINUING TO FEEL OBLIGATION IS BEING HONORED. NEXT MEETING

WITH BARKER, WHICH HOPE TO HAVE NEXT WEEK, PLAN TO SAY THAT

ON BALANCE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE. PROGRAM CONTINUE IN VIEW

PAUCITY PROPAGANDA GOING TO CUBA AGAINST CASTRO. WHILE THERE

*NO OVERRIDING NATIONAL INTEREST, WE CONSIDER IT IMPORTANT BUT

DECISION ON CONTINUATION IS STRICTLY UP TO WNYW.. ALSO, PLAN TO

SAY, IF WNYW DECISION IS TO DISCONTINUE PROGRAM, OUR UNDER- *

STANDING IS THAT AMSTRUT-2 IS A VERY VOLATILE LATIN TYPE AND:

WE WOULD ADVISE HANDLING MATTER DIPLOMATICALLY AS POSSIBLE IN

ORDER TO SAVE THEMSELVES FUTURE TROUBLE POSSIBLY

ANY REACTION FROM BARKER AFTER NEXT MEETING. N
