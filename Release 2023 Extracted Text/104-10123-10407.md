From early December 1965 through May 1966, Messrs. James W. McCord,

JI., Alan F. Petit, and William M. Marcy, of the Technical Division,

Office of Security, spent many off-duty hours in experimentation with

various items of equipment in an effort to improve and strengthen the

Agency's Audior itermeasures Program.24They conceived and developed

which is considered to be

a major breakthruugh in the detection of clandestine microphones and

other devices targeted against the Agency. It gives the Agency for 24

the fist time the capability tol

a capability for which the intelligence community has expended

large sums of money to develop in a variety of approaches. This tech-

nique will not only benefit the security of all Agency installations

at home and abroad, but will be of utmost benefit to other agencies

in the community.

This technique was met with wide acclaim by the

intelligence community and the Technical Security Countermeasures

Committee.

To further enhance the use of this equinent, these

reycloped an inconspicuous, easily transportable package z4

casisting of two attache cases which hold thel

equipment, wall racks, and motor units.

This makes it

possible for an audio-countermeasures team to enter offices,

residences, and safehouses without undue attention.

These men have shown great ingenuity and resourcefulness

in the application and developnent of this audio-counterneasure.

Through their further efforts in package design they

contributed significantly to the future clandestine use of this

technique on a world-wide basis.

This technique provides the

Agency for the first time a procedure through which large in-

terior Fall surfaces, room furnishings, and objects can be

rapidly scanned in "real time" in the search for hostile tech-

nical penetrations. This capability will significantly enhance

the security of all Agency installations.
