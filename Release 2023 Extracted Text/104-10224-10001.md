MEMORANDUM FOR:

Fred:

Director of Personnel

The facts behind the question raised with the

Dircutor by Mr. Maksymec on Saturday, 26 April, are,

according to him, as follows.

After NPIC had done its fine work during the

Cuban

missile crisis it appears that two different types

of recognition were given.

Determinations wore made

first on certain individuals whose contributions were

such that they should receive an agency medal award.

A

second group of some 200 were then

identified for their

level of contribution and received some kind of certifi-

cate from the White House signed by the President.

NT.

Maksymec was

In the latter group and espouses the cause

that a "special medallion"

should have been given along

with the White House certificate.

Nr. Rob Gaynor also

spoke to me on this matter on

Saturday, and has a good

recollection on the whole matter.

Will you do what you can on the matter and pre-

pare me a letter to be sent to Mr. Matsymec?

MIMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUEJECT: Mr. Muroslav Maksymled - Ketired Employee

The meeting vith Mr. Makaymlee on 6 May 1975 was to sa:isty his

request to revier bis offiolal personnel sile (this matter va

tetog treated' in the manner of a request under the Freedo at

Incormation Ast).

. Location: Main Reception Interview Rosa at

Readquarters Building - 3.p.u.

The duration of the neeting was one (1) hour of which tire

At. Makeymise used approsimately 7 to 8 minutes to quietly shao-.

thou the OPF. It is my lepression that he was ourprised: 1) se

nere allowing his to

see all the material in the file (he described

rividly, a 1971 unpleasant encounter with Mr. Echols; the Direstor

o1 Fersonnel, who refuser to show him a document and would anir

read to him a small portion iron lt - this caused his request and

sudsequent Interviev with the DCI, Mr. Helma), and 2) at tbe

reality that the file contsined nothing actually derogatory

(he stated he had seen and aigned the fitness reports so these

represented nothing unknowa).

The major portion of the time was consumed ln my listezing

to: his. evalustion aud assessment of the varlous supervisorg and

co-sorters at NPIC and their shortcomings. He regaled me with

muda of his background and history with the military and 1n1:1al

application and entrance on duty with the Agency; his persosa!

acquaintance and relationships vith notables - a former Amerisaa

Astassador to Ethlopia, Joseph Simonson, the imperor of suhiopia,

several Generals and Congressional personalitles, Mr. Helms and

Mr. Arthur Lundahl, and his nembership in the Explorer Club.

- 1

Presently he is Vice President for Sales of the Environenial

Coating Industries Corporation located In Annandale, VIrginia -

the company removes corrosion and stains from surfaces. He

offered the company services at the 1974 Alumni session, to

clean the stains from the Nathan Hale statue at the froat of tbe..

building, at a cost of $300. He plans to rollow-up on his pra-

posal, since he has

not heard anything

from the Agenzy.

## Page 28

14-00000

He mentioned that Mr. Blake, at the direction of the DCI,

(1975 Alumni Day) sas to explore and advise him (Makeynlec) of the

posalbility of strlking and 1s8uing a medal to about 200 Agency

personnel (of whom he la one) for their participation in sertain

aspects of the 19,2 Butan crials.

Our meeting ended with Mr. Maksymlec indicating he had no

Intention of "going after anybody,

"but he was curious what was in.

h1s file, and that vas the basis for asking to see it.

COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

I concur with the rater's comments.

We have been making every effort

to aid Mr. Maksymiec in becoming an asset to RED as a laboratory technician.

To date, there has been little noticeable progress; in fact, the temper out-

bursts menticned above indicate a deteriorating condition.

Unless this

situation improves, it may be necessary to recommend teruination action.

As. I have stated in previous comments, it's unfortunate that he cannot

find a position which takes advantage of his expertise in photography, since

this would go a long way to resolving his problems.

lirat-lovel supervision to idlow him to learn the skills required to perform

these duties.

To insure that he is given every opportunity to perform in his new

section, uritten assigments and accomplistments will be submitted on a

daily basis.

In line with previous reports, it ls still felt that Mr. Maksymiec is

essentially mis-assigned

as he is an expert photographer and should be assiened

in some area where his skill can be utiliced to its sullest extent.

GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY

WARMINOTON, 0.6.20008

SOUCATIONAL ANO PATCMOLOGICA:

August 24, 1906

Name: Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksymicc

Mr. Myroslaw A. Maksynies, age 49, came to this Burcau on August 1,

1966, in connection with the Veterans Administration's educational

vocational counseling progran for former servicemen.

Mr. Maksymice is

married, has two children, ages five and eight, and

is employed by a federal

goverrunental agency as a photographic research technician (GS 09/3).

retired From the United States Any in 1961 in the grade of Master Sergeant

after serving for over 20 ycars with primary duties as an intelligence

photographer. His education includes eight years of formal schooling, a

high school completion equivalence certificate, and additional courses with

the Graduate School, Department of Agriculture,

and the United States Armed

Forces Institute. Mr. Maksymice stated that he was interested in further

education at the college level in order to improve himself both personally

and professionally in a field related to his present vocational activities.

In addition to several conferences with the undersigned, Mr. Maksymiec

was administered a battery of educational and vocational tests.

contains the results.of these conferences ind tests, the results of which

should not be interpreted either as conclusive or final.

considered primarily as indications of various psychological factors that

should be seriously considered by Mr. Maksymicc in making decisions concer-

ning his educational and vocational goals.

In order to determine Mr. Maksymiec's fields of vocational interest

he was given the Kuder Vocational Preference Record.

When compared to a

representative group of men

in the national popuiation, Mr. Maksymiec in-

dicated that his interests are significantly similar to persons who are

engaged in computational, scientific, and literary activities.

Men who have

interests similar to Mr. Maksymiec's

are found in various enginccring fields,

scismology, economics, psychology, and technical publications

These fields are closcly allied to his present occupational endeavors.

On the Educational Interest Inventory, a device that is bencficial

to an individual in discovering his

interests in various fields of study,

Mr. Maksymiec's responscs indicated that his study interests are very high

in physics; high in engineering, chemistry, earth science, and history

political science; high average in communication, zoology, and mathematics;

and average in psychology.

The arcas in which he showed low to average

interest were music, education, industrial arts,

agriculture, botany,

sociology, literature, art, business administration, and economics.

Nine: Myreslaw A. Maksymice

Mr. Mahisymice also took the Army Gencral Classification Test, Civilian

Edition, to find out his overall lovel of mental ability.

Ilis score reveal.cd

that he ereceds approximately 78 percent of adults in general mental capacity

as measured by this instrument.

A safer evaluation of his performance is

that he is probably in the upper 25 percent of adults regarding his global

intelligence.

on the Michigan Vocabulary Profile Test, in

instrument that attempts

to measure a person's intollectual

interests as will as the amount of infor-

mation he has retained in various arcas of knowledge, Mr. Maksynicc indicated,

when compared with college freshen, that he execeds approximately 50 percent

in his howledge of human relations,

69 percent in government, and 67 percent

in the plysical sciences.

On the lower side, he does as well

or better than

24 percent in his familiarity with cormerce,

31 percent in mathematics, and

24 percent in fine arts.

In order to find out Mr. Milksyniec's ability to handle English, a

basic necessity for one to perform well in colleg, he was given the

Cooperative DisLish Tests.

When compared to college freshmen, he showed that

lie excceds from 52 percent to 78 percent in his understanding

of vocabulary;

from 5 to li percent in his ability to comprchend what he reads; from 2 to

Il percent in his speed of compreension; and from 18 to 36 percent in his

overall ability to know and understand what he reads under timed conditions.

In his skill to express himself properly in English, lie exceeds from 1 to

6 percent of college freshmen.

Which reading and expression are combined

into one score,

it may be said that Mr. Maksymiec excceds from 6 to 12 per-

cent of college freshmen in his overall usage of Engiish.

The results of the above tests indicate that Mr. Maksymiec has made

the most of his learning opportunities both within and

outside the military

service.

Although he completed only eight ycars of school, he has acquired

a considerable amount of knowledge by observation, reading,

and personal

experience.

In spite of his broad experiences and acquired knowledge,

it will

be necessary for him to improve

his reading and writing skills in English,

however, before he begins college courses.

Although he manifests a high

interest in engineering and scientific -fields, he should probably not con-

sider these fields

as majors because of his deficiency in mathenatics.

It

is believed the skills in English can be developed but it is doubtful if

the mathematical deficiencies can be overcome sufficiently to major in a

scientific

ared.

It is probably advisable,

thercfore, for Mr. Maksymiee to

consider one of the social sciences as a college major.

His background in

photograply and military subjects, combined with a college major in an ap-

propriate social science, would probably provide him with the necessary

qualifications to become a geographer

or an intelligence analyst in govern-

ment service.

It is understood that Mr. Maksymicc has enrolled in Montogomery Junior

College, Takena Park, Maryland, for the 1966 fall scmester and that he will

take a special English course concentrating on the fundanentals of reading

and written exprussion.

After he completes this instrction, he might con-

sider working for an associate of arts degree

i social science it this

junior college with the ultimate goal of transferring later to a four-year

college to work toward a bachelor degree.

I have appreciated knowing, and talking with Mr. Maksymice and I trust

he will contact this Bureau if he requires further counseling assistance.

My best wishes go with this report in whatever plans Mr. Maksymice makes

concerning his future plans and gouls.
