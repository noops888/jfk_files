interest:

A. Attachment A: A letter from CAW,

magazine of Students for a Democratic Society, signed

by Jerry *BODANES, thanks Margaret for her poems

which they are using.

The magazine is scheduled to

be off the press around May 10.

The letter clearly

indicates that the SDS was behind the student seizure

of Columbia University. It says,

"Right now our

glorious brothers have seized Columbia University-

naned MalcalmX University--and over which an

N.L.F. flag now flies. The others, faculty, deans,

managers, are all scurrying

saying SDS this, SDS that,

"while we hold

buildings in joyousness and the most serious

preparations to resist, our movement has over reached."

Enclosed is a check made out against the account of

the SDS in the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company,

2681 Broadway, New York, for the anount of $50, and

signed by Robert M. *SHAPIRO.

signed Heiner &

BASTIAN has made arrangements

with the editor-in-chief of AKZENTE to publish works

of revolutionary poets, and he asks Margaret's

help in collecting them. BASTIAN says that he is

going to Berlin about I July, to Prague in early

autumn for a "group

47 meeting," and to Cuba in

November.

Letter from Jaime *CARRERO,

Interamerican University in

San German, Puerto Rico.

CARRERO has apparently sent

series of drawings based on Dr, Martin

Luther KING's assassination.

He describes them as

"poetic...but full with guts and disgust."

a possibility CBS will do a program on

his paintings and the work in his Art Department.

CARRERO is going to Columbia University in the

summer of 1968 to study and plans to distribute

El Corno there.

Attachment D: Letter from Susan *SHERMAN,

305 E.

6th St., No. 3, New York, N. Y. (see HMMA-

33837).

She tells of

her plans

go to StoneyBrook

on 23 April to speak about the conference for their

week of protest activities.

She tells Margaret

that there are three people in Cuba she thinks

would be interested in

"The Hippie Book."

They

are

JOSe *BELL Lara,

01. Calle J #556, Vedado,

Habana,

who is connected with Pensimento Critico; Cuban

psychologist Gustavo *IORROELLA, Ave. 3A

#22,

and Lohania

*ARUCA,

99-4722,

Marianao, Habana, e Organismos Internacionales,

MINREX-Direccion

Depto. ONU 516, La Habana.

Margaret got a letter from

someone associated with CATERPILLAR.

He is thinking

of getting married to Marie BENOIT

in England this

summer when he goes there to work in applied

philosophy.

Therefore, he tells Margaret he cannot

go to Cuba

as planned.

An interesting

development was the

fact that Margaret RANDALL received a letter from

Moscow from

Luis *SUARDIAZ, whose return address was given as the Cuban

Embassy,

SUARDIAZ asks for Suzan SHERMAN

(see paragraph ID above).

SUARDIAZ says he will be working

as Cultural Counselor in

the Cuban Embassy and hopes Margaret

Will keep

in touch with him and send him things of

interest

(in a literary line).

In attachment G,

Sergia MONDRAGON,

Subject's husband,

indicates, that Margaret

RANDALL is planning to travel to

Venezuelg-from 15 to 30 June.

It is suggested that Head-

quarters may wish to send Venezuela some

background information

on Margaret with suggestions for action by the Venezuela

Station.

dear Meg,

I am sorry to have put the Japanese flimmaker on you; my

misjudgement. You were right to send the thing back to me.

Some changes in my life häve recently re-determined the

summer, and I am doubtful tonight, really doubtiul for the

first time (tho I have been thinking about this for a couple of

weeks, but have not written because Everything was up in the

air, about the trip this summer.

The thing is that a more im-

portant thing has come up, namely going to England this fall

to do some very important work in an applied philosophy called

Scientology (to go "clear" as they call it), and doing that I

must teach all summer to make money and also to do work on

the fall issue of CATERPILLAR. Marle Renoit and I are

seriously considaring getting marrled in England, and while

I could put the trip off until next spring, she wants to do the

thing this fall, and we both want to go clear together. So,

considering all of this, I think you should scratch my name,

and hope I can go to Cuba later as well as hope the Cubana

will see fit to invite me later (I bava heard nothing from any

Cubang about the trip this summer, so I ilgured it is not com-

pletely set).

•?÷.

p....

All of the other names I sent you are still to my

knowledge goodSit I hear otherwise I will write you immediately.

1034"

745 ar:

CATERPILLAR 3/4 ls out, and 3 copies are on their way to you.

I will mail a box of #2 and more'3/4s when I get the time.

Sorry

not to hu sent more, but only 3 went out to the contributors this

time and I forgot about you sending some to Cuba when I mailed

yours.

Saw Serglo a few weekg ago, it was nice to see him.

We had supper in Chinetown and I gave him a new poem.

A number of people have commented on your prose/poem in

#3/4. Very impressive is the general word. I hope it looks good

to you when you see the magazine.

I have a great deal new

work; are you open to printing more of my poetry in a forthcoming

EL CORNO?

I hope you are not upset my change in plans. This.

Sunday is the first day they have been definite.

Hoping your

life goes well these days,

alfectionately,
