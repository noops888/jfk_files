THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION. SOURCE GRADINGS ARE DEFINITIVE. APPRAISAL OF CONTENT IS TENTATIVE.
AN AMERICAN OBSERVER (B); FROM TRAN KIM TUYEN.
WITH DUE RECOGNITION TO THE FACT THAT TRAN KIM TUYEN IS DEFINITELY ANTI-REGIME,
✓ HIS VIEWS ARE CONSIDERED OF INTEREST BECAUSE HE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS NGO DINH
NHU INTIMATELY.
1. SUMMARY. TRAN KIM TUYEN, EXILED WITHOUT HIS FAMILY TO A CONSULATE
POST IN CAIRO, CLAIMED ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1963 THAT IF THE DIEM REGIME IN SOUTH
VIETNAM CONTINUED FOR SIX MORE MONTHS, ALL WOULD BE LOST; THEN NOT EVEN A COUP
D'ETAT COULD SAVE VIETNAM. IF A NEW REGIME IS INSTALLED FAIRLY SOON, HOWEVER,
IT MIGHT HAVE A FIGHTING CHANCE, BUT WITH NGO DINH NHU'S SKILLFUL DIVIDE AND
CONQUER TACTICS FRAGMENTING THE OPPOSITION, IT IS UNLIKELY. TUYEN CLAIMED THAT
NHU IS NOW TRYING TO DELUDE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR HENRY CABOT LODGE, JR., INTO
BELIEVING THAT THE REGIME PLANS REAL REFORMS AND THAT ITS FAULTS HAVE BEEN
EXAGGERATED BY ITS ENEMIES AMONG THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS IN SAIGON. TUYEN'S FRIENDS,
SUCH AS LIEUTENANT COLONEL PHAM NGOC THAO, INSPECTOR OF STRATEGIC HAMLETS ATTACHED TO
THE PRESIDENCY, ARE IN DANGER AS SUSPECTED SUBVERSIVES.

IS MOUNTING AMONG YOUNG BUDDHISTS, STUDENTS, AND JUNIOR ARMY OFFICERS;
GENERAL TRAN VAN DON AND SEVERAL COLLEAGUES REALIZE THEY PLAYED
INTO NGO DINH NHU'S HANDS BUT ARE NOW HELPLESS. AS THE SITUATION
DETERIORATES, EXTREMISTS FEARING THE CONSIDERABLE RISKS OF A COUP
ATTEMPT, WILL TURN TO ASSASSINATION PLOTS IN DESPERATION. THIS WOULD
LEAD TO RETALIATION BY LOYALISTS AGAINST AMERICANS AND TO HOPELESS
CIVIL WAR.
2.
L
UP TO THE TIME OF DR. TUYEN'S HURRIED DEPARTURE ON 12 SEPTEMBER,
THE GOVERNMENT OF VIETNAM (GVN) WAS TRYING TO RESTORE APPEARANCES OF
NORMALCY AND TO PORTRAY ITSELF AS LABORING UNDER DIFFICULTY OF
COMMUNIST PLOTS AMONG STUDENTS AND BUDDHISTS. UNDER NGO TRONG HIEU,
KNOWN NOW AMONG THE SAIGON POPULACE AS "THE POPE OF THE FALSE
BONZES", THE GVN HAS PLACED DOCILE BUDDHIST PRIESTS AND MONKS IN
ALL PAGODAS. HIS TALK OF RELEASING ARRESTED STUDENTS AND LIFTING MARTTAL
LAW HOWEVER IMPRESSED MANY WESTERNERS. THE LIFTING OF MARTIAL LAW
I'S PURELY NOMINAL; MANY OF THE ALLEGEDLY "COMMUNIST STUDENT PLOTTERS"
MANHANDLED AND ARRESTED WERE YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SONS OF PROMINENT
GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND MILITARY OFFICERS; GVN REPRESSION AND
BRUTALITY HAS ACTUALLY DRIVEN MANY EMBITTERED STUDENTS WHO WERE
NOT COMMUNISTS TO FLEE TO THE COUNTRYSIDE TO SEEK THE COMMUNISTS
AS THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS; MOST BUDDHISTS REPUDIATE THE GVN'S
BONZES, AND ATTENDANCE AT PAGODAS HAS DWINDLED. WITH THE CLOSING
OF TUDO, ORDINARY VIETNAMESE NO LONGER TRUST THE PRESS OR RADIO

3. NHU HAS DECIDED TO FLATTER AMBASSADOR LODGE BY MAKING GRUDGING
CONCESSIONS SUPPOSEDLY AS A RESULT OF THE AMBASSADOR'S NEGOTIATING
PRESSURE (SENDING MADAME NHU OVERSEAS, OSTENSIBLE ENDING MARTIAL
LAW, RESTORING SCHOOLS AND TEMPLES.) NHU HAS TRIED TO BLAME
AMERICAN-GVN. DIFFICULTIES ON AMERICAN CIA PLOTS AGAINST THE REGIME,
PERSONAL HATRED OF JOURNALISTS AND INCUMBENT AMERICAN OFFICIALS OF
NHU AND THE FAMILY, AND AMERICAN MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE COMMUNIST
AND ANTI-REGIME SUBVERSIVE USES OF THE BUDDHISTS AND STUDENTS.
NHU'S. CHARGES OF AMERICAN PLOTTING WERE SET WITH DERISION BY VIETNAMESE
BUT AMERICANS HAVE LOST MUCH FACE WITH MANY SINCERE NATIONALISTS
BECAUSE THEY TAKE THESE ACCUSATIONS AND YET ARE NOT GUILTY OF BLAME

WHEN MANY VIETNAMESE WISH THEY WERE.

THE VIETNAMESE ARMY HAS SUFFERED MOST FROM THE CURRENT
STALEMATE, BOTH IN MORALE AND IN REPUTATION.
THE GENERALS WHO
SUCCUMBED TO NHU'S WILY SCHEMES FOR A SHAM MILITARY TAKEOVER ARE NOW
HELPLESS AND DISCREDITED. GENERAL TRAN VAN DON, COMMANDER IN
CHIEF, SARCASTICALLY RELATED ON TWO OCCASIONS RECENTLY HIS YOUNG SON'S
DERISIVE COMMENT THAT DON IS COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF EVERYTHING BUT CAN
COMMAND NOTHING. ONLY MAJOR GENERAL DOUNG VAN MINH AND BRIGADIER

ARMY LEADERS ANY MORE. THE VOA ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE ARMY WAS NOT
RESPONSIBLE FOR ORDERING THE 21 AUGUST ATTACKS ON THE PAGODAS TEMPORARILY
SAVED THE ARMY'S REPUTATION BUT GENERAL DINH'S IMMEDIATE DENIAL SQUELCHED
THIS. FORTUNATELY FOR NHU, DUONG VAN MINH HOWEVER DISCONTENT STILL
ABIDES BY HIS OFFICER'S OATH OF LOYALTY AND SHUNS POLITICS. HE
DOES SO NOT OUT OF STUPIDITY, AS NHU OFTEN CHARGED IN DENIGRATING HIM.
(FIELD COMMENT. TUYEN RECALLED BITTERLY HIS OWN PAST SUPPORT OF NHU
IN PUBLICIZING THIS PICTURE OF MINH.) NGUYEN KHÁNH, THE MAN
WHOM TUYEN CONSIDERS NEXT TO HIMSELF AS MOST ABLE TO PLAN A SUCCESSFUL
COUP, IS HAMPERED AS IS TUYEN BY DISTRUST AS A PROVOCATEUR ARISING
CHIEFLY FROM VIGOROUS SUPPORT BOTH GAVE THE REGIME IN 1960. NHU'S
AGENTS HAVE FURTHERED THIS IMAGE OF KHANH AND TUYEN AMONG OTHER
SUSPECT MALCONTENTS TO PRESENT ANY COALITION AGAINST THE REGIME.
5.
THE REGIME HAS THE ABILITY TO KEEP THE ARMY IN LINE BY
THREATS OF COMMUNIST ADVANTAGE BY CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE OF SUSPECT
ELEMENTS AND LIMITATION OF THEIR COMMAND AUTHORITY AND BY
RUINING THE REPUTATION OF HIS ENEMEIES AND OF WELL-MEANING
COMPROMISERS LIKE DON. THERE IS NEVERTHELESS A STRONG CURRENT UNDER
THE SURFACE IN THE ARMED SERVICES, CIVILIAN BUREAUCRACY, POLICE,
AND PROFESSIONAL CLASSES, PEOPLE LESS KNOWN THAN THE TOP FIGURES
SUSPECTED BY THE GUN'S SPIES UNDER LE QUANG TUNG AND DUONG VAN HIEU.
THESE PERSONS HOPE FOR A COUP WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AS VIETNAM'S
ONLY SALVATION. NOT ALL OF THEM ARE WILLING TO RISK IT, THOUGH

THEY WOULD WELCOME IT; THE BIG PROBLEM IS UNITY AND TRUST OF EACH
OTHER IN AN ATMOSPHERE ABOUNDING WITH PROVOCATEURS AND RUMOR MONGERS.
IF THE STALEMATE CONTINUES ANOTHER SIX MONTHS, THE REGIME WILL LAST
AS LONG AS VIETNAM DOES, BUT THAT WILL NOT BE LONG SINCE NO ONE WILL
HAVE THE WILL TO FIGHT. IF A WELL-PLANNED COUP COMES SOON, IT
MIGHT SUCCEED AND UNDER TREMENDOUS HANDICAPS COULD STILL SAVE VIETNAM."
ITS SURVIVAL POTENTIAL DECREASES AS TIME GOES BY. NHU KNOWS THAT
HIS MAIN STRENGTH IS THE RELUCTANCE OF HIS PATRIOTIC OPPONENTS
AND OF THE AMERICANS TO GIVE THE VC A SUDDEN ADVANTAGE BY PRECIPITIOUS.
ACTION AGAINST THE REGIME WHICH MIGHT EVOLVE INTO A PROTRACTED
CONFLICT. HE IS SKILFULLY PLAYING AGAINST THAT AND TURNING
ONE ENEMY AGAINST ANOTHER.
6. THIS POLICY MAY FRUSTRATE A COUP. THERE IS A GROWING NUMBER
OF JUNIOR OFFICERS, ESPECIALLY MAJORS AND CAPTAINS, WHO WILL NOT COUNT
THE COST OF DESPERATE ACTION IF THEIR SUPERIORS DO NOT MOVE.
EVEN THEY MAY TURN AWAY FROM THE INCREASING HIGH RISKS OF A COUP
TO THE RELATIVELY SIMPLE DESPERATION MOVE OF ASSASSINATION. NHU HAS
ALREADY MADE IT CLEAR THROUGH THE SAIGON UNDERGROUND WHERE
!
PROVOCATEURS AND PLOTTERS MEET THAT THE REGIME IS PREPARED TO RETALIATE
WITH COUNTER ASSASSINATIONS OF NUMEROUS PERSONNEL ALREADY
EARMARKED BY COLONEL TUNG FOR SUCH A DIRE EVENTUALITY, INCLUDING
AMERICANS, ON WHOM ANY ASSASSINATION PLOT WILL BE BLAMED. THE
ONLY FURTHER RESULT WOULD BE A HOPELESS THREE-CORNERED CIVIL WAR.
