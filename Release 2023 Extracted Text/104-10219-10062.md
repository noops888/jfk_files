1.

Following his move from Leningrad to Moscow in June 1968,

Source met Aleksandr Aleksanrovich ROZINKIN, a translator who works

for a number of soviet publishing houses in Moscow but actually

does his translation work at his residence (address:

Moscow 452,

Balaklavskly Prospekt, House No. 4, Korpus No. 5, Apartment No. 353;

home phone number:

110-2311).

ROZINKIN's father is Jewish and his

mother is Great Russian:

ROZINKIN graduated from the Moscow State

Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages imeni Maurice Thorez in

1956 or 1957, traveled to Australia

in connection with a one-year

assignment as an interpreter attached to the Soviet antarctic

expedition,

and traveled abroad to at least one other foreign

country (location unknown by Source).

He was married twice.

His

first wife (name unknown to. Source) bore him a son and his second

(named Lena Inu) gave birth to a daughter.

Although he is still

married to Lena, ROZINKIN does not reside with her and the daughter.

ROZINKIN loves his daughter and frequently visits her at his wife's

residence located in the area of the Preobrazhenskaya metro station

in Moscow.

ROZINKIN had a mistress named Galina Sergeyevna ZHIRKOVA

(refer to

SX-28663, dated 14 April 1976, for data on ZHIRKOVA) who

worked as a typist at the Higher Diplomatic School and was scheduled

to be assigned PCS in 1975 to a Soviet embassy in an unidentified

general, ROZINKIN, per Soviet standards, lived well in source's

opinion.

On one occasion in

about January 1970 or 1971, Souice

approached an American

official in the restricted parking area of

the Luchniki Palace of Sports in Moscow - Source obtained a special

pass and parking permit from a friend in order to observe boxing

matches, and while parking his car noticed what appeared to be an

American official car being driven by a foreigner.

(Source claimed

that he already had thoughts of wanting to leave the Soviet Union

and hoped the American could help or perhaps provide some suggestions.

It should be noted, however, that Source was in at least semi-official

contact during this time frame with a KGB officer named Lev

Mikhaylovich GAVRILIN who reportedly was involved in operations

against American Embassy personnel.)

During the brief conversation

which was held in English, the American official mentioned that he

was the assistant to the American Military Attache,

replied to

source's queries

that Source's

only chance of leaving the USSR would

be through approved TDY or tourist travel,

gave source a calling

card (Source could not recall the American's name), and suggested

that source phone him the next day.

source mentioned the encounter

to ROZINKIN and on the following day ROZINKIN and Source phoned the

American from a public phone booth.

(In actuality, ROZINKIN spoke

to the American during the telephone conversation because he was

considerably more fluent in the English language than Source.)

The

American merely stated that there was nothing

he could add to his

previous statements and the telephone conversation was terminated.

Source described the American as taller than average, having a thin

face and perhaps light colored hair; Source was uncertain of the

latter because the American wore a hat at the time of the initial

contact.

ROZINKIN had occasional contact with foreigners in Moscow

and reportedly hod lengthy correspondence with an Australian national.

When questioned about the aforementioned correspondence and probable

Soviet knowledge of it.

Source commented that ROZINKIN might have

been "hooked" by the KGB.

3.

In approximately 1972 ROZINKIN introduced Source to an

American defector named fnu MARTIN at the latter's apartment in one

of only two high-rise apartment buildings located on the southeast

corner of the Obrucheva Akademika Ulitsa - Leninskiy Prospekt

intersection in Moscow.

Source visited MARTIN together with

ROZINKIN on one other occasion during the same year.

The front door

to MARTIN's apartment had at least several locks.

The apartment

itself, consisting of two rooms, had unidentified security devicas,

according to ROZINKIN who related to Source most of the information

reported below.

MARTIN, who had stereo equipment and played

during

music

the two. brief

encounters, allegedly would not permit anyone

into his apartment without receiving an advance phone call. He

had some capability in the Russian language and reportedly was

not

married at that time:

Based on what KOZINKIN mentioned, MARTIN,

suring his early years in Moscow, surrounded himself with prostitude

and black marketeers who often visited his apartment, and had been

treated

in a Soviet psychiatric clinic at one time.

He later became

suspicious of people and frightened of possibly being apprehended

or harmed by American

authorities and therefore curtailed his social

activities and became cautious in inviting visitors to his

apartment.

No important or interesting soviets associated with

him on a social basis.

He allegedly consumed large amounts of

alcohol and usually was found in a rotten mood.

ROZINKIN stated

that MARTIN received 500 rubles per month from the Soviet

authorities and had been assigned to work at the Institute of

Mathematics imeni Steklova, but actually did not work there.

ROZINKIN also remarked once that MARTIN indicated he felt he made

a mistake in defecting to the Soviets and regretted it.

Reportedly,

MARTIN has had contacts with foreign diplomats in Moscow and in

this connection ROZINKIN stated that a Swedish diplomat offered

his assistance to spirit MARTIN out of the Soviet Union, apparently

through the use of a diplomatic vehicle.

MARTIN, as Source was told.

declined the offer because he

was afraid that the Americans would

get ahold of him once he left the UsSR.

4.

Source claimed he did not know the reason for ROZINKIN's

association with MARTIN and only guessed that ROZINKIN may have been

involved in obtaining

translation work for MARTIN.

Relative to this,

nowever, source stated it was his (Source's) impression that MARTIN

had no interest in seeking any form of employment.

As concerned

Source's relationship with ROZINKIN, in the fall of 1973 ROZINKIN-

became miffed at Source's one-time ill treatment of him (ROZINKIN)

during a petty incident and the friendship dissolved at that time.

They did

not see each other after the incident and RoZINKIN did not

bid farewell

to source at the time of the latter's emigration fros

the Soviet Union.

Source did not know ROZINKIN's friends well, but

did state that ROZINKIN was a very close friend of Yuriy pou SHIROKOV

la translator/interpreter who had studied at the Moscow Institute of

International Relations, is the son of a soviet diplomat, and has a

good capability in the English language).
