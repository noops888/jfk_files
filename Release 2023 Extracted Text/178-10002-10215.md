A

I guess it was 1964, January, I believe.

8

And what did that detail involve?

Cuban operations, economic warfare.

And how long were you on that detail?

I was in the Cuban operations for nine years.

operations, who was -- who were the chiefs of the Miami

Station?

I think in 1963 Ted Shackley was the Chief and he

was followed by -- I can't think of his name. I should know

it. Well, I will come back to that.

Then, the next Chief of Station was Paul Henze.

What years was he Chief?

I think Paul was there about a year and a half.

He

left in 1968 when we reduced the size of the Station. Let's

say Henze was there from 1966 to 1968. And then Jake Esterline.

He was Chief of Station from 1968 to 1973.

Now, what was the formal title of the group to which

Special Activities Staff. It was headed by Desmond Fitzgerald.

And then, I believe after that it became the Cuban Operations

Group.

Now, was this a special group within the DDO or was

it attached to one of the area divisions?

A

No.

Following the Bay of Pigs, they created a thing

called Task Force W which was headed by Bill Harvey. And

that -- when Harvey left, he went to chief of Station, Rome.

and Fitzgerald took over; it became Special Activities Staff.

It wasn't attached to anything except -- it reported to the

Deputy Director, Plans.

And that was

Mr. Karamessines?

Yes.

Well, it was Helms at that time back when it

was

first created. Heims was DDP at that time.

And Task Force W was created immediately after the

Bay of Pigs? •

Well, not immediately. I think sometime around --

in the Bay of Pigs was in April. I think this was created in

September, something like that, 1961.

And that subsequently became the Special Activities

Staff?

A

Special Activities Staff and consequently became the

Cuban Operations Group. As the Cuban Operations Group it went

back into the Western Hemisphere Division.

And what was

the date of that reorganization?

well, let's see. I would say that was probably around

1965 because Fitzgerald then became Chief, W.H., and then

later DDP.

Q

Now, Mr. Harvey - do you recall what position Mr.

Harvey held after he left Task Force W?

A

Yes. He was Chief of Station, Rome.

And is he still with the Agency?

Oh, no. He retired a long time ago.

Do you know where he lives at the present time?

Frankly, I don't. I have an idea where he lives.

He went to work for a friend of mine who had a law firm.

Harvey is a lawyer.

You mean prior to the Bay of Pigs?

Yes.

7

I really don't know.

It was a small -- it was a

forward base and it was more of less as I recall, a support type

thing.

Well, after the Bay of Pigs when Task Force W was

established, did it have sole responsibility for Cuban

operations?

Yes.

Or was that shared with the Miami base, Miami

Station?

No. The Miami Station was under Task Force w.

All right.

would that also be true of the Special

Activities Staff, the Cuban Operations Group?

A

Right, except that at the present time the Station

has no Cuban operations.

I understand that. When were Cuban operations termi-

nated?

NH 50955 DocId:32275518 Page 9

At the Station? Let's see. Sternfield went down

there in 1972. It was during fiscal year '72. I think it was

in early 1973. It was a gradual reduction.

And have those operations been terminated entirely

or are they now run out of the Washington area?

A

All Cuban operations are run out of Washington.

Well, the first knowledge I had of any discussions,

I was on TDY and this was October, November, 1963, with Fitzgerald

in Paris. And I knew that he was going to meet - let me put

it another way. I had overheard that discussions were going on

with a member of Castro's military but that he wanted, as

I recall, he wanted some british -- I mean Belgian rifles and

A fellow named Nestor Sanchez.

And Mr. Fitzgerald?

Yes, and I really can't recall some of the other

people. We were - we had just moved the Station at that time,

in Paris, out of the Embassy into the old Rothschild Palace

and we felt that it was probably bugged, so all conversations

took place - we walked around the garden and tyat type of

thing, and, you know,

I was walking with somebody, somebody

A

Yes.

I see.

Mr. Sanchez -- was he a member of the military?

A

No. Mr. Sanchez was in the Special Activities Staff.

He was stationed in Washington. And he was in contact with

Cuban military-type.

Was it your understanding that the Agency had received

instructions with respect to this activity from another

component of the Government?

A

Well, let me put it this way. I don't know whether

they received instructions. I have to assume, and I am pretty

positive, that this was a result of a Special Group decision.

And at this time you have to remember that Bobby Kennedy was

overseeing this deal, presumably for his brother, and he was

were

there any other occasions that you can recall

in which the possibility of the subject of assassination of

Fidel Castro was

No, not really.

You referred to this as the first occasion.

No. It is what is contained in the files.

9

Have you caused a search to be made of CIA files,

I have.

14

What were the results of that search?

Absolutely no connection, never has been.

When we talk about connection, are we talking about

A

Not to my knowledge.

Do you know whether of not Mi. Sturgis ever partici-

pated in any type of paramilitary or other operation against

Cuba?

A

On his own behalf he did, not on behalf of this

Agency.

2

How did you learn of those operations?

A

Through the newspaper. And through FBI reports.

Now, are these recent FBI reports?

A

Oh, no. These go back -- I know at one time, the

thing that comes to mind, I think he made a

leaflet drop

over Cuba and this was subsequently reported in the press and

by the Bureau oifice in Miami.

Do you know who financed his activities?

A

I have no idea.

Is it possible that Mr. Sturgis' activities were

indirectly financed by the Agency through -

A

I don't see how. Frank Sturgis is a soldier of

fortune: has been. He has constantly tried to associate himself

with the Agency. When I went through his file they wanted me

to classify the file and the way I classified it was "don't

destroy it, he is an intelligence nuisance."

BY MR. MANFREDI :

Have you caused the Agency records with respect to Mel.

Sturgis to be assembled in any one location?

Yes. Ihave custody of them.

And what is the volume of that material?

A

As I recail, there are five volumes. Your committee

called for them the other day after the article in the paper,

I guess it was last Saturday. They called for them Monday and

they returned them Monday afternoon.

Do you know who examined those files?

A

No, I don't.

You indicated

a moment ago that Mr. Sturgis contacts

the DCD office in Miami with some frequency, is that correct?

well, not great frequency but he does with tidbits

of so-called information.

Is this information limited to narcotics, alleged

narcotics traffic?

Recently it has been.

Has Mr. Sturgis been encouraged by the DCD office

in Miami?

A

MI. Sturgis has been told by the DCD office in Miami

to take his information to the Drug Enforcement Agency or the

FBI.

Do you know whether or not they consider him an

established contact?

A

No manner.

Do they have any -- do they periodically seek to

collect information from MI. Sturgis?

I can't speak to that but the records that we have

don't reflect anything like that. Before they would contact

somebody in that context, knowing that there is a 201 file

on Sturgis, they would have to coordinate with the Latin

American Division before they did anything since we do hold

the file.

each other. They have to know each other from their days

in Cuba.

pated with Martinez in raids against Cuba?

I guess, and he was in our maritime activities. He was a

boat captain eventually. And he did participate in infiltrations

and exfiltrations and perhaps one or two raids, hit and run,

sabotage-type actions against Cuba. Sturgis never engaged in

any of these things. He never did it for us nor did he ever

do it on any of our boats, planes, of - anything that belongs

to the Agency.

When artinez would run such an operation or captain

a boat on such an operation, would he be charged with putting

together his own crew?

A

No. He had

an assigned crew and every boat had a

Case Officer operating either out of the - probably out of

the Miami Station. Sometimes I would assume that we did have

some people in the Key west base. But he, Martinez, would receive

his instructions and briefings from his Case Officer.

2

So it is likely that he could have brought Sturgis

along on any of these operations?

Absolutely unlikely. Oh, the guy whose name I was.

Shackley and Henze?

Yes.

activities conducted by the Special Activities Staff during

your - and subsequently the Cuban Operations Group during

your

tenure with those groups.

Well, there was - it was an across-the-board

intelligence operation consisting of collection of foreign

positive intelligence,

counterintelligence, paramilitary

activities, covert action,

economic activities.

That is about

the breadth of the thing.

Now, these were all conducted through the DDO?

Right.

Now, let's speak for a moment about the paramilitary

operations.

Were these operations run out of southern

Florida?

Right.

2

And in particular out of the Miami Station?

A

Yes.

Were there any other CIA facilities in that area of

the country that participated in these activities?

A

Yot to my knowledge..

Were there any southern harbors other than Miami

that were used in these activities?

well, we had activities down in the keys also. As

I said, we did have a Key west base.

were there any other bases in that area of the

country that vere utilized in these operations?

training facilities for the UDT teans.

What is a UDT team?

Underwater demolition.

here were those bases located?

I frankly don't know. They were down along the keys,

along that long peninsula going down there. There were a

number of sites. I reaily can't recall them.

2

Were there any other sites within the United States

in which paramilitary training was conducted, for people

participating in these

activities?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Where were these people trained?

A

What do you mean?

A

well, Cubans who participated in these activities.

We trained them at these places we had in the Keys.

Now, there also -- some of them were brought up here and trained

at the Domestic Training Station.

Where is that located?

That is down in Virginia.

Were any CIA personnel actually involved in these

raids?

Occasionally, I would think that - you have got to

employees, independent contractors and this type of thing.

DDO.

Now, the facilities that we have been talking about,

training facilities, were manned, then, by the Special

Operations Group, or at least supervised by the Special

Operations. Group, is that correct?

well, supervised, yes, and I would think that probably

some of the training was given by their people. The Domestic

Training Station is under the Office of Training and -- but I

would think that in the paramilitary field that the SOG would

probably staif the training facility with their people who have

the expertise in paramilitary operations.

Now, were the people that were being trained at

these facilities basically Cuban refugees?

Yes.

And at the outset i take it not many of those people

were American citizens?

No.

You spoke about paramilitary operations and covert

action. How do you distinguish between those two categories

of activities?

Well, actually one can fall into the other. The

paramilitary could fall into covert action but in those days

we did distinguish somewhat. A lot of the covert action was

media placement. We had a number of operations at -- legal-

type operations, harassment operations. For instance, Fidel

seized a great many art treasures and in particular he had a

Napoleonic collection which was supposed to be the finest in

the world that he sold to dealers in Europe. He had paintings

that were immensely valuable that he tried. to have auctioned

in London and the London auctioneer would not accept them

because he obviously didn't have clear title to them. He was

-- they were stolen, in the eyes of the auctioneer. He was

forced to auction them in Toronto, Canada.

We ran legal operations, got the owners and had them

hire attorneys and bring them to court and this type of thing.

He seized these race horses. He tried to peddle them

in Europe and up in Canada. We ran opposition against that

it was called the Special Group, CI, Counterinsurgency. Then

it went to the 302 and then it had another name in between

We used

extra-legal things. We tried to get to his sources of supply,

particularly when they were countries that we had treaties

with, NATO countries, Canada, this type of thing.

Let's talk about each of those in turn. You said

A . Well, in the moral suasion field we - actually, ve

were the catalyst in this whole thing and we had the legal

activities, the legal - weil, I don't know how you would

phrase it, but we operated under the Cuban access control

regulations of the Treasury Department, the Trading with the

Enemy Act, and we also used the facilities of the Department of

Commerce, the Export Control people.

U.S.-oriented. As parts began wearing out and this type of

We had the Department of Commerce send letters to those 600

manufacturers and

ask them to cooperate with them in denying

any spare parts to the Cubans. This was a fairly concentrated

effort to really isolate them.

Bright Stock.

ileavy, heavy oil, and since Cuba -- 85 percent of

commodity. Bright Stock can be - oh, it is almost like tar,

melted tar, and it can be cut into additives, lubricants, this

type of thing, and this was critical to the Cuban economy. So

we had an oil firm purchase this Bright Stock from a dealer fori

which we reimbursed the guy and the Bright Stock was eventually

soid in Africa.

were made within the United States?

Right.

Let's taik about economic warfare for a couple of

moments. Could you describe for me briefly the type of

economic activities that were condücted against Castro?

Well; first of all, we wanted to denigrate the

regime, his credit vorthiness, and this type of thing. We

worked very closely with the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs in

the State Department and, well, for instance, in those days,

guess it was back in 1964, the price of sugar had

jumped from

about a penny a pound to 13 cents a pound, something like

that, and we couldn't understand why. So we kept - Fidel kept

saying that he had such a

poor crop and this type of thing and

we just couldn't figure out why he had such a poor crop because.

some of our own island assets told us they were out there cutting

this cane like mad and the mills were working 24 hours a day,

this type of thing. So subsequently, we found out that he was

lying and he was storing the raw cane in the schools, any

place. He had no storage facilities and put it any place he

could.

So in cooperation with a couple of sugar brokers in

New York, we surfaced this fact and the price of sugar took a

real tumble and all of a sudden then Cuba started exporting.

It was this type of thing that obviously he was

trying to build up the world price because he didn't have any

money, he was so short on his exchange, and obviously we didn't!

want him to get the exchange.

So it was those types of

activities.

Was the assistance of any U.S. businessmen or u.s.

companies enlisted in that effort?

A

Oh, yes.

2

In what manner did you use U.S. companies and

businessmen?

Well, ve simply used them as the experts. A great

many -- the sugar industry in Cuba was controlled by the

American community, by American bankers, and obviously they

lost everything when shey had to pull out. Sugar is the

lifeline of Cuba as far

as any exchange, foreign exchange, thisi

type of thing, and it was

naturally our Number 1 target. So it

was only natural that ive would go to the American businessmen.

what kind of assistance did you seek of obtain from

these businessmen?

A

weil, ve sinply talked with them about why -- you

know, the market conditions. were, why the price was rising, if

we could find out that Fidel has plenty of sugar, what would

happen to the market price. This type of thing.

They were used as consultants, basically.

into the thing and indeed they did.

Who owned the mine?

to twist their arm.

Right.

probably have people on detail from other -- from the military

branches in the Government, but other than that I don't think

that -- of course, during the Bay of Pigs operation we also

had people detailed into the Agency.

Now, the training of persons involved in maritime

operations, I take it, was conducted in part within the

United States and in part outside of the United States.

Is

that correct?

The Keys would be considered within the United

Or were there any locations where it was conducted

outside the United States?

A

Following the Bay of Pigs, I don't think so. Not

to my knowledge. I just don't know, I just don't recall

but I don't think that -- I think all the training was done

domestically.

Now, what kinds of operations are included within

this category of maritime operations?

A

Well, the infiltration operations, infiltrating

agents into Cuba, exfiltrating agents, hit and run sabotage

raids. That is about the extent of it.

Now, when did. these operations commence? Was it

shortly after the Bay of. Pigs?.

A

I would - I think these operations were probably

at their height during the period about 1963 through, say,

1967. The program was terminated in 1968, I think in December

1968, something like that.

Why was the program terminated?

A

First of all, it was too expensive. It wasn't provia-

ing enough intelligence and it simply wasn't - economically,

it wasn't feasible to continue these things. The agents were

getting wrapped up. We were - we just felt that the return

wasn't sufficient for what the investment was.

You say the agents were getting wrapped up.

A

Yes.

What do you mean by that?

A

When we infiltrated an agent, Cubans would identify

him and capture him.

These various types of paramilitary operations that

were conducted by the Agency I trust were approved by the

Forty Committee?

Every operation received a specific approval from

the Forty Committee.

In advance?

In advance.

initiating such an operation?

A cache of anything, replay of radio, batteries,

whatever they might need.

over to the, I guess to the White House and then the Forty

Committee at its weekly meeting - they used to meet very

frequently -- they would either approve the operation or say

no. These operations had to be planned well in advance because

the tides had to be right, the moon had to be in the proper

phase for communications and this type of thing. And these

things, all these were coordinated with the Joint Chiefs of

Staff, the Navy, the Coast Guard, the FBI. If we were

exiltrating people, the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

Every Government agency or enforcement agency or military

agency that had any involvement whatsoever, and the entire

thing was coordinated.

Do you know of any such paramilitary operations

that were run unbeknownst to the Forty Committee?

A

No.

What kind of volume of operations are we talking

about?

A

You are not talking about a very big volume of

operations because of the planning that had to go into these

things. I would say that probably at the height of the thing

they may be running three or four a month. No more than that.

You have heard Eugenio Martinez refer to having

run 300 operations.

I have seen that.

Is that inaccurate?

may have considered some of the training exercises as opera-

tions. Obviously, these guys trained. In order to run one

of these operations, you know, you would have to have a mother

ship in place and rubber boats and the UDT people to go in to

see if there were mines and this type of thing on the shore

before you go. So he may have considered that all these train-

ing exercises were operations but no way did he ever partici-

pate in any three or 400 active operations into Cuba.

Now, from what specific locations were these

operations launched?

A

They were mostly launched from the: Keys.

Any other locations?

Not to my knowledge.

Now, would you describe. for me the kind of hit and

run sabotage operations that were conducted?

the Texaco refinery.

What used to be the Texaco refinery.

went into these things. We did have a model of the refinery.

We agonized over the best approach to the refinery and this

type of thing to do the most effective damage. This was run. It

was successful, as I recall, not totally successful but it was

a successful operation. By that, I mean they didn't do as

much damage as they wanted to because they had to get out

because the Cuban defense came after them. It was that type

of operation that we did.

As I recall, another time we took a team in to burn

some cane fields. Really, the classical operations that we

did in the maritime activities were the infiltrations and

exfiltrations.

Were any CIA operations run out of Guantanamo?

A

Well, we did lay down a cache, if you will, sabotage

kits to be used by our own island agents. They contained

sugar to dump into gas tanks and metal fragments to put down

crank cases. Things of this nature.

One of our main objects was to, of course, sabotage

all the oil. We did that with a big operation. We made our

own oil, substandard. Additives, I should say, not oil. We

contracted with an American firm for that. And we shipped

it in through third countries in Europe. It did hit the target.

The thing we wanted to get at was the oil and the

automotive machinery on the island. We knew it was breaking

down and if we could get a complete breakdown we would have

everything at a standstill because in those days the automotive

equipment wasn't coming in that rapidly from Europe because

Castro didn't hve the money to buy it and they weren't going

to

extend the credit.

The railroad system was in total disaster. The

Soviets had such a long logistics line, supply line, plus

the fact that the Cubans didn't like the Soviet equipment

because they were used to good American equipment. And these

were principal targets that we were trying to get to.

In your experience at the Agency can you think of

any other analogus or similar paramilitary operations run

from a base in the United States?

they had the fastest engines in them. They could outrun any-

and these other entities were under commercial cover, or non-

0

Did any of these companies actually engage in any

legitimate commercial activities?

A

Not to my knowledge, no.

None of them - were any of them in competition with

firms in that area?

A

These are probably what we would call devised

facilities. They were probably registered with the State of

Florida and they paid taxes

and this type of thing, but if one

was. blown or became known, we just crossed that out of

existence and started up a new one.

What did Eugenio Martinez do when he wasn't running

these operations?

Well, he was down -- this is one of the reasons, as

I told you before, we brought him back and put him under that

contract, that retainer, because of the years that he spent

under such strict operational discipline down in the Keys.

Obviously, he didn't stay down there all the time. He

came back -- he might come back once a month,. or something

like that, to see his family, perhaps once every two weeks

if he got some time off.

actually stationed full-time in the Keys.

A

Oh, yes. Oh, sure.

Were there any operations run out of the United

States which involved destruction of crops or poisoning of

sugar of anything of that sort?

A

What did you have in mind specifically? You mean the

Puerto Rican thing?

well, that is one of the things I had in mind.

Would you describe that for me?

A

Well, this is, I guess you could term it a target of

opportunity. This was where a vessel was carrying Cuban sugar

to the Soviet Union and I forget exactly now what happened to

it but I know that it got a hole below the waterline, or

something, and had to put into Puerto Rico for repairs.

In order to repair it, I guess, and get it in the

drydock or wherever it

was, they had to remove the sugar and

put it in the warehouse and at that time I guess somebody came

up with a plan to try to widen the rift between -- there was

a rift at that time between the Soviets and Cubans and to

put a harmless substance into the sugar that would make it

acid, sour tasting, and it wouldn't harm the sugar of the

individual, and some of this was done. And then when it

leaked, of course, we had to get rid of it and we had a sugar

firm buy it back from

the Soviets.

Are there any other operations in which crops were

-- were there attempts to destroy crops in Cuba?

No. No.

Q

Place foreign substances in Cuban products?

A

In Cuban products?

Yes.

A

No.

Not that I recall. You see, Cuba really - in

those days the only thing, Cuba was exporting sugar and nickel.

The agriculture sector of the economy was in absolutely total

chaos. God, they didn't have any citrus, they didn't have

anything, and the poor people in Cuba were literally starving.

There just wasn't anything to eat. And Fidel was going around

with this big plan -- of course, there were a number of

experimental cattle ranches in Cuba. King Ranch had one there.

I forget - several other European and American companies that

had experimental cattle ranches there and they were experiment-

ing with the, you know, cross-breeding and this type of thing.

Fidel was preoccupied with this. He went up to

Canada and paid $100,000 for a bull and - so he just put it

high and the bull became sterile by the time he landed in

Cuba. No thought given to, you know, pressurizing the cabin

and keeping the temperature at a certain point and this type

of thing.

So he was helping us all along the line and

this here again, we generate propaganda, incompetence and this

type of thing.

But as far as sabotaging any Cuban product, no, we

didn't go into that. Our object was to enforce the blockade

and cut off his sources of supply.

When was the Miami Station established?

As a station?

Yes.

I think in September 1961.

And that was several years before you became involved

in Cuban matters?

_A

Yes.

Do you know of any other facilities of that nature

within the United States, Agency facilities?

A

You mean, targeted against the opposition?

Yes.

A station as

such?

Yes.

No. You have some communications facilities that

Right.

But I am talking about actual stations.

Operating stations, no.

This is the only such station in the United States

as far as you know, is that correct?

Right.

And was this station established to deal primarily

with Cuban activities?

A

Yes.

Cuban-related matters?

A

With Cuba, period.

Did it have, when it was established, any other

responsibilities with respect to Western Hemisphere activities?

A

Not to my knowledge.

Entirely limited, then, to Cuban activities?

A

Yes, and in support of Cuban activity and other

countries in the Hemisphere.

When you joined the group dealing with Cuban

activities, what was the size of the number of personnel

attached to that Station?

A

To that Station? Well, the Station had probably a

couple hundred staffers there, full-time employees of the

Agency, plus I don't know how many contract employees,

independent contractors, probably another 200 minimum. It was

height it had over 500 people in it.

Now, would Martinez have been one of those contract

people?

A

Yes.

Even though he was located down in the Keys? .

oh, yes.

And what kind of facilities did the Station have in

Miami? Physical facilities.

Well, they were located on the south campus of the

University of Florida, I mean, the University of Miami, at

the old Richmond Naval Air Station. It was a self-contained

unit. It was pretty well off the beaten path, in fact, damn

well off the beaten path. It was about four miles from the

Dixie Highway inland. We had our own guard force.

Official cover?

No. Non-official.

Non-official cover. What was the cover?

A

It was a commercial cover. It was called - the first

one was called Zenith Corporation and it was set up with a

President and Vice President, normal corporate setup.

Engaging in any business?

No.

Now, in a community of that type, Cuban community,

how long could a non-official cover last?

A

well, obviously it didn't, but it was research

activities. Funded -- it:is a giant mechanism when you put

one of these things in for the funding and this type of thing,

• for your ostensible customers, establishing bank accounts.

Yes, I understand.

So it was a research activity and the only people that

ever paid any attention to the place were the newspapers. You

know, somebody would make an inquiry, you know, we can't accept

any work, we are loaded with Government contracts and this

type of thing, and it held up reasonably well. And out of

this one thing, of course, then we were running these innumera-

ble other covers with different activities. The guard

force, of course, were like - well, they wore uniforms, similar

to the Pinkerton people and this type of thing. And I think

that there was -- in the later days at that site I think the.

Department of Agriculture had offices in there and some other

Government agencies, in other buildings, of course.

And this particular Station, then, was under the

supervision of the group we have been discussing?

A

Yes. They were staffed within the Cuban Operations.

When did the Western Hemisphere Division resume

responsibilities for the Miami Station?

A

Well, when Des. Fitzgerald left as Chief of the

Special Activities Staff and became Chief of the Western

Hemisphere Division, he brought it back into the Division.

Is there presently a Miami Station?

A

oh, yes.

And how large is it at the present time?

A

Well, since we -- I think when we closed down the

Cuban Operations, I don't know how large it is at the present

time because we are in one of these periods where we-are

reassigning people, but I think by the end of this fiscal year

there are going to be between 11 and 14 people.

When you joined the group in 1963,. what functions

were being performed by the Miami Station?

A

Well, all the classical intelligence functions.

I

think I have lined them out at one time -- collection of

positive intelligence, counterintelligence, paramilitary, this

type of thing. Covert action.

This is the list of things you gave me earlier in

the deposition?

Yes.

Which of these activities, if any

of them were

actually being conducted within the Cuban community in Miami?

well, the collection of foreign positive and probably

counterintelligence.

So the Agency was conducting counterintelligence

activities in the Miami area?

Yes, sir.

Can you give me an example of the kinds of counter-

intelligence activities that the Agency would be conducting

in that area or was conducting in the area at that time?

A

Well, we had a number of joint operations, as I

recall, with the Bureau. We had identified a Castro agent that

came in by small boat and when she was - she came in with a

number of other people. When she hit the -- they had a recep-

tion center up in Opa Loca that was really a HEW operation.

The Domestic Contact Division office had people out there and

we did, too. Our people from the DDO were under

cover. When the lew people did the

preliminary interrogation of these people they had to fill

out forms, where were you born, this type of thing, biographic-

type thing. These forms would be passed to our peopte who

would

look at the forms and based on previous experience or what

they might have been doing, ad they felt that perhaps they

might have some information of intelligence value, they would

reinterrogate them.

It was in this manner that this gal came to our

knowledge. We surveilled her for a long time and determined

that obviously she was receiving messages and she was

sending messages. So along with the Bureau we put a surveillance

on her and we obtained a van with DF equipment in it and

indeed, she went on the air in the morning at 5:00 o'clock

or 4:30 or whatever it was,

and the direction finder found

it was being beamed toward Cuba, this type of thing, and that

was oen of the examples of the CI activities we were involved

in.

Bureau's Cuban squad was fairly small. I mean, it was a large

squad in terms of FBI squads. It had 36 people on it, some-

thing like that, but 36 people trying to follow a couple of

hundred thousand Cubans around, you know, it is pretty nega-

tive. This was one of the reasons that obviously from.--

in those days when we had formed these revolutionary fronts

which were being run by the Cuban exiles, they were reporting

to Case Officers and they would report on things in the

community, of people they thought were suspect and this type

of thing. These leads in turn were then given to the Bureau

and it was to this extent that we got ourselves involved

in CI activity.

activities in that area was primarily a function of the over-

whelming number of these people and the Bureau's inability

to properly staff the thing?

A

Yes, yes. You have got to remember, too, that a lot

of the people on that Cuban squad were in the legal section

of the Embassy in Havana. You know, the FBI overseas is

known as Legal Attaches, obviously working out of the Embassy

the same as our Station was, and a lot of our Station officers

from Havana were down in Miami at that time. So there was a

relationship there that had gone over a period of years

between the Agency and the Bureau.

Thereupon,

called as a witness by Counsel for the Commission on CIA

Activities, and having

been

first duly sworn by the Notary

Public, was examined and testified as follows:

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION (Cont'd)

BY MR. MANFREDI:

When we recessed for lunch you were talking about the

Miami Station • Do I understand that the Miami Station was the

largest CIA station in the world?

A.

The largest CIA station in the world.

D.

At its height?

A.

Nothing comes anyplace close to it.

I wonder if you could describe briefly for the record

what the hors were.

A.

Well, the ANOis were Cuban a Cuban intelligence

organization in exile.

We full intended -- this was part of the

overall contingency plan that US Government had. Should Castro

ever be overthrowni, these people would be the nucleus to go into

Cuba and form a new Ministry of the Interior.

Now, Ministry of the Interior, is that a euphemism

for Security Agency?

A.

Well, in most countries of the world the Ministry of

Interior, unlike ours, is the security force, internal and.

but I know it well exceeded over inn, probably closer to --

Go ahead.

A.

Probably closer to 150, something like that.

Now, would that 150 persons be included within the

three to 500 who made up the Miami Station?

NO.

A.

That was over and above the personnel of the Miami

Station?

A.

Right.

A.

These people were fulltime CIA employes, weren't they?

Right. WEll, let me - these people really were -

they were being subsidized by the Agency.

They were employed

byisio cover companies, the largest of which was called.

Then we had another

smaller group that did the interrogating and they were under

another cover; commercial cover, - I just don't recall what it

was. But these peope ostensibly were employees of these wholl!

owned proprietaries of the Ayency. They were duly constituted,

incorporated, paid taxes, all this type of thing.

The salaries of these people, although paid indirectly,

were paid by the CIA?

I am referring to debriefings of newly arrived exiles

or perhaps exiles that had been in the country whom during their

time here had acquired new information.

How were those -- how and where were those debriefings

reception center was for all the Cuban refugees coming in.

Sometimes if there was going to be a lengthy debriefing, we had

a residence which we rented and the interior was changed into.

small rooms like this where vou could bring people in, sit them

down, under controlled conditions, and debrief them without any

interference and this type of thing.

0.

For how long a period did these debriefings go on?

A.

You mean in terms of vears?

Yes.

A.

Well, I would think that I would probably say from

about 1962, and I think the debriefings

as such, of course --

¡we relied principally on the

airlift for the people coming out

and when the airlift was cut off, which Castro did -- cut off

about, I quess about 1970 or '71, in that timeframe -

I see.

A.

-- that stopped the flow of the refugees, so we just

terminated that part of the activity.

D.

Well, in addition to debriefing refugees that came

in in the airlift, did the smaller group of AMOTS have any other

intelligence gathering functions --

A.

No.

In the community?

A.

Well, I can't give you a real yes of no to that. I

would suppose that there is an outside possibility they could

have been used to debrief people within the community, within

the Cuban community, but we had in the organization - all these

people were Cuban with the exception of we had what we call an

On-Site Case Officer, who was a fulltime staff employee and he

had a couple of assistants, including a secretary. These people

were directly under his control. Though the organization as it

was set up, they had their own chief and this type of thing,

but the chief. took his instructions from the On-site Case Officer.

of course, if these people went out and did something on

their own, they could do things we were not aware of, obviously.

You can't -- you know what they are doing during their eight or

ten hours that they are going to work everyday but once they

leave, we don't know what they are up to.

Did they have CIA credentials?

A.

No sir, because

they were proprietary hires of this

commercial cover.

Did CIA levy any intelligence requirements upon these

people other than in their duties - in their debriefing

capacity, I should say?

A.

No. When there were - obviously there was a

standard debriefing form that covered questions of intelligence

interest or a battle, you know, anything - economic questions,

morale, and this type of thing. When these questions - when.

these people were cebriefed and the debriefer wrote up the

report, it would be sent from the AMOTS over to the Station.

If the debriefing report contained something of positive

intelligence, of that nature, the Case Officer - well, not the

Case Officer but a staffer in the Station may or may not jot

down some additional requirements and. ask that that person be

recontacted and asked specific questions.

Now, in addition to debriefing, what else did this

smaller broup of AMOTS do for the Agency in the Miami area?

A.

This was their prime purpose.

types. I don't think there were more than probably 12 or 15

in that group, if there were that many.

(Off the record discussion)

BY MR. MANFREDI: Back on the record.

Before ve nove on to further discussion of the AMOrS

could you briefly describe for me what role the CIA plays in

resettling Cuban emigres?

A.

CIA doesn't resettle Cuban emigres.

What Agency is charged with that responsibility?

A.

Health, Education and Welfare.

Does CIA play any role in that process?

A.

We may assist if we are asked but the idea of the whole

airlift was having relatives here. for somebody to claim you when

you came in so you wouldn't become a ward of the State of the

Government, and normally when these refugees came in, they were

processed through the Center and then they had a place down

on

Biscayne Boulevard they called Freedom House and this was, of

course, all run by lEW, and they - if need be and they had to

stay overnight or stay several days, HEW would put them up and

care for them in Freedon House.

Then as soon as they could, of course, they would move them

to the areas where they wanted to resettle them, where the

relatives were, this type of thing, and we had nothing to do

with that whatsoever.

Turning back. to the AMOTS, and to the larger of the

two groups, what was the name of that group again?

A.

We can call them

for short?

A.

Really, they are both - the only reason we separated

the two groups was for security because we had one group housed

over here and the smaller group was over here. Obviously we

couldn't bring these refugees into the larger establishment, so

that is why we took the smaller establishment to preserve some

cover.

Okay. What activities was the larger group engaged

in?

A.

WEll, the larger group was engaged in the collection

of intelligence.

they compiled dossiers on the principals

inside Cuba. They carded - they kept card files on every

refugee that came through the reception center.

They provided

they did do economic and social reporting. They put out a

monthly newsletter based on the information they collected.

The information these people collected as opposed to the

information we collected, ther's was all unclassified. That

came from -- all the information they had came from human sources

We subscribed - well, the proprietary

subscribed to a number, a great many newspapers, periodicals,

Spanish language type things.

Well, they were doing clandestine collections as well,

weren't they?

A.

I don't know if you could call it clandestine. What

did you have in mind?

0.

Well, would they run agents in the community?

A.

Well, yes, there were penetrations of the Cuban

community, yes.

A.

And that is clandestine collection, isn't it?

WE11, I call that human resources.

All right. Where are these files now?

A.

They are in the Headquarters here. A great many of

them were really destroyed. It got to be rather comic. We

went down there several years ago just looking through the files

to see what kind of shape they were in and they had such great

information for intelligence value in there as a picture of a

gal who might be the daughter of a Cuban refugee who just won

a swimming meet. It got rather ridiculous. So we purged those

files and took out that material, you know, which just didn't

have any pertinancy at all.

How are the files organized? You indicated before that

there is a card, index card for each Cuban refugee?

A.

Right.

0.

Are there soft cover files as well?

we had I quess the manilla files, probably went into the tens

of thousands, I would think.

Now, is there any way to determine from those files

which of those exiles have become United States citizens?

A.

No way.

Has there been any effort to make such a determina-

tion?

A.

We made an effort at one time but this -- you can

become nationalized out in California and your record of

nationalization wouldn't be reflected here in Washington for

two years. That is how far they are behind.

So I take it-

A.

So there is no central index you can go to. I mean,

there is a central index you can go to but it is not current.

I take it, then, that there is a possibility that the

CIA has some files in Miami or here in Langley on Cubans who

are now American citizens?

• A.

Absolutely true.

Now, are any of those files likely to contain

derogator! information about the individuals involved?

A.

course, we had targets for recruitment. It could range from

anything from a first mate, a captain or chief engineer of a

Cuban maritime vessel to Fidel. When we targeted these people

as possible recruitments, for possible recruitment, we would

ask

that all the information on that individual be assembled so that

we could do a complete target study -- habits, you know,

everything right down the line. In case of some of the more

important ones, of course, we had psychological studies prepared

where we had enough information. But this is one of the things

these people did. If we said we want everything you have on the

first mate of the - one of the Cuban ships, then they would

start looking through the papers or anything else to come up

with anything they could on what the guy's current activities

are, his background, his life habits, this tupe of thing.

Well, the AMOTS were going to be the intelligence

service of Cuba?

A.

Right.

And they obviously were going to perform some function

in addition to recruitment of agents?

A.

Right.

I take it they were trained in counterintelligence,

gathering of positive intelligence, recruitment and all of the

traditional skills, is that correct?

That is about right.

A. :

Well -

D.

For example, let me

ask you this.

Were any of these

suspected or thought to be a possible

internal security problem?

A.

No. No. They didn't keep those types of files.

We

would simply task them

with through your sources what do you

have on so and so. They would not be told the reason why we

wanted the information on anybody.

Well, I quess with several million fiels or several

million cards and tens of thousands of files it is difficult to

make generalizations about the kind of information that is in

those files?

A.

Well, that is right.

So I guess I won't ask you to do so, but I want to ask

you this. I trust that there is the possibility that some of

these files do contain what you in the trade refer to as deroga-

tory information?

A.

I would assume so.

And that so much of them may - some of the subjects

of those files may now he American citizens?

A.

Right.

And finally I take it that no effort has been made to

study that particular situation?

WEll, we did make an effort to do it at one time:

What else did they do, this larger group of MOTS that

was not doing debriefings?

A.

Well, when they were trained in trade craft we would

send them to other countries, in Europe and within the Hemisphere

to train some of the local services in those countries. They

served as safe housekeepers in other countries. They served in

listening posts where we had audio --

Government allowed a lot of this to go on for awhile but I guess

about 1965 or 1964 they got a little tired of it and they

alerting us and in turn we alerted the enforcement agencies when!

As we phased down the maritime activities, they were made

available to intercept Cuban communications. NSA tasks them with

the frequencies they wanted covered and the Cuban Communications

important one was the sugar network. We had the border guards,

Now, since they belong to us we could levy ceratin require

ments on them if we wanted to, which we did very infrequently

because the common interests, -- we have a comnon interest in

what NSA has an interest in and unless there were one particular

operation going that they wanted to cover exactly what the Cubans

were doing, then we would task our people with that.

For instance, we knew a Cuban vessel was taking arms into

Africa and our operators saw the thing leave Havana and then

there was absolute silence. So nobody knew where the thing was.

But we knew arms were being loaded and we finally located the

boat in an African port, I mean the intercept operators did, when

a matter of fact, they were unloading arms in Algiers. And 200

It began -- well, it began around June of '63.

Now, with particuiar reference to the last half of

1963, including whatever

period in June '53 may not have been

involved, were there a great many. Cubans in the southern United

States who were active in revolutionary fronts that were being

7

sponsored by the Agency?

Wellm you mean agency sponsored fronts?

9

Yes.

10

A.

The Agency subsidized these fronts in an effort to

11

have unity rather than these split factions, split anti-Castro

12

factions. Obviously the leaders of the fronts knew that the

13 | CIA was subsidizing. Supposedly the people that joined these

fronts did not know they were being subsidized by the Agency

- 5

or the li.S. Government.

But when you say "supposedly," does the fact appear

16

to be otherwise?

WEll, based on my experience with the Cubans and this

type of thing, and their penchant to talk, I would think that

it vouldn't take long for knowledge of any subsidy to surface

itself.

Office of Finance showed that he had had nine hours of sick leave

during the two-week pay period ending the 23rd of November but

that the records were not available as to how much sick leave

or annual leave had been taken on any particular day.

A.

Well -

Am I mistaken?

A.

As I recall, he was in a duty status one day and a

sick leave status the next day and back to duty the next

day.

I would have to check that with my Budget and Fiscal Officer.

a two-way street. It wasn't simply that we assisted these

people as well as they were assigint us.

What assistance would you render for members of

the press in Miami?

A

Well, in the case of the Latin American editor

we would put him in contact with the Chiefs of Stations of

areas he periodically visited and the Chiets of Stations

would give him background briefings and this type of thing

on the developments within a given country.

Was that done evenhandedly for various newspapers?

A

Predominantly, I would say probably the Miami

Herald received probably a little more attention than the

other papers, principally because it was a large paper and

their Latin American editor traveled a great deal throughout

the Hemisphere.

Was he also used as a source?

No.

Do newspapermen in Washington, D.C., receive

similar briefings?

Yes.

Is there a CIA station in Puerto Rico?

A

No. There was but there isn't any more. There

hasn't been one there for years.

When was it disbanded?

A

I think the station was established around 1958

and - perhaps it was established beiore that. I think it

went out of existence in 1958.

Do you inow why it went out of existence?

t1o, i don't.

¿ don't have any idea.

Do you now what function it was performing?

• A

(Hods in negative.)

2

You mentioned earlier that Bernard Barker worked

in the Cuban community for the CIA?

He worked with these fronts, too.

Was he performing any intelligence function in the

community?

Intelligence functions. Nell --

...

Was he collecting information?

sure. It be got information that he thought was

worthwhile he would pass it on.

Now, would he have been considered one of the three

or 500 persons empioved or assigned to the Miami Station?

Yes. He was a contract employee.

And vere intelligence requirements levied on such

contract

enployees?

Normally, the requirements are pretty standard,

Some of these contract employees were, then, in

the business of scilecting intelligence information in the

Cuban conmunities in Miami.

Now, I think ie Finished with the AMOTS but can

you think of any other functions performed by the AMOTS that

we have not discussed in the course of the afternoon?

ito, not really. To.

I think you previously described them for me as the

eyes and ears into the Cuban community.

Right.

And they actually had a physical facility in Miami

which was their headquarters, did they not?

Exactly.

Ind there was à CIA Case Officer who managed to super-

vise that facility.

Yes.

Now, what has nappened to the AMOTS?

The AMOTS were cradually phased down and will go

they? Isn't it the AMDUKES Of - these are the radio people.

At the request of the Secret Service we conducted

employees of catering services, linosine service, employees

Foreign news people and media, television, radio people.

Were these people on whom name traces were

all foreign nationals?

All foreign nationals.

was there any check made to determine whether

any of them were American citizens?

We levied on the Secret Service as a requirement

that they have identified these people by nationality before

we would run a name trace. Inadvertently, at one time

they did submit a list, a rather long list of American citizens

which we promptly sent

back to them and told them we could

not trace.

And this practice was followed both in 1968 and

1972?

The

here. In the case of Cubans, probably the Miami Station had

more information on the Cubans than we would have back here.

But the names were traced through Agency files?

and I think they were carried in the Anderson column but we

made file checks and this type of thing. One

particular

activity was supposed to

have been carried out in Rockefeller

Center in New York and in turns out it was taken out of

It was a training mission and -- training exercise.

These guys were being trained in surveillance in New York

and they were simply asted to go into a branch of the Manhatta!

- Chase Manhattan and is come back out and then they were

supposed to diagram the layout of the bank. And this to some

of them meant casing the sank when in fact it was just a

There are no domestic activities at all in the

Miami Station. All Cuban activities have been moved back

here to Headquarters. The iami Station now is completely

and solely involved in the intelligence in the Caribbean.

Does the liami Station - I beg your pardon --

does the Headquarters component that now handles the Cuban

situation in Miami run any agents in the Cuban community?

No. Well, let ze explain that to you. He do have

a career agent who has been with us for a good many years

in Miami and we do use nir to contact relatives of Cubans

who are still in Cuba. I mean, relatives who are in the u.s.

who have relatives in Cuba.

Now, this is done principally with the idea of a

recruitment target, determine weaknesses or strengths,

this

type of thing. lle does contact these people all over the

United States. If we come soross an individual that looks like

he might be recruitable, of perhaps we could even double him,

ve will, after we make our preliminary assessment, and we

find out where relatives aná these types of people are, we

will ask this career agent or instruct him to go contact

these people, be it New yor:, New Jersey, Chicago, or what-

ever.

So you use Cuban, now citizens or aliens in this

country, as access agents.
