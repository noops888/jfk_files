MICROFILM

Following FILONENOR's recent visit, the Station had a much better

idea of MECHAOS activities.

This dispatch is a round-up of our most recent

actions against this target.

In a meeting with KRHOLLY/8 on 17 December, in addition to the

routine discussion and passage of information on the Soviet Bloc people,

JAVILIONER presented KRHOLLY/S with a memo (based on Headquarters 776)

requesting information on and watchlisting of the MICHAOS group who were

destined for Africa and were likely to visit Lagos. This was given after

JAVILIONER had briefed KRHOLLY/8 on the "Weathermen", the "Black Panthers"

versus the 'Martin Luther King" group, the

indicating the advocation of violence of each group and the need for üs to

keep track of their external noverents to enable us to protect the stability

of our country as he was trying to do in his. JAVILLONER approached him then

visit Nigeria. KPHOLLY/8 said that this would be a difficult problem because

many US people picked up visas in other countries such as Italy, France,

Ghana, etc.

JAVILLONER then asked if he could, at a minimum, push for the

corpilation of US arrivals departures just as he did with the Soviets, since

in sore cases the "bad" Americans could present a threat to his country as

well as our own and that by compiling such travel data and monitoring their

activities centrally, perhaps we would both benefit from the effort.

He

seemed agreeable and

said he would attempt to do what he could personally

i and would bring this up with his hierarchy.

3. While KPHOLIY/S was still motivated with this theme, JAVILLONER

mentioned that many of the so-called Black Panthers were in reality "Communist

Agents" and were working for Commnism and not for the Civil Rights Novement.

We then cited the case of JULIA WRICHE HERVE and told KRHOLLY/& that she had

been living at the Nigerian Institute for International Affairs; working for

the Ministry of Information on Ikoyi and also from the main office; but that

she and her husband (who were ostensibly working. to help the Nigerians and

working with them via Sam IKOKU and the Ministry of Information) were known

members of the "Curiel Apparat" and were using Nigeria, the Black Panthers

and any other group or person, such as NKRUMAH, to further their Commnistic

goals and that he would be well advised to look into the activities of these

people and contacts, since they were undoubtedly involved in subtersion and

using their jobs and assistance to the FMG as a cover for their real aims.

HRHOLLY/8 was aroused and said that he would definitely get onto this matter.

He then volunteered that a "Carmichael" had been in Lagos a few months ago

and, upon questioning, he said he didn't know if it was "Stokely" or his

JAVILIONER then told him that this was a case in point and that if

he had any system of monitoring these people he could help us run down known

criminals, just as we would help them run down any criminals that landed in

our country.

As noted above, KPHOLLY/8 seemed eager and willing to assist, but

it is dubions that he will be able to make any real progress on his own or

convince his superiors to make a concerted and formal effort to provide us

with the information we would like to have, especially the follow-up locally

of the activities of MACHAOS people when they arrive and start moving around

However, the initial reaction was positive and perbaps if we keep

plugging away, we can make a break-through in this area.

FILOMENOR reported that the Nigerian Charge' in Algiers had been

involved with MICHAOS target personalities.

Our records indicate the Charge'

at the present time is:

James Duro Olufemi SOKOYA; born 1933 at Ojowo,

Iebu-Igbo; one of ten Nigerians to attend a course for diplomats (Interna-

tional law and French lessons) in Geneva, based on a bilateral program for

technical assistance.

SOKOYA was Assistant Chief of Protocol before his

present assignment and, according to the INCUFF Assistant Political Officer,

was very friendly and helpful to INCUFF.
