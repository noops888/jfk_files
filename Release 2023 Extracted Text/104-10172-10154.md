Appraisal

1.

The Soviot Unton has olearly acceptod Fidel Castro as the loader of the

Cuban revolution,

sinoo in any case there 1s no ono else, and apparently

also as a sincore Marxist-Ioninist, Hoverer, the Sovlots and other foreign

Communists resent the revolutionary arrogance of Castro, Who has admitted

to having road only 370 pages of Das Kapital, which he says he may study

nore when he has timo.

2. The ahange of the Cuban youth organization's name from Association of

Joung Rebela to Loague of Young Communlats 19 rogarded anorug foreign

Marxista as ridioulous.

3. An lllustration of forolen Communistsi irritation ad Cuban arrogance

occurrod during a pross conference early in May given by two Spanish

Communiato in Habana.

The spanlards had said that the Spanish Communist

Party was trying to sohlove power by means of strikes and other non-

violent action in order to avold another civil var.

A Cuban journallot

chided them for this statement, and asked scornfully, "Don't you have

sountains?" With some irritation one of the Spaniards replied that, Just

as the Cuban revolution had toen made in a way quite different fron the

many that had preceded It, so the Spanish revolution would be unique,

dependont on conditions inaldo Spain and on decisions taken by Spantards

alone.
