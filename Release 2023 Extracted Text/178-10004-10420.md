ORGANIZATION OF THE FILES

OF THE COMMISSION CN CIA ACTIVITIES

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES

The files have been left in the same basic organization

as they were maintained by the lawyers during the

investigation.

The most helpful information in finding

specific documents in the files is, therefore, an understanding

of what areas were investigated by each team of lawyers.

÷

Belin-Gray-Greene Files (B-C-G). The files of

the executive director and his two special assistants are

of a general nature, focusing on no particular portion

of the investigation.

Schwarzer -Manfredi Files (S-M). This team was

responsible for Chapters 14, 15 and 18 of the

Report, on Watergate, domestic activities of the

Directorate of Operations and CIA file systems.

Baker-Weidner Files. This team was responsible for

Chapters

9, 10 and I1 and the federal portion of 17 of the

• Report, on mail intercepts, inter-agency domestic intelli-

gence evaluation, CHAOS and CIA aid to other federal

agencies.

Olsen-Roethe Files. (O-R): This team was responsible

for Chapters 12, 13, 16 and 19 and the state and local portion

of 17, on the Office of Security, the Directorate of Science

and Technology, the Kennedy assassination and CIA assistance

to state and local agencies.

Gellhorn-Cargill-Hardy Files (G-C-H). This team was

responsible for Parts II and III of the Report, on the

legal authority for the CIA and its internal and external

controls.
