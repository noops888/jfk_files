The treatment of the

of the mid 1964 incident because the alleged pepetrator is

related to the sroup described therein. The Incident described

in Castro's report as mid 1965 has bech combined with the

In sunnary, of the twenty-four incidents doscribed

in Castro's report,

the files reviered indicate that CIA

had no involvement

in fifteen of the cases; i.e., nover had

any contact with the individuals nentioned or vas not in

In

the remaining nine cases, CIA had operational relationships

This case (Rolando CUBELA Secades) was not

reviored in connection with this nemorandun. Of the twenty-

three cases reviewed, nothing has been found to substantiate

the charges that CIA directod its agents to assassinate Castro.
