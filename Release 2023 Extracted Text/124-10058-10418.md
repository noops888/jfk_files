Paris 100-1793

(U)

On 3-24-64 JAMES LISTEn

the local

office o

CIA advised that his office had received information thack

BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed, on an installation

01 Bull office machines being usedrby the Prefecture of

Police in Paris.

This information has been furnished to the

Prefecture of Police, and while their inquiry is continuing,

preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.

In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned

THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR.j which sets forth

background

information concerning him appearing in Bufiles, and which

was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to

Baltimore

3-19-64, was made available to the Prefecture of police.

It appears that the information contained in the memorandum

would be of interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH of the

local office of U.S.I.S>3 the Direction de la Surveillance

du Territoire (DST.), French domestic counterespionage service,

and the local office

of CIA. We are therefore furnishing

copies of that memorandum to them.

As mentioned previously, we will continue to

follow this matter closely and promptly transit to the

Bureau any pertinent information of interest.
