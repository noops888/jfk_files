to assassinate Fidel Castro in Chile in 1971 with An-.

tonio Veciana and Luis Posada.

Whether or not uny of the individuals listed below had

any relationship with the CIA, they may believe that actions

they have taken were at the direction of responsible persons

in the Central Intelligence Agency. Accordingly, in order

for

the Select Committee to obtain truthful statements and ulti-

mately testimony from these individuals, it would be most use-

ful for the Committee to have a letter from your office re-

leasing these persons of any obligations of secrecy they may

have made to the CIA, or to anyone whom these individuals may

believe was affiliated with the CIA.
