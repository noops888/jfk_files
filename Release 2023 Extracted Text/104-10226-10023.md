I keenly regret to inform you that, upon further reflection and

upon the basis uf information nhách has recently

come to my attention,

1 consider it inadvisable for in ito addresa your Psychological Straters

Conference, and that I find 1% necesaary to ask you to release no fIcu

spenking at your meting on Saturilaj.

When I was first asked to speak

about the significance of lintional Connittee for a Free Europe and it.e

activities of. Radio Free Europe,

I understood that the Conference nor: 1a

This releaBe also

indichtes that there will be full and open discussion of such matters sio

that persons purporting to represent undereround movemente in Poland, tie

Baltic States, Russia, Chins, Kores, ete:, will take part in discussions.

It is my personal view that 1t nould be unrise to discussmatters of

this sensitive and provocative character in open meetings, particularly

where programs of specific action are considered.

It seems

to me that

THE "VOICE" AND RADIO FREE EUROPE

COMPLEMENT EACH OTHER

Buth Are Indispensable

"What's the difference beeween the Voice of America and Radio Froe Europe?" "Why

is it necessary co liave buch the Voice and Radio Free Europe?' These are frequent questions

asked of General Clay and the other leaders of she Crusade for Freedom.

The Voice and Radio Free Europe are both virally nerded if we are to win she

Cold War.

They are complerely separate organizations. Each performs a distiner function in the fighs

against the gigantic Sovier propaganda machine.

The Voice speaks wish the authority of the U.S. Government. It is financed by Govern-

ment funds.

Radio Free Europe was ser up by private citizens. I is financed by millions of individual

concributions to the Crusade for Frecdom.

Voice is World Wide

The Voice is a worldwide network, broadcasting in 46 languages over 75 transmieters. le

is the only American voice heard in the Sovier Union. les 120 individual daily programs of

news, music, roundtables, contimentaries, documentaries, service programs, erc., have a porential

audience of 300,000,000 listeners..

adio Free Europe is much smaller. le concentrates on the captive countries behind th

ron Curtain: Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Rumania, Bulgaria and Albania. Its transmi

sers are in Western Europe.

point of view.

Bur Voice is nor limited so Government pronouncements; it regularly refleces American

opinion as expressed in our press and radio. In a friendly way with programs of informa-

sion and service— it promotes a berter understanding of the United Stares in Europe, in Latin

America, the Far East and the Neas East.

Exiles Speak Over RFE

Radio Fre Europe, on the ocher hand, dues nur portray America, Is cuncentrares largely

on what is raking place within the slave countries. Over its transmitters Poles speak to Poles

Hungarians to Hungarians, erc. They speak'as "che voice of Free Poland," "che voice of Frer

Hungary." erc. They look as their prople's problems through their own eyes.

'RFE programs specialize in identifying and denouncing Communist informers and collab

orators, sending back messages from escapees, and exposing the corruption and crimes within

the Red regimes.

In sheis broadcasts to behind the Iron Curtain, the Voice and Radio Free Europe have es-

sentially the same aims: to keep alive the hope of liberation; to ler listeners know that they

Both combar Communism and the persecurion of seligion and denial of human rights.

Both report the superior industrial power and fighting potential of she free world over the

Sovies-enslaved world.

1951 Year of Progress for "Voice"

During she pass year the Voice of America:

1. Scepped up daily programming from 30 to 50 hours daily.

2. Made progress in overcoming Soviet jamming.

3. Increased its broadcases ro behind the Iron Curtain, adding the "splinter" languages of

Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Tatar, Turkestani, Larvian, Lithuanian and Esrunian.,

1. Inaugurared programs so Albania, Finland, Israel and Portugal in their respective languages

• China in roo áddicional dialects, Swarow and Amoy; so Japan and South and Southea

Asia in Hindi, Urdu, Thai, Burmese and Malayan.

S. Became more outspoken and hard-hirting. One of the principal chemes was the support of

the UN effort to repel the Chinese and North Korean Communist aggression in Korea

Major arrention was given to exposing the fraudulent Sovice "peace" drive.

&. Resan work on the "PRing Plan approved by Congress which calls for a newart of poser.

7. Created "Vagabond" -a ship equipped wich a transmitter, so chat radio broadiasts may

be relayed from shipboard.

8. Received 318,000 lerrers from overseas listeners- an increase of 38j over 1930.

9. Need'ed the Communists so successfully shar Radio Moscow and Sovier regioral stations

Jamary 28, 1952

Dear Allen:

This letter concerrs the ratter which I discussed with you

briefly last week.

For sone months pest hoth the officers and directors of the

NOFE have been concerned as to what protective steps could be taken

in behalf of foreign nati-nals working for Radio Free Europe in

Germany under conditions which might arise in certain eventualities.

I attuch copy of & letter beuring on this matter which was

to Gates Lloyd on November 5, 1951.

It gives a

concise rutline of the probien and suggests a solution of the sane.

To date, as fer as I know,

ie have not been able to secure any

assurances that this is being token care of. If, us we have been

informed, the Army ruthorities in Germany are willing to help ujon

receiving cleurance fron tie Department of Defense, we feel every

effort should be nude to tarlament this promotly.

Apart Ir-m the very real present und potential future value of

the fore ga nationals in the group,

the Cormittee feels thit it has

a definite norsl obligstion to seek the sale degree of assist nee

und srotecticn for then as muld be efforded United States citizens

under the conditions referred to.

Personally, I feel this obrigation is a broader cue which ex-

tends to this Goverrient Is well.

Last T'ursde; wher he hare discussing this question in New

York, Joe Grew was zuch interested and stid he iculd

be gled to ussist

In any war cossible. He si! felt.

other Goverruent agencies here ind thet it car only ce broucht to a

proper solution through setics in the part of the Director or yourself.

Plesse be good enough te tike tide matter under considerition

end give us the benefit of ¿nur advice.

At a mootine so the Executive Conmittice of the Bourd of N.C.F....

from McCluny und o-ro in Incomfree,

that 18 nasris could ba fourd to

for certain of their broadcasts. Since this matter was not brought up

as a formal request, so action was token by the committes, but the In

60 Poles into the cily of Munich for work with P.F.E. to carry out

This was follored by a sonerni discussion of the nature and acopa of the

Briefly, there was screencht thet the proform in

taten off publicity and placed on fund-raisin, with the promotional yerlod

tion mus obtainod last Marchs

"a. Radio Free Europe broadcasts from Wullch, Germany,

Ire more popular trian the Voice of America programs and its

news coverare is considered both current and based on authen

tie sources.

Homever, Its cormentaries on foreign politics

are severely criticised and allogedly the general opinion in

Hungary is that whoever mrites this program has not the

slightest idea sither of the conditions in Hungary or of the

general needs of the people.

"D. Test are ilso objections to the program of Nens

Briefs (ROVAI NDhEOK).

This propram is considered a nuisance

and isn't even listered to by those for whom it is intended.

By scheduling 15 and 30 minuto prorrars specifically beaned

to different serments of the population, such as; the women's

propram, the church prorram, the farner'g program, book and

movie reviews, etc., Radio Free Furone reduces its listening

audience to those tino sight be interested in tre speciflo

program, thile the majority of the listoners are forced either

to ceaso listeninz to their radios or change to another brand-

castin', station.

ha a result, Radio free Europr has beon losing

1ts audienco and the declino is especially noticeanle during

the prostran of Hoas Briefg whon the majority of the listenors

allegedly change over to the BAC prograno

#c. The morors are particularly intorastei in political

nets and are in in excellent position to spread the nexs

• Project TPTONIC

1. On 18 April 1952 the Projoct ilculow Committon recommondod

to tho DOI approval of Project NIOMIC calling for tha payment of

4433,991 to thio Crucade for Frocdon lor 1953.

As a ridor to its

recommondation for approval o1 the project, tho comittoo made the

followin, provisions

that a consulting firu be employed by CIA at

a concultant's fee to Invostigate tho Crusade ounration, both from

ine standuoint of subutance and adrinistration with particular

attention to cost.

Tils proviso was mado at the instanco of Mr. Hoddon, Inspector

General. I argued at this mocting that vince tho Crubado Itself was

a fund-ralsing aguncy and cuployed another fund-raisint agency to help

It, the employment of a third lund-raisine agency as convul tant was

comparable to placine an advortising contract with N. W. Ayer and

tinen placing another contract with Young i lubican to invostigato

Li. W. Ayer's conduct undor the contract. Mr. Heddon Inalsted in

responso that thie was reasonable businoss practice and his view

carried the day.

3. Several woeks aro, with all the tact that I could muster,

I conveyad to Armiral lIller, tho President of !Citi, my intention

Dear Oliver:

Whion I last san you, I spoks of tho Goneral

Hennyoy matter explainin:; the brent Importanee thrt

the Fund placos

on expediting the arrival of tensral

Honnyay in this country for Fund purposas. I later

mentioned this matter in dotail to one of your ilaison

associates who has thoso mattors in hand.

I explained

that 1t is considerod imperative that all possibio a3-

sistance be developed lookini towari the sponsored ar-

rival of General Hennyey in the shortost possibio timo.

I now sofer you is our letter of March 2, 1952, which I

delivered in purson to Mi. Abramson.

That letter con-

tains all of the nocessary data for action in the case.

Wa have just been informed that une unconscionable

delay in the processine and approval of General Honnyey's

entry presently will be made the subject of public pro-

test by elements of the Hungarlan National Council.

The dotails of this situation will be more fully explain-

cd by Leonard I. Stann who will hand you this Letter.

For your convenience, I am attaching

a copy o1 01

Letter of March 2 above cited, and I vould furtier state

Sincerely,

Michael@Thomps.om

Dear Hr. Minett:

General Quisgtar lennyey is Ropresontative of the Hurrrian Natiozel

Council in Yesicin Gormany and a person tu whom the Fund places trust sna

confidonce in its dealings with the problons of the liungarian Naúional

The fund has boon dogirora for sonu time that leneral Henryer

the United States,

and belioves that his uisit hore would be most

helpful to the prusent activities and futura of the lungarian Nationel

An opportunity prosented itsalf lasi fall for General lennyey to

emigrato to the United States as a displaced porson. He mas grantod a

visa by the Consul Genoral in Munich on November 21, 1951, EC Nunber 250ü11,

D.P. Commission Validation Number A-1037, sponsor Mr. Louis Rado, 152 kain

Street, Poughkeepsie, New York.

Subsequent to the issuanco of his visa

his file mas sent by the local representative of the ll. s. Imigration

and Naturalization Services in Munich to the Office of the Attorney ver

eral in Washington for spocial consideration under No. &-CFR 17557.

Noither General Hennyoy nor the National l'ouncil have been abla to doten

mine why his case has been held in susponse, by the Immigration and Natur

alization Service.

Indeed, in response to one inquiry Genaral Hennvey

was told that the filo in question had boon lost.

As statad abovo, tha

Fund attaches great importance to Genoral jennyoy's visit to the linitod

States, and considers this visit to be of high operational importance,

since

it will deeply afject the work of the Hungarian National Council.

Displaced Persons Act in the near future should he not be able to enigrate

promptly.

sincerely yours,

logical polnt of view. It 1s, however, not essential. From the point of lif

view of our campaign schedule, an initial launching date of about August

20th would be ideal.

This would allow trie slory on the operation and 1ts

effect to becone known at the opening o! our Septenber campaign.

We have in storage in Munich 50,000 packszes (of two each) of razor blades,

100,000 zippers, 72,000 packets of neodles (five to the packet), and 150,000

cakes of soap (1/2, 3/L and one ounce sizes). All of the above except

needles vere donations to the Crusade, and the noedles were at cost.

the operation for which they supplied teir products had been delayed. be

I do not know what keeps putting this off the track. It 1s ty information caliso

that the boys in the big house vere iridally enthusdastic about the idea,

and the record will show

that Ambassador Briggs thought it most valuable

1n Czechoslovakla, witness his special request that this muans of communi-

cation be used ät the time of the Czech Preedom Train break-out.

I Hould appreciate your getting us as sons as prosible a positive and (barring.

an act of God) irrevocable approval for a balluon operation into a specified,-

arget country at a certain date, wit agreement in principal on the natun

of the operation = 1.e.; of an order of sagnitude of 60,000 to 75,00

vehicles, bearing the above mentioned aalerials together with messages.

To repeat, by far the best target is Czeccoslovakla; our preferred dates WiF

around August 20th.

Lot us not nake this approval in princiale (vith fim dato and target)

contingent on a budget, except in a general way. With an approval in hand,

so can proceed uith plans and supply a fairly accurate budget, which will

depend somewhat on such things as whether ve can use the P-20 balloons on

hand for the short flight to

Prague or meter ve vill have to resort to

P-501 a for the longer flight into Poland of fron the U.S. Zono of Austra

_ March 28, 1952

Dear Olivers

Tearing my Crusade hat at this juncture, let ne fill you in as best I can on

the history and development of the Crusade operating budget.

This is no nean

Job, sinco practically all of the transactics concerning it were verbal -

a situation I hope to correct in the future, starting now.

So here goes. I

will make the special budget the subject of a separate letter.

In Decembor, Abbott pot the General's verbal approval of a Crusade budget for

1952 of approximately $1,000,000 if Abbott would stay on.

Eefore, any progress

toward firming up this commitment had been made, difficulties arose in connection

with our position vis a vis VOA. On January 17th, CD and Abbott net with everyone

concerned in the problen in Ed Barrett's office.

Out of this seeting came general

agreement that the 1952 Crusade progran should be considerably reduced in scope,

which was duly reported to the Crusade Board the following day. Allen instructed

Abbott to draw up a proposed budget for scuething under $500, 000. This Abbott

did under date of Janary 21st and transaittod it to Allen mith a letter dated

January 23rd.

The budget submitted, which I believe is in your hands, scunted to $4,88,991,

covering the eleven months from February Ist to December 31st, 1952. (The

Crusade had meanwhile received on January llth, on special request, funds covering

the months of Decerber and Jaruary.)

It was initially contemplated that the total sun of $483,991 should be transferred

to the crusade in a lump.

It then derrioped that because of fiscal year problens

five-elevenths, or £222,270, would be transferrod inmediately.

Within a week or so fron January 23rd, Abbott received telephonic approval fros

Allen of the $408,991 over-all, with $222,270 to be transferred in a lump sun.

Carly In February, Crusade was advised it would be more convenient for you to

transfer just the February allotment and postzone the lump sun cayment until

March. On advice, we therefore mado formal request for sul, L54 for February on

February 19th.

This payment was received by us on larch 3rd.

installment we have received against the total (eleven-nonth) Crusace 1952 budget.

During my trip before last, I received verbal reassurance diat tie balance of

the five-sonth figure rould be forthcoming.

This then 1s is urge you to put

this 1n line for attention as soon as possible.

To recapitulate, this 1s a roquest specifically for $111, 016, representing

Sul, 45 a month for March, April, l'ay, and dino.

sinceroly yours,

Fonce S. Stea

Harch-28, 1552

Dear Olivers

This 1s an attempt to give you tre backeround of our special ¿ASY BAlER budget.

This 1s the balloon project, initiated last fall after the first Minds of Froedom

one and scheduled for Christnastlie. It was then know as santa Claus or SUGAR

CHARLIE.

Aftor definite cancelation for Christnas and post-crement to Easter,

it became known in our accounts as tester bunny or easy barre.

In a menorandum to Jchn Danewood, dated lecenber 5, 1951, Abestt said: "Attached,

also, is request to cover costs of operation Santa Claus to date. Excapt for

some continuiry preparations in the field, this too is being kept on lce pending

further nord from you. You will recall that AlD authorized the purchase of

vehicles, ete., at our conference in his office in October.

tie estinated at

that time that the total project tould run approximately $175,000."

Formal request to the Foundation for the $51,500 was made Jariary 3rd, togother

with request for December and january operating expenses. All tess sums mere

received by Crusade January 10th.

On one of. Abbott's january or february tripe to your city, he received a promise

• to transfer to us the balance of the EASI PAKER budget ($123, 500).

strongly reconmend that this would be the neatest way of handling this account.

He naturally keep separate accounting for this budget and could give you an

accountine to date at any time on reciest. To nake such a trenefer now would

also enable you to dispose of this oncget in your current fiecal year, in which

an allocation for lt has presumably been made.

I should perhaps set down for the record that it cannot be guaranteed that an

EASY BAKER type operation, when and 11 1t should be definitely put on the schedule,

can be carried off for the original budget of 5175,000.

There are too many

And, while the major fart of the budget spent or to be spent goes

for quasi cajital equipment, sone of it goes or will go lor expencable operation

(publicity, communications, and the like) walch would have to be repeated in

conrection with another balloon operation.

Attached 1s a schecule of expensee and cuumitments as of larca zist apainst

the EASY BAKER budget.

Fron this you will see that ne have had to use general

overating funds of about $21,000 fOT LASY BAKER as of that date. A rough estimate

of additional costs of the prayer operation, unich belongs to EASY BArE", 19

99,500. (I also altach for your iricrnation a nineographed report indicating

the acceptance of the prayer oceration anong the churches.)

To recapitulate, this 1s a roguest for transter of the balance of $123, 500 of

the EASY BAKER

special budget.

sincerely yours,

1. On at lanst four ocoasions Mr. Willian Soripps, Dotrolt News,

diroctly or Indirectly has approachod the Goverment with proposals for

utilization of balloons for psychological warfaro. Followius is a llat

enclosios "Operation Ballast."

On 1 November 1950 Willian H. Jackson

responded to this memorandun to the effoct thit this suggostod opera-

tion was being referred to the appropriate parsons and suggesting a

aubsoquent nooting with Donovan to disouss this and other matters.

In Novembar 1950 an we were undertaking planuing for develop-

ment of balloons with General Mills, ve vero inforuad that Mr. Scrippa

planned à gonoral nooting to be hold in Washington to discuss balloona.

Through the Genoral Mills Washington Representativa Mr. soripps was

persuaded to keep his meeting general and vas infoital that the various

azencies of tho Govornment had the matter undar consideration and

considered that 1t would not be in the public interost at this time

to disclose tho nature of their findings, Coadaquantly, Mr. Scripps

forwarded us on l December 1950 a proposal "Tha Usa of Frea Balloons

for Load Carrying Purposes" which we acknowlodged on Il December 1950.

c. On December 26, 1950 General Smith ravalved a lattor from

Blair Moody sumnarising a suggestion from Mr. Wiilian scrippa for

discuss use of balloons for psychological varfaro. ADFC addressed a

briefing memorandum to DCI on 12 February 1951, subja Balloona for

Carrylog PH Material to Soviet Areas.

2. In Septembor 1950 the NPSB roquested that Old should represent all

Interested agencies of this overment and should acooriingly take ateps

to develop, procure and stockpilo an appropriato number of sclantifically

dosigned balloons for future propaganda use 1a contitloas of international

energoncy. At moatinis of the XPSB on 13 february 1951 and 1l Juna 1951

1t was agreed that OPf vould procure and stockpile 1,000 largo laarlot
