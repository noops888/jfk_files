reports since 1961.

Summary.

Correspondence between the MDC 1n Miami and the MDC

delegation 1n Puerto Rico, and a letter from Enrique Villareal

de la Concepcion, MDC roprosentative 1n Chile, indicated a

difforence of opinion within the organization concerning the

MDC's views regarding tho Chilean Christian Democratic Party

and Eduardo Fred Montalva, President of Chile. Villareal ro-

velgned from the Hdc.;

In a letter dated 29 July 1965 to the president of the Movimento

Democrata Christiano MDe, Christian Donocratic Movement) In

Hami, the Puerto Rico delogation of the MDC set forth its

views

on what it considered a "conspiracy of sileuce" against

Christian Democracy.

It felt that the movement was being

harmed by deliberate distortion of facts, and that the can-

paden was Intensified by. Chilean President Eduardo Frel

Montalva's trip through kurope.

The delegation took exception

ghould be alort concerning Frei.

The delegation suggested

that Frei should be consured by the national executive con-

agreed

with the Puerto Rico delegation's concern about the

hostility toward the NDC in the press,

and in political and

religious circles, which it said was more intense in Miami

than in Puerto Rico.

The letter pointed out, however,

that

there has been a noticeable change in the attitude of

United

States Government officials toward the MDC; that the MDC 18

treated with more respect and consideration his was

attributed to the groging importanco of Christian Democracy

in international relations,

duo to Frel's triumph and his

/ policy of

"hemisporte transcendence."

According to the letter, the nattonal executive committee of

the MDC has been observing Frei's

actions with growing alarn.

Since Frei's inauguration in Novenber 1964, the MDC has been

Inquiring about the Chilean Government's attitude toward

claim that the statements attributed to Frei concorning Cuba

are loose quotations from speeches, intended for

consumption which are exaggerated

or quoted out of context

by the press.

The lotter continued;

that it was not advisable

• to take a püblic stand against the statenents attributed to

Frol as that would lead to a public debate with the PDC and

as a result would place other parties of the Christian

Denocrat Organization of America (ODCA) in a position of

having to support one or the othor.

The letter said that the MDC must gather documentation on what

Frei has said and written concerning Cuba, and assigned this

to the Puerto Rico delegation.

be studied at the next national congress, and from this

documentation it might be possible to develop a good defense

for Christian Democracy and the MDC.

It warned that this

that he bad received notice fron Laureano Batista Falla,

secretary of delegations of the MDC, that he (Villareal)

would not represent the MDC at the ODCA meeting in Venezuela

On 8 Aprll 1965, Otto Boyer, foroign rclationg secretary of tho

Chiloun

Christian Donocratic Party, arrivod In Miani, Florida,

for &

one-day interviow with members of tho national

exccutive

comeittoe of

the loviniento Denocrata Cristiano (MDC, Christian

Denocrutic Movement).

Juan Manuel Salvat Roquo, leador of the

Diroctorio Revolucionario Eatudiantil (DiE, Students' Rovolutionary

DIrectorate), was preseut for the intervicw.

Boyer had just

spont more than 30 days touring Central Anoricau countrles in an

effort to make direct contact with Christlan Democratic Parties

in that ares.

After his introduction, Boyor briofly cescribed the history of

the Chilaan Party frow

the day it was foundod 30 years ago until

its rigo to powor in 1964 with tho clection to the prosidency of

Eduardo Frol.

During the course of the intervior, loyer entertained polito but

anergotic questions from various nonbors of the MDC.

asked why President Frei wantod to Inve commcrcial rolations with

the Cormunist countries, loyer nttempted to explain that the

declaton was not baged on idoology but on econonies.

He said that

Chile has a great neod for hard currency und that 1f the United

States can maintain comercial rclations with the Communist

countries; way can Chilo not do so also.

One of the HDC memberg

remarked that by doing to such an extrene, the Chileang were

bohaving 11ke

"Englishmon," and that it was tamoral

to establish

relations based on such excuses.

more important. When be was asked when the HiC could expect

wenpons from Chile, Boyer explained that the Chilean Government

could not give such aid becaugo of intornational agrucents

with other pattong,

but that the Chilean Christian Democratic

Party could proride this help.

He said that thie would be a

matter to be discussed by the leaders of both the Chilean and

Cuban Christian Denocratic Parties.

Boyer concluded by proclalming that the United states approvod

o't

all the social, reforus undortaken by Chile, and that Chile

In the lend would help the Cuban exilos.

Meanwhile, however, the

noat important thing to do was to establish intimato relations

between the two parties.

Boyer gave the lapression that the

Chilean Party was concorning Itself dooply with the problems

of, the Cuban Party and wanted to cooperate in the llberation

of Cuba.
