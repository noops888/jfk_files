dren knowledge and

Spanish language fluency dates back to

1940-49 when I engaged in preparation of ec-nomic and political

studies and analyses of Latin

American republics for l.S. Air Force

stafi and command dissemination. After studies in Sconomic and Social

Sciences at universities of

Costa Rica and Havana, I contributed to,

or supervised,

research,

analysis

and preparation

of investment and

marketing studies in Mexico and Cuba. Because of language fluency

I have frequently

maintained business and

social

contacts with tha

government agencies and indigenous organizations•

2. Iraininge Administrition and manarenent: -

At various tines, I have supervised two to liva

conpany personnel

twenty or

selection, xen taunty indesenous field a ents.

This also involved

and training of indigenous personnel as well.

as funding their field survey operations training usually was included

the techniques of interviewing as attuned with the fiold of study or

survey. LA

The compilation of studies and

publications frequently

required cuitorial

supervision and graphic presentation,

using skills

in maps, photography, reproduction methods, and some knowledge of
