15 October, 1968.

Dear!

Duch,

Your Melbourne Station has sought my views

on the possibility of declassifying a Warren Commission

document in which reference is made to the "Australian

security service".

The document in question is CD. 971

dated 22nd May, 1964, together with an attachment dated

29th November,

recommend strongly that CD.971 and

Its attachment should not on any

account be

declassified or

publicly released for reasons which include the following :

(1)

It has never been officially stated that there

is a "C.l.A. Canberra Station" or that

there are C.l.A. officers in Australia.

This has been avoided as a point of policy.

(ii)

Publication of these facts would invoke a

"spate of questions by the Press'and in the

Parliament, which would be contrary to the

national security interest, for example :

a) Who approved the establishment c

e Â¡C.lA. Canberra Station'

(b) What is its composition and location?

(c). What is its purpose in Australia?

(Allegations have already been made

that C.l.A. is interfering in Aust-

ralian domestic affairs.)

(d) With what Australian agencies does it

deal?

(A.5.1.5i, which has not been

publicly disclosed, could be brought

into discussion.

(e) With what other foreign agencies does the

A. 5.1.0. deal?

Whist Minisierial control is there over

such dealings?

(li)

Questions could be raised as to the investigation

by the A. 5.1.0. of the anonymous telephone

calls, the validity of its quoted conclusion and

the result of its further enquiries.

I am giving a copy of this letter to your Melbourne

Station.

With kindest regards and best wishes.

yours reassing,

Clacks Agony
