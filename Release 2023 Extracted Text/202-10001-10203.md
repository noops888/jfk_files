Part V, PP. 5-8, of General Lansdale's program review of

the Cuba Project, dated lô January 1962, assigns 32 specific tasks

to elements of the U.S. Government. Of these, l6 are assigned

to CIA solely or jointly. The tasks have been reviewed by this

Agency, and it has been determined that substantially all reporting

and planning deadlines can be met. Work on all tasks, with and :

without assigned dates for completion, is in progress. The

following detailed observations are keyed to General Lansdale's

paper.

1. Task 1, p.5. The intelligence community is hard at

work on NIE 85-62 and is attempting to meet the deadline of

7 February. As was agreed in a conversation of 23 January 1962

with General Lansdale, a short extension may be necessary.

2. Task 2, p.5. The Opa-Locka Interrogation Center in

Florida will be in operation on 15 February -- the deadline daie.

3. Task 3. p.5 The survey is in progress and w:!l be

completed on the stipulated date

obtained the possibility of establishing additional interrogation

points will be determined.

4. Task 4, p.5. An operational assessment of the stay-

behind net in Cuba will be completed and reported by the deadline

of 15 February. Because communication with singleton agents is

by SW, not W/T, it is unlikely that assessment can be completed

by the date stipulated; an extension to 28 February may be

necessary, although every effort is being made to complete the work

before that dat

An intensive program aimed at the acquisition

of third country assets through the cooperation of liaison services

is also under way, particularly in Spain, Belgium, France,

CIA

Uruguay, and Costa Rica

A progress report on the status of

this program will be made by 15 February, although this Agency

cannot be sure that the cooperation of all intended participants will

have been obtained by that date. CIA has also taken the follow-.

ing additional steps in respect to Task 4.

a. A cable has been sent to field stations io give added

impetus to the search for assets and the development of both

unilateral and joint operations. Progress reports have been

required by l March.

end of February.

5. Task 5, p.5. The 1 February deadline will be met, and

by that date we shall also have begun the search for suitable inter-

mediaries. Analysis to date has not uncovered a top-level official

of the Cuban regime whose personal characteristics indicate he

would accept recruitment or agree to defection now. Although

some targets of opportunity will appear outside Cuba, most planning

will necessarily be based upon an appeal made inside the island by

intermediaries selected from the ranks of

journalists, foreigr

officials, international businessmen, foreign lawyers, crime

syndicates, international detectives and foreign police officials.

Additically, plans for the defection of lower-level Cuban officials

abroad have been completed, and the search for targets and access

abroad is under way

6. Task 6, p. 5. By the assigned date we shall complete

and submit a coordinated plan. We shall also have begun action on

¡cover and deception operations by that dare.

7. Task 7, p.5. By 1 February CIA will submit an opera-

tional schedule for the initiation of an organized resistance move-

ment inside Cuba. The schedule will include the localities selected

and the assessment of some candidates. A full assessment will

be completed in accordance with the schedule listed in para. 4,

above, in conformance with Task 4. It should be noted, however,

that this operational schedule (like the schedules called for in

Tasks 10, 26, and 30) will necessarily be tentative and subject

to later revision as the number of assets inside Cuba increases

and as the flow of intelligence is augmented.: Moreover, the

development of a resistance movement will not remain controllable,

so that operational timetables produced during the next four weeks

can serve only as guides for a proposed sequence of actions.

8. Task 10, p.5. 'CIA has on hand both propaganda and

POlitical action assets in the Caribbean area and elsewhere in

Latin America. It is planned to use those assets both to support

the Project inside Cuba and to generate and mobilize public and

official opinion against Castro outside Cuba, The operational

schedule will be submitted on the stated date.

officials have been donducted and a leport of developments will be

submitted by 15 February.

10. Task 21, p. 7./ Plans for inducing the failure of crops

will be submitted by 15 February. These plans will envisage both

the use of controlled assets who can be infiltrated and exfiltrated

and the provision of encouragement and guidance to the resistance,

so that it will undertake acts of sabotage, some of which are to

be directed against crops, particularly rice.

Task 24, p. 7. This deadline will also be met. Primary

methods of disrupting the supply of Cuban nickel to the USSR could,

if approved, include (1) the sinking of Cuban or Bloc ships by open

attack; (2) the use of "frogman" or UDT tactics in harbors for the

same purpose; (3) the employment of torpedos and mines toward

this end; and (4) the sabotaging of primary or secondary sources

of Cuban nickel, such as the Nicaro and Moa plants. CIA now has no

proven internal assets capable of carrying out any of these actions.

The Agency does have external assets capable of undertaking actions

12. Task 26, p.?. Together with Tasks 27 and 28, Task 26

constitutes an outline of a plan for a psychological warfare operation.

These tasks are so closely interrelated that CIA proposes to submit

by 15 February a single plan dealing with all three tasks.

facilities, (4) equipment for the refining of petroleum, (5) facili

ties for producing and distributing power, (6) industry, (7) food
