To

*Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission files

we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some

explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets: When we remove a classified

document from a folder we record more information for

administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.

The data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying

agency, classification level, comments, and special markings are

not printed on this short form that researchers see.

Our

computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public

descriptions because some agencies,

chiefly the CIA, do not want

to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.

We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission

items we have processed more explicit than normal practice

because the Church Conmittee published the gist of most of these

documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection.

But, because

of the software limitations, the computer cannot print

, the

"agency" data on the short form.

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the

originating agency for most of these documents. Most of them

were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the CIA, although

many of them are of interagency origin.

If you have questions

about particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have

already been declassified, but rather than take the time to

research all of them and delay "opening" the collection, we

simply "pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what

happens with the proposed review commission.

systematically declassified, we will research them individually

ay deleted,

If they are not

as they are requested under mandatory review.

12 Sept 1994 - phone conversation with Lessa Tobin (Ford)

They have screened the Rockefeller Commission material

and identified JEK assassination records. They have 1400

items in their data base and 6-7 feet of material to be

reviewed. They estimate that 80% of the records contain CIA

equities.

They would welcome reviewers this Fall (the sooner the

better since Ms. Tobin is going on maternity leave in

January).

:

Dear Mr. Harrelson:

I am sending out to you today by registered mail the document

identification forms for all of the Kennedy assassination materials

identified in the Ford Library whose status was recorded as "postponed".

This includes forms for about 1,000 items. This package does not

include identification forms for the 400 items whose status is "opened".

Also enclosed is a list explaining the shorthand collection titles we used

on the identification forms.

Karen Holzhausen and I produced forms for all of the materials we

identified, including all duplicates. In some cases there were two, three

or four copies of the same document located in different files. We've

developed a system to keep track of those duplicates which we can

explain to your people when they arrive.

Karen and I are very much looking forward to your visit this fall but we

have lots of questions about how the process will work. Will you know

which items have already been declassified elsewhere? Will you be able

to recognize and act on non-CIA originated documents which have been

acted on at other repositories? Will you have to see the originals of each

item which are scattered throughout our vault collections, or can you just

examine the copy set we created during the identification process? Is

there anything we could be doing to help prepare for your visit? Will

there be follow-up work for us to do after you leave?

known as the Rockefeller Commission) was charged with investigating allegations

of improper CIA activities within U.S. borders. The files consist of documents

created by the Commission in the course of its work (correspondence, testimony,

report drafts, etc.), as well as historical documents and exhibit items collected

during its investigation.

The portions of the file which are available for research (2.5 cubic feet) deal with

the investigation of possible CIA involvement in the assassination of President John

F. Kennedy or in anti-Castro plots of the early 1960s.

QUANTITY

41 cubic feet (ca. 82,000 pp.)

DONOR

Gerald R. Ford (Accession numbers 81-23 and 78-56)

ACCESS

Materials related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy or to anti-

Castro activities, 1960-64, have been processed for research. A significant

portion of this material is security classified and accessible only through

researcher-initiated declassification review. The bulk of the Commission files are

U.S. PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION ON CIA ACTIVITIES

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES: FILES RELATED TO THE

ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY

INTRODUCTION

President Gerald R. Ford created the Commission on CIA Activities within the

United States on January 4, 1975. He directed the Commission to determine

whether or not any domestic CIA activities exceeded the Agency's statutory

authority and to make appropriate recommendations. He appointed Vice President

Velson A. Rockefeller chairman of the Commission. (The Commission is ofter

referred to as the "Rockefeller Commission.") Other members were John T.

Connor, C. Douglas Dillon, Erwin N. Griswold, Lane Kirkland, Lyman L.

Lemnitzer, Ronald Reagan, and Edgar F. Shannon, Jr. David W. Belin, a former

staff member of the Warren Commission, was named Executive Director. Named

Senior Counsel were Harold A. Baker, Ernest Gellhorn, Robert B. Olsen, and

William W. Schwarzer. Counsel were Marvin L. Gray, Jr.; George A. Manfredi;

James N. Roethe; and James B. Weidner. Ronald J. Greene served as Special

Counsel. Staff members were R. Mason Cargill, Peter R. Clapper, and Timothy S.

Hardy.

The Commission looked into all aspects of CIA operations within the United

States. Its report, submitted to the President in June 1975, lists the following

significant areas of investigation: mail intercepts; Intelligence Community

coordination; "Operation CHAOS" (collecting information on dissidents); protection

of the Agency against threats of violence; other investigations by the Office of

Security; involvement of the CIA in improper activities for the White House

(including Watergate); domestic activities of the Directorate of Operations;

domestic activities of the Directorate of Science and Technology; CLA relationships

with other federal, state, and local agencies; indices and files on American citizens;

and allegations concerning the assassination of President Kennedy. The

Commission also looked into the legal authority of the CIA and its internal and

external controls.

One area on which the Commission collected evidence, but did not include in

its report, was the role of the CIA in assassination plots against foreign leaders.

The study focused on plots against Fidel Castro of Cuba, Rafael Trujillo of the

Dominican Republic, and Patrice Lumumba of the Congo. The Commission was

primarily interested in seeing if these plots involved any domestic illegal activities,

such as connections with organized crime, as had been alleged. The report states

- 3 -

## Page 10

13-00000

that the Commission did not have time to complete the study, so it was turning the

materials over to the White House.

The processed segment of this collection consists of materials identified as

being related to either the John Kennedy assassination or to plots against Castro.

The anti-Castro materials are included because of allegations that Castro or his

supporters were part of a conspiracy to kill President Kennedy as retribution.

THE INVESTIGATION OF THE KENNEDY ASSASSINATION

The Commission investigated allegations that the CIA was somehow involved in

the assassination of President Kennedy. Specifically, it looked into allegations that

E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis were CIA agents and were present in Dallas

("the derelicts") at the time of the assassination and could have fired the alleged

shots from the grassy knoll. It also investigated claims that the CIA had

relationships with Lee Harvey Oswald and Jack Ruby.

The Commission heard testimony, taped interviews, took depositions, consulted

experts in forensic pathology and ballistics, examined photographic evidence, and

requested documents from various intelligence and law enforcement agencies. The

Commission concluded that the findings of the Warren Commission regarding a

lone assassin were correct and that Hunt and Sturgis were not the derelicts. No

concrete evidence was presented to link Oswald or Ruby to the CIA; the

Commission concluded that the allegations were "farfetched speculation."

DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSED FILES

These files contain two distinct types of material. I will refer to the first type

as Kennedy assassination materials and the second type as anti-Castro materials,

although both types were selected because of their possible connection to the

Kennedy assassination.

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION MATERIALS: Most relate to the allegation

that CIA operatives (possibly in the persons of E. Howard Hunt and Frank Sturgis)

fired shots from the "grassy knoll" in Dealey Plaza at the time of the Kennedy

shooting. Also considered was the allegation that Oswald and/or Jack Ruby had

connections with the CIA. Witnesses, many of whom were unsolicited, provided

testimony and exhibits supporting or refuting those allegations. The findings of the

Warren Commission regarding Oswald as a lone assassin and the single-bullet

theory were considered through analysis of photographs and the Zapruder film,

examination of Kennedy autopsy materials by a panel of medical consultants, sworn

testimony, and examination of documents from the CIA and other agencies. A

copy of the Zapruder film, lent by Robert Groden, is in the collection.

## Page 11

13-00000

There are also drafts of Chapter 19 of the Commission report, which deals with

this aspect of the investigation.

ANTI-CASTRO MATERIALS: They consist primarily of copies of

"historical" documents provided to the Commission by the CIA, predominantly, and

the State Department, Defense Intelligence Agency, and Justice Department. The

documents deal mainly with planning for covert operations in Cuba, 1960-64,

including assassination attempts on Fidel Castro, but also include some interspersed

materials on the Trujillo and Lumumba assassinations. The Cuba documents

include some items on the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban missile crisis, but by

far the bulk of the material relates to Operation MONGOOSE. Included are

minutes of meetings of the various special groups assigned to planning anti-Castro

operations, reports on the operations, and memoranda between the individuals

involved.

Also included in the "Assassination Materials" processed are transcripts of

sworn testimony and interviews conducted by Rockefeller Commission staff with

former CIA, State Department, and Defense Department officials from the 1960s

regarding what they knew about plans to assassinate foreign leaders and about the

connection between the Cuba operations and organized crime.

SELECTED RELATED MATERIALS (JUNE 1992):

The Congressional Files of Gerald R. Ford contain materials related to his

service on the Warren Commission (17 cubic feet). The Records of the U.S.

Department of the Army, Military District of Washington, Directorate of

Ceremonies and Special Events contain approximately two cubic feet of records on

the transport of President Kennedy's remains, his funeral ceremony and interment,

and administration of the gravesite. These materials are open for research.

The Presidential Handwriting File and the files of Presidential counsel Philip

Buchen contain materials on the intelligence investigations of the mid-1970s,

including the Rockefeller Commission. These collections are open for research.

The Ford Presidential Papers may contain additional materials related generally to

the Rockefeller Commission or congressional investigations of the intelligence

community. Use the PRESNET database to locate them.

The neighboring Bentley Historical Library holds papers of John Stiles relating

to his collaboration with Gerald Ford on Portrait of the Assassin, a book about Lee

Harvey Oswald which grew out of Ford's work on the Warren Commission.

- 5 -

## Page 12

13-00000

Additional materials on the Rockefeller Commission or plots against Fidel

Castro are in unprocessed collections or unprocessed series of open collections.

These include about 3,000 pages of collected historical documents, which continue

to be heavily classified, gathered by the White House on anti-Castro activities.

[NOTE: For additional information regarding the acquisition and processing of the

Kennedy and anti-Castro files from this collection, please see MEMO FOR THE

FILE, dated June 8, 1992, which is appended to this finding aid.]

3 THE FILE

ACQUISITION OF COMMISSION FILES

The Ford Library holds two sets of files of the President's

Commission on CIA Activities within the United States

(Rockefeller Commission) â€¢

The first received, a copy set which

was kept at the White House when the originals

were transferred

to the Justice Department in June of 1975, was received via the

National Archives on March 1, 1978.

The originals came later, in

November of 1980.

The copy set is somewhat smaller than the

original set because some administrative materials were not

copied. It is the Kennedy-related materials in the original set

which have been processed in part and made available for

research.

The Ford Library received these materials under the terms of

President Ford's deed of gift.

PROCESSING THE FILES RELATED TO THE KENNEDY ASSASBINATION

In early 1992, President Ford stated publicly that he

favored the opening of currently closed files on the Kennedy

assassination and

investigations thereof.

The Ford Library

notified him that the Rockefeller Commission files contained

material related to the assassination and that staft planned to

consolidate those materials and process them for opening. He

endorsed this action.

The task of selecting Kennedy materials was not an easy one,

and Library staff do not claim to have found every document.

Archivists had a rough finding aid that came with the collection,

consisting of folder titles and, in some cases, lists of

documents within folders.

The materials were organized by

Commission staff team not by subject.

Because Robert Olsen and

James Roethe had primary responsibility for investigating

possible CIA connections with the assassination, archivists

started with their files.

Within the Olsen Roethe files there

was an identified Kennedy assassination series, which archivists

pulled first and examined. Based on their reading of those

files, and other background research, archivists were able to

examine the folder title list for the complete collection and

identify relevant folders in other staff files.

A Presidential Library Administered b' the National Archiles and Records Administration

## Page 17

Commission

no erase i ere detent earan

or discussions of actions against Castro, Trujillo, and Lumumba.

Those folders which appeared to have anything to do with Castro

were pulled for processing because of the issue of a possible

link between U.S. attempts to assassinate Castro and the Kennedy

assassination.

No attempt was made to go through the whole collection to

search for stray materials.

Nor could archivists identify all

the people whose names appeared on folders--they may have missed

some simply because they did not know of a connection.

Folders

identified only by date of testimony were also not examined. So,

Ford Library archivists believe that processing of the full

collection may eventually lead to the discovery of additional

Kennedy material.

DESCRIPTION OF PROCESSED MATERIALS (2.5 cubic feet) Eplus Oct 1992

Archivists pulled and processed slightly over two cubic feet

of material.

(This is from the original files only.) of the

4759 pages,

plus audiovisual material, approximately 68% (3232

pages) dealt with the investigation of a possible direct CIA

connection with the Kennedy assassination.

This material was

pulled from staff files and chapter drafts.

The other 32% (1527 pages) consisted of materials related to

the investigation of CIA involvement in anti-Castro activities

during the early 1960s.

This was pulled from a series called

"Assassination Materials," which was different from the body of

the Commission files in that the folder titles were not coded and

numbered and there seemed to be less organization within the

files.

REMOVAL OF CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS

Frow the processed materials, archivists removed

approximately 450 documents for national security reasons.

of

the 450 documents, 29% were classified Top Secret, 48% were:

Secret, 3% were Confidential, and 19% were unmarked.. A few

CODEWORD documents were found. Just over 60% of the withdrawn

items were dated between 1960 and 1964.

Thirty-two percent were

from 1975, created during the tenure of the Commission.

There were classified documents from several agencies but

about 64% were created by CIA or had "CIA interest."

An

additional 25% would be considered White House documents for

declassification purposes (including NSC/ interagency documents

from the 1960s as well as the classified materials originated by

the Rockefeller Commission itself).

state, Defense Department,

Army, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Federal Bureau of Investigation

account for the rest. There were only four FBI documents.

## Page 18

13-00000

KENNEDY ASSASSINATION MATERIALS: Most is unclassified and

is open for research.

The 16% that is classified is mainly

testimony which includes information on CIA operations.

ANTI-CASTRO MATERIALS: Approximately 87% is classified, and

much of the unclassified material is simply requests for

documents, transmittal memos, and cover sheets. Therefore much

of this section is unavailable for research until it can be

reviewed by the CIA or other originating agency.

Dear Karen:

We have finally completed the review of the JFK items that

you forwarded to us on January 4, 1995.

We apologize for

the delay.

To avoid any confusion should the document be separated from

your identification form, we have stamped both the document

and the identification form.

When the document was many

pages and it required only one or two redactions, we

indicated on the identification form which page/pages

required redaction.

However, please check all pages since

we could have slipped up. Also, on the identification form

we indicated which other government agency/agencies needed

to coordinate on certain documents.

Where the document was

many pages

and coordination was required on only a few

pages, we indicated the specific pages which should be

coordinated with the other government agency/agencies.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call us

for clarification.

To act

as a filler and also to advertise ourselves, we are

enclosing some of the releases that the Center for the Study

of Intelligence has made in recent years:

Sherman Kent and

the Board of National Estimates, Cuban Missile Crisis =

Reply to: Karen Holzhausen, Ford Library KOTHS DOCUMENTin

Subject : Rockefeller Commission files information

: Steve Katz, Senate Committee on Government Affairs

Enclosed are the finding aid to the Rockefeller Commission files

we have processed, copies of all the withdrawal sheets, and some

explanatory information.

About the withdrawal sheets: When we remove a classified

document from a folder we record more information for

administrative purposes than you find on these withdrawal sheets.

The data put into such fields as creator's agency, classifying

agency, Classification level, comments, and special markings are

not printed on this short form that researchers see.

Our

computer program was designed to produce these abbreviated public

descriptions because some agencies, chiefly the CIA, do not want

to be public identified as the originator of specific documents.

We have made the withdrawal sheets for the Rockefeller Commission

items we have processed more explicit than normal practice

because the Church Committee published the gist of most of these

documents in 1975, identifying the CIA connection.

But, because

of the software limitations, the computer cannot print the

"agency" data on the short form.

I think there is enough information for you to deduce the

originating agency for most of these documents.

were supplied to the Rockefeller Commission by the CIA, although

nes are ole neckagenes

Most of them

many of them are of interagency origin. If you have questions

about particular sheets, please don't hesitate to call me.

We may find that some, perhaps many, of these documents have

already been declassified, but rather than take the time to

research all of them and delay "opening" the collection, we

simply "pink sheeted" everything and will wait to see what

happens with the proposed review commission. If they are not

systematically declassified, we will research them individually

as they are requested under mandatory review.

In this document the Church Committee asked for a variety of

information on

projects, programs, Agency files, and Agency

and non-Agency personalities.

Regarding DS&T,

they asked

for the files on the projects/programs numbering 39 through

47 on page 2 which is attached.

We requested your

coordination for this page on 20 May 1997.. We have no

record of receiving this information.

Since the

Assassination Records Review Board is meeting on 17 June

1998 to review the Ford Library material, we would

appreciate your quick review of this page. We are not sure

whether the highlighted items under DS&&T on page 2 are

classified or are open.

Query dtd 29 Oct 98, Same Subject

We appreciate your attention to the processing of

the documents that affect CIA equities.

This memorandum addresses part of the

questions/problems regarding sanitizations identified

in reference. A follow-up memorandum will be forthcoming.

SANITIZE!

178-10003-10386, -10243, and -10188

These documents are identical documents. We believe the

ARRB did have the DOD review these documents.

Periodically

a group of reviewers from CIA, DPD, NSC, and State jointly

reviewed documents at the ARRB offices. Enclosed is a cover

sheet for -10386 that the ARRB staff included with each

document.

As you can see, DOD was on the "Third Agency

Equities" line.

We feel certain that they reviewed these

documents because DOD was crossed through on this cover

sheet, but apparently DOD reviewers neglected to stamp it.

178-10002-10480

We assume other redactions are marked in this document;

and, yes, on page 7, we agree to release "Mr. Murphy asked

if . . . his sister . . . she . . . inside information."

Other redactions should continue on this page and the

previous page. Copies of these pages will be forwarded if

needed.

178-10003-10026 and -10048

We do not have copies of these

documents, which were

probably reviewed during one of the joint sessions at the

ARRB offices.

The "no objection" was frequently used in the

joint sessions to indicate that the document had no specific

CIA equities. If there is(are) CIA equity (ies) that we

missed (as opposed to NSA equities), we will need a copy of

the document (s) â€¢

178-10004-10302

Assuming other redactions continue, please also continue

to protect the particular subject on page 4; but it can be

released on page 5 because there it is used generically.

178-10410-10297

We do not have a copy of this document. If identical to

-10302, our copy of page 3 of -10302 contains no redaction.

If not identical to -10302, please provide a copy of -10297.

178-10310-10398

We do not have a copy of this document. We originally were

protecting the name of "Sherman Hoar," but we are now

releasing the name:

Therefore, in this document and in all

your documents, this name can be released.

178-10003-10404

We agree with you that the name and the closing word in

the clause fragment needs to be sanitized. Please sanitize.

We appreciate your calling this to our attention.

Also, if

possible, on counted but unnumbered page 13 under "header

B-W,

subsection VI - Mail, sub-subsection J.,"' is it

unnu

possible to

redact the digraph that precedes "indian?"

If not already 'out there', please redact the digraph.

178-10410-10041

We do not have a copy of this document, but we can release

"Handle via COMINT Channel only.":

178-10004-10054 and -10053 (vice -10043)

These two documents contain a different system of controls

(not COMINT), and we need to continue to protect it.

In

-10053, this is not COMINT but the other system of control.

Please

protect this codeword in both documents.

Reference word was released in 'I.d' and protected in 'I.b.'

on page 19 because the word in the first instance refers to

a different, less sensitive location.
