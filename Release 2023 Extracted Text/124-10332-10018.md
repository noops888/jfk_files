In view of the relative inactivity of subjee

at this time insofar as Cuban revolutionary matters are

concerned, no further investigation is being conducted, and

this case

is being closed.

Should subject subsequently

emerge as an active leader in anti-CASTRO activities, his

case will be re-opened, and investigation conducted concerning

his activities, and the Bureau will be advised.

U)

On August 1, 1961,

WILLIAM HERRINGTON

MOLA CoVErt

operational interest in subiect during the Cuban invasion

in April, 1961. HERRINGTON Said that while thete is no

interest in subiect at the present time.

CHERRINGTON!

Indicated that CIA did have considerable

operational interest in subject's yacht, the "Alisan"

but that there is no interest at the present time.

HERRINGTON indicated he would advise the FBI at Miami

CIA develops any

further interest in subject.(g

(Miami indices contained a 'communication from

JUSTIN F. GLEICHAUF, CIA representative, under date of

February 7, 1961, which, among other things identified

subject as a former Cuban senator who had collaborated on

matters relating to the publication from time to time callee

"Esbirros". This infornation, according to CIA, came from ye

a usually reliable source. Communication was classified "secret!

An investigation by the Miami Office of "Esbirros"

disclosed it was a two or three-page mimeographed "scandal

sheet' directed against the Frente Revolucionario Democratico

(FRD), as well as all other groups and individuals both pro

and anti-FIDEL CASTRO, according to MM 492-S. It was noted

that many individuals, anti-CASTRO and anti-communist, had

accused many other individuals of printing "Esbirros", which

had resulted in the paper not being printed or published in

January, 1961.

This paper received very limited distribution,

and It was not believed it had been printed in December, 1960. df(4)
