I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

Projoot LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soriet official

Installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LENVOY

assuned this responsibility.

This freed LIFEAT to provide, with 1t3

unilateral coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials shich

could better support not only the Station's CE effort but alse other

Statior. operations against the soviet target.

In this extort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting perlod. Samples

of the operational information provided by LIfEAT follous:

approximately 390 reels of take were passed to the local ODENVY for

their provessing. On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This

office feels the coverage mentloned is quite valuable and many usenul

leads are obtained from this coverage, particulaily with regard to

travel in and out of Mexico of American Communists who are in contact

wiüh individuals on whom coverage is raintained". Typical examples

of reporting based on LIFEAT coverage of tha ACGM are:

noted Cuban coverage, accounted for the greatest percentage of tha

LIFEAT effort.

Rost of the information provided by LIFEAT in 1ts

the home of a known Soules rielllionce officer stationed in Mexico

LISA? Informatian provided vital infor-

nation which enabled the Siiion to establish a pattern of action,

of both the family of the Scries officer and his neid.

This infor-

mation nado possible the seiiing of a time for una autual entry into

the target, and continuing areraço (Including live monitoring of the

target line immediately preceding the operation) by LIFEAT sado

possible a degrea of securist for this operation which would not have

been possible without the suppurt of a unilateral tap operation.

Further LIFEAT coverage has, la addition to giving informalan on

the dally activitles and corices of soviet officials, provided an ex-

-. cellent check on the contacis of three KUßARK controlled double agenta

with their Sovlet Case Officers. This coverage ins enabled the ruepoa-

sible Case Officer to guide his operations with Increased assurance

that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activiiies in this area were concerned primarily

with support to the AMSTRUT operation.

Coverage of relatives of

ANSTRUT -2 provided an excellen: "indow" Inio the uperation which

H. Conclusion

It is the opinlon of tho Mexico City Station tial the support providod

other Station operations, the CINCE InformatIon and loads, and tho

ability.of the unilateral LIFFAT opAration to cover senslilvo raryors

without rovealing Station Interest to the llalson forcon, woll Justify

been noted in the past, that even mith the starson's envolverent in cha

the presont local sovernment administration or a change in covernment

arministrations vould ond NUPARK parelo1pation in lia! llalaos projoot.

For that reason, LItEAT.. In addition. to maintaining its prosont hoavy

coverago, must bo availablo to once again undertake coverago of tho

official soviet and Croch official tarkets in Mexico Clty.

Therefore,

LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operations

and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positivo

intelligenco, leavos it readily avallablo for rocall into the soviet-

Czech coverage.

It 1s the Station'a firm opinion that the LIFEAT

contrals have boin removed by the central'e workmen, but these are of so

danger to the operation inless a füll Investigation l's made of one of

these unusual connections.

During, the past project jear no such investigation

has been undertaken, and no suspicion of the LIFEAT linesen has been revealed

to date.

The greatest dangers faced by LIFEAT in the past year centerod on tuo

developments, 1)

the continued efforts of the telephone company toward moderni-

zation

of the Mexico City teleptiona system and 3) the Investigation launched by

tho seoretaria do Camunicaciones y Obras Publicas (SCOP) to determino 18 tha

tolephone company. has not been providine maximum possible service to Moxioo

City residents

by hölding from use certain "spare pairs" of every cable and

distribution box:

In the first development (which has been in process for tha past sen years

and was so noted li part project renewals) the most noteable incidents which

offoCt LIFEAT security are the Installation of new underpround cables ro-

placing the old

overhead telephone wires (thereby reducing access to target

11nes and tap routing lines) and the institution of a more efficient system

to keep track of dally assionments of the telephone company personnel (cereby

The limiting, of the mobility of the LIFEAT linemen has not jet interferred

serIously with LIFEAT socurity or efficlenoy. However, In event of a "flap"

situation, the delay in getting one of these lliemen anay from his normal

asslenment in order lo cut back the affected LIFEAT tap could cause serious

consequences. A number of Ideas have been tried to bypass this problem but

as yet no natisfactory solution has been found. LIFFAT personnel are continuing

their attempts to negate this problem, too.

This

would eliminate LIFEAT use of these pairs to route

Even the posslbility

of StOP insistance an only a reduction in the number of "spare pairs", held

from use by the telephone company could affect LIFEAT adversely, sinco this

would reduce the options LIFEAT has in routine 1ts tap lines.

However, until

the Invostigation is comploted, and no f1rm estimato of a target dato 18

presently known, the real danger of LIFEAT can only be speculated upon.

LILEUD-l 1s alerted to obtain the recoumendations of SCOP when fiven to

the telephone company and all efforts will be mado b: LIFEAT personnel to

other nogate or take advantage of any recommendations which aro placod

into practico.

It should be noted at tills point that the LIFEAT operation could "blow"

at any time throuch any of a large number of security dangers LIFEAT

faces in 1ts dally operation as a unilateral effort. LIFEAT, personnel are...

situation which wil "blow"' the operation despite the best efforts.
