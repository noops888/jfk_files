will reach mandatory retirement at age 60. The prospect of retirement de-

serves serious thought and planning because of its impact on each of us and

for thie reason, we'are taking this opportunity to provide you with thia

advance notice that according to our records you will be required to retire

on March 1971.

with each passing year, definite

progress toward your retirement goals and the Agency is anxious to assist

you in your retirement planning.

3.:

We would like to make available to you as much information as

possible on the general subject of retirement, your annuity estimates, life

and health insurance protection in retirement, opportunities for other

employment, Social Security benefits, and other additional matcrial which is

available.

The Agency feels that this type of information and advisory ser

vice should be made available and, hopefully, will be used by employees well.

in advance of the date of retirement:

Our Chief, Retirement Branch, on extension 3257, is available to

discuss with you any aspect of your retirement planning and we encourage

Mr. Noel is much too experienced and practiced a hand for his performance

to vary very much from year to ycar.

He has continuertif * Bin the hight

reditable performance in San Francisco that has been standard for hin fo

many ycars: He has managed hia subordinates well and has exorcised uni-

formly good judgment in directing their opcrational efforts. Of particular

value has been his stcadinees in the faco of administrative adversity disrupting

the organization of his Base. Mr. Noel insured that the work of the Bage

continued uninterrupted and demonstrated his capacity to keep on top of

all details and report them to Headquartors as appropriate. It is a credit

to Mr. Noel that in the post-Ramparte exposure period there was not a singlo

instance of an academic asset withdrawing from a relationship with the Base.

The performance of his officers atteststhe careful guidance and wise

leadership which has enabled them to oporate securely and woll in sensi

tive areas. His realtions with the FBI and DCS aro excollent. He is

appropriately economy mindod. In short, he is a decidedly strong aupor-

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

James A. Noel

1. - Chief, DO and I talked to Jim Noul this morning about

tie possibility.of his converting from staffer to career agent.

After considerable discussion, Jim agreed to the conversion. He

is obviously doing this reluctantly, but he appreciates the situation

within the DDP in which the encumbrance of senior grades by long-

lime employees is blockirg the promotions of junior officers.

2.

Jim urged that he be retained as a career agent until

he reaches the age of mandatory retirement (about three years).

Chief, DO stated that the need

for handlers

of contacts and assets is such that there would be a continuing need

for expurienced career agents

I told Jim that unless ho pulled something stupid,

he was virtually assured of career agent status until he reached

age 60, and perhaps could be employed as a retired annuitant alter

that time if his performance was productive and if operational

requirements remain as they are at present.

3.

Jim explained why he could not retire -- the next five

years will be difficult for him financially with two teen-age boys to

put through college.

Chief, DO and Jim will work out the details and timing

of his conversion to career agent.

BerVIce.

If you should return to the Civil Service Syaten In order

to receive the maximum annulty it would be necessary for you to nece

& daposit, with Intereat, to cover that perlod fur which no contri-

butions were made; however, you may receive full credit in counting
