Bill Harvey's absence) specifically for information about all CIA action teams inside

Cuba on 30 Oct and again on 31 Oct so that I could give a firm report to Dept. Sect.

Gilpatric prior to negotiations with the Soviets. Chever had not mentioned the

Matahambre sabotage team when 1 asked about action teams inside.&Cheverndid mention

that two action teams were inside (one small one in Central Cuba, and Ke tetto a wee

200 men in Western Cuba), that these teams were under orders not to

OCCURRENCE:

With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's memorandum to SGA dated 14 Nov.

1962 Harvey states: "The statement that Operation Mongoose had had no information on

this operation since early October was patently false.

Specific references made to the

pen ultimate paragraph and Lansdale's memorandum concerning a report for the CIA which he

used as a basis for memorandun dated 31 Oct. 1962 to Oswald Kirkpatrick. This refers to

a telephonie-conversation on the evening of 30 Oct. 1962 between Lansdale and cheever

which is referred specifically in paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memorandu.

I have discussed this matter in detail with Cheever and clearly recollects that his-

conversation with Lansdale on that date took place as reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this conversation there was no discussion of previous opcrations except a brief

discussion of the COBRA and AMORID teams and lansdale did not ask, according to cheever's

recollection, any specific questions concerning assets inside or prior operations which

SOURCE: would logically have led to the discussions at the tipstart:

of the Matahambre operation."

from CIA on the current status of all operations.

CIA reported all militant

operations have been ordered held at a stop, although the volatile Cubans

were frustrated and not under complete control. The Matahambre operation

was not mentioned by the CIA in reporting in operational teams inside Cuba,

although I asked for specifics on militant teams inside. Two-action-teams

CIA reported as being inside Cuba were described as in place only collecting

intelligence, not actions, (sabotage,etc.)*

deterred by the order (to stop hit and run raids). They may even profit by

the decree. It will now be a greater honor to engage in operations against

Fidel.

The double jeopardy arising from the threat of detention by U.S. agents

and the chance for martyrdom at the hands of Fidel will be an even greater

challenge. Actually the supply of recruits for such hit and run raids may

run shallow but not dry."

OCCURRENCE:

Fitzgerald states it is too soon actually to state definitely

what the effect of this policy (i.e. stopping raids) will have on our recruit-

ment program. The Agency's problem is not the number of recruits, but their

quality.

The unemployed, poorly educated, hungry are always with

us. Some of

the more discerning Cuban types will avoid recruitment as they are convinced

that a priciple reason for the U.S. action is to control who fights Castro in

order to insure who will succeed him.

of U.S. agents will be the improvement and control and better clandestine

security practices on the part of the exiles. But as the U.S. restricts and

apprehends these men, confiscating goods and funds, the loci power will have

a tendency to move back to its traditional center:

the exile--monied interests

such as the bosches, prios and Batistas.
