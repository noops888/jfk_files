THE NATURE OF THE BUDDHIST CONFLICT IN SOUTH VIETNAM

The current Buddhist protest movement in Soutb

Vietnam has been highly political since its incep-

tion.

However, in the context of Buddhist tradition;

as well as of political life under the igo family

regime,

it is impossible entirely tó separate Bud-

dhist political aims from Buddhist religious mötivâ-

tion..

And in the course of their protest campaign,

many otherwisé apolitical Vietnamese Buddhists were

forced to the conclusion thät only through à change

in the regime could they win religious equality:

A majority of the South

His statements cannot be refuted

The five demands: drafted

by Buddhist leaders in Hue on

10. May were in effect a petition

for both religious and political

concessions, including the elimi-

nation of legal restrictions not

applicable to Catholics and resti-

tution for the 8 May victims.

Whether

or not, the: demands were

that the government reached a

compromise agreement on 16 June,

however, the Buddhists had de.

veloped sufficient momentum and

evidence of new repressions to

challenge the regime's promise

of good faith.

There is strong evidence.

that

the government, through

its authoritarian inclinations

and its concern over Viet Cong

instigation or exploitation. of

the Buddhist issue, was disposed

from the beginning to regard the

dhists were able to arouse pub-

demonstrations and, ultimately,

by self-immolations which, what-

ever their political effects,

represent a sacrificial gesture

compatible with the traditions

of Vietnamese (Mahayana) Bud-

dhism.

Although by early Au-

gust the fervor of the Buddhist

movement may have been partly

out of control, as claimed by

the Buddhist leaders, the lat-

ter were already expanding their

demands in late June; in mid-

July moderate Buddhist clergy

were expressing alarm over the

political aims of extremists in

the movement.

There is almost

no question that Tri Quang and

others were actively organizing,

whether from the outset or as

a: result of frustrations en-

countered during the campaign,

a"vehicle to bring about the

government's overthrow, though

they do not appear to have co-

operated with Diem's traditional

political opponents:

The government has claimed

it has proof of Communist di-

rection of the Buddhist campaign,

but officials privately admit

there is little hard evidence

of this, other than Viet Cong

directives to exploit the is-

sue. Charges concerning the Com-

munist ties of Tri Quang and

other Budhist leaders apparently

derive from French intelligence

files alleging their participa-

tion in the early stages.of the

Viet Minh resistance.

Quang him-

self claims that, despite per-

sonal antipathy to Diem, he ini-

tially accepted the President

as a strong anti-Communist leader;

it was only later that he con-

cluded that Diem could not win

the war and that the Buddhists

were caught between the evils

of the regime and of the Viet

Cong.

Quang, however, is polit-

ically sophisticated and.some-

what devious in his approach.

A Vietnamese source, one who

regards most Buddhist leaders

as sincerely motivated, has

expressed distrust of Quang

and his denials of Communist

sympathies.
