3. July 1951 1n which you requested that a Special Inquiry be coi

ducted to resolve inforustion concerning an allegation that sub

joct lo gympathetio to and/or connected vith Communist activitios.

2. On 31 August 1951, Mr. Kenneth Patrun of the Security

Office was advised that partial results have been received as

a result of inquires at several national agencies.

The partial

information reflected that Subject had beon connected with at

least two factions of the Comminist Party while living in the

far East.

It was suggosted that extreme caution be used in con

tacting or associating with the Subject.

3.

This offico has completed the investigation of the Sub

ject, which includes a check of records of the appropriate Federal

agencies.

As a result of this imestigation, the filos of this

office

contain a great deal of information concerning Subject's

association with questionable organizations and individuals.

Although Sübject has denled any current activities with the Commu

nist Party, his associations and aotivities are highly questionable

and his political sympathy has not been unqualifiedly resolved at

the prosent time.

In blow of the information as set forth above, It 18

recoimended that extrane caution be exercisod in dealing with the

Subject. Under ho circumstances should Subject ba contacted, vith

regard to posstble use by this agency prior to recelving a final

security determination by this office.

TO: Lieutenant Colonel ROCLE L. PAPP

From: John I. Coddlington

•Subject: HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS

Mr. GORGE N. KATES Of O33, Fih, has just roturned to the United Statos

from Chungking. Ho reached lashington yesterday. He clains to have known

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS quite well in Chungking, and has the following observations

to make concerning fir. ISAACS:

HAROLD ROBERT ISAACS 18 atout 35 Jears of age. Ho attended Columbia

University, and received the dozros of A.B. there in 1930. He 18 tho son of

an orthodor jewish norchant, who is very wealthy, and who has almaye supportod

HAROLD, even though he did not approve of the radical views that HAROLD expreseed

In the 1930'9.

HAROLD went to Chira mediatoly after graduation fron Columbia, partly,

atleast, out of a desire to see atrange parts of the morld and to experienco

"adventure." He went out by way of Herall, and stowed away for part of the

voyage - elther betwean san Pranciaco and Honolulu, or between Honolulu and

Shanghai - Mr. KATSS does not reserber which. Anyway, this was part of the

"adventure."

In China, HAROLD met a South Alrican named FRANK GLASS, who was an "Intolloctual"

and a very interesting person. GASS mes a Leftlat, but not at all a Coiminist.

HAROLD took a trip up the Yangtae with GLASS in 1930 or 1931. At about this timo,

HAROLD becane a convert to protokylan, partly, at least, under GlASsis influenco.

Ho felt that "suffering humnity" required a "revolution" to set things straight.

Communism was too organized, and fifOlD was a complete individualist, and renctod

strongly against the organizationei set-up of Communisal, and 80 espoused Trotskylan.

He returned to Shanghal fron the western part of china, and ment to work for

1932. YANG CH' Lai was the head or this for Central Ching, and Dr. HU SHIH (later

Chirese Ambassador to fisshington) tas the head of it for North China. YANG was st

that tiro Secretary-General of the deadenia Sinica. YaNt was soon assassinated

by the Blue Shirts (at that time MIG KAI-SHEK's bodyguard). HAROLD ISHAGS had

boen an enthusiastic nember of the wins League for Civil Rights, and in the

-atsosphere of turmoil, niter the killing of YANG, when all leftists were under

attack by the Kuaintang, HAPOLD becase tho editor and publisher of the China Forum,

various controversios - the printing shop was broken up by kuanintans strong-arm

men; the mili were refused to the ragazine; but he continued publication for

some

tina, and smugaled the copies out to the subscribers.

In 1933 or 1934, ISLACS bad & fight with AGNES SOULSY. It was an ideological

right, and therefore especially bitter. IsluGs and his wife left Shanghal after

this, and soved to Paking. There he acquired a Chinose translator named LIU,, and

there he settled down to write his back, ihe Tragddy of the Chinese Fevolütton.

It was on this occasion that he mist have undertaken to translate TROTSKY's book,

Whither France? ISUACS then returned to New York, and went to work for the

HAVAS News Agency once nore.

At some tina in the lato 1930's, he became interedtod in New York polities,

and he sorked hard for NORMAN THOMAS.

By 1940, howèver; ho became disgusted with New York politics, and became

Interestod in the war, and in"bourgools lifo." He and his vifo had a baby at

about this time (their first), and ISAACS found he could write radio scripts and

got good money for them. Up to 1940, he had been living chiefly off his father,

but from 1940 on, ho begar to mike money. In 1942, he did a "Report to the Nation"

for CBS.

Soon after this, ho joined the Start of News-lleck, and in 194 was sent to Chungking

by that nagazine. Theire must have been a certain amount of trouble in convincing

the Chinese Central Goverrment that ISLACS had really changed since the old days

In Shanghai, but this convication was evidently accomplished, or ISAACS rould not

have received permission from the Chirinse Covernment to go to China.

IShAGS 18 a very smert ran indeed. He knows a lot: about China, and he knows a

lot about people in general. loreover, he is a great deal "smoother" and more

diplomatie nor than hè mas ten years ago.

Subject: HARULD ROBERI ISAACS

HAROLD ROBERT ISANGS 10 nOM the correspondent of Nowsweok magaxine In

China. His herdquarters are in Chungking, but he evidently travels to unming,

Kweiyang, and other places in the course as hia dutios. He seemo to havo arrived

In China in his prosent capacity during the summer of 194l, probably in July.

Subjecò mes born in 1910, and 1s a member of a wealthy famlly. He bacame

a firmly convinced Trotskylst in his youth, and remained one till the time of

PearlHarbor. He is now regarded as a renegade by his former Trotstolst callengues,

because he has disavowed the principles

of world revolution, turned away from

Trotsky's taschings, and since 1939 has been writing patriotic propaganda for the

Unitod States Government.

He wert to China about 1930, and wrote two books dealing with Chinese

politics, Fise Yoars of Kuomintang Reaction (1932); and Tho Tragody of the Chinese

Revolution (1938). Both of these volumes axpressed the author'd trotskylat

point of vien, The firat was publlabed in Shanghal, and the second in London.

Neither was over published in the United States, and ISAACS sald that the

Stalinist Carnists were so powerful in this country that they tiere able to

provent the pablication of the Iragedy of the Chinese Revolution here. This

book received high praise from many serlous students of Far Eastern affairo,

Including G.P. Fudson, Pollo of All Souls College at Orford, and author of.

The Far East in Forld Politics, who said that ISAACS! book was the test one evor

arliton on the Chinese Revolution. Hudson is now an official of the British

Ministry of Information.

ISAACS' non-Communist and non-Trotskyist friends say that even during the

was always open and above-board, and never ongaged in any conspiracies to overthron

Ho was attracted to the novement, they say, by shoor

For a time in China, ISAACS lived Mith TIllman DURDIN, the China correspondent

of the New York Times, Who was then the mnaging editor of the China Proas. ISAACS.:

returned to the United States In the late 1930'8, and was for a time eriployed by
