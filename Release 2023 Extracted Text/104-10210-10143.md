25/11-53.

The Fresident of the United States of imerica, Jonn f jennedy was

assassinated by lee i Oswald by direct order of the governuent of

the Peoples Republic of Ching. Lee H Oswald executed the act alone

but there was helpers and reserv. "Now all is over" was password

to his customers: Oswald was a fully convinced Coumunist but he

must assassinate Kennedy. Ve etablised contact with Oswald already

when he was in Sowiet but then to try to get him as a spy for China.

Later he was spy for us. When lee il Oswald had returned fo USA we

couliabled hiu aner dod Ireshened up his minú "you have beed a spy

for us" and told him what could happen to him if FBI got informed.

Now we had him. He got his last information in lexico. /It was not

good to assassinate kennedy in lexico/ "Fair Play for Cuba" was

started only to confuse and throw the blame on Castro for the as-

ssassinated. Our government thought that USA should attack Cuba

when Xennedy-was murded as the orginaztion was behind the assassin-

ation. Then Cuba was attacked by USA Sowiet must help Castro defend

himself. It that was so it would burden Sowiet that Oswald: had.visi-

ted. He should be allieted with sowiet then we mould ast them for a-

bombs and they should not be able to refuse us. He and Sowiet should

win this war and whole the norld should be Communistic. Then we should

assassinate Krustjer and other Sowiet leaders and we would be leader

of the NEW WORD. When this letter will reach you they have maked

away with me and all that knowed the planes. This letter is outsmuggled

Ixon our Embassy in Stockholm where the Embassy is a chinese spy-shool.
