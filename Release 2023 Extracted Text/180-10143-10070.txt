Info. in PROT is info. selected from letters.
"II" is info. from person if he is recruited - they want it separated, to be
viewed only on "need-to-know" basis.
Standard form for opening 201 file would not contain reason; would
contain ref. to documents which would be the reason.
201 #'s all designed by a particular Agency in sequential
numerical orders.
201 would contain photocopies - when other agencies send in file,
if prots is sent in from field or another agency after 201 is opened,
it would be added to 201.
Doc. Review of 201 - see they are opened in sequential
numerical orders.
201 File num. 1.5. Reason" - Reason is categorized
by a review of the file using specific criteria.
PROT does not apply to PROII.
Normally PROT & PROTI would exist in the same file. If PROTT contains
primarily op. info, then it would be in separate file,
to which would be a reference to PROT.
If operational info. limited, separate files would then
be made.
Name & cryptonyms are not maintained on the same sheet.
but it is not maintained on the same sheet.
On 201 reg. form, there is no room for a cryptonym, but it is
filed in a tale name file.
There is a table of contents list of what is available in 201 file.
This is compiled from alphabet record list in complete system.
Green list check: Info. gathered as a result of SIGINT or COMINT.
* White check: also a separate check, but Cliffy doesn't know what it checks.

Am. citizens in most cases, generally used in some measure, would not
interest the most senior people.
If that person was an agent of a foreign agency or from military,
then other agencies would have to be consulted.
Formerly would not exist.
PLS - Policy & Coord. Staff.
Is would be involved in coord. of a project in which both the CIA &
another org. was involved.
To the extent of its involvement, files would be maintained. That is
not to say that files would not have more comprehensive files.

OCB - office of Central Intelligence
activities are mainly photos of persons, etc.
Photos of persons involved would not be of interest.

This has always been true - in earlier times, it may have been restricted

P&L communication may, in time, be downgraded; may never be destroyed.
Is it possible, in context of a threat, in case of an hypothetical that staff
would not be compiled in a 201 file - it is conceivable that it
may appear in a different system & not compiled into a 201 file.
Pseuds: cannot be compelled into a 201 if there is no reason.
Crypto: used to id. names of ops. of communication.
If soldier lists has given away mil. secrets & then defects, a 201 file
would not necessarily have been opened - it might be a mil. matter.
CIA staff may have had interests in defectors.
In early '60's, there was an interest in defectors.
Dan's crypto based on ZRRIFLE:
574 A form: request to put doc. into system
In op. such as ZRRIFLE, request to put doc. into system - may go
to 201 file.
"Sleeper agent" hypo: to PROHIBIT handling of 201 file - might go
directly to 201 file.
Sleeper agent necessarily has to be a staff member.
Would a 201 be opened on sleeper?
Competing secrecy vs. being able to keep track of sleeper.
