1. As per reference D Heddquarters concurs in chis program and has offered

to forward requirements If JMWAVE so desires. Since this approval wes obtalned

from Headquarters, I have taken the following steps: (A) requested and obtained

some requirements

from IS to be used. In this program and (B) chrough PASSAVOY

have requested

some basic informalion as to specific facilities for use in this

program. AMBUD-1 is to advise us on the following matters: if the Hotel Monroe,

fer, which AMBUD receives approximately $800 per month, has space available for

AMBUD-1 has,

as

requested,

advised the group members of AMBUD to each appoint

an Individual as "Jefe de Infornacion"« in such cases there one does not already

exist.

are

2. My primary purposesin setting up this collaction program ts/to obtain

useful information and to make AMBUD a useful organization with a purpose in mind--

à purpose wich a practical and visible ends. AMBUD is a large organization composed

of a number 8mbffeyps and Individuals which also has affiliates who are not actual

mambers. The/personnel avafibe to it is undoubtedly unequailed in the NAVE Area.

FrOm

this vast reserve of manpower, there is every reason to believe competent

interrogators can be found, although most of them would naturally need training in

interrogation and reporting

techniques, which factor can be surmounted. In addition

to the AMBUD personnel supply, there is also a vast, untouched number of sources to

of information

1n the WAVE area. For example, part of each plane load stite uf exiles

which arrives frum CUba is released by Imnigration; the remainder (about 2/3) are

sent to CAC. Of that number all are screened at CAC and about i are actually

interrogated at CAC due to

the lack of personnel to handle any more cases. In sclax

sards addition, no

women arriving from Cuba are interrogated at CAC.. Therefore,

the number of

persons who are potential sources of information available to AMBUD

would be approximately 2/3 of all tcose arriving from Cuba, plus all the women.

I think we should approcah this information collection program with an

As a result, I plan to make up a chart,or table of organization, of an actual

Interrogation center for this purpose,

In addition, I will rake an estimate

of any addidonal expenses which might be involved in the near future. Since I

have had actual KUBARK

experience in an interrogation center, I believe I am

at least somewhat qualified to make certain suggestiors. (HYl: in the jolot

KUBARR/Spanish Interrogation Center created for the interrogation of Spanish

repatriates from the USSR, I was chief of the CE Section. In additoon, l'trained

several Folice Inspectors and Spanish Army Officers in Interrogation techniques.

Also, I

was head of a five-man Spanish interrogation team.)

L. An interrogation center of the type I have in mind, after serious consideration

of the personnel, facilities and sources available to AMBUD,

the operational map,

so to speak, and should also do credit to JMNAVE. This centert

would not be in opposition to, or in competition with CAC, since the sources tapped

would be those they are not physically able to handle and the women who now are

under no one's jurisdiction for such satteras purposes.

with you and to come ten about he guite a coup cos to us this programa.
