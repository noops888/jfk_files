Connection with the Agency

Memorandum of Conversation,

Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and the DCI.

Dated 6 September 1975

1.

The referent memorandum contains two points

which

require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

In one form or another, the allegations are

hat Lee Harvey OSWALD had been connected with the Agency.

The allegations are totally urrounded.

2. The facts regarding

this matter are as follows:

On 27 Noyember 1963 I was instructed by

Mr. R.G. Rocck, my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thorotal check within the Agency at Headquarters

to accept statements of intermediaries.

He also ex-

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the Warren

Commission®

b. Although I had already checked the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination,

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DDO

I recall very clearly that we were

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation, in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CIA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and I am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta sen was not

that of Oswald. We do find from our informant don there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had. He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it would take three

weeks. He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr. Rocca

"Internal Mana Regarding Ageney's Position in Dealing

with, Warren Conmission

"The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state,

that the Dirgetor has received a telephone call from, RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM;

day.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on tha

morning.

The DDP wishes to have from you a

sho

but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basit issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission. For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH'source. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director' appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fatty aware of its implications since it could well serve

ax the basis for detailed questioning.

Thé DDP stated that he would

Feview thie

Carefully and made a decisiati a

question of timing.

Given the schedule, you willappre

ciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

in DaI houses, where they receite

Their life is normal;

they use the cover of being scholarship students supported by the Cuban governmert

The DGI supplied them clothes, food, and every sort of care, such as medical and

any othar kind. The DGI takes care of their general expanses.

Ordinarily king an attempt is made to hosp then fron contact with rag anyone in

government circles so as to avoid indiscretions. Any agent recruited in a foreign

country is brought to Cuba and arrangements ara made so that he has no contacis

with persong in Cuba from his own country or any other. Once his training is

completed, his departure fron Cuba is not made know to anyone attached to him

In recruitment of Cubans, an effort is made to find those knowing the fewest

possibla persons. "If the Cuban who is recruited is employed in an office or

factory or works sone other place, an effort is made to have him continue his

work so as to use his situation to proride true cover; instruction is given at

hours when he is not working.

If the agent has any trouble after he has been

recruited,

the DhI tries to helo him as nuch as possible without breaking dow

compartrentation or his covere

When he has completed his training and is sent abroad, the UGT covers the ex-

panses of his family.

If a Cuban who is recruited is unemoloyed, it looks for

a cover adapted to his situation, and the UGI takes care of all the expenses

the agent has, including those of his fanily if he is married. He receives his

training in the hours adapted to his cover position.

His life, Like that of the

agent who is working, must contire normal, just as it was before recruitment.

SUBJECT: Lee Harvey OSWALD

On 17 December Mr. Papich

HIBITED

Dadvised that the Bureau was

anticipating a request fron the Somnission, named by President

Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already submitted. He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache in Mexico City dealing with the Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich

Inguired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad-

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

in which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps..

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

consultation with Mr. Angleton and Mr.

Ambassador Mann knew of no contacts by Oswald with

Once again we asked Anderson to review the Gutierrez

either being prepared or that had already been sent to

Washington on this matter which

we had not yet received. We

Anderson agreed that it would be a workable arrangement. In

this connection it came out that Osrald's tourist card appli-

the FBI Mez"can office and therefore authenticating it would

be a problem to be handled elsewhere. He agreed that we kosla

the argument with Azque took place was itself different from

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

SIlvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

of paper with her name and telephone

number; because Azque

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

*Posing Certain Questions on their Letter to Ue

I would Include in our letter to the CIA the following

questions:

Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

supposed to have taken placa in an automobile outside the

Cuban Embassy in Mexico City?

Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet

Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? If you

do, can we find out its contents?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your

letter.

Would 1t be possible for us to see the full report

• of the Mexican police Interrogations of Hrs. Duran and her

husbard?"i

....

Paragraph 7 of your letter states that Oswald;

"that same afternoon,"

came back

"again" to the Cuban

Embassy.

Does this mean that he was there twice the same

day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous

day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the

Soviet Embassy? Only the latter Interpratation of this

sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed Information

As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sonetime in Summer 1960 --

this was discussed while Oswald and his family

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck »

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

4. As an afterthought, I recall

also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "hone".

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany hin to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

Timited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.l Dissemination to the Intelligence Community

E.2

Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
