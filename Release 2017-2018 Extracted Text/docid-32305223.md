00: New York

The following is submitted for the information of the

Bureau, New York and Chicago and should be of interest concerning

ICN affairs. It should be noted that the information is

speculative as to the purpose of Milwaukee ICN family boss FRANK

BALISTRIERI's trip to New York City and his possibly receiving

direction from the top level of the LN. Should New York or

Chicago have any confirming information upon review of instant

communication,

including the purpose of FRANK BALISTRIERI's trip

to New York, Milwaukee should, of course, be notified accordingly.

On 6/27/67, SA CARLYLE N. REED was in contact with

MI 623-C-TE, at which

time this informant advised as follows:

instructions are relayed to members or other persons by word of

mouth. FRANK BALISTRIERI claimed that this procedure is now going

on all over the United States among the several LCN families.

FRANK BALISTRIERI also stated to these other members

that guys like MARSHALL CAIFANO recently pled guilty to federal

charges in Chicago, Illinois (FBI • ITSP case) to protect other

hoodlum leaders there. Informant pointed out that this is contrary

to usual procedure in

the past whereby family members would not

enter guilty pleas.

In this instance informant also pointed out

that CAIFANO was probably playing for a concurrent federal

sentence to run with a state conviction in California for which

he has to serve time.

The informant was questioned concerning the fact that

in the past the Milwaukee family and particularly the boss, FRANK

BALISTRIERI, has been receiving orders from Chicago and has been

considered under the direction of the Chicago family. Informant

explained that there is speculation among the soldiers in

Milwaukee that Chicago is probably having to make changes due to

the convictions of family leaders there which would necessarily

cause considerable disruption in the Chicago family.

Therefore,

it is possible that both Chicago and Milwaukee are having to

seek direction and orders frow New York City as far as family

leadership is concerned.

Informant acknowledged that this is

strictly talk or discussion and not to be considered lact..

Milwaukee will advise further in the event the

informant obtains any substantiation or additional pertinent

information concerning the above matters.

MI 623-C-TE is identified as &

hoodlum who has

furnished reliable information in the past.

Extreme caution should be exercised in the

utilization of any of the above information and, il disseminated

in any way, it should be suitably paraphrased to completely

protect the identity of this informant and the fact that he is

located at Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Compromise of this informant

could jeopardize his personal safety

and well-being.

Further,

has been and

is expected to cantinue

he

to be a valuable source

in

CIP - LCN matters.
