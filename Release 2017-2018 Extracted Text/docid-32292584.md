Note: Alex was barred by Swiss authorities in 1965 from re»

entering Switzerland for a period of 10 years due to his un-

savory background

and reputation as a hoodlum.

He has continued

efforts through attorneys to have this ban lifted and within the

recent past, letters were forwarded to Swiss authorities by

Congressman

Dawson and Senator Dirksen, both of Illinois, in

Ales®

behalf.

Chicago has indicated efforts to lift the ban are

being continued by Alex and his attorney George Bieber, and

has suggested contact of Swiss officials by Legat regarding

ban against Alex.

Recent information indicates the ban still

in effect and representative of Swiss athorittes, after checking

into the matter in Chicago, indicated he would recommend con-

tinuance of ban.

In view of controversial aspects of this situation,

and prominence of several individuals

mentioned in connection

therewith, it is not considered desirable for legat to make

inquiries

Swiss

authorities at this time and he is being so

advised.
