On 5/31/61 PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

Prior to the primary elections on 5/16/61, GABRIEL MANNARINO

and hia henchmen were meeting about once or twice a week

with political workers during evening hours in Memorial

Park, New Kensington, Pa. This park has only one road that

leads in and out, and an unusual number of ears were

observed entering and leaving.

Since the GABRIEL MANNARINO-

backed candidate, incumbent New Kensington Mayor RAYMOND

GARDLOCK, lost the nomination, there has been a marked

dimunition in the number of caro going to Memorial Park

but GABRIEL MANNARINO has been observed to enter the park

on two occasions alone in his car.

There is some talk in New Kensington

GARDLOCK-MANNARINO forces are thinking of conducting a

campaign to get voters to write in GARDLOCK, or gome other

hand-picked candidate, in the general election in November,

1961. SAMUEL MANNARINO, who backed EDWARD ZALESKI against
