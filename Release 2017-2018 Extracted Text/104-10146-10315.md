Relations, Department of State, called to explain that a task force had

been established at State on the Middle East airplane package and asked

if he could lay on a briefing for this group by us on the arms balance

in the Middle East. Bob Hepworth's, NFAC/CSS, office was advised.

26. (Confidential - LIM) LIAISON Called Bill Miller, Staff

Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and concluded

arrangements in connection with the Director's providing Senator

Lowell Weicker (R., Conn.) certain KCIA material and outlined the

terms and conditions of the covering letter from the Director to

Committee on Ethics.

Deputy Staff Director, House International Relations Subcommittee on

International Organizations (Fraser Subcommittee), and told him that as

soon as he can have Chairman Donald Fraser (D., Minn.) execute the

Addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and

the Subcommittee, we were prepared at his convenience to show him the

additional material which I had discussed with him. Hershman is pleased

with the progress we are making and all indications are that Chairman

Fraser will find it acceptable to rely upon Hershman's testimony

exclusively on the FBI/CIA issue and there will be no necessity for a

statement from the CIA or a CIA witness on KIA.
