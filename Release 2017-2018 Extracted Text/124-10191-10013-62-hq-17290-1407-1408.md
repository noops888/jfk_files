The Chairman.

And what was there, given the kind of tone

4931

that was set from the top by Mr. Hoover, the realization

4932

4933

that he wanted DI. King destroyed, and with that notion

being prevalent throughout the entire bureau, and trickling

4934

all the way down to men like Rose who came in this afternoon

4935

and admitted under oath that he was racially prejudiced,

4936

with the knowledge existing throughout the entire bureau

4937

4938

4939

4940

that Hoover wanted him destroyed, what would stop some agent

from feeling that he could with impunity kill DI. King?

Mr. Brennan. I think that is an extreme supposition.

think that the people in the FBI, at least on the basis of

4941

my personal experience over the years that I worked in the

4942

4943

FBI for more than 26 years, were men of great dedication and

integrity, and I would say that that would be

tar-out

then

4944

extreme case.

4945

Now I am not saying that we

never had any bad apples in

4946|

the FBI, and that somebody would

not consider doing a bad

4947 thing, but I would be shocked and

amazed if any individual

in the FBI ever did consider such a step.

The Chairman., Were you shocked and amazed that it was

testified to here that when MI. Rose heard DI. King had been

killed he expressed joy, and used the term

''They got the

SOB''? Did that shock and amaze you?

MI. BIennan. That shocked me, yes.

I don't see how any

man, particularly the men of the caliber, of the type that

we try to get into the FBI, would be joyful over that type

of assassination.

The Chairman.

Regrettably, Mr. Rose is still with the

FBI.

MI. Brennan. Well, sir, that is not of my doing.

The Chairman.

I do not fault you for that.

I fault the

system for keeping him.

The gentleman from the District of Columbia, MI. Fauntroy.

MI. Chairman,

I have no questions.

I am

exhausted.

The gentleman from Ohio, Mr. Devine.

Mr. Devine.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

INTERVIEW BY HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

On December 14, 1978, Special Agent Thomas J.

Deakin, Public Affairs Office,

on Assassinations regarding the Racial Counterintelligence

Program which Special Agent Deakin supervised for a period

of time in 1967 and 1968.

The questions asked by the Committee staff

related to the justification of selecting Martin Luther

King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as

targets of the Counterintelligence Program and at what

level of the FBI this selection was made.

General information on the method of originat-

ing and handling Counterintelligence Program suggestions

was explored, as was the particulars of the Counter-

intelligence

Frogram aimed at the Poor Peoples Campaign.

The Comnittee investigators were particularly

interested in the amount of counterintelligence sugges

tions generated by former Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan

and whether these were on his own initiative or by oral

instructions from J. Edgar Hoover,

This last area was, of

course, beyond the knowledge of Special Agent Deakin.

A final area of inquiry was what was described

by the Committee investigators as factionalism withir

Bureau Headquarters between C. D. LeLoch and w. C. Sullivan.

This interview was not under oath as Mr. Webb

explained the Committee only planned to take a deposi-

tion if new information was obtained from Special

Agent Deakin.
