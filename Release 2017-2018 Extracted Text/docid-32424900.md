e. Summary - Our knowledge of Cuban military order of

battle, especially ground order of battle, has dropped off con-

siderably in recent weeks. Changes in unit organization and in

the numbering system as well as the militia nature of the organi-

zation itself make OB material perishable. Until such time as a

definite target date and objective is set making it possible to

inject a sufficient quantity of trained observers into the area with

specific targets, this situation will probably continue.

4. Estimate of the Potential for Military Operations within Cuba -

Should a policy decision be made to militarily intervene in Cuba, the

U.S. could:

ay with to-days of preparation, execute a coordinated airborne-

amphibious assault which it is anticipated would gain control of key

military installations and the principal centers of population of Cuba

within 10 days and result in minimum US and Cuban casualties.

b. Should the situation demand, a piecemeal commitment of

US forces could be made|with reaction times approximately as follows:

2 Airborne Divisions

5 days (para-drop units only)

• 4 Marine BLTS

7 - 8 days

Following Forces

15 - 18 days

: (This operation would involve a dangerous element of risk. )

c. In conjunction with either of the actions described in a and b,

above, cover and deception plans have been developed which, if executed,

would result in prepositioning of forces assigned to the invasion of Cuba

and could thereby result in an over-all reaction time of approximately

12 days for a coordinated assault.

Air strikes could be conducted against selected targets in

Cuba within 6, 12 or 24 hours; the time dependent upon airerast

availability and desired intensity of attack.

e. Ait-sea blockade can be initiated within 24 hours with effective-

ness increasing to a complete blockade within approximately 48 hours.

5. Factors Worth Considering in Deciding on One of the Following Four

Courses of Action for the United States to Follow in Relation to Cuba:

a. Cancel operational plans; treat Cuba as a Bloc nation; protect

Hemisphere from it.'
