He is pushing informant to have informant

set this up, however, to date informant has refused to do so

and stated he has no intention of hooking up this recorder

for TOURINE. Informant does not know the purpose of this

ADMINISTRATIVE CONTINUED

he likes to talk dirty to girls on the telephone and gets

a charge out of it.

It is noted that in the past the same informant

advised that another of the subject's aberrations is stealing

articles when he goes into stores.

He has

a compulsion to

steal

even though in many instances the article is

insignificant in value.

Through liaison the Bureau has furnished the

Swiss Police

since he periodically visits Switzerland.

The Swiss

Police in the event of another visit by the subject will

now take steps to have

him banned upon arrival.

It is noted

that TOURINE is already banned by

England.

Periodic spot checks of the subject's residence

and some of his known NYC hangouts were conducted by SAS

PAUL G. DURKIN and CHARLES G. DONNELLY.
