As far as meeting the

He had mary ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Granch for botterment of the payiolling system, but un-

were found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

uncertain in his thinking, and he does not always seem to crercischis

best judgment in reaching decisions, but he is striving to eradicate this

impression.

During

the: period Subject was in charge of the Payroll Section

at NAVE his performance was, in the rater's gainion, not more

than adequate:

He apparently was of the opinion

charge of a section relieved him of the onerous tasks of filing

and other related duties of like nature.

As far as neeting the

payroll deadlines Subject was proficient in this duts, but he

normally required considerable amount of overtime mork to meet

these deadlines

He had many ideas which he presented to Chief,

Finance Branch for bettermen't of the payrolling system, but un

fortunately after due consideration the majority of these ideas

were. found to be impractical and/or in violation of either good

accepted commercial practice or Agency regulations.

Suggestions

made to him were outridly accepted but upon follow-up it was

determined that he had failed to implement these suggestions.

Overall it is the rater's opinion that the Subject nas barely

adequate. in performing his assigned tasks.
