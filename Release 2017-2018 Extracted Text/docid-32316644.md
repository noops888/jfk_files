RE: AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO;

REGISTRATION ACT - CUBA.

On October 7, 1962, the "Diario Las Americas,"

a daily Spanish language newspaper published in Miami,

Florida, contained an article stating that a series of

lectures had been organized by the National Democratic

Front (Triple A), headed by Aureliano Sanchez Arango.

The lectures were to be held at 433W. Flagler Street

Institute.

The subject

of Azcuy's talk was to be "posi-

tive and Negative Aspects of Recruitment."

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)

advised on November 8, 1962, that Aureliano Sanchez Arango,

a politician and former Cuban Minister of Education, was

born June 7, 1907, Havana, Cuba. The U. S. Embassy at

Caracas; Venezuela, refused him an immigrant visa because

of his membership in the Cuban Coumunist Party from Decem-

ber, 1930, to December, 1931. Sanchez seeks classification

RE: AURELIANO SANCHEZ ARANGO•

head of the Asociagion de Amigos de Aurellano (Iriple A),

an organization now in exile in the United States.

This

organization is in opposition to the government of Cuba,

and Sanchez is prominent and influential in political

groups throughout Latin America which are friendly to the

United States and opposed to Communism.

INS advised that the U. S. Department of State

has found Sanchez to be a bona fide defector, and that his

entry into the United States would be in the public interest.

MM T-1, who has been active in Cuban revolutionary

activities for the past six years, and who has furnished re-

liable information in the past, on October 22, 1962, advised

that Ovidio Manalich,2633_BayView Drive Coral Ridge,-Ft.

Lauderdale, Florida, was formerly an attorney in Havana,

Cuba, who is presently residing in exile in the United

States, and is a close friend and associate of Sanchez.

MM T-1

advised that Manalich had recently received a num

ber of booklets from Caracas, Venezuela, and these booklets

were re-prints of a debate in which Sanchez had participated.

These booklets were received by Manalich on about October 13,

1962, and were addressed to his residence.

MM T-1 advised that Sanchez Arango is a close

friend of Romulo Betancourt, the President of Venezuela,

and members of the Triple A

say that on a recent trip to

Venezuela, Betancourt contributed $10,000.00 to Sanchez'

organization, but that Sanchez lost this money inadvertently

leaving it in

some hotel where he stayed while en route.
