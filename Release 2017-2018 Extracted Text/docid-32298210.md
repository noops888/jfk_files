ADMINISTRATIVE

The Intelligence Unit of the Miami Police

Department comes under the supervision of Captain LEE

NAPIER.

The Intelligence Section has been investigating

matters relating to Cuban revolutionary activities during

the past two and one-half years, and has made several

seizures of guns and a number of arrests relating to

violations of local ordinances. It is possible that

some of NAPIER's contacts with Cuban revolutionists

have been of a legitimate nature pursuant to his official

duties.

U. S. Customs, Miami, has advised that NAPIER

has, in different ways, tried

to get information from

U. S. Customs, both in Washington, D. C., and Miami,

Florida, concerning anti-TRUJILLO groups. They have

refused to give him any information, suspecting that he

would transmit this information to

the Dominican Republic.

AL TARABOCHIA, Deputy Sheriff, Intelligence Unit,

Dade County Department of Public Safety (formerly the

Sheriff's Department), advised that the Intelligence Unit

does not trust or cooperate with NAPIER.

Miami Office contacts NAPIER only on certain

matters within his jurisdiction, and then with great

circumspection, and considers most information furnished

by NAPIER as being self-serving and not within the realm

of verification.

It is noted that RODRIGUEZ COUŒIhas, on several

occasions, desired MM 639-S to be introduced to NAPIER.'

The Special Agent handling MM 639-S has instructed informant,

stated during the time he was

Consul General,

on only

two pocasions had the Cuban

Consulate received any assistance from the Miami Police

Department, and that on neither of these occasions.

was assistance requested. He explained on one of these

occasions, which arose in 1957 when a group of Cuban

exiled demonstrators began to march from Bayfront Park,

Miami, to the Cuban Consulate, carrying banners and

placards, the Miami Police Department attempted to

stop

this unlicensed march. Two officers were severely

beaten.

The march was broken up, and a considerable

number of demonstrators were arrested by the Miami

Police Department.

An incident was thus avoided at the

Cuban Consulate.

The second incident occurred when Mr.

was at the Seaboard Railroad Station in Miami with the

family of a Cuban officialawho was departing for Washington,

A large group of threatening Cuban demonstrators

appeared on the scene, some reportedly with guns, and

the Miami Police Department rushed police to the scene to

avoid an incident.

A considerable number of these

demonstrators were also arrested by the Miami Police

Department.

MM T-1, on March 17, 1959 advised that ROY..

RATON, a Miami gun dealer, contacted GILBERTO PERNANDEZ,

who had reportedly served as a major in the July 26th

Revolutionary Movement.

MM T-4 said he subsequently talked to RODRIGUEZ

who said that NAPIER was very friendly and told him that

• ..

1f he ever got into trouble,

everything he could to help him. l? him and he would do

RODRIGUEZ said that at times, NAPIER has called

at his (RODRIGUEZ') residence and asked his advice prior to

performing some official act. RODRIGUEZ gave as an example

the time when ESTEBAN VENTURA first entered the United

States in 1959, NAPIER came to RODRIGUEZ and said VENTURA

was in the United States illegally and that he could arrest

VENTURA and have him deported.

He asked if this was what

RODRIGUEZ wanted, and RODRIGUEZ said "No". NAPIER did not

have VENTURA arrestea: (P)m)

RODRIGUEZ also said that NAPIER offered to give

RODRIGUEZ as much protection as he was able to give regard-

ing RODRIGUEZ' revolutionary activity. (X)M)

On December 19, 1959, MM T-4 advised that at

about 2:00 a.m. that day, RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO was contacted

by an individual who stated he had a method of shipping

guns to Cuba and that RoDRIGUEZ should immediately obtain

what guns he could for this shipment.(r(m)

RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO immediately made a telephone

call to Captain NAPIER and stated that he needed some more

"candy". Because of the early hour, it appeared that NAPIER

was uncertain as to who was calling him, whereupon RODRIGUEZ

stated he wanted more "candy", the same type that NAPIER

had previously delivered to RODRIGUEZ at a motel. RODRIGUEZ

told NAPIER he needed the "candy" before 6:00 a.m. (4)(M)

At about 3:30 .a.m. on December 19, 1959, NAPIER

arrived at the residence of RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO In a

Chevrolet automobile, was met by rodRIGuEz outside the

house, whereupon NAPIER opened the trunk of the automobile

and gave a box containing 19 revolvers to RODRIGUEZ. NAPIER

immediately left. No money exchange between NAPIER and
