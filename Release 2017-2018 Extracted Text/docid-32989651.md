REVIEW OI returns Ior past year Iron

pen special cute waten list

being monitored on our behalf by National Security Agency (NSA) shows

program has been productive and warrants continuation.

After combatting many technical problems for over two years,

NSA perfected a machine which could automatically handle through

mechanical means stops against a maximum of approximately 300 names

and addresses of interest to us in Cuban field. Since the machine's

capacity was limited, we selected the following categories for coverage:

(1) Names on Cuban special section of Security Index; (2) Regular

Security Index subjects living in Cuba who had been tabbed pro-Cuban;

Mail drops in Cuha nf known Cuban intelligence agents operating

in. U.S, anú fuerto Rico. Of course, NSA is not furnished the categories

in which the individuals fall and it is known to NSA only as the FBI

Cuban watch list.

During the past year positive returns have been received

concerning from five to 15 subjects each month.

Basically, the products

are open messages sent to or from the subjects on the list

and nothing

significant has been developed concerning intelligence activities on

behalf of Cuba. However, we have benefited considerably since the

stops enable us to confirm presence of subjects in Cuba who abandoned

their U.S. residences and to verify continued residence in Cuba of

many other subjects which could not be accomplished by any other

means now available to U.S. Government. The program is carried out

to assist in the curtailment of militant anti-Castro

expeditions, we desire the identitles of particinants to

assure the United States Goverment is aware of persons

whose activities should be monitored in the future. Detailed

information regarding the operations of United States-based

exiles in Cuba and countermeasures taken'by the Cuban Government

ore also of prime concern iron an intelligence standpoint

In view of the possibility that some participants are working

in collusion with the Cuban Government and have wittingly led

exile forces into a Cuban Governent trap.

Our most pressing problen in the Cuban field is the

identification of individuals in the United States who are

clandestinely transnitting intelligence information to their .

principals in Cuba.

We are constantly analyzing information

provided by you concerning indicated illegal agent traffic

being directed toward the United States from Cuba.

Your

technical assistancs is vitally important in our efforts to

pinpoint the areas wherein the recipients of the messages reside.

Our specific requirements in furtherance of the

foregoing objectives are being furnished your Agency as they

arise.

Your further assistance in efforts to curb activities

on behalf of the communist Cuban Government, as they relate

to the United states, will certainly be appreciated.

NOTE:

Classified "Secret" since reference is made to

National Security Agency's (NSA) efforts in the foreign

intelligence field, which information is so classified by

NSA. Unauthorized disclosure of this could seriously affect

national defense interests.

NSA has capability of monitoring messages to and from

individuals on Cuban Special Section of Security Index, Security

Index subjects residing in Cuba, mail drop addresses in Cuba,

and other areas of Western Hemisphere, and Cuban military

traffic pertaining to exile raids against Cuba, including the

eventual fate of

Date

Since 1962, National Security Agency (NSA) has been providing

valuable services to the Bureau in the Cuban field. Coverage afforded

o FATe ponsibility: con none -Cator Ction aning to many areas

Intelligence Service (CUIS) radio traffic to Cuban agents in the U.S.

This coverage is particularly of interest to us at the present time because

of irrefutable evidence from a defector that an illegal Cuban agent in

the U.S. is developing information concerning President Nixon's Key

Biscayne, Florida, residence, staff and associates.

NSA provides a broad picture of Cuban activity which enables

the Bure u to stay tuned to developments which could have a positive

effect on pro-Castro activity and CUIS operations in the U.S. Of

particular value is information furnished regularly concerning clandestine

conferences held in Cuba which are attended by U.S. citizens, some of

whom are radicals and other rabble-rousers.

It is well known that NSA is having to make drastic reduction in

personnel due to the President's drive to reduce Government spending.

This will almost certainly result in reduction in or curtailment of various

programs which NSA has had in effect. Because of the value to the Bureau

of NSA monitoring of Cuban activity, it is believed the Bureau should make

this known to NSA for their use in evaluating the effectiveness of their

various programs. Thus, betore making any arbitrary decision to cut back.

in an area of detinite interest to the Bureau, NSA will be fully apprised of

our interest.

Accordingly, a letter to NSA is attached for consideration

and approval.

EXTREMIST MATTERS

African Liberation Day demonstrations are scheduled

to be held on May 26, 1973, in approximately 26 cities in the

United States as well as in Montreal, Canada; Toronto, Canada;

Halifax, Nova Scotia; London,

England; Accra, Ghana; and on

the islands of Antigua, Dominica, and Grenada. These demon-

strations are being organized by the African Liberation Support

Comnittee (ALSC) under the leadership of Howard Lamar Fuller

of Greensboro, North Carolina, where the ALSC is headquartered.

In September, 1972, Fuller told a Howard University audience in

Washington, D. G., that overthrow of the United States Government

by any means, including terrorism in the manner of the Olympic

massacre, is necessary. Fuller has announced that the demon-

strations are to have three primary aims: (1) To cement conmon

bonds among oppressed African people throughout the world;

(2) To point to "concrete relationships that exist in the

Mr. Felt _

pattern of exploitation plaguing Airican people all over the

world"; and (3) To attempt to raise $40,000 or more to aid the

The Department has advised that its motion to dismiss

the indictment in captioned matter, filed with the court in

to dismiss.

Detroit on 10/15/73, has been granted by U. S. District Judge

Damon Keith.

The indictment, returned 12/7/72 superseding a prior;

indictment, charged 15 members of the Weatherman with conspiring

to violate Federal bombing and gun control statutes. Five of

the defendants have been free on bond awaiting trial and we

have continued in sees ine remaining iU detendants as fugitives

As a result of the dismissal, only one of those 10 defendants,

Ronald Fliegelman, will no longer be an FBI fugitive.

The othe

9 defendants whose whereabouts remain unknown will still be

sought based on violations of other Federal and local statutes

Four of these 9 defendants have Federal antiriot law charges

outstanding (Chicago) and the other 5 have other Federal charges

or Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution charges outstanding.

Whether the same situation will arise when they are located

and

brought before the court will depend on what motions are made by

the defense and what the particular judges' reactions will lill

",these motions.

REC-51

176-21111

The motion for dismissal was based on the fact that

a pretrial

evidentiary hearing

concerning allegations made

by

the defendants of Government misconduct in conducting the

investigation, ordered by the court on 1/10/13, might reveal

information vital to the National security iL This concerns

information obtained by the National Security Agency (NSA)

chrough its functions concerning the gathering of foreig

ibtelligence information. We previously recommended to the

Defendants.

• Motion And Order For Dismissal

Now comes the United States of America, by and

through Ralph B. Guy, Ji., United States Attorney for the

Eastern District of Michigan, and moves this Court for an

Order dismissing this case and in support thereof, states

the ollowing:

Pursuan't to the Orders of this Court dated

June 5, 1973, and July 10, 1973, the Government caused

investigations to be conducted by the White House, Central

Intelligence Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation,

National Security Agency, Department of Treasury, Department

•of Defense, Secret Service and the former Intelligence

Evaluation Conmittee of the Department of Justice into the

' defendants' claims of illegal and improper conduct on the

part of these agencies. The results of these investigations

have been furnished the Department of Justice and the

Department of Justice has received sworn denials of these

agencies that any such illegal or improper conduct as

described in the

defendants' motion and

affidavits has been

engaard in by any of these agcudies.

55101

DocId: 32989651 Page 171

However, the Court has previously boon advised

that ass agency of the Federal. Government,

for the lawful

purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence

information decmed

essential to the sccurity of the United States, has legally

intercepted communications of individuals who are not

defendants presently before this Court.

The Government has

determined that the security of the United States requires

that there be no disclosure of this information and further,

the broad scope of the evidentiary hearing previously

ordered by this Court on July.I0, 1973, permits inquiries

which may lead to disclosure of this vital national security

information.

Wherefore, notwithstanding the Government's

derermination, after extensive inquiry, that there has

been no illegall sabotage, mail searches, electronic

surveillance, provacateurism, breaking and entering or

other illegal and improper activities by United States

Government agencies as alleged by defendants herein, the

Government moves to dismiss this case in order to protect

vital national security interests from disclosure at the

evidentiary hearing ordered by this court.

On 10/1/73 John D. Butler, Chief, Soviet Intelligence

Activities, NSA, furnished the following information by secure

telephone:

55181

During the previous week, a meeting was held of the

Program Management Resources Review Group, a US Intelligence Board

committee whose function is to review and coordinate acquisition

of intelligence and assign priorities as a means of precluding

duplication of effort.

FBI does not normally participate in meetings

of this Group. It was indicated that the Director of Central

Intelligence (DCI) had recommended that acquisition and analytical

work by Butler's group be terminated. Butier indicated he had to

prepare rebuttal material for the Director of NSA by 10/3/73 and

that he was inquiring informally as to the FBI's position in the

indicated he did not feel that an official position would be

necessary fron the FBI at this timell) 105-25490-101

Butler was reminded that by letter dated 5/8/72 (copy

attached), FBI had officially levied collection requirements on iSA

to provide information

to assist in our counterintelligence mission.

Since that time Butler's group has given us detailed analyses and

breakdowns of numerous one-way coded radio broadcasts emanating

from the Soviet Union and Cuba which are believed directed to illegals

and illegal agents in the US.

They have also provided us with prior

interceptions of coded radio

traffic directed to subjects of our

"Palmetto" investigation which have permitted

us to capitalize on

a cryptographic penetration of those broadcasts by FBI Laboratory.

In addition, information from Butler's group is the only material cu.-

rently being received which permits even a rough estimate of the

illegal, capabilast hergrested by the soviets against. this country.

RE: NSA WATCH LIST

As you are aware, the NSA. Watch List has become an issue

in court trial in Detroit being heard by Judge Damon Keith (Keith decision).

Easically, the issue involves whether the use of the Watch list to gain

information on domestic organizations or U. S. citizens is in violation

of the Keitb decision.

Office of Legal Counsel feels that there is definite reason to

believe the use of the T-atch List in this respect is illegal. The Depait-

ment has yet to furnish an opinion in the matter.

The attached is the Watch List as furnished to NSA by the

Eureau and is current as of 9/21/73.

Each Section should review the List and indicate thereon those

organizations and individuals who should be retained with the above situation

in mind. Where a rocommendation for retention of a domestic organization

or U.s. citizen is made, full justification must accompany the List. Where

aliens or foreign organizations are involved, no such justification is necessar

It inust be borne in inind that in the event the court rules that the

surveillance of domestic organizations or J. s. citizens through the Watch

List procedure violates the Xeith decision, those organizations and

individuals will be delcted from the Yatch List.

Please review this material and eubn.it the requested results

by c.0.b. 8/28/73 to SA F.. E. Horner, 713-C 93D, Estension 2005.

Dear Mr. Kelley:

In the course of acclimating myself to my new assignment

I asked my staff to review with yours our Watch List procedures,

and they have been pursuing that subject diligently.

Meanwhile, I thought it would be worthwhile for us, as the

heads of cooperating agencies, to correspond directly on the Watch

List matter. The need for proper handling of the list and related

information has intensified, along with ever-increasing pressures

for disclosure of sources by the Congress, the courts, and the

press, and naturally I am concerned ultimately for the protection of

highly vulnerable SIGINT sources. Of paramount importance, how-

ever, is to insure that the procedures we have established for

compiling the lists, and for changing them as needs dictate, remain

adequate and fully appropriate to our authorities and responsibilities.

Certainly, I expect NSA to remain as responsive to your

future requirements for information as we have to those of the past.

Also, as in the past, we at NSA will lack the wherewithall for veri-

fying the appropriateness of the Watch List entries, "and we will

continue to rely upon you, as the requesting agency, for that assur-

ance. However, the requirement for us to perform the NSA mission

in ways that remain unquestionably within the framework of our

existing authorities has never been more clearly evident. I am clea

confident that current procedures are designed to insure that we do

so; however, I ask your help in my efforts to make double cartain

that in the process of our providing you Watch List information 62 - 1377-

acquired during the performance of our foreigErintelligence missionT o :113

we do not - even inadvertently - exceed the letter or spirit of any
