Re Chicago airtel to Bureau, dated 7/28/64; Chicago

teletype to Bureau, dated 8/3/64.

On 8/4/64, MI 623-C-TE advised that on 8/1/64

at a wedding reception

In Milwaukee FRANK PETER BALISTRIERI

said that the ICN meeting of 8/2/64 had been called off

because of 1llness of one of the big wheels, but It would be

rescheduled in October at the same place.

Informant said he did not realize the importance

of furnishing this information immediately, as 1t dealt with

a cancellation rather than a positive occurence.

This may

well be, In view of the fact that Informant was at no time

given reason to believe that the 8/2/64 meeting would be

dovered by surveillance, and emphasis has always been placed fate

on security of our Investigations and techniques.
