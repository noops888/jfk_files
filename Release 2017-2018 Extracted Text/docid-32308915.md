BRUNO's apparent instructions from TRAINA, who the Bureau

nows was arrested in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1928, for attending

* Mafia meeting, was to the effect that he could continue

with his plans

to induct new members but not to induct the

members behind the back of JOSEPH RUGNETTA: and that the .

induction ceremony should be amicable.

DeveLopments up to 3/1/69 had established that
