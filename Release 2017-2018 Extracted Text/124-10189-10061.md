TRAINING OF NEGROES IN CUBA

This Bureau is in receipt of a copy of a Central

Intolligenca Agency (CIA) communication dated October 31,

1967, regarding the training of Negroes in Cuba.

of the communication was addressed to the Honorable Walt W.

Rostor, Special Assistant to the President. (8) (Al

Information is contained therein to the effect that

three Cuban sources during the past four nonths have reported

the existence of a training school near Santiago de Cuba where

from 100 to 150 young men are being groomed for subversive

onerations against the United States to include sabotage in

connection with race riots directed at bringing about a Negro

revolution in this country.

One source reported that

training includes courses

in English, taught by Soviet

instructors.

While two of the CIA sources described the

students as

Negroes, there was no indication that any of the

Negro students were

from the United States.

The third CIA

source described

young men from North Vietnam

North Korsa, Alrica, and Latin-Amer tran countries (syU)

Information in the possession of this Bureau indicates

that the above-described training school may well be an outgrowth

of the Tri-Continental Conference, held in Havana, Cuba, in

January, 1966, the declared purpose of which was

organizing

guerrilla warfare in Asia, Africa and Latin America. During the

year

following the conference this Bureau received continuing

reports that the Cubans were endeavoring to implement the aims

of the conference.

Since Castro first came to power in Cuba

in 1959, we have been alert to his possible use of refugee

channels to infiltrate agents and saboteurs and have initiated

appropriate investigative steps to detect this.

In January, 1967,

an additional program was instituted aimed at detecting Cuban-

trained agents and saboteurs entering the United States through

¡egitimate Cuban refugee channels. Such refugees have been arriving

in Miami since Decemoer, 1965, at

the rate of approximately

1,000 each month. Min the ten months since our Cuban refugee

program was first

instituted, over 1,700 cases have been opened

based upon informazion in the backgrounds of various refugees

pointing toward a potential or propensity on their parts to

undertake intelligence, sabotage, or other subversive missions

on behalf of the Caban Government.

Currently

these cases are

being opened al a rate of about 200 a month.*)M)

TRAINING OF NEGROES IN CUBA

During

late July and early August, 1967, a Latin-

American Solidarity Organization (LASO) conference was held

in

Havana, at which the Cubans indicated that they

were continuing

their efforts to implement the declared aims of the Tri

Continental Conference.

Numerous resolutions were promulgated

at the conclusion of the LASO conference, one of which exhorted

North American Negroes 'to respond to the

racist violence of

the imperialist United States Government with an increase in

direct revolutionary action."

The Anerican press and other news

media extensively reported on the presence of Stokely Carmichael,

foremost "black power" advocate of violence, in Cuba at the time

of the LASO conference, which began on July 31, 1967.

that date all field offices of the FBI have been alerted to

Castro's obvious intention of infiltrating agents into this

country for the purposes of sabotage and influencing the black

nationalists and other subversive movements throughout the

United States.

Our Agents on a selective basis have briefed officials

of various local, county and state police agencies of the

problem posed by

the possible lse of minority groups in carrying

out sabotage on bohalf of Cuba.

These officials have been

requested to alert their racial and security informants to

provide any clues which would aid the ferreting out of potential

saboteurs.

In daily contacts with cooperative security

officials of plants handling key Government contracts, department

stores, supermarkets, and similar establishments employing

sizeable labor forces, our Agents have alerted such officials

to our interest in being expeditiously advised of data indicating

groups or individuals within their organizations are potential

tools for use by Castro in subverting the United States.

To date, no concrete evidence has been developed to

indicate that any Cuban-trained saboteur has entered this

country since the widely publicized Cuban sabotage ring in

New York City was discovered and immobilized in 1962. Neither

has any evidence been developed of clandestine entry of Cuban-

trained Negroes for any other purposes, including infiltration

of the black nationalist movement.

On June 2, 1965, Victor Domindador Espinosa

City Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Espinosa advised as follows:

On May 29, 1965, he returned to New Xorl City after

spending twenty-six days in Paris, France, where he was in

contact with individuals involved in a plot to assassinate

Fidel Castro and other Cuban Government leaders.

The main

Fidel Castro. Cubela is identical with former Major Rolando
