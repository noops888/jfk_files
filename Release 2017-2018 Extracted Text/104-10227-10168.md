do Support of this type of bulletin le the province of

Catholic groups duoh as NChC (which has the No News Agency and reacher

hurch papers and the relialous orders such as the Jeauita.

There are altogether too many "bulleting" at present.

Every group has one and they

effective information-news type bulletin with up to date truth on
