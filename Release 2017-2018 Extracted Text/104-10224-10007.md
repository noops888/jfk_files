1. I have been some time getting around to expressing my

appreciation to you and through you to the other officery who

participated in the Senior Seminar. Maybe it is just as well

becausc, as you probably are aware, a number of the findings

of the Senior Seminar have been,

in one form or another, acted

upon. In some of the cases, action that was already underway

was accelerated. In othere, the Seminar produced useful insights

on thc basis of which action was taken.

2. I know that it was a considerable labor for you but I

would like you to be aware of the fact that I and the other officers

in the Clandestine Service involved in the matters dealt with by the

Seminar have been helped greatly by its several findings.

3. It la probable that we will want to do another running of

the Seminar later this year.

If so, I know that we will benefit from

ine excellent pilot run which you conducted.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Africa Division

SUBJECT:

Recommendation for Prosotion - Newton Scott Miler

Miler was assigne

to tho Africa Division on 9 July 1961 and assumed his present

position of Chief of Station,

_, in September 1961.

He has been in grade since 24 March 1957.

In accepting his

progent assignment Miler assumed responsibility for a very com-

plicated operational program requiring considerable reorientation

and modification.

In a short time he has been able to give

purpose and direction to operations which previously had been

the subjcet of considerable controversy within DD/P,

worthy of note that Miler has accomplished this with an almost

entirely new team,

few of whom had any previous expertence in

Africun operations.

Under normal circumstances,

the Supervisor would be

Inclined to delay a promotion recommendation pending further

opportunity to observe first hand the performance of the

Individual.

It is felt that Miler is a justifiable exception

to this rule.

Prior to his assignment to the Africa Division,

Miler had been recommended for promotion by his former Supervisor

who is

presently Deputy Chiof, CI-CF Staff.

apparently felt so sticugly about Miler's performance that he

had suggested that Miler be the one man on the CICE staff who

should be given a jump promotion to supergrade.

If necossary a

memorandum supporting the remarks made can be obtained.

In addition to the above,

the Supervisor has been

assoulated with Miler in a professional relationship since 1940e

The only kap in continuity was from the perlod 1956 to 1959.

1s folt,

therefore, that

the Supervisor's evaluation of Miler's

knowledge, ability, experience,

potential bears weight.

SUBJECT:

Recommendation for Promotion of

Newton scott Miler

lo It is recommended that Mr. Miler be promoted to Grade 15.

2. During the two years that he has been an officer of the

Operations Group of the Cl Staff Mr. Miler has demonstrated an

exceptional ability to interpret counterintolligence experience and

practice in guiding opcrations in this area throughout the divisions

of the DD/P. He has applied field experience gained in one area,

combined with expertly informed Headquarters knowledge, to

intricate and sensitive problems affecting U. S. security in a

variety of geographic areas from the Far East to the Western

Hemisphere and Europe with outstanding skill and sureness of

judgment.

He is aggressive, devotes long hours uncomplainingly

to his tasks, and willingly contributes his guidance in officers of

less experience. In peroonal relationships throughout the

Clandestine Services he is admired, respected, and well-liked.

His recommendations are eagerly sought and contribute in major

fashion to increased criectiveness in carrying out the ll mission,

It is again strongly recommended that he be promoted to GS-15.

Newton Scott MILER

(1 April 190! - 31 March 1970)

)4.1)

1. During the current rating period Mr. MILER was transferred

• from his previous position as Deputy Chiet of the Special Intelligence

Group of the Counter Intelligence Staff to the position of Chief of the

Operations Group of the same Staff. This was a new position and as such

required unusual skills and vigor to give dimension to the job to be done.

Mr. MILER approached his tisk with imagination and energy. He inherited

an incohegive group of capable dificers and immediately began the task of

trying to define common denominators for their operational activities, to

weed out duplicatory and marginal tasks, to establish clearly delineated

guidelines and to provide a sense of discipline, all aimed toward giving

better counterintelligence guidance and support to the operations of the

arca divisiona and the operational components of the CA Staff.

2.. At the same time Mr. MILER has continued to handle, under

the direct guidance of the Chief, Counter Intelligence Staff, a number of

extremely sensitive cases to which he has contributed analytically and

developmentally.

The cases required not only keen operational sense in

their handling, but a strong feeling for liaison as many of the cases involved

frequent high-level discussion and negotiation with other components ut

CIA as well as with outside agencies and departments.

In fulfilling these.

responsibilities, Mr. MILER has worked without regard to hours or to his

personal convenience.. He has assiduously tried to reflect the thinking of

the Chief of the Cl Staff and to relate it to the operational problems he is.!

handling. He has also given mature, insightiul supervision and encouragé-

nient to the orientation and development of a Deputy Chief, Operations,

another important innovation in the Staff's organization.

As a member of the Program Review Panel Mr. MILER con-

tributed fully in examining, reviewing and commenting on the programs

of the operating components within the Clandestine Service, He, Bogether

with other members of the Panel have striven to dovise a formula to

give management i clear, concise picture of what we intend to do and

what we are doing and have done to make those intentiong reality.

0:5

5. While being able to adjust his own thinking when and as

required by a given situation, Mr. MILER has strong personal con-

victions on operational matters and does not hesitate to advance his

opinions or to push for his recommended solutions.

6. Mr. MILER is currently directing an office which includey

in its complement one GS-16 and El GS-15s. He is also responsible

for the career development of talk more junior case officers. The

above is in addition to the normal suporvision of the remaining group

staff. In performing these functions, he is cost-conscious and ccono-

mizes in the expenditure of government funds and the valuable time of

senior officers.

7. Mr. MILER would be the first to admit that many problems

remain for him in his current assignment.

He would also readily ack-

nowledge that he has not yet been able to clearly define each of these

problems or to provide the perfect solution for every one which has

been isolated. Progress, however, is being made every day and Mr.

MILER clearly demonstrates that his promotion to GS: 16 in 1967 was

deserved and that it will not be the last which he will merit. This is

an officer of high professional integrity and dedication. He is a self-

starter, he works and thinks realistically,

He speaks his mind when

he has something to say - including critical things, yet entains a good

sense for the craftsman's side of the Cl job. He is not adept just at

identifying problems, he finds the solution.
