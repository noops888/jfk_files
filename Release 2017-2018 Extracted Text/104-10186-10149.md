Apparently during 1962, there had been considerable sentiment

for Anibal ESCALANTE and his faction, the Parrido Socialista

Popular (PSP), but In 1964 thr PSP group was disrupted and

the raal loyalty was to Fidl CASTRO rather than to the Party.

ESCALANTE, while he remained in Cuba, was apparently the

lintson officer

between the DGl. and the PSP.

When ESCALANTE

left Cuba,

the llatson botween the DOI and the PSP was

taken over by Ramiro VALDES,

as a. CP member,

and he was

described as a true representative.

The DGI operated

strictly on orders from the Party, conveyed through VALDES.

Membership In the Partido Unido Revolucionaria Socialista

(PURS) made life caster and eniry into the GI more simple.

Between August 1963 and April 1961, all new personnel hired

by the DGI came from the Union de Jovenes Comunistas (Unton

of Young Communists - UJC), which was PURS-ortented.
