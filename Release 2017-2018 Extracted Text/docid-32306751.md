OLA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

MM 1231-C-TE advised on 4/3/68 that the

MIKE CONSOLO hit (killed in Brooklyn 4/1/68) was a

contract ordered by JOE BONANNO. CONSOLO was another

defector from

the BONANNO family. The killings carried

out under the direction of BONANNO are being performed

by members of BONANNO's "execution squad" previously

described by the informant. At least one of the hit men

is from Denver.

Informant states that MIKE SABELLA (formerly

with BONANNO, now with the LUCHESE - GAMBINO group) is

extremely nervous and feels he is the next to go.
