Ars

When

the Central Intelligence Agency forwarded

to the Warren Commission a copy of Duran's signed state-

ment. It read as follows:

i. she remembered... (that Lee Harvey Oswald)

was the name of

an American who had come

to the Cuban Consulate

to obtain a visa to

travel to Cuba in transit to Russia, the

latter part of September or the early part of

October of this year, and in support of his

application had shown his passport,

in which

it was noted that he had lived

in that country

for a period of three years; h's labor card

from the same country written in the Russian

language;

and letters in that same language.

He had

presented

evidence that he was married

to a Russian

woman, and also that he was ap-

parently the leader of an organization in the

city

of New Orleans called "Fair ***(Play) for

Cuba," claiming that he should be accepted as

a

"friend" of the Cuban Revolution.

According-

ly, the declarant, complying with her duties,

took down all of the information and completed

the appropriate application form;

and the

declarant,

admittedly exceeding her

responsi-

bilities,

informally telephoned

the Russian

con-

sulate, with the intention

of doing

what she

could to facilitate issuance of the

Russia visa

to Lee Harvey Oswald.

However,

they

told her

that there would be a delay of

about four months

in processing

the case, which annoyed the appli-

cant since,

according

to his statement, he was

in a great hurry to obtain visas that would

enable him to travel to Russia, insisting on

his right to do so in view of his background

and his loyalty and his activities in behalf

of

the Cuban movement.

The declarant was unable

to recall accurately whether or not the appli-

cant told her he was

a member of

the Communist

Party, but he did

say that his wife***was

then

in New York City, and would follow him, ***

(Senora Duran stated) that when Oswald under-

stood that it was not possible to give him a

Cuban visa without his first having obtained

the Russian visa, ***he became very excited or

Charles Thomas' kirst Meeting with Elena Garro Where

Lee Harvey Oswald is Discussed,

on 12/10/65, Charles Thojas, a political officer

at the American Embassy, wrote a memorandum about a con-

versation with Elena Garro de Paz. (81A #586 587, WX-7241

Entry N0. 425-p-91--674 10. 198.) The meeting with

Elena had been about other matters but she mentioned

knowing Oswald.

Thomas noted that she was reluctant

8581

to talk but did. (bide)

Elena's story reported here is the same as that

given in the

_memo dated 10/5/64, but with

more details.

She said that General Jose Jesus Clark

Eusebio Azcue, la pro-Communist writer-friend of the

Durans), and a Latin American Negro man with red hair

(unidentified) were at the party. A marginal comment

by this entry in WX-7241 says, "How did Elena know

about a red-haired Negro?" Elena also told Thomas

that she had later learned that Silvia Duran had been

861

Oswald's mistress while he was there."

of Elena Garro's Allegations

The House Select Committee on Assassinations in-

vestigated Elena Garro's story both through file reviews

and personal interviews. The Committee requested and

reviewed the CIA's, FBI's and State Department's files,

Paz, Manuel Calvillo, Noe W. Palomares, June Cobb Sharp,

Victor Rico Galan, Eunice Odio, Sylvia Duran, Lydia

Duran, Ruben Duran, Betty Serratos, Horatio Duran, Eusebio

Azcue, and Emilio Carballido. Only the Elena Garro de

Paz file contained information on her allegations. Though

all the names listed above played a role in Elena Garro

de Paz' story, not one of their files included a refer-

ence, to Elena Garro de Paz.
