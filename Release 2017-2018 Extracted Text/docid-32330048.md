ROLANDO ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS

NEUTRALITY MATTERS

211012-24

Reference is made to your memoranda of October 7 and 10, 21622-11

1960, with enclosures, in which you requested to be advised whether

the information developed to date indicates a violation of the

neutrality statutes within the jurisdiction of the Bureau and war-

rants further investigation.

We are of the view that the facts surrounding the invasion

force which landed in eastern Cuba in 'early October 1960, indicate

a possible violation of the neutrality statutes.

You pointed out

in your memorandum of October 10, 1960, that Masferrer stated that

his boat, which participated in the movement of members of the

expeditionary force from the United States to islands in the Bahamas,

will continue to make such trips.

Accordingly, it is requested that further investigation be

conducted concerning this matter.

In this connection, it appears

desirable to reinterview William Otis Fuller with respect to the

information set out in your memorandum of October 10, 1960, to the

Department of State.. Specifically, we are desirous of ascertaining

the basis of Fuller's statements concerning the invasion force which

'left Miami on about September 26, 1960.

We are particularly in-

terested in acquiring any information in his possession concerning

his statement that Masferrer was active in the organization of this

invasion.

Furthermore, it appears desirable to reinterview Paul Joseph

Hughes and Frank Joseph Williams, Who are also mentioned in your

memorandum of October 10, 1960, to the Department of State and were

actual participants in the invasion,

concerning the following

(1) Whether the members of the invasion force were

organized in the United States with knowledge

that they were to embark on a military expedi-

tion against Cuba on September 26, 1960

Whether they knew if any arms or military

in Miami.

pation in the organization of the

investigation as you may in the circumstances deem appropriate.
