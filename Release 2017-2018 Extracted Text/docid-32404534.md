there are some very specific damage issues that I wish to

Original Text of John F. Pereira

Following is in response to questions raised by the EXDIR:

1. Members of JFK Board:

Chairman: Judge John Tunheim (Federal District Court, Minnesota)

Four other members: Henry Graff; History Professor Emeritus, Columbia U.

Kermit Hall; Dean of Humanities, Ohio State

William Joyce; Assoc. Librarian, Princeton U.

Anna Nelson; History Professor, American U.

2. Intermediate steps before appeal to President:

a) We are discussing our concerns with JFK Board Staff, and will ask the Board to

reconsider its decision.

b) We'll propose that a senior Agency officer brief the Board on the sensitivity of

Warrenton.

3. Who would make the appeal to the President?

Thus far, the process calls for the Agency's General Counsel to forward the appeal

to the White House Counsel, with the approval of the EXDIR and/or DCI.

4. Has there been an appeal to the President before ?

CIA has submitted one appeal, in early 1996. The issues concerned identification of

certain European stations and liaison relationships. The White House directed the

Board and the Agency to "work it out", which was done. After the ADDO briefed the

Board, a compromise was reached.

The FBI has submitted three appeals, none of which was successful.

5. Does ISCAP have a role?

Thus far, ISCAP has had no role with regard to JFK, as far as we are aware.
