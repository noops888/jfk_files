NOTE:

Dr. Rey is being brought to U.s. undererrangements

made by CiA.

Our files indicate Mr.!

and Colonel

Caldwell King of ClA are probably those uno jacilitated nis

visit.

In view of obvious purpose of trip, it is believed

e should find out from CIA what is goina on. y I'here ar

ncreasing indications of conferences with influential cuba

leaders who oppose Castro, particularly by state Department,

and since we are not being apprised of any U.S. moves to back

the Castro opposition, it is believed we should inquire

promptly where there are indications of official or semi-

official encouragement.

It is not believed we should

investigate Dr. Rey while he is here. Miami Office has been

in contact with Benitez and Faget, who are to be contacted by

Â«ekira Miami to interview Beniten ana laget

and who have professed to be cooperative.

We are not

until after

Dr. Rey's departure.

This will afford some idea of whether

they will come to us voluntarily and give us a straight story

on opposition planning. Data received from Mexico is CIA

data which has been given to state and Bureau making no su

further dissemination.

Bureau data mentioned herein was

furnished to State by letter 2110/54 Lelassified secret

since it possibly concerns CIA covert operation l) (u)
