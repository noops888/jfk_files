quoted:

"(3) It is indicated that Irwin Fruchtman advised Sternman

on two different occasions that he had been

"out west."

Normally we

would interpret this to mean a visit to the Western US, however we:

also' understand that in the Chicago underworld, the expression

"out

west" means a visit to the home of Sam Giancana in the Chicago suburbs.

It may well be wild speculation that Fruchtman would be visiting and

receiving orders from Giancana, but we do know that Murray Humphries

met Sternman et al in Montreal, and that Humphries is closely associated

with Giancana. Perhaps we should not overlook the possibility: that thes

Embassy Steel operation may be part of the overal plans of Glancana
