WAS A TRUE STATEMENT IN THAT COMMANDOS OF MIRR WERE RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE MINING: HE DENIED HE HAD GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS FOR

COMMISSION OF THE MINING OR THAT HE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO

• BE COMMITTED. HE CLAIMED. HIS COMMANDOS ARE CONSTANTLY

• FIGHTING AGAINST CASTRO AND COMMUNISM THROUGH OUT THE

CARIBBEAN AND WHERE EVER OPPORTUNITIES ARE PRESENTED. BOSCH

CLAIMED HE FIRST RECEIVED NOTICE OF THE MINING BETWEEN

9 AND 11 PM, OCTOBER 11 LAST BY MEANS OF A COMMUNICATION

WHICH HE DECLINED TO IDENTIFY, AND THIS ACCOUNTED FOR

HIS BELATED PRESS BELEASE• HE DECLINED TO NAME ANY OF THE

INDIVIDUALS RESPONSIBLE OR TO FURNISH OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION.

HE DENIED THAT THIS WAS A FALSE PRESS RELEASE WHICH MIGHT

SERVE TO RAISE MONEY FOR THE MIRR AS A RESULT OF PUBLICITY.
