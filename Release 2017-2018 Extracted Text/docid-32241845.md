RE :

Secret Service cases established in 1963 involving assassinations

In reviewing the 413 computer print outs on Protective Research

cases set up during the time period between March and December, 1963,

it became evident that the Secret Service paid some attention to

foreign assassinations.

Case #401 on Thelma Estella King was refer-

red to the Service by the CIA on 3/8/63. Ms. King was alleged to be

involved in an assassination plot against JFK and the President of

Panama during a meeting in that country. She was reportedly involved

in the assassination of former President Ramon of Panama and in a

plot to overthrow the government of Panama under President Robles.

Case #407

pertains to Chy Song, a military bodyguard to the Laotian

foreign minister in 1963. On 4/1/64, Song assassinated Quinim

Pholsena with 18 shots from his machine gun. Apparently the assas-

sination was well planned

as the other bodyguards did not react to

the firing.

The assassin's fate was listed as unknown. Case #409

involves Mohamed Khalifa, who on 4/11/63 mortally wounded his long

time friend, foreign minister of Algeria, by shooting him in the

The chauffer captured the subject but his final disposition

was given as unknown.

The above three cases show definite Secret Service interest in

foreign affairs.

However, it is questionable as to why the Diem

brothers' assassination was not given a case number.

files showed no mention, whatsoever, of the assassination occurring

in Viet Nam prior to the planned Chicago trip of Kennedy on November

2, 1963.
