LEE OSHALD IN RUSSIA

(e) On 23 February 1964, as SUBJECT approached the table for

the evening meal, he noted that the Time magazine Iving on the coffee

table in the living room had a picture of Marie OSWALD. As he sat

down he hit the table ith his fist and said, "I feel that I could

have stopped OSWALD". At this point Special

Agent Stanley C. LACH

asked him "how?"

He proceeded to state that he (SUBJECT) was head

of the KCB Tourist and Visitors Section which kept control over the

activities of OSWALD while he vas in the Soviet Union. He caid at

the time, OSAID tas of no special concern or Interest to the KGB

recause he lacked intelligence background. Therefore, then he applied

for permission to leave fussia, they (KCB) under his (SUBJECT) direction

informed OSWALD that he vould have to make his application through the

appropriate channels of the Stete Department, who in "urn would request

his relcase from the Russian counterparts in handling of visas This.

he said was all done for propaganda and show purposes. He went on to

state that if they really wanted to release OSTALD, it could have been

at operatio

done on the spur of the moment, but since OSWALD had nothing and was

not vorch anyhing, they decided that this was an opportunity to show

the American State Depariment that they did not mind releasing individ

uals if they applied for release through the appropriate channels.

Prior to this application for release of oslAnd, the subJect stated

that since he was of no particular intercat to them and there was

nothing in roscow that they could use him for or place him into, they

decided that they would send OSWALD to Minsk where he rould be placed

in a factory working on radios in the hope that some training in the

electrical and electronic field might result in his development into

an electronies enginees; horever, he showed no capability in this field.

The SUBJECI then siated that it mas just at this period, before sending

OSWALD to ilinsk, that a very strange thing happened..

OSWALD was supposed to have a meeting with a travel agent in regard

to preparaiions for his going to Minsk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

At 6 o'clock he still did not report to the travel agent, so the travel

agent decided to so to the hotel where OSWALD was staying to see if he

could locate him.

When he goù to the hotel he asked the clerk if OSWALD

proceeded to OSWALD's room. He tried the door, but the door was lored.

He knocked, got no response, and then wiüh the assistance of the cle i

they broke

Into the room and found OSWALD lying across the bed with both

of his trists slashed. The travel agent and the clerk responded Immediately

by taking OSHALD to the near-by medical facility where he was given blood

transfusions and aîter a period of time regained his strengüh.

During the

Investigation the following day the SUBJECT stated thai the doctor Indicated

that had OSVAID not been Lound for approximately ten more minutes, he would

have been dead. It is here that the SUBJECT again pounded the table and

said if the travel agent had not broken Into the room, but had instead

contacted the KGB office Ilke they are instructed to when they do not

get any response from poople with whom they have appointrents, that he

(SUBJECT would have most likely directed the travel agent to forget

about him, and on the following day or later that evening he would have

sent one of the KGB agents to check on OSWALD, et which time he woula

have been found dead.

This, he went on to state, is what nuris him

when he realizes that he could have been instrumental in disposing of

OSMAID ithout any special inquiry or serious investigation, OSMAID

being nothing, and at the same time today the President of the United

States, Presiient KENnY, would be alive. The SUBJECT then tent on

to state that after OSWALD was sent to Minsk it was there that he met

Like hinself (OSVALD), Marie was a girl fron a peasant family

with no special background and somewhat illiterate. It was because

of her poor background that she was given permission to mariy OSWALD

and return to the United States as his wife.

The SUBJECT then went on to describe what took place on the day

that Prosident ITNEDY vas assassinated. He said that this vas actually

on saturday in Moscow, the 22nd of November. He was home at the time

and nappened to have the radio on, when he heard that the President of

the United States had been assassinated. Approximately one hour later,

the radio informed him that the assassin was Lee OSWALD. This announcement,

he said, really stunned hin.

He grabbed his coat and dashed to his office.

Imnediately upon his arrival he searched for the OSMALD file.

When he

Lound the file he reviered it and found that OSWALD had not been used

or even approached for use by the Russian Intolligence. He put in a

long distance call to the Chief of the KGB Section in Minsk and inquired

gence activity. The Chief informed him that according to what he could

recall, they had not made any use of OSVALD. Just about this time, he

(SUBJECT) stated that his superior walked into the office and directed

the SUBjEcT to get all the Information avallable on OSHALl and prepare

a sunmary to be furnished the top officials of the Cormunist Farty.

a surmary of his file on OSWALD and Inforned him that within trenty

minutes a KGB agent would arrive by special military plane to pick

up the surmary for return to Moscou.

Party unill he was 27 years old, end he did this out of respect to his

lather, who at the time vas on his death bed and asked him (SUBJECT)

whether he would do him one more favor before he died.. That Is how. i

would not have been a member

to this day.

DIPTOMATS AND INTELLIGENCE TYPES

(5)

The SUBJECT stated that the KGB are able to differentiate

between Anericans who are assigned to Moscow and are actually the

State Department type, from those who have an intelligence background,

by the foct that the Intelligence type of people do not associate with

the Russian girls, that is they will not go out with them alone, whereas

the State Department type will.

Also, over a period of a month or two,

they invariably are able to find evidence that the Intelligence types

have been nasturbating.

This 1s usually detected through close exam-

ination of the individual's tovels and bed sheeis.

RUSSIAN U-1 AIRCRAEL

(h) On 25 Febzuary 1904 during the evening meal, a discussion was

had regarding the recent alrplane crashes noted in the newspapers and on

and study, and also from the SUBJECT's grandfather, who was one of the

first shipbuilders in fussia. The SUBJECT added that his grandfather

ras about the last time he saw his mother and brother and sister, as

they all went to this ceremony in honor of his father.

He also

Indicated that there was a periodical which gave a complete run-dow

on his family background, including that of his grandfather and his

father, and it vas well publicized; and this he believes had a lot

to do with his being able to get some special preference and move

along as fast as he did in the KGB organization..

KGB PRESSURE ON FAMILY

(3) On 27 February 1961 during lunch, the SUBJICT stated that he

has been informed that the KGB is putting pressure on his immediate

family, particularly his mother. However, he said he was not overly

worried about her because she is well-off financially, and being up

In age there is not much they can do to her.

However, what concers

him most Is the fact that they have already started to play on the

sympathies of his two children and his wife.

The SUBJECT stated that

he was anticipating this; however,

he did not think that they would

start so soon to pressure the fanily. However, he does have some hope

that in due time he may be able to get his family, out of Russia. This

hope' he said was given to him by the Chier of SR Division.

LIBRARY OF CONGRESS PENETRATION

and thereby get an idea as to what the militacy was planning in the

way of armaments and things of that nature.

The SUBJECT also advised

that the responsibility for getting Information surreptitiously fron

American Embassies In foreign countries who employ Indigenous personnei,

falls within the confines of the KGB.

He stated that the way they go

about this is to work through the indigenous personnel and arrange to

enter the embassy at special times during the night. They would first

make a close survey and a photograph of the area in which the embassy

keeps Its classified material, then they would subsequently enter this

area and open up the safes. When he was asked how this was done he

stated, "oh, combinations to safes are not hard to acquire". He said

that the important and difficult part of this activity is taking the

material out and photographing it and then placing it exactly as it

was before they touched it.
