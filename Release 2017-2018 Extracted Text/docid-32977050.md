MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT:

Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on

Operation MONGOOSE, 14 September 1962

PRESENT:

Mr. Bundy; the Attorney General; Mr. Johnson; Mr. Nitze,

General Lemnitzer, General Lansdale; General Carter;

Mr. Donald Wilson

The Group approved in principle General Lansdale's paper

of 31 August, with the amendments that had been agreed upon at last

week's meeting and which were attached to General Lansdale's memo-

randum of 12 September. However, Mr. Bundy made it clear that this

did not constitute blanket approval of every item in the paper and

that sensitive ones such as sabotage, for example, will have to be

presented

in more detail on a case by case basis.

General Lansdale noted that he has asked appropriate people

in the Pentagon to draw up estimates covering requirements for person-

nel, space, communications, etc., against the contingency that Cuban

operations

will move into a more active phase and will require such

facilities.

Mr. Bundy expressed his concern about the necessity for

linking planning in the political and military fields with the MONGOOSE

operations. He said that his tentative conclusion is that what is

required is a tightly knit interagency group closely tied to the

MONGOOSE group but not a part of it. He said he would discuss this

concept with higher authority.
