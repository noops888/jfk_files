Dear Mr. Hoover:

(5FK) 2/9/98 412798

We have completed our review of domestic positive intelligence

collection engendered by your letter of ll Maich 1970.

We warmly

welcome periodic Icexamination by our two agencies of the implemen..

tation o1 ine isóo agreemen dui de cuiicuine ui pusiciro incomigence

I concur also with your comments that there is

a need foi close coordination of our efforts in the field of positive and

counterintelligence coliection. To be most effective, I agree that it

is essential for this Agency, together with your Bureau, to conduct a

continuing analysis of clandestine collection activity.

The product is

of growing importance to the national security and to the United States

Intelligence Community.

Therefore we endorse your proposal for a

reexamination and bespeak your desires as to how this might be

conducted.

With regard to the 1966 set of ground rules, which you sent to

the then Director, Vice Admiral Willian E. Raborn, JI., the compe-

"tent work of our respective representatives did, in fact, produce an

effective and realistic agreement.

I welcoine your statement that no

major problems have been encountered since its adoption.

I feel strongly that there are other related subjects, of similar

importance to the national security, which warrant periodic reexamina-

•tion since they have a direct bearing on domestic clandestine collestion

of positive intelligence.

As a result of our review, engendered by your letter, I believe

that the following subjects are deserving of your personal considevation:

"(1)" Audio cóveräge. Audio coverage provides timely

intelligence of inestimable worth to U.S. officials for

policy planning, early warning, and accurate guidance

necessary for the improvement of operational and collec-

tion activity here and abroad.

Audio coverage is unique

production because it is readily subject to local cross-

checking and evaluation which is far more difficult and

costly to achieve abroad.

Further, such coverage is on

targets which affect directly the national interests.

- 49.

For several years your Bureau had been recep-

tive to requirements and leads which resulted in valuable

coverage.

The quality of your production proved that

jour Burcar alono possesses capabilitico and cxporionce

which cannot be duplicated by any other U.S. agency.

On 2 October 1969 two related requests for audio

coverage were submitted by this Agency pertaining to

positive intelligence targets, one of whom had KGB connec-

tions.

(I refer to the case of em

1) Your Bureau replied that henceforth the

Agency should refer all such cases directly to the Attorney

General for approval.

It is suggested that the question of audio coverage

beireopened between representatives of your Bureau and

this Agency. I would welcome your thoughts and observa-

tions on this subject.

I wish to assure you that I believe that this sensitive

type of collection should be implemented under rigid and

stringent controls.

This is absolutely necessary in order to

maintain the highest standard of security both in instituting

the coverage and for the exploitation of the product. (An

excellent example of this is demonstrated in your effective

and secure production of SCOPE. ) 6)

+ a.

(2) Mail Coverage. Another much needed intelli--

gence.toolis.mail coverage.:.Its importance has been

proven in the past.

I have the impression that it has

been discontinued, and I would suggest that our represen

tatives should confer and examine together whether this

assel might be deployed against communications of the

Soviet Block

Wei, ew tell and identified foreign agents.

(3)

CIA Technical Scivices. A significant expendi-

ture of this Agency's money and personnel has been com

mitted to research and development for the improvement

of technical aids.

This Agency has provided your Bureau

with an appreciation of our resources and capabilities, and

has offered you at cost or gratis our most sophisticated

equipment.

Although we will continue these services, we would welcome

SI(S)

any suggestions from your Bureau for improvement in the

technical field including proposals how these assets' can be

better employed.

Your comments will be particularly

appreciated in view of our mutual interests in implementing

lOpcration

(4) Courses in Positive Intelligence Requirements and

Reporting: Since the collection and reporting of positive

foreign intelligence is, as you say, only incidental to your

main internal security and counterintelligence responsibili

ties, I realize that your personnel are somewhat at a dis-

advantage in carrying out the evaluating and reporting

processes necessary for the conduct of positive intelligence.

At our 1966 conference, we offered to institute positive intel-

ligence training courses, including reports writing and

for FBI personnel. In soliciting your views on

the desirability. of this type.of training, I wish to reiterate

our willingness to provide such instruction.

It would be

designed to expose the needs of the Intelligence Community

in depth, thus making the Current Intelligence Reporting

List (GIRL) more meaningful to your personnel.

(5) Seminars on Opposition Services.

Given the"

growing sophistication and increased capabilities of hostile

intelligence services, it is suggested that CLA and FBI

experts in this field meet as required at our respective

Headquarters, the Washington and New York Field Offices,

in order to keep abreast of new developments, modus

operandi, operational tasks, and diverse missions of

opposition services.

I know that you will agree with me

that no opportunities for improvement should be over-

lankod which might holn to negate the efforte of hostile

services who are charged with undermining the security

of the United States.

These sessions should also provide

an opportunity to explore and devise new means to pene-

trate and neutralize these inimical forces.

(6) Live Bloc Sources. The record of our coopera-.

tion and coosdination to exploit live penetrations and defec-

tors from Bloc sources proves the success of our mutual

effort.

I believe that there is room for substantial improve-

ment in achieving a more uniform and efficient exploitation

of the positive intelligence potential of certain of these

sensitive sources.

I would invite your thoughts on how we

may better coordinate requirements for these sources and

establish a more thorough evaluation of their positive

intelligence production before it is given general dissemina-

tion within the Government.

Our review would suggest that

there are good reasons for consultation to explore the

development of higher quality live sources, for example

feel confident that both agencies have adequately exploited

the full potential of this field, and would urge that this

subject be explored by our respective representatives.

(8)

New Left and Racial Matters.

There is already

a substantial exchange of information in this field. Limi-

tations of manpower raise a serious question as to whether

both agencies can keep pace with future unpredictable

developments.

The increasingly close connection between

these forces in the United States and hostile elements

abroad has been well established by both of our agencies.

we can best emplor mure wisely oui linited tanpowci,

Inowing that this problem, which embraces bombings,

hijacking, assassination, and the demeaning of law enforce-

ment officers, is international in scope.

(9) Relations with Domestic Field Offices and Legal

Attaches. I do not feel that there aie any serious conflicts

in this area but there may be room for improving the quality

of liaison in order to expand positive intelligence collection..

Given the changing situations both here and abroad, periodic

re-examination of field relations could assist both agencies

to make mutually-agreed adjustments.

Mr. Hoover, I wish to assure you that I value highly your personal

judgment in affairs bearing on the national security.

I know that your

experience is derived from a unique lifetime of dedicated service to our

country. In this spirit,

I welcome sincerely your observations on the

foregoing agenda and solicit your thoughts regarding any other item

which you deem worthy of the attention of your Bureau and this Agency.

(1) LOCASE (TI: RORIS MORROS CASE)

This vas a sensitive Sovict-espionage case

cations and historically has been, and undcubtedly

will be, one of the most important and involved cases

of Soviet operctions in this country and abroad. We

did not dissominate any intormation of significance

• in this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Linicon agent has become involved in heated argu-

ments with CIA ofricials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding exampic of FBI failure to

cooporato with the Agoncy. The position taken by CIA

was

that it should have boen auvised regardine the

Soviet opcrational activity in forcign countries,

claining that

the Agency rould have had the opportunity

so develon more infornation of significance, identify

Soviet ag

Its, and possibly prepare conditions for

, recrutnert or doubling of Soviet operatives.

We did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

extrene sensiti:ity oi the case. We actually did not

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

Ithe HOCASE until 1957.

ID 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have raceived the information earlier

because nany aspects of the lICCADE portained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greaily handicapped in effectivoly carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the loads were given to the

Agency at the same tine that the case vas publicized.

'The drency argucd that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted tie french, rother than the U. S., to play a

I dominating role in Europe.

indicating that HOUA was interested in obtaining Colonel Frantisex

Allen Dulles allegedly informed

ICUA that Tisler was agrocable to appenring before the Commitice

instructions.

The Director asked whether or not CIA had authority -

to make a defector available to a congrossional committee without

first chocking with other interested agencies.

The Director was

informed that CIA did

not have such authority becnuse a National

Security Council directive made it very clear that this could not

be done without procossing the mattor through the Inter. Agency

In this particular case the aforementioned
