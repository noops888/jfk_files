Re: I. IRVING DAVIDSON

SECREL

NOTE:

In May, 1961, we examined books and records of

Davidson at request of Department, complaint being that

his Supplemental Registration Statement had not been sufficiently

detailed.

Results of examination were furnished Department

in BFO's

151 page report dated 6/14/61.

WFO's memorandun of 2/12/63 revealed subject's

concern about two checks of which Drew Pearson was aware and

which subject claimed he knew about approximately & year sgo

according to our Special coverage on Nicaraguan Embassy) e

(S

n his column 2/13/63 Pearson identified checks as $10,000

contribution to President Kennedy's 1960 campaign and $1500

contribution to campaign fund of Representative Daniel J.

Flood (D) Pennsylvania.

According to Pearson, contributions

were made by Nicaraguan President Luis Somoza and his brother,

Anastasio, through Frank Barry, registered agent of Nicaragua.

Subject is a registered agent of Nicaragua and also

of Ecuador and Israeli Military Industries. Although we

have closed our investigation of Davidson and gone on record

with Department, WPO should be aware of current interest in

him and alerted

to necessity for prompt reporting of

pertinent information.
