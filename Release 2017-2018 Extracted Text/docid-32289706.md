With reference to your Los Angeles report

dated I SEPT 67, attached hereto is a copy of the

application

form submitted by Mrs. Gertrude ZAROWITZ dated 28 DIC 59 for

a Canadian Passport No. 4-953559 which was issued on 29 DEC 59.

Also attached is a copy of her application for renewal of the

said passport.

This renewal was issued on 9 MAR 65 and is

valid until 29 DEC 69.

The only method of determining

if Gertrude

LAROWIIZ travelled to Europe during October 65 would be by

a physical examination of her passport as the Passport Office

have no record of her travels.

Assistant Officer in Charge,

Criminal Investigation Branch.
