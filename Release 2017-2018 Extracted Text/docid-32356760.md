Director of Central Intelligence

Clarence M. Kelley, Director

Subject: - OCELOT;

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

This is to advise of pertinent developments in

a double agent operation, assigned the code name

which involves

"Ocelot,"

a meeting

between our asset and Cuban

Intelligence Officers (CIO's) in Mexico on May 19, 1977.

We learned, after debriefing the asset upon his return

from Mexico, that the

format of the meeting had unex-

pectedly involved a videotaped interview of our asset

by Cuban technicians concerning his knowledge and partici-

pation in anti-Castro Cuban exile activities.

The asset developed in this operation first

became of investigative interest to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) in November, 1976, when allegations

received that he was in contact with known CIO's in

Jamaica during October

and November,

Subsequent

investigation, coordinated closely

Intelligence Agency

(CIA) , confirmed an active relation-

ship with Cuban officials

Panama and Mexico.

A successful interview of asset was effected on April 8,

1977, which resulted in establishing a double agent

operation.

At that point, the asset furnished details

of seven previous meetings with CIO's in Jamaica, Panama

and Mexico.

In addition, asset furnished a typewritten

note containing instructions for his next meeting in

Mexico City, on May 19, 1977, which involved a coded

telephone call to the Cuban

Enbassy, Mexico City, to

activate the scheduled meet at a pre-determined

and place. The purpose of this meeting, according to

the asset, was for the passage of additional information

concerning the activities of Cuban exile groups in the

and Latin America, as had been done at

previous

meetings.

Letter to the Director of Central Intelligence

Re:

Ocelot

The asset has advised that he was transported

by automobile from the meet site in Maxico City to a

hotel room equipped with videotape equipment and occu-

pied by two Cuban technicians.

The asset was then asked

questions by CIO's and his responses were recorded on

videotape.

They assured the asset that this tape would

to high Cuban officials,

including Fidel Castro,

and that it would not be made public.

There is, however,

obvious propaganda value in this film which could be

utilized by the Cuban Government.

Asset was specifically

advised by CIO's that Premier Fidel Castro has a forth-

coming television news interviaw with an unnamed U. S.

news commentator, and that they wanted Castro to see this

videotape prior to his interview. (S)

According to the asset, the interview began

with questions regarding his family life in Cua before

the Castro revolution,

after which he was asked to comment

on the former Batista Regime in Cuba.

He was then asked

to nans tha political movements of which he had been a

menber.

ile told the

interviewer that in 1954 he had worked

with Alpha 66, a militant anti-Castro organization head-

quartered in Miami, Florida,

in helping approximately

twenty-eight Cuban

exiles and arms

pass through Puerto Rico

to Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, for use against Cuba

and that all but

four of these Cuban

exiles had returned

to Puerto Rico.

The four who did not return are now in

Cuban jails.

(5)

Asset was also asked about his participation in

an assassination attempt of Fidel Castro in Chile in 1971.

The asset stated that he had participated in the attempt

vith Antonio Veciana, a Cuban exile now residing in liami.

When asked if Veciana had been employed by the CIA, he

replied that he did not know, however,

assuned that he

was, based on the fact that Veciana had used a car with

United States diplomatic license plates to transport the

necessary arms and equipment from Bolivia, where

plan was aborted by other Cuban exile participants at the

last minute.

Asset had previously furnished this infor-

mation to CIO's during other meetings. .

nation attempt directed at Castro in Cuba ne, Veciana,

Asset was also questioned about a 1951 assassi-

in which the

asset participated.

He acknowledged that

and Bernardo Pradreres had at that time tried to kill

Castro with a bazooka.

They waited in an apartment, which

was rented in Havana, Cuba, by Veciana's mother-in-law,

for Castro to appear at the nearby Cuban capitol. Pradreres

had hired two other individuals not known to the

asset to

do the actual firing, but when Castro finally appeared the

bazooka failed to fire due to its deteriorated state from

naving been buried for an extended period of time.

The

cuoan authoritles later discovered the bazooka, which had

been left in the apartment, and vere then able to Identify

all of the participants.

During the initial interview of asset on

April 8, 1977, he made availabla a photograph obtained

from Antonio Veciana, which Veciana claimed to depict

Lee. Harvey Oswald in attendance at an Alpha 65 meeting

in Dallas, Texas, in 1963.

Another photograph depicted

veciana

as 2

speaker at this neeting.

The asset had

made this information available to CIO's at previous

meetings.

In tie last segment of videotaping in Mexico,

the asset was confronted with enlarged photographs of

the alleged Alpha 66 meeting and was askad to point out

the individual similar in description to Oswald, after

which the videotaping was concluded.

The whole taping

process lasted approximately 90 minutes and consumed

almost three reels of videotape. (5)

Photographs nade available by the asset were

exanined by FBI agents familiar with the Oswald investi-

gation and it was determined that lee Harvey Oswald is

not depicted in these photographs.

It is noted that

Letter to tha Director of Central Intelligence

Re: Ocelot

Jack Anderson's colunn in the Washington Post on May 5,

1977, claims that Antonio Veciana has

testified before

the House Assassinations Committee that ho was in con-

tact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas, in August,

1963. (U)

The above asset has furnished other sensitive

intelligence information, including the identities of

previously unknown CIO's, and it is anticipated that he

will be of future value to our foreign counterintelligence

effort.

Any effort by the Cuban Government to exploit

the propaganda value of information obtained from this

recently developed asset over the period of seven pievious

meetings would necessarily cost their intalligence servica

the public identification of several CIO's currently in

Jamaica and Mexico.

You are being made aware of the above

developments since

it is recognized that the Cuban Govern-

ment may elect to publicize this videotape for propaganda

purposes and that such an event could impact upon current

policy decisions. (s)

This information is also being furnished to the

Secretary of State,

the Assistant to the President for

National Security Affairs, and the Attorney General.
