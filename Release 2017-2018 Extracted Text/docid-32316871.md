EFTO

PHONE HIM AS HE AND VICIIM HAVE BEEN CLOSE FRIENDS FOR YEARS.

STATED ROSELLI WAS IN GOOD SPIRITS, APPARENTLY NOT

WORRIED ABOUT ANYTHING AND ROSELLI CALLED JUSI TO SAY "HELLO."

SAID HE COULD GIVE NO EXPLANATION OR REASON FOR ROSELLI'S

MURDER; HE DOUBTED "THE CHICAGO PEOPLE" PUT THE CONTRACT OUT

ON ROSELLI..

CG 9561-CTE ADVISED TODAY AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH SEVERAL

LON BOSSES IN THIS AREA THE MURDER OF ROSELLI SEEMED TO BE OF

LITTLE CONCERN TO THEM. ONE LON MEMBER INDICATED ROSELLI

"HAD IT COMING" AND THAI "HIS TESTIMONY IN SECRECY" HAD ALREADY

CAUSED TROUBLE FOR-A NUMBER OF PEOPLE. FROM WHAT THIS SOURCE

COULD DETERMINE, BOTH THE NEW YORK AND MIAMI "PEOPLE" (LON

MEMBERS) WERE FED UP WITH ROSELLI'S TALKING.

JOEY AIUPPA AND CHARLES NICOLETTI, LON LEADERS IN THE

CHICAGO AREA, WERE LOCATED AND INTERVIEWED. BOTH REFUSED TO

MAKE ANY COMMENT ON THE ROSELLI MATTER. ADDITIONAL INQUIRY

ON SAMMY "C" VERIFIED WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. SAM

CANZONERI APPEARS TO BE ONLY LON CONNECTED "HOOD" USING THIS

NAME. LIEUTENANI FRUIN, INTELLIGENCE UNIT, CHICAGO PD, ADVISED
