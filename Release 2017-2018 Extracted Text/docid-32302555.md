A RELEASE IN PART

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.

I TOTAL DENIAL

It is noted that on 6/29/61 agents of IRS, Pittsburgh, took

part in what the press alleged was a nationwide series of

raids on gamblers.

Local IRS agents concentrated their raids

at about 2:00 PM in the Turtle Creek Valley section of

Allegheny County, about 10 miles East

of Pittsburgh, appre-

hending some 25

small numbers operators.

On 7/6/61, PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

The MANNARINOS knew of the impending raids by IRs agents at

9:30 AM on 6/29/61, several hours before the raids occured.

This information was relayed quickly to all numbers writing

and/or horse bookies who turn in to the MANNARINOS throughout

the New Kensington-Arnold-Vandergrift, Pa., area.

Apparently

the MANNARINOS did not know where the IRS agents

would raid,

merely that raids would come off.

ÃœEK-Law 11(a)

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
