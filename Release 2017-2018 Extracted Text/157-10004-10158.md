down.

lle

says that on the 20th or 21st of December 119001,

the

last time he was in the Embassy talking to rax rail, he (Kail)

told him he was gi

going to the United States and he would come

back and talk

to him

later.

Kail said he was going to Texas

for Christmas.

That's why he always thought Bishop ardxkxi had

told him to go to Kail because he thought he perhaps they were

friends from

Texas.

(Do you think Bishop and Smith were friends also? He doesn't

Know.

Smith was

young person, always well dressed.

He's

prebty sure he was

CIA.

(Smith wasn't this the Ambassador?) Ohu no, he was the political

advisor.

Not Earl Smith, Ewing Smith.

He says he docsn't want anything to come out in the paper, because

he's afraid it would cause a Tot of troutle for his family.

but he would never never do that.

corner from Veciana's house.

The magazine

is owned by Max

Lesnick,

Lesnick was a leader of the Second National Frant

of Escambray and the key link with CIA agental

officially a political attache in the Embassy, Even before

Castro took over.

Also in the Replica office now is Reynaldo

Pico, good friend of Artime's and one of the original

Watergate group.]

Losnick at Replica has urged him to talk to Volsky.

(Is Volsky working for CIA?) Volsky has always denied it.

But he was in Cuba and he was with the Voice of America.

Volsky also now receives money from Replica and AV says

All he remembers volsky ver writing for Replica was an i

ever writing for Replica was an interview

with the president of Portygal.

(Do you have any suspicions that Lesnick is being supported by

the CIA?) No,

one dopicion that son

Lesnick is a hard worker

and good administrator.

1(A)

(Have you ever made any major arms deals?) No. Maybe only 20 to 50

rifles, 40 or 50 pounds of dynamite, $40-50,000 at the most.

(Ever deal with Mitchel & WerBell?)

No. But he said that you're going

to ask him about Masfeerer now. (Why?)

Because there was a lot

of business between Masferrer

and Werbell.

They say that Masferrer

was I killed as a

result of his dealing with Wer√üell. He (AV)

personally thought Masferrer wasn't worth anything.
