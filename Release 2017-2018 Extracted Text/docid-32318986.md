Dear Mr. Marsden:

On 10/26/92, President George Bush signed "The John F.

Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992. "

This Act requires that Government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy be sent to the National

Archives for public release.

It was passed because of the

renewed public interest in the release of all JFK records and it

facilitates the release of information normally exempt from

disclosure under Executive Order and/or the Freedom of

Information Act.

We have enclosed a copy of the Act for your

review.

The FBI has established a task force to process the JFK

assassination records.

The FBI's goal is to maximize release of

information and we propose to seek postponements (i.e. matters

withheld) only where there is compelling justification for doing

5o.

In 1978, we processed all of our JFK records and disclosed

all of the information which you had provided but withheld your

We believe that we should now disclose that name

where it occurs in our assassination files.

This planned release

is limited to the JFK investigation and the documents defined by

the 1992 Act and should not affect any future handling of your

organization's information concerning other subjects.
