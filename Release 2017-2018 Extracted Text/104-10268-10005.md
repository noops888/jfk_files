Q:

A:

Q:

Q:

A:

that was the line of reporting in flA during the period I serve

as working level point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staff'

It was

a multiple leveled things (a) from the Commission and AWD

personally via McCone-to Dick Helms; (b) from Helms to the two or

three components primarily concerned *SE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

LA, then WH; anch aola

"In practice, the substantive SB input worked

up by one of its

photo

for examplay search companehts headed by Lee Wigren-Minsk

et alo-passed via cl.

CI had own defector input.

In addition, on sensitive matters af concern to the inkestigation

Dick Helms and Murphy also dealt directly with the Commission. BRAufler?

Did you hear:

?? [two crypts, one sounded by "Jackenet" ?].

Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

94253

he had charged assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? Mr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

was, in fact, aware of something underwas regarding Castro.

He

ad no evidence to show that I RGRY hadübeen informed about it..

Would that change any of the thinking' re Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

Yes, I said, though I intended to

give moke potentia importance

to Oswald's KGB contacts, and related that I

-and others--though

recognizing the wisdom of the Warren. Commission's handling--had

felt chere had been moneys the sowet aspect that should haye

been

pursued:

a.

Fact that his two

Sovtet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGB and at

i least one both 2 had beer

b. Our defector information strongly insists that all

Western militart defectors like Oswald--were screened by the

13th Department.

c. Thinness of file

turned over by Soviets in view of b.

1 acknowledged In retraspect that Cuban hypothesis was worth recon-

sidering, though it would appear that period of solid inter service

(KGB-UGI) relations began later, (i.e. after 1967-68, Venceremos, etc.).

Q: Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he had

made the Mexican trip unless there was something important to hide

about it?

All his other lies concernedikey factual elements of his

cover story.

Why also did Marina

deny she knew anyching

about the

Mexican trip in her first story d@ the FBE-which she later

rectified

before the Warren Commission? Mr. Belin noted that he had left the

hypothesis of Castro/Cuban vavolvement opem in his book.

He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

anti-Castro plot at the cmejof the Warren Commission investigation.

le felt the least he woubd have done would have been to have insiste

on the polygraphing of Marina Oswald regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

Da 30 April. A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on I May (Attachment A) Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD. A follow-up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/ 1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two.of Attachment D.

exploitation of AMMUG/1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mi. Rankin- AMMUG/1 is such an

Debrieting of AMMUG-1

The Oswald Case

: Bund Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 V

1 Reference is made to a telephone conversation yesterday

with Chief, CI Staff concerning this matter.

" Because l am not aware of the information already

available to the Commission investigating the Cswald Case or

furnished by the Agency, my debrtefing of the Source has been

based on the questions prepared by the CI Staff and on what the

Source answers have suggested. I shall be glad to pursue any

other topics suggested by Cy stalk

The Following information in addition to that in the

reference might be of interest.

a Luisa CALDERON, since she returned to Cuba,

has been paid a regular salary by the DGI even though she has

not performed any services. Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high.

b. Source has known CALDERON for several years.

: Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was known as the #Empresa

Transimport". Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

Luisa CALDERON Wa

transferred directly from her

position in the Ministry of Exterior Commerce to a post in México,

a matter of surprize to the source.

Rogelio RODRIGUEZ LOpez

(DGI pseudo MORCOS),

shortly before he left Cuba for Mexico on or about 16 April 1964,

saw CALDERON.

REFERENCE

Blind Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 v

B.

Blind Memorandum dated 07 May 1964

C. Conversations between Cl Stat and

C/WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by CI Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A.

That memorandum

which I dictated to a Cl Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program, of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I further discussed the Oswald Case

with the Source in order to clarity exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if 1

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DCI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban Government.

1 first heard of OSWALD aiter the assassination of President

Kennedy when new, media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in the DCI first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one day after lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting.. The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Manuel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in the Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence officer of the DGI.

VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the timethat VEGA, w as in Mexico. I gathered

although I do not know that VEGA made any specific

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba. This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DGI.

Such agentsion appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the DGI. ( do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do knownthat agents from El Salvador in

requesting visas always made mention of the name "Mauricio" )

The DCI officers ata, Consulate interview visa applicants to

find out if they areagents. If the visa applicant does not use

one of the indira ed phrases, the DGi officers, instead ol

granting the vist immeciately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days. The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa. I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have

seen OSWALD because he worked with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CALDERON right have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about INMarch 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico. that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico OThe information to which I refer was told

to me by a DG care oricer named Norberto HEHNANDEZ de

Curbelo.

because he gave me $40. 0u to buy some shoes and

- other items during my trip to viexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was receiving a salary from

the DGI although ste apparently did not do any work

for the Service. CHERNANDEZ told me that hers was

a peculiar case and that he himself believed that she

had been recrüited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Krecall, FERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or Something similar. As you know, the pronunciatior

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the mattet, the letter from the American

was a love letter but-ifdicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON. Fa sounderstood from HERNANDEZ that

after the interception of the letter she had been followed

and seen in the company of an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

ol Exterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth. She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, Is Sylvia: DURAN and I know very

little about her.

What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 23 March 964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Habana the sameday. I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogello RODFIGUEZ Lopez and

Ínu BUENAVENTURA of the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named, "Tato", and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

We saw a pretty girl standing at the end al

the reception room, and someone asked who she was, and one

of the group said it was Sylvia DURAN

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DGl orders were issued

for all offias of theOCl, at Headquarters and in the field

to sort and package all documents according to whethe

they were "muy gesreto" (very secret), "secreto" (secret),

or "importante" (important). The material, once packaged

was to be held pending further instructions. All travel by

DGl officers and all DGI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition,

I recall that DGI Headquarters personnel were

instructed either to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGi aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices. As

nearly as I can recall. we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the óf December 1983."

3. In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALD. If the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to fee further clarification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most familiar with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source. This can bevarranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a questian asked in a forthcoming ICFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the Source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Subject - General: Debrieting of Cuban Source

Specific:

OSWANd. Ease

The source does not have afege knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was able to provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia.

The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

1. Prior to October 1963, OSMALl visited the Cuban Embassy

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Belore, during and atter

these visits, OSWALD was in contact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Lursa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Dópez.

VEGA what Cuban intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current CubanIS chefrig Mexico.

He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prior to which he held the sarne post as.

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 196%.

2. The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity or other manner.

3. A. When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

"importante" (important). The material once packaged was to be

held pending further instruêtions. In addition, all travel by DGI

oificers and all DGI pouched were suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that

OSWALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

It is not known if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for 'Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who-is recalled in "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

• in the United Nations in New York, SANTIESTABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli-

gence services is not known.

Nothing is known about Soviet proposals following the news of

President Kennedy's assassination.

9. The only fabrication known is the special matter by Fidel

CASTRO previously mentioned.

10. Nothing is known about Jack RUBENSTEIN aka Jack RUBY•

11. The name Gilberto LOPEZ is not familiar but, if he visited

DGI headquarters, a photograph of him possibly could be identified.

12. OSWALD's photo was seen in the newspapers but nothing is

Knoche:

Assistant to the Direetor

Intelligenge Agency

Washington, DaQy"

Dear Mr. Knoche:

As you know, there have been allegations that the CIA was

involved in

a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro.

purposes of this letter, we will assume that these allegations

are correct, and based upon this assumption I would like to

know the answers to the following questions:

Did anyone with the CIA tell any member of the Warren

or any lawyer serving on the Warren Commission

staff that such plans had been underway?

If the answer is

yes, we would like to know what person or persons with the

Agency delivered said information,

to whom it was delivered,

when it was delivered, what specifically was told or said,

what documents there are to support the answers to the fore

going questions, and what response, if any-was received from

the Warren Commission. If the Commission was not told about

this, why was it not told and who made the decision not to

deliver such information to the Warren Cormission?

There is evidence that Castro, prior to November 22, 1963,

MEMORANDUMSTOR: Man Rocca

"Internet Mame Regarding Agaucy's Pestion in

Dealing

with

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the

Directos has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

MI. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

19940.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues of

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed.

Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

• sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Dire cor's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3. Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

Summary Outline

This brief is concerned yith fixe topics which, it is

anticipated, will arise, in the course of the Director's appear -

ance before the Pr

Ecident's Commission. These are:

a. Formal an@unqualified negation by the DCI

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

Harvey Oswald. This should be accompanied by

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Director that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activities and associations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB 3)

problem o

activity. It is suggested that the DCI take the position

that at this time there is no conclusive evidence of

conspirataal apons or ship at dewald; that all Agency

information bearing oa this problem has been furnished

to the Commission for evaluation and consideration in the

framework of its total knowledge of the facts. The Agency,

at the present time, is lacking any knowledge of recent

information or documentation furnished by the Soviet

Government to the Commission with respect to Oswald's

• activity in the Soviet Union. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization with respect to the personal security of

the President. Certain steps relating strictly to the

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

memorandum. It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

of the President and, advisedly, other Federal officials

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

similar to what currently exists by statute for special

relationship to the Cuban Intelligence Service.

Substantive information of grave concern, to the

security of sources and methods have been developed

on both of these topics. The information and, in certain

instances, knowledge with respect to acquisition has

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

MT. Rankin and to certain elements of his staff. It is

recommended that the DCI not respond on the record

to queries on these topics. He should suggest that all

such "technical questions" be worked out in detail through the

channels and procedures that have functioned very well

-- we believe - between the Commission and particular

CIA components. (TAB E)

Formal Disclaimer of any Relationship with Dee Harvey Oswald

injoin is:

There have been pumore and allegations which began

immediately after the assassination which branded Oswald as a

U.S. Government agent, In many instances, CIA has been

named as his sponsor. The authorship, geographical dispersion

throughout the world, the identitycof themes and the timing lend

strong support to the conclusion that these charges are elements

of a world-wide, Soyfet-sponsored propaganda and misinformation

program.

As DCI, Mr. McCore welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

It is recommended that the DCI state concurrently with this

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

up momentum over the past six years. We have traced the

sponsorship of that campaign directly to individuals and com-

ponents within the Soviet police state apparatus. Their un-

scrupulous treatment of the Oswald case was neither new as a

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.

If the DCI is challenged by anyone on the Commission

the Commission has taken up these points item-by-item with

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Organization Regarding

Presidential Security

Mr. Rankin raised this question dire ctly by letter. In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasury, record

with the Office of Central Reference a formal require-

ment for information relating to Presidential security.

b. It was suggested that, it the Secret Service

intended to expand its

Inteltigence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions;

the DCI should state that he desires

to take the opportunity

offer

Ogdestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the country à few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL.165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons - for example, asylum if they were

created to administer the purposes of the Act.

Stra

The DCI should sugeetthat the Commission consider a

recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secret associations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

such work and for the system which calls upon them to do it.

There are specifio cases in the past ten years which document

this assertion. Trusted personnel charged with assassination

• missions have abandoned the mission even without the assurance

or the inducement which the DCI is here proposing.

In making this suggestion, 'ne DCI may go one step further

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.).

(Regarding Public Statement

by CASTRO,

etay, attached

BACKGROUND

1. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular Président KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordina

ovocative fashion

" ... the BATISTA of his

(" ... KENNEDY is a creti

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4.. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper. the Iimes-Picayune,

on Monday, 9 September, page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba.

Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

"Bitterly denouncing what he called

and make promises which later it will not honor.

This has happened to promises made during the

October crisis.

They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

" "But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'

6.. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated Ie-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

?. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY'

assassination).that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads of in dealings with the warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headguarters attention. to the AP story very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba.

There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff Itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above. The results

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20- 20 quality

of hindsight, may be stipulated in summary:

There is no increment of credible

evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of

soviet anayor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in the as-

sassination to what was developed and con-

sidered by the Warren Commission and its

staff. The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of

President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did

them in alone and of his own determination

stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this judgement

did (and does) not exist in Washington. But

such evidence could exist in Moscow and/or

Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination. Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and/or Cuban (KGB and/or

DI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

grow until there has been a full disclosure -

by these governments of all elements of

OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet Union

and Rig contact, in Mexico City. The

Warron Commission report should have left a

wider "window" for this contingency. That,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level,

particularly in the counterintelligence com-

ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated

by Mr. Helms in his testimony before the

Warren Commission, CIA would continue to

regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as

still open.

C. In the absence of additional of new

elements of "credible" evidence,

are

"nuances" in the record that emerge as note-

worthy, in the light of other conclusions.

there was any formal mandate, of even

The Warren Commission Report takes note of this:

"OSWALD tOld DELGADO that he was in

10. Actually DELGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected. by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a questign marka

DELGADO's testimony has the cast of credibility.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

1.

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States. The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was

there reporting

from Los Angeles to Washington and Havana

represent the opening of a Cuban

INTERCEPTED- CONVERSATIONOF CUBAN EMBASSY

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18.

glexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Luisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians!

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coindide with the burial. Finally she

said she punner tS move that night into the house of a

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

"Zuisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON; a Cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate Cenéral of Intelligence (DI) .

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headquarters.

B. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

•as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S SUCCESSOr)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installationg in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by the

Mexican Governmental authorities.

statements that it was learned that OSWALD

became engaged in a personal altercation on

27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

d. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February 1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-

lished, was on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first. He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days. 5

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the

visa action and facilitation of the trip to Cuba via

Mexico City from 28 December 1962 - 21 January 1963 that

23. There-is

no evidence in the OSWALD case file that

?.

Silvia DURAN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

OSINATE

confirmed by intercept, with the data held

on the Cuban

DGI, its personalities and methods, in

Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

fundamental guestion: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VECA is later pited by

* Cuban DEI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfaced in the DURAN

was taken by Vincent Theodore LEE, the organizer of the

Fair Play Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD establishec

Dallas during the period 19 April

2 November 1963.

There is an overlap between LEE's and

VEGA's travels to Havana during that period: VEGA

departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returned

on 13 February 1963.

statements.. Coming back to the beginning: "Luisa" -

Luisa CALDERON - as a member of the DGI unit in Mexico City -

could very well have known something that would make what

she said to her unidentitied caller less a matter of

boastful self-indulgence than was assumed at the time.

SILVIA DURAN,

SUBSTANTIAL AMPLIFICATION OF ADMISSION OF

ALLEGED PERSONAL RELATIONS WITH LEE HARVEY-OSWALD, 1967

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia, DURAN

testimony already have been suggested above. (In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,

and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaguim Hernandez ARMAS,

because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-

tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about [or been

offered?] money payments by her Mexican interrogators.)

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN

was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have

cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967. of

how she had been taken into custody and had been interrogated

after the assassination repeated what was already know.

26.

As

Warren Commission reported, "Literally

dozens of allegations of a conspiratorial contact between

OSWALD and agents of the Cuban Government have been

investigated..."6 Among these cases, which consumed

hundreds of CIA man-hours in Headquarters and abroad

and similarly the FBI in the United States was the

Nicaraguan walkin in Mexico City, 26 November 1963,

Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.

27. The ALVARADO case is taken up in detail by the

Warren Commission under the cryptograph "D."" ALVARADO

claimed that he had seen an American, whom he identified

as OSWALD, receive money some time in mid-September 1963

in a meeting in a patia of the Cuban Consulate in

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

security service contrâf into the case.

28. The ALVARADa story is a particularly acute repre-

sentation of the difficulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transactión of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial.

siculate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Communism,

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandun of Recora dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [said) that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the cuban

Embasay daring the period she now finds out

that ostip tas here in Mexico prior to the

assassination. She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family [Horacio DURAN].

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

log. They were so obviously out of place that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

through." She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos "without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

in certain particutars significantly modified her earlier

account.

She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been interviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed

they did not give a'very complete story because the

Embassy officers did not appear to give much credence

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the Legal Attache on 17 and 24, November 1964.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substa@tiated by inquiries.

The Fal representative therefore considered the matter closed

and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Political Officer, however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, CARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont.

(This detail checked

out

affirmatively: CARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27

and 28 - 30 November 1963.) In another, on 7 February 1967,

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

events she described as having occurred in the Mexican capital

1967, the

Oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

He studied lay at the University of Mexico

for three years

approximately 1960 - 1964. He

belonged to a clandestine pro-CASTRO revolutionary

CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because

felt necessary to explain to Mr. Dulles the direction of our

thinking about thesa proposals.

(Note: I Instructed ir. Migren to prepare a

drait of suggested queries, using the

assistance of DERYABIN and

to have this

ready;.

If possible, by the closa of

business today.)

: 3.

Ranksin stated that the Commission wants to account

1n detail, minute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

tine outside the United states.

hir. Bagley suggested that

the narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviet Union

bey convertod to a chronology tabulation which would pernit us

more simplyto insert added details and dates as we learned

of then in other documentation which we can expect to receive

shortly.

This vas agreed.

(Note: I Instructed hi. Higren to begin re

casting the narrative immediately into

this form.)

Mr. Rankin said that the Comnission has a waist high

stack of documents and reports received from the fBI and Secret

Service which CIA has not yet received.

These Include Secret

Service Intervieys with Marina Oswald, letters from Lee Oswald

1n the USSR and other naterial. He promised to send this

matertal to fir. Helms shortlj..

(Hoto: We will pass appropriate parts of this

material to DERYABIN for further analy

sis along the lines of his earlier work

on documents already in our possession.)

5. Messrs. Angleton, Murphy and Bocca considered DEBYA-

BIN's Initial analysts of Marina Oswald's documents, and the

questions to which 1t gave rise,

to be a worthwarte and

impoxtant contrebution.

CIA would be unable to make any Beri-

ous

analysisor even hypothesis until some of battali

restlong Iad been answered.

Mr. Rocca suggested that DERYA-

SIN's paper be recast into nore of a questlonalre form and!

Mr. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERABIN's cornent and

speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory con

ment on each question,

Mr. Angleton and yr.

Murphy thought that it would be desirable to send this paper

to the Warren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a menorandum informing the Commission that we would need

answers to this interim questionnaire in order to reconstruct

3 detailed chronology of Oswald's tine in the USSR and to

papers:

Has the Connission formally requesting us to

wellins thougat that the answer

to this question is yes.

However,

Mr. Angleton asked for a formal

request from the Comission to this

effect.

The FBI. has stated that 1ts

reports are not to be passed to

Astabus, which may cause some comi

cations.

Would the Comission be prepared to assune the

burden of responsibility 1f sucha defector should disa

radically different hypotbesis or Interpretation?

The persons present said that the

Commisalon would.

If a defector who had contributed to the analy

Mr. Angleton reported that ir. Richard Davis is repre

Inquiry.

Thompson had ruled himself out because he was

Anbassador to the Soviet Union at the time of the events in

question.

One matter which had been brought to light by the

Ostrald case was the need for a mechanism in the United States

Government to record and assimilate our knowledge of the Soviet

handling of Anerican defectora to the USSR.

The Bureau 1s

Similarly, CIA has not

systematically collected nor compiled information on sovie

defector handling.

Berlin Base had kept a list of American

defectors at one time, but these individuals have not beer

debriofed on their return to the West.

8. The Commission representatives at the 14 Jamary 1964

meeting estimated that the liarren Commission would need from

three to six nonths to complate its task.

9.

Hr. Bagley raised the question of the desirability

of having DIRYABIN participate personally, representing the

FBI as an interproter perhaps, in a debriefing of Marina.

Kesars. Angleton and urphy were convinced that cia mist avoid

direct Involvement with this investigation. Although 1t is

Agency the Commission may choose to use.
