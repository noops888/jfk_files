Vice Admiral B. R. Inman

Director

National Security Agency

Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755

Dear Mr. Director:

The Select Committee on Assassinations was

established by the House of Representatives pursuant

to House Resolutions 222 and 433 to investigate the

assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Dr.

Martin Luther King, JI.

In conjunction with our

investigation into

the assassination of President

Kennedy, it has come to the Committee's attention that

the National Security Agency has information which

will be of substantial assistance to the Committee's

inquiry.

The information

to which the Committee staff

needs access and which is held by the National Security

Agency is all outlines and summaries and biographical

data relating to the Cuban Intelligence network of

Premier Castro covering the period from 1959 - December 31,

1964 with emphasis on operations by Cuban Intelligence

operatives in the United States and other Latin American

countries, and any analyses of the direction and evaluation

of specific assassination operations.

In addition, the Committee requests that it be

provided access to any other materials you have relevant

assassination of President Kennedy or any

investigation

into the assassination.

Access to all

materials we will receive from the National Security

Agency will be restricted to staff members with

SECRET security clearance.

Mr. Burke,

Attached is a request from the SSCI.

I have talked to Fred Cassedy at the FBI

and he says that the Committee is looking

into the Kennedy assassination and that

the SSC provided Veciana's name.

I intend to contact Howard Liebengood

next week and will probably arrange for

the SSCI to review the document out here

at that time.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

4 January 1977

SUBJECT: Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) Inquiry

into the Assassinations of Kennedy and King

1. On 30 December, the undersigned met with Howard

Liebengood, Deputy Staff Director of the SSCI staff and Tom

Moore, staff member.

The meeting was to permit the Committee

to read an NSA end-product report on Cuba in response to the

Committee's letter #5900 dated 20 December 1976. The Committee

staff members exhibited keen interest in the product and the

two Cuban national names contained therein.

The Committee

staff also indicated that they intended to broaden the scope

of their inquiry and would forward to NSA another letter

(which has been received and is inclosed) requesting access

to all Cuban reports stored in the repository for the period

1961-1965.

2.

After the meeting, the undersigned contacted LIC Don

Bennett of Mr. Latimer's office to inform him of the first

letter since it had been sent directly to NSA. LTC Bennett

indicated that another Dod component had been asked for similar

information. As a result, LTC Bennett stated Mr. Latimer was

revising his earlier containing policy on providing to the

SSCI information on the assassinations and now had decided

a policy of full cooperation.

At Mr. Latimer's direction,

LTC Bennett will draft a letter to Staff Director Bill Miller

suggesting a meeting between the SSCI staff and Mr. Latimer's

staff; the meeting will focus on projected DoD responses to

the Committee's inguiry. NSA will be invited to attend these

meetings.
