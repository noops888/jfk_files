Dear Sir:

The following concerns the technical equipment of your office:

Reurlet 12/17/63 forwarding two lamps for the purpose of

concealing a MUTT unit in each lamp.

Inasmuch as the lamp shade is used, when feasible, as

the MUTT antenna, New Orleans should immediately furnish

the FBI Laboratory the appropriate lamp shades for lamps

already submitted. New Orleans should identify which lamp

shade goes with each lamp.
