PG 511-C in August, 1951, advised that she is very well acquainted

with a J. PATI who

resides in New Kensington and who is a cousin

of SAM MANNARINO.

PG 511-C stated

that from PATI she had learned

that the MANNARINOS have been short of funds lately and have borrowed

as high as $25,000 from friends in New Kensington.

She related that

Pennsylvania,

terrific financial reverses as a

result of the

lost of certain patent rights used in the manufacture

of juke boxes.

On December 12, 1951, some 22 slot machines, consul type, were

confiscated by Pittsburgh agents at the NuKen Novelty Company,

1242 - 4th Avenue, New Kensington,

pa.

This confiscation was

on the

authority of USA EDWARD BOYLE on the basis these machines were movec

from a 7th Street address in New Kensington after passage of the

Gambling Device Law without proper marking or identification in

violation of Public Law 906.

P. K. JONES, Attorney at Law, New

Kensington, Pa., advised that the records

at the County Clerk's

office,

showed that the following persons own the

New Kensington Novelty

doing business

as the NuKen Novelty Company:

SAMUEL MANNARINO, GABRIEL MANUARENO,

TOM TANNAS, ALBERT SAM, and F. W. LOGG.

The ownership, distribution

and servicing of slot machines was not

the sole business of the NuKen

Novelty Company and it is still operating, its interest lying in vending

and pinball machines in the New Kensington area.

JEK Act 6. (4)

PG 62-1643

a PCI of the Pittsburgh Division of unknown

reliability, advised that the Arrow Ireasurer Ticket, a lottery,

is back in full swing in the New Kensington area and in his

opinion the MANNARINOS are the force behind the sale of these tickets

but the informant had no positive proof of this.

In August of 1953

reported that SAM MANNARINO had returned to New Kensington

for good as his business interests had been lost in the gambling

casino San Souci in Cuba.

Mainly, through the efforts of the Westmoreland Ministerial Association

and its program called "Operation Crusade" in the latter half of

a large amount of publicity was given to the corrupt conditions

existing in New kensington, and because of this most of the gambling

activities were voluntarily curtailed. During the same period it

was reported through several non-authorative sources that the MANNARINO

control in the area has been greatly lessened and that other factions

were ready to step in and operate when the town again opened up.

As has been reported it appears that New Kensington is again wide

open and it further appears that the MANNARINO organization is still

in control of all gambling in operation even though the subject and

his brother GABRIEL MANNARINO spend a great deal of time out of the

city in Miami, Florida.

Hangouts and Places of Amusement

The Ken Mar Hotel is the headquarters for all activities of the

MANNARINO organization operations in the area. This is a hangout

for the top racketeers and hoodlums in the area.

The Lateus Club,

unauthoratively reported to be owned by SAM MANNARINo, which is

located near the Ken Mar Hotel and is an after-hours spot and gambling

establishment.

The City News Stand owned by TOM LATEOS and headquarters

for the MANNARINO numbers operation in the area. The Greek Club and

the

Bachelors Club, after-hours clubs and gambling establishments, both

located in New Kensington.

The Sans Souci Club

the subject is reported to have a large interest.

The description and the identification record of the subject is set

forth.

It is to be noted that the description was obtained from the

of the Allegheny County Workhouse where the subject was received

on January 10, 1935.

to serve a sentence from 1 to 2 years, which is the

most recent authorative description available.
