CRIME ON THE HIGH SEAS - FIRING OR TAMPERING

WITH A VESSEL

This is informative memorandum to advise of

attempt to

dynamite the British freighter "Lancastrian Princess." The bomb

which did not explode has been recovered and was made of simulated UiACH

dynamite which Miami Office has passed to orlando Bosch Avila, head

of Movimiento Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR),

militant anti-Castro group, through a cooperative source.

Previous information has indicated that on 8/27/68 Bosch

had disclosed that a bomb had been placed on the "Lancaster Princess, "

a British vessel, nine days before and that he expected

go off shortly.

That deterined that the Lander feet

was, probably identical with the "Lancastrian Princess," a British

vessel, which, although it had not touched Florida ports' during the

pertinent period, had touched several Gulf ports and had siled for

Englaid from Mobile, Alabama, on 8/27/68• U.S. Coast Guard, Miami,

which had been alerted indicated it would notily the ship's agent,

It being his responsibility to take any further positive actioler

The interested agencies, including State Department and MI-S

advised

Miami Office has now advised that on evening of 8/28/68

coast Guard, locally, advised that bomb had been found attached to

the "Lancastrian Princess," anchored about three miles off Miami

Beach by Dade County, Miami, Sheriff's Office.

The bomb was

located on right-hand side of vessel, fifteen

feet below watertine

in the middle of the ship.

means of chain and padlock and consisted of about ten sticks of

dynamite.

Memorandum Wannall to Sullivan

RE:

UNSUBS; ATTEMPT TO DYNAMITE THE BRITISH

FREIGHTER.

"LANCASTRIAN PRINCESS"

' ON. HIGH

SEAS, 8/28/68

CONIDENTEL

no suspicious persons were observed in the water or anywhere in

vicinity of vessel at any of the U.S. ports despite the fact that

his officers and crew had been alerted by the ship's owners to

beware of possible Cuban saboteurs.

The Captain advised that he

received instructions from the ship's owners to put into Miami to

have the vessel checked for a bomb as the result of a Coast

Guard alert.

Miami Office pointed out that the dynamite in this case

did not explode because it was simulated dynamite furnished to

Bosch with Bureau approval by a cooperative Miami source who was

approached by Bosch for explosives.*

The Department of State was advised of the bomb attempt

on the evening of 8/28/68and State was authorized to furnish the

information to the *British. We are advising MI-5. 7C)

Immediate and vigorous investigation has been instituted

' and you will be kept advised of pertinent developments.

Miami

has requested local agencies and the vessel's Captain to treat

this matter confidentially since the security and life of our

source could be jeopardized.

OBSERVATIONS:

Previous investigation has indicated that Bosch's group

has threatened to bomb ships of countries trading with Cuba, and

previous memoranda recommended and approved that the Miami Office

pass simulated dynamite to Bosch. It would appear from the fore-

going that Bosch or members of his group constructed the bomb with

the simulated dynamite. Our action in making the dynamite available

to him in this instance has "'probably saved the lives of the crew

of the "Lancastrian Princess," prevented the vessel from receiving

serious bomb damage and has prevented the U.S. from being placed in

a most embarrassing position.

ACTION:

This is for your information.

We are pressing all aspects

of this matter in effort to obtain admissable evidence of crime on

the high seas violation against Bosch and any members of his organi-

zation involved.
