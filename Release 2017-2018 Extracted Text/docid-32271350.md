- Item 2-3

As discussed in an earlier section of this report,

the Warren Commission did not gain access to the CIA's

production from it

in Mexico City until

an advance stage in its investiga-

tion. The record reflects that Mssrs. Willens, Slawson,

and Coleman did not review the production until they

visited Mexico City on April 9, 1964. At that time, they

reviewed a number

Commission. The response an both accounts has uniformly

been that the Calderon conversation was never made avail-

able to the Commission nor was its existence ever made

known to the Commission. (Rankin dep; Slawson

interview,

Willens response to letter, but see Rocca deposition

wherein he states that he is sure the Commission knew of

it, Helms hearing.) In addition, the Calderon 201 file

bears no reference to the conversation nor does it indi-

cate that it was ever made known or, provided to the War-

ren Commission for its analysis.

The, the available evidence supports the conclu-

sion that the Warren Commission was never given the informa-

tion of the opportunity by which it could evaluate Luisa

Calderon's significance to the events surrounding Presi-

dent Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

expeditiously provided this evidence of her

intelligence

background, association with Silvia Duran, and her com-

mentary following the assassination, it may well have

Two difficult issues

provide the Calderon conversation to the Warren Commis-

sion; secondly, why didn't the Agency reveal to the War-

ren Commission their full knowledge of Calderon's intel-

ligence background, her possible knowledge of Oswald and

her possible connection to the CIA or some other American

intelligence apparatus.

The first question can be

explained in benign terms.

It is reasonably possible that by sheer oversight the

conversation was filed away and not recovered or recol-

lected until after the Warren Commission had completed

its investigation and published its report. However, this

conversation could have also been withheld deliberately

be a CIA operative. It is possible that this information

was not provided the Warren Commission either because

there was no basis in fact for the allegation or because

the allegation was in fact true. If the allegation

were true, the consequences for the CIA would have been

serious. for It wour daul

An earlier CIA dispatch from the CIA Chief of

Station in Mexico City to the Chief of the CIA's Western

Hemisphere Division records that:

Wilfredo of the Cuban Consulate, Tampico,

reported that Luisa Calderon has a sister

residing in Reynosa, Texas... Luisa may go

up to the border to visit her sister

soon--

of her mother may make the trip--details

not clear.

1849, July 31, 1965)

At the very least, the above dispatched evidenced

an interest in Calderon's activities and those of her

family.

Whether this interest took the form of a clan-

destine-agent relationship is not revealed by Calderon's

201 file.

The Committee has queried the author of the above-

cited dispatch requesting that Calderon's sister be con-

tacted by the CIA's "domestic exploitation section.".

David Ronis, the dispatch's author, was a member

of the CIA's Special Affairs staff at the time he wrote

the dispatch. He worked principally at CIA headquarters

and was with responsible for recruitment and handling

of

of agents for collection/intelligence data. Mr. Ronis,

when interviewed by this Committee, stated that part of

his responsibility was to scour the Western Hemisphere

division for operational leads related to the work of

the Special Affairs staff. Ronis recalled that he normally

would send requests to CIA field stations for information

of tea

or leads on various persons. Ause he would receive no

response to these requests. It was

Ronis'

recollection

that the above-cited domestic exploitation section was

a task force within the Special Affairs Staff. He also

stated that in 1963 the CIA's Domestic Contacts Division

might have been requested to locate Luisa Calderon's sis-

ter.

Ronis told the Commiftee that he had no recollection

of recruiting any person associated with the Cuban Intel-

ligence Service.

He did recall that he had recruited

women to perform tasks for the Agency. However, he did

not recall ever recruiting any employees of the Cuban

Embassy/Consulate in Mexico City. Finally, Mr. Ronis

stated that he had no recollection that Luisa Calderon

was associated with the CIA. (HSCA Staff Interview August

31, 1978)

Various present and former CIA representatives

were queried whether Luisa Calderon had ever been asso-

ciated with the CIA. The uniform answer was that no one

recalled such an association. (Cites: Helms, Hearing, August

9;. 1978,.p. 136; Rocca, Dep. P. 148, July 17, 1978; d
