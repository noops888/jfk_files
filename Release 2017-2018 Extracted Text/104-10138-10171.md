3. Results: A covered the following tonice with me:

Training: On Panama and the facilities used, the best

could remember,

Ft. Shernan was open in about August or

September 1960 to train Cubans for about a 2 to. 3 month period.

There were about 40 to 50 men, mostly ARTIME followers. When it was

decidod a birger group would be noeded, which later became Bripado

about Novomber 1960. Actually, the group was split, with some going

said, "Look ovor the supply manual for that timo." Apparently,

the exiles wore given everythin that was available and in large

quantities.

A said he just could not bogin to rive me a list

of what had been passed.

Infil loans: After the Bay of Pies invasion,

vorker with infiltration teans. The drency worked with those terma

from toughly 1983 to 1956.

Thay were in two catapories.

The first

wore unilateral teams. traintre, and sponsored by the Agency. The

othor catagory war "political" toans - that is political groups in

southern Florida who were sponsoring infiltrations into Cuba.

The Agency helpod this lator a catapory by riving them supplies.

In the case of both, they usually made a caches

in Cuba.

The

unilateral team, as an example, vould make a cache on-island, and

another group would pick it up and use it (compartmentation).

In some cases, teams. (both unilateral and political) would not

actually make the cache and keep the material. in Florida, to be

used later at their own convenience,

In addition,

I was positive

that some of Castro's troops obtained some of these cachos, due lo

foul-ups and snitches.

These caches containes pistols, rifles and

heavier, money and demolitions. Some of the teams cheated by going

to the Bahamas and buryinh thoir stuff on small islands and reporting

back to Florida that they had cached in Cuba.

stated soveral

timos that there

was no offoctive control over the "colitical"

groups and thereforo no control ofer the material riven them.

Fron

this, me may surmizo that Agency equipment (demolition included) was

in the hands of anti-Castro Cubans in south Florida, as

well as

'Castro's Rebel Army on-island.

d. Brigade Training: Furthor to demolition training to

Anti-Castro Cubans,

A reminded me that shortly after the Brigade

was ransomed from Cuba, Brigade leaders were taken to Palm Beach

and talked with President Kennedy.

At that time, the US Govt offered

Brigade members the chance to join the U.s. amy.

This also included

infil team members, who were completely seperate from the Brigade, and

members of the Brigade airforce.

The Army end of this training was

given at Ft. Benning, Georria and beran in early 1953. There, Brirade

members entered the U.S. Army at roubly equivalent ranks - officers

were made 2nd Lts.

They received Ranger training, plus. jump trainin.

of those men were in the U.s. Army for oither 6 months or one year.

Cubana Bonbing:

was specifically askerl about the

6 October 1976 bombing the of the Cubana airliner in the Caribbean.

A I said the street-word among the Cuban community in south Florida

Is that the bomb should have gone off in the plane on the ground.

Tho

bombers did not mean to kill all of those people.

On BOSCH, the

community does not particularly like him, but admires him bocause he

had been going at Castro tooth and nail for yoars.

They do not like

the idea of terrorism and fault BUSCH and MORALES for this.

said if Swine Fever had been introducor

into Cuba, ho wouldn't doubt that the Army/DIA had some hand in it,

espocially if the so-called sourcos claimed it came out of Ft. Galick.

P. Assassinations by the Aroney:

said ho had abcolatol!

no knowledge of assassinations, attempts or plans, by anyone in the

Agency during his tour.

Not only vere they prohibited by the Agency.

they were counter-productive. It was explainer to him during hi:

Azency tour that there was a good chance of an assascination back-

firing; that we (U.S.) are more vulnurable to assassinations than

the Cubans or Soviets. Therefore, as far an he was concorned, ther

Editorializin,

A said it was too bad

that the upper-ocholonsdid not believe in this restriction. On ton

of that, they approacher mafiosa to help them. (NOTE:

* 'is

rather anti-Kennedy, especially Bobby, with whom he was in a shoutin;

match during a hearing on the Bay of Pigs invasion.)

h.

Assassination of Peruyero: Juan Jose Feruyero, a Bay

of Pigs veteran and leader of the Brigade 2506, was runned down last

week as he left his home in Minni.

said

tho word on the strea!

among the cuban, community is that this was done by the Del as

to the anti-Cubans in Miami. Foruyero had no enemies - he was not

into drugs, crimo, politics, etc.

By killing him, the Cubans verg

had been killed, perhaps the killing could have been blamed on

the mafia, drug dealors, politicians, etc.

from the Tampa I'ribune of 14 Jan 77 is attached, below.

an SOB and worse.

He went. into a long explaination of his activitios

with DEA in Key West. โข In summary, he was a P/A and ran a string of

informants.

Because of internal DEA politics, he was blown and left

dangling on a string in Key West. He had to leave town within 24

hours and loft his peoplo (informants) there without calling or

warning then.

As a result, he lost friends, prestigo with his

informants (many of them Cuban exiles) and his business in Key West.

In roneral torns, he was treated very shabbily by DEA and regrots

ever having nixed with them.

He is still in contact with one of

4. Conclusion: For me, this was a most intoresting intorviow.

As far as results, the interviow indicated to me that we can rot

broad-brush overviews from retired Agency employaes, and fow details.

To answer specific quostions from Congress and/or the Dopartment of
