A highly confidential Chicago informant advised that

after Alex and his paramour, suzanne Keger letter from the

arrived home from

their recent European trip, Alex received a

Swiss Consulate in Chicago notifying him he has been banned

from Switzerland until January, 1975.

Alex's concern has increased considerably because of

this order and he has until March 31, 1965, to appeal the order.

Alex contends he will send an attorney to Switzerland to fight

this matter if necessary.

Alex is known to have frequently discussed banks in

Switzerland and has been observed in swiss banks by the Swiss

Police. This coupled with Alex's great concern over the bann-

possible that he has funds presently in the

Swiss Bank.

Chicago is awaiting further information regarding use

of false identification by Fueger while in Paris. Chicago is

desirous of obtaining full details regarding the cause of this

investigation in Switzerland and France and any efforts made by

Alex in his defense, regarding the above matter, may disclose

other interests in Switzerland besides skiing and recreation.

It is noted that upon arrival at U.S. Customs, O'Hare

Field, Chicago, Fueger was found to possess three mink coats and
