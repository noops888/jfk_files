TRANSMITTAL SLIP

TO: Mr. Wigren - re GPFLOOR

ROOM NO.

1963.

Mr. Paul Chretien called me at 120 hours

on 17 December, presumably on the basis of

some press query, asking "whether there is

still an Soviet intelligence school in

Minsk." I told him I'd never heard of one

in the first place; had he? No, he hadn't.

I then checked through Mary Kay Viering

and got the following sole trace, which

I passed to Chretien by phone, simply saying

that there had been a report of one back in

source reliability unknown, but that

suspected' his query concerhe

"spy schools"

, then those are none anywhere

FRoM: he seened to understand fully.
