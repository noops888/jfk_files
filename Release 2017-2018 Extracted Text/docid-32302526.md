During the evening of 5/18/61, I

, Proprietor of _

_Confectionary Store, 956-5th Ave., New Kensington,

was interviewed for three hours in Monroev121e, Pa 15E SA PHONAS

G. FORSYTH, III, and among other things,

His father,

operated the confectionery from

approximately 1925 antil his death in 1952 as a numbers-horse

book-sports betting station.

His father cooperated with the

MANNARINOs but was never part of their organization.

This was

tolerated by SAM MANNARINO because he had grown up with WILFRED

BURGART and was personally fond of him. WILFRED BURGART was the

only "independent" allowed to operate in a fashion where he banked

his own "play" and only contacted the MANNARINOs to "lay off."

When the elder BURGART died in 1952,

took over his

business, both legal and illegal, and has operated until the

recent past much in the same fashion his father had done. About

two years ago, SAM MANNARINO went into semi-retirement and has

almost nothing to do with the rackets,

leaving this field to his

brother, GABRIEL MANNARINO, known to

as KELLY MANNARINO.
