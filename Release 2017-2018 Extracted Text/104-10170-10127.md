Sergto Viconte ARCACHA Salth (Enclosure 2 of referenco memorandum)

DPOB: 22 January 1923, Cuba

1.

Traces on ARCACHA do not reflect the date

he first

arrived in thou.s.

However,

he became the FRENTE REVOLU

CIONARIO DEBOCRATICO (FRD) delegate In New Orleans prior

to the Bay of Pigs invasion and continued in that position

until the FRD ceased to function.

The FRD was the piedecessor

of the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL, and was organized and

supported by the Agency.

The organization was used as a

front for rocrultment of Brigado

2506 for the invasion.

During this poriod ARCACHA reported to the FRD hcadquarterg

in Niami through a post office box in Coral Gables, and

reportodly maintained extensivo relations with the New

Orleans FBI and Immigration offices.

Two of his regulnr

FBI contacts were a Mr. De Bruce and the deceased Guy

Banistor.

2:

ARCACIA was also one of the promoters of the

FRIENDS OF DEMOCRATIC CUBA, INC (FDC) which was incorporntod

In New Orleans on 6 January 1961.

This organization was

ostensibly created by several New Orleans business and

political figures, including the decensed former FBI agont,

Guy Banistor, to collect coney to aid Cubans in their

fight against Communism.

According to the articles of

incorporation;

these donations would also be used to support

the FRD and the funds were to be channeled through ARCACHA,

less a percentage to be retained by. the FDC.

An investi

gation conducted by a reliable Miami Station asset concluded

that the FDC was organized strictly for the personal sain

of the promoters with the approval and collaboration of

ARCACHA.

The investigation produced no evidence that any

individual donations. were ever solicited or received and

recommended that the funds of the Stevedores Union and the

books of the New Orleans Exporters Company be investigated

for evidence of personal gain and possible evidence of

federal tax evasion, since both the president of the New

Orleans Exporters Company, Gerard F.

of New Orleans Stevedores Union, Alfred Chittenden, were

officials of the FDC.

Approximately one month after the

FDC was created,

"strong criticism from some

put the organization: out of business.

3.

Information in an inmigration card reflects that

ARCACHA travelled to Caracas,

Venezuela at an unspecified

date.

His address in. Venezuela was HOTEL TIUNA, Caracas,

and his US address was listed as 4523 Duplesses Street,

New Orleans.: Passport No. 00J33.

Emillo SANTANA (paragraph y C of reference memorandum)

ĐPOB:

7 Sept 1935, Cardenas, 1936 and

Cuba

(also reported 7 Sept

Intanzasy Sept 1937

1:

Subject is probably identifiable with Emilio SANTANA

Galindo, who was recruited by JNWAVE In December 1960 as a

guide for an infiltration team.

SANTANA was pald a monthly

salary under provisions of his NOC until he was terminated

on 15 October 1963 when the ratline developed by the team

became inoperable due to occupation of the target area by

Soviet technicians:

Another compelling reason for SANTANA's

termination stemmed from his untruthful reporting concerning

certain aspects of the team operations.

2.

JAWAVE obtained a report from the Dade County (Miant)

Sheriff's office that an Emilio SANTANA (no matronymic)

•born 6 July 1936 in Cuba, was declared a fugitive from

Louisiana on a federal warrant 22 December 1965, FBI Sheet

132287F, based on two counts of burglery in Louisiana.

He was

arrested and booked by the Dade County Sheriff'g

office on 2 February 1966 and was presumably sent back to

Louisiana.

At the time of his arrest SANTANA gave his

address as 851 SW 4th Street, Miami, which is the same

address

shown on an old immigration' brm when he was

living in Miami.

Headquarters files indicate SANTANA 1s

separated from his wife who apparently still resides at

the old Miami address.

Since SANTANA's date of birth: vartes

on various documents in his 201 file, the variation in birth

date on his arrest sheet is not conclusive:

The fact he

did give his former address to the arresting officers

indicates he is Emilio SANTANA Galindo. A 1962 immigration

form includes a photograph which could

be obtained from

JMNAVE for identification purposes if this becomes necessary.

Although JUWAVE has had

no contact with SANTANA

his termination, there is a note in Station files

dated

23 June 1964 that SANTANA used the Agency as his:

employer on an auto credit application.

DIRECTORIO REVOLUCIONARIO ESTUDIASTIL (DRE)

(STUDENT REVOLUTIONARY DIRECTORATE)

1.

Tho Dre was concolved, created and funded by the

Agency In September 19G0 and terminated in December 1966.

It was an outgrowth of the activist studont group In. Cuba

which fought against BatISTA and later against CASTRO.:

Many of the leadors came into exile around September 1960

and vere subsequently tralned and Infiltrated into Cuba

by the Arency In late 1960 whore they operated by obtain-

tox Intelligonco sotting up action teams,

ete., up through

the Bay of Pigs Invasion.

While the DRE was initially set

up as a psych warfare outflt. the orkanization was given a

large amount of paramilitary aid In funds and material.

After the Shy of Pies, the DRE engaged in independent

mIlitary actions, which declined at Agency direction and

because of a roduction in funds

from lato 1962 untll tor

mination of the group.

Members were used through 1966 as

political action agents, for publishing propaganda which

was sent throughout

the Hemisphere,

attending

internattonal

student meetings at Agency direction, and producing radio

programs and special propaganda campaigns.

2.

After the cutback in military operations any

of the

best DRE members

relocated in other

areas.

present there are delegations in most Latin American coun

tries which have maintalned some contact with various

Agency stations over the years although the DRE is no

longer very active.

During the organization's 6 jear

period of actlve existence DRE personnel were in contact

with several wAVE staffers and outside contract agents.

However, from January 1965 through December 1966, contacts

with DRE personnol was limited to two agents, Juan Manuel

SALVAT, the curront DRE Secretary General whoris now

operating a bookstore in Miant, Florida,

and Fernando

GARCIA Chacon who was rolocated in El Salvador.

ISCA is an anti-Communist propaganda organization

with headquarters in New Orleans, that disseminates Englist

and foreign language propaganda tapes and films on a vorld

wide basts. conducts public foruns of an extremist

political nature,

etc.

The organizational impetus and funds

apparently come from wealthy low Orleans. figures including

Dr. Alton OCHSNER, of the OCHSNER CLINIC, and Willard E.-

In recent years funds have been supplied bs. the

SCILICK SAFETY RAZOR COMPANY. An ISCA letterhead listing all

the officers and officials has been requested from JivE,

which has had some casual correspondence with the organiza-

tion concerning Miss Juanita CASTRO.

There is no indication of any Agency relationship

with INCA prior to January 1965 when INCA sponsored Miss

CASTRO's appearance in New Orleans.

sponsored by INCA.

The dinner, which was attended by ciric

shortly after liss CASTRO's defection and there was

considerable interest in her appearance.. INCA was particularly

interested since

it had distributed hundreds of English

was surfaced in Mexico.

In October 1966 INCA again

requested that Miss CASTRO appear as a guest speaker in

major American citles in connection with the release of

the INCA motion picture

production

"HITLER IN HAVANA"

Following various reviews of the file, JWAVE decided the

inadvisable to permit Miss CASTRO to accept the invitation.›

FRENTE REVOLLCIONARIO DEMOCRATICO (FRD)

. (CUBAN DEMOCRATIC REVOLUTIONARY FROVT)

1.

Tho FRD was created with Agency assistance,

guidance and tinancial support in May 1960 and consisted

of soveral antl-CASTRO groups.

The FRD was forned aga

political action, propaganda and military unit.

Initlal

actions consisted of extonsive radio and printed propaganda,

demonstrations,

and trips

throughout the Hemispherc to gain

support for the fight against CASTRO.

The FRD also functioned

as the front organization for recruiting the mombers of

the Bay of Pigs Invasion force and carried out a missive

program of social assistance to Brigado 2506 membere in

training camps and thelr families.

Although the FRD head-

quarters wore based in Miami, delegates were assigned to

other areas

which included New Orleans,

Louisiana,

Tampa,

Florida,

and Moxico City, to gather intolligence and

coordinate Cuban refugee

activities

2 :

In late 1960 or carly 1961 the CUBAN REVOLUTIONARY

COUNCIL (CRC) was

formed to coordinato and direct FRD

activities and this group was headed by Agency and white

House sponsored Dr. Jose MIRO Cardona, assisted by Manuel

ARTIME and Dr. Antonio VARONA•

Both

the FRD and the CRC

continued to function until October 1961. when the FRD was

complotely absorbed by the CRC In order to avoid the confusion

resulting from duplication of personnel, activitles and

funding.

The CRC also had direct access to President

Kennedy

and top ihite House aides.

Because of the magnitude

of the FRD and CRC operations and the Agency participation

in the activitles and funding of the groups, a laige number

of JMWAVE

and Headquarters were directly involved with both

FRD and CRC personnel.
