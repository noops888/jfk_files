* review of the recent tampa inspection report indicates nat

you are giving consideration to the use di the electronic switch

elpment CU

in effecting MISUR coverage at the Dream Bar. You now have two complete

units of this type equipment. since you have additional microphone surveys

pending, there is a possibility that additional electronic switch nits may be LU

needed by your office. In the event the surveys indicate that additional

equipment of this type is necessary, you should advise the Bureau at the

earliest possible date, giving complete details concerning the environment

where it will be used so that appropriately disguised equipment may be

prepared for your particular installation.

Should your survey reveal a situation where additional technicall

information, assistance or equipment are desired, you should advise the

Bureau, attention FbI Laboratory, the details of the problem.

NOTE: It is noted from Tampa inspection report 4-19-62, that Tampa

has a MISUR installation pending at the Dream Bar, Tampa, and one

additional survey each pending in Tampa and Orlando, Florida.

Nature

of telephone wiring and equipment used in some areas of Florida makes

microphone egress difficult unless existing wire is used. This requires

special equipment such as the vo lectronie switched previously but u an

especially for the Tampa Office.

SA STEPHEN J. LABADIE - 4/20/62:

SA LABADIX has the SANTO

TRAFFICANTE

JR., aka., AR case

assigned, he being a subject of Bureau "crash" investigation.

Efforts to enter his part-time residence at 2505 Bristol Avenue,

Tampa, where it is known he spends very few days a year, have been

negative since some members of family or the maid are in the house

at all times.

Furthermore, the risk involved may not warrant the

effort as TRAFFICANTE is seldom there.

In view of the above, fully realizing the aims

and

desired accomplishments to infiltrate and penetrate the "TRAFFICANTE"

group at Tampa, it was ascertained that some of the close

"TRAFFICANTE"

group hang out, not regularly, at the Dream Bar,

2801-03 Nebraska Avenue, and appropriate survey was requested.

It was thereafter established that entry could only be

gained to the Dream Bar, with relative security, from approximately

3:30 AM (when FANO TRAFFICANTE and his trusted helpers and friends

left the bar) to approximately 9:30 - 10:00 AM, when they reopened.

Entry would have to be gained from approximately 3:30 AM to light

For daybreak.

Survey indicated that the above entrances, even with

a key, would have to be made on numerous occasions to bury wires,

sand such entry was not deemed secure.

On 1/14/62 the Dream Bar was

gutted by fire.

Thereafter

the building was checked and it was noted it was boarded up.

being the case, it suggested the probability that new telephone

instruments and new telephone booth would be installed, and such

suggested to SA LABADIE possibility of placing instruments in new

phone or new booth and therefore a memorandum was submitted suggest-

ing this be checked and considering the fact that new possibilities

now existed.

Since the Dream Bar was to be reconstructed, entailing

perhaps all new plans, new materials and changes, it was realized

by SA LABADIE that installation of misurs for concealment in old

building was not the desired method,

changed, completely torn out and rebuilt.

as such would undoubtedly be?

Being aware of the above

situation, SA LABADIE set out to determine new construction.

SAS FRANCIS X. O'BRIEN and LABADIE, after appropriate .

checks,

obtained from CASIMORO HERNANDEZ the reconstruction plans

and materials used at the Dream Bar and adjacent poolroom.

(162-51), serial 46, on administrative page the information is set

out that the Dream

Bar now has glass front doors, installed by

G. E. SHORE, Shore

Glass Company, per CASIMIRO HERNANDEZ, and

thay are made by NATCOR.

The above is noted so that master keys

may possibly be obtained for the locks which are used in NATCOR

products.

Having the keys pould give ready access for any

subsequent re-survey.

SA EARL M. PETERSEN (sound-trained Agent) - 4/20/62:

In letter dated 9/20/61, advising the Bureau that an

FD-142 was being submitted requesting authority to install a misur

in the Dream Bar, the Bureau was advised that the Dream Bar is

located, near a busy intersection in Tampa where both streets have

a considerable flow of traffic on a twenty-four-hour-a-day basis.

Two cleaning establishments are located within a block of the

Dream Bar and are operated on a twenty-four-hour-a-day basis.:

Another bar and a billiard parlor, both open long hours, are

located nearby.

The billiard parlor is adjacent to the

Dream

Bar and in the

Trafficante estate.

The Dream Bar is usually vacated between

3:30 and 4:15 AM, with the

venetian blinds in the front of the

building raised and lights left turned on inside the building.

doors and windows at the rear are barred and bolted from the

inside and only one of the front doors is not bolted from the inside.

remaining front door has a bolt-type lock which would make it

It was pointed out that it would be dangerous to work in

the front part of the building,

but that work could be done in the

rear rooms of the building provided access could be obtained.:

It was pointed out that during the course of this survey

a fire damaged the interior of the Dream Bar. In addition to this,

the operation of the Dream Bar was being taken over by FRANK: PETER

ALBANO, who is married to a niece of SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.:

Its

was surmised that because of the fire and change of ownership it

was possible that extensive interior redecorating would take place

in the near future.

Technically, it seemed possible to effect an installation

in the Dream Bar as a

spare pair of telephone lines lead from a

pole at the rear of the

building to the back wall of the Dream Bar.

It would have been possible to install a hidden microphone in the

Dream Bar and conceal wires inside the building which could then

have been connected to the wires icading to the telephone box on

tha

pole in the alley and from there to a plant or to the office.

good possibility existed of obtaining a key or a copy of the key

the building through contact with NICK SCAGLIONE, JR.,

who was operating the bar and who was at that time an informant

of this office.

Authority was requested in order that we could move

without delay should conditions be such that this could be done

with security.

It was felt that a key was necessary for access to the

Duce Far because the only available entrance to the building was

on a busy street patroled by uniformed police in cars. Close

Insison with police officers in the area is not deemed advisable

because of the possibility of police protection being afforded

the Dream Bar in connection with bolita activities.

A key had not been obtained and renovation of the

building had not occurred when on January 14, 1962, a fire ruined

the interior of the building.

As a result of this fire, the entire building has been

He pointed out that in matters involving the security of the

United States, such as Communist or Espionage matters, these

....now is the time

for

Daytime surveillance made on a spot-check basis revealed that the

Droam Bar was watched by one or more of the persons operating the

establishments at all times.

At no time was this building seen

In the process of renovating the building.

This could be done

with security provided a close watch of the building was made to

follow exact progress of the interior construction and many entries

made to place technical equipment and wiring in the building as

construction progressed. Even then,

a change in plans could cause

removal of work already done, revealing wires and/or equipment

placed in the building. It is felt that installation of a cable

containing extra pairs

with the subsequent connection of microphone

equipment to these cables would not be secure at the Dream Bar as

NICK SCAGLIONE, JR. is familiar with telephone procedure, according

to statements made

by him to SA LAbaDIE, and is able to conduct a

security check of telephone equipment in this bar.

This is a com

pletely changed situation from the case when a pair of spare wires

was available for our use.

These wires did not approach other

telephone wires and extended from near the top of the building.

The possibility of installing equipment in the building

which will not need spare wires exists.. As a result of communica.

Consideration was given to obtaining access to the

telephone booth which will be installed in the Dream Bar on

4/27/62.

Inquiries at the telephone company revealed that the

telephone conpany installs the telephone booth and later installs

the telephone in the booth.

This would make necessary the

installation of the device in the booth and then when the tele

phone is installed the wires from the device would have to be

connecced to the wires serving the telephone.

This is not &

destrable arrangement in this case. It was also noted that we do

not know

where the telephone booth is to be installed and that the

equioment might be in such a location that it would furnish little

or no information of value.

In this connection, it is felt that &

better installation could be made after the telephone equipment has

been installed and has been in service for some time.

installation would be complicated by the fact that telephone wires

in this building now run in conduit.

Nothing is known of any alarm system installed in this

building when it was renovated. It is felt that no alarm system

with an outside connection has

been installed as no wires have

been found leading from the building.

An alarm system of the type

to give an audible alarm when a door is opened or to leave an un-

noticed indication that someone has entered the building could have

been installed.:.. Consideration to this would have to be given at

time of entry into the building.

radio-type installation could be made in this building

which would require no external wires. The disadvantage of this

type of installation is that it broadcasts on a frequency which

can be picked up by anyone with equipment which will receive om

the band on which it broadcasts. This equipment would have to be

connected to the AC circuit to give long-time operation and

should be equipment which could be turned on by radio signal

when monitoring is desired. This would cut down chances of

detection.

This type of equipment would be available from the

laboratory (possibly the off and on feature would have to be

devised,

but this is no real problem). This office has battery

operated radio equipnent of this type available for temporary

installation.

This equipment will transmit for only about 24

hours without replacement of batteries.

A radio installation

such as that described above would require a nearby installation

an antenna and receiver could be located.

deal equipment and kor how are available for misur

installations in this office. Liaison with the telephone company

is such that nearly anything can be accomplished. It should be

pointed out that technical installations are made only with proper

security to protect the Bureau's interests. A memorandum dated

3/21/61, maintained as top serial of 66-75, gives instructions to

agents having cases assigned in which a misur installation could

be used to advantage, as to the procedure used in the installation

of a misur.

This memorandum points out the responsibilities of

agents involved in this type of operation.

In summary, it appears at this time that:

1. No extra pairs should be installed by the telephone

company in view of statements made by NICK SCAGLIONE, JR. that he

is able

to trace out the telephone equipment.

2.

No installation should be made in the telephone booth

to be installed in the Dream Bar.

3.

Techniques considered secure are installation of a

radio transmitter with off on switching possibilities and a nearby

receiving

location for the installation of equipment that can use

telephone lines already in use for telephone service.

equipment could be installed in the most desirable location in

the building. A plant would be located nearby.

4. Installation hinges on obtaining access to the

building on

enough nights to allow installation without detection®

The situation is considered to have changed with the renovation of

the building requiring consideration of possible alarm systems

a watch of the building from 4:00 AM until morning.

5. Any installation placed in this bar will be con-

siderably hampered by a television set which in the past has been

turned on and with plenty of volume on every occasion when the

writer has been in this bar.

This installation continues to receive consideration for

installation in spite of information furnished above. Careful

an installation at the Dream Bar would warrant the risk involved

or whether installations at other locations might be more productive.

It is realized that a long

period of time has elapsed

since authority was requested for this installation.

Every effort

will ba made to bring this

case to a logical conclusion in the

2627

future.
