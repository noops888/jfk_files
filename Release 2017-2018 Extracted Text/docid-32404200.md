One of this Center's major responsibilities over

the past year has been as the Agency's intermediary with

the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Review Board

(AARB) .

The presidentially appointed Board was created

by 1992 legislation with broad authority to review

assassination records held by government agencies and

privately with the objective of publicly disclosing the

maximum possible number of documents.

The five member

Board is chaired by John Tunheim, the Principal Deputy

Attorney General of Minnesota.

3. Neediess to say, CIA records--Lee Harvey Oswald's

201 flle, Mexico City Station records, and large quantities

of operational material--are of keen interest to the Board.

our Historical Review Group, headed by John Pereira, has

one an impressive job of coordinating Agency relations with

the Board and overseeing the declassification and release to

the National Archives of Kennedy-related records.

220,000 pages already have been released,

a large percentage

of them with redactions to protect intelligence sources and

methods.

The Board is not due to complete its work for

about another two years and our support for its mission will

continue to be a major, time-consuming responsibility. (S)

4. It is likely that the Board eventually will want us

to declassify operational details from our records that

Agency components will not want to release. If we were

unable to broker a satisfactory solution--as John Pereira

has been able to do in all such cases thus far--we would, of

course, bring the issue to you and the dcI.

5. At some point you may want John and me to brief you

on this entire matter, although I do not believe it is

urgent to do so. The Board has advised us that it will want

to meet with the DCI, probably in the next two months or so.

Finally, for your information I am attaching a memorandum

from John providing a recent update on Board activities.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Director, Center for the Study

of Intelligence

John Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

Meeting with JFK Assassination

Records Review Board

, This memorandum is for your information.

1.

On 18 May 1995, members of the Directorate of

Operations

and the Historical Review Group met with the

JFK Assassination Records Review Board to discuss the

declassification of CIA records. The Board had requested

the meeting for purposes of educating its members as to the

categories of information that probably will require

continued protection, i.e. by deleting words or inserting

substitute language.

2. The discussion focused on some 30 documents that

describe CIA operations in Mexico City at the time of the

assassination. Among the categories of information

discussed were: locations of stations, surveillance methods,

intelligence liaison relationships, names of agents and

staff officers, and pseudonyms and

cryptonyms.

In a number

of instances we suggested alternative ways of

describing

sensitive information, which the Board

seemed to find a

reasonable approach.

3. No decisions were made by the Board during the three

and half hour meeting, but the session was highly productive

in terms of providing

the Board a basis for understanding

material in documents related to sensitive sources and

methods.

Board Chairman John Tunheim told me that the Board

found the discussion very helpful in helping them fulfill

their responsibility for approving or disapproving all

recommendations to withhold information.

The Board's

Executive Director, David Marwell said it was a valuable

meeting, and he complimented the Agency representatives for

being willing to engage in an open-minded discussion that

was "not scripted."
