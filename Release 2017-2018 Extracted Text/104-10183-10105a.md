send General CARDENAS a copy of "The Constitution"' of the Inter-

American Bank. and send him word that a ' Cormission of Advisers"

such as he sifiested could not be established without an Amendnient

to the Connitution. LITENSOR said the government in each country

was (by the Constitution of the Bani) to represent that country--and
