Re Philadelphia letter to the Bureau 3-22-61.

Information contained in referenced communication wasoTHER

made available to and discussed with Colonel

official of British Security Service, MI-5.

CoLonel

advised that MI-5 for a number of years has developed certain

individuals in Lloyds of London as confidential sources. Colonel

Jat the request of this office contacted these sources

S

at Lloyds to determine the answers to questions raised by the

86/08

Philadelphia Office concerning subject's financial dealings

in the gambling casino at the Plaza Hotel, Havana, Cuba. (5)

On April 24, 1961 Colonel

confidential sources had stated that Lloyds of London had acted

as the re-insurer for the American International Re-Insurance

Corporation of New York City to the extent of $70,000 for a

policy made out to subject in connection with the gambling

casino at the Plaza Hotel, Havana. (5 )

Colonel

stated in April, 1959, a claim was

paid to subject for $185,000 presumably by the

American Inter-

national Re-Insurance Corporation in respect to a fire which

had occurred at the gambling casino, Plaza Hotel, Havana, on

January 1, 1959. (5)

Colonel

stated that in making this information

available to this office he would respectfully request that no

LENIVENDO NOIZINGOARI

dissemination of this information be made outside the Bureau

and that extreme discretion be used in connection with this

information in order that the American International Re-Insurance

Corporation would not know that the original information came

from the Lloyds organization in London.

Any such revelation

would seriously Jeopardize MI-S's future relationships with the

EN

Lloyds concern (5)

also pointed out that the term

"insured" by lloyds of london is a misnomer as Lloyds do not

pay out claims to individuals but act as a re-insurance

organization for other insurance companies and any money

paid by Lloyds is paid not to the individual policy holders

but to other insurance companies to help them cover their

losses when heavy demands are put upon their resources by

their own policy holders. (s)

No information was obtained indicating subject or

any of his associates had any kind of an insurance policy

other than the fire insurance policy mentioned above and

no information was available identifying the officers of

the corporation of which subject was a member. (e,

As there are no further leads outstanding, this

case is

being placed in an RUC status. C,4)
