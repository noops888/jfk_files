â€¢ MEMORANDUN FOR:

THROUGH:

SUBJECT:

Director of Central Intelligence

Deputy Director (Plans) el

Juana (Juanita) CASTRO Ruz

1.

ACTION: None.

This memorandum is for your informa-

tion.

2.

In connection with Task Force l efforts to split the

Cuban

leadership,

some

time ago we

targeted Juana Castro Ruz,

halesisterofFidel. and Raul Castro ruz.

A number of reports

have been

received indicating that Juana Gastro Ruz opposed

the strong communist nature of the

Cuban regime and was

prepared,

at least to some extent, to cooperate with anti-

regime elements. In May 1962 we reestablished contact with and

and a long time personal

friend of Juana: Castro Ruz!

On 11, June 1962, on our

instructions,

proceeded

to Havana where she maintained frequent contact

with Juana.Castro.Ruz and other

prominent Cuban leaders until

1 July 1962.

She discussed the current regime quite frankly

with

Juana Castro Ruz and,

according to

she

obtained Juanars agreement to provide intelligence on the

Cuban political leadership and

to work against the Cuban

communist regime, short of engaging in activity which might

result in

direct personal harm towherebrothers: Raulband Fidel.

According

to

Juana has agreed

to proceed to

Mexico

the l

United States in this connection and return to

Cuba after discussions with

"the Americans"

Lo He are making the necessary arrangements with

soon as possible in order that we may attempt. a direct re-

cruitment.

You will be kept advised of any future develop-

ments of importance in this

case.
