ERMETAL once,

to lobby on my own behalf; and was able to speak

with Identity E who promised to make a favorable recommendation..

Travel costs and other problems prevented my following up,

however, and nothing ever came of the

bill as far as I know.

In 1959 Identity D called me and told me that my

services would be needed again in view of the Communist tendencies

o The ANTHUG 1 regime.

I agreed to cooperate without hesitation;

and was introduced to Identity F, KUBARK Chief of Station, who

assigned me to Identity G.

promised that my citizenship status would be inquired into

My JWAVE contacts, I explained, claimed that.

He said that he and Identity I had been given to understand:

I wish to make the record clear that I have never

poseable under the above circumstances to maintain my (PBPRIME
