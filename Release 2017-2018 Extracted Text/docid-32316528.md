Enclosed herewith is a self explanatory letterhead

memorandum containing information furnished on 10/17/61,

USHERIDAN,

Chairman, New York Trucking Authority,

141 Broadway, New York City who requested his identity not

be disclosed..

INFORMANT

Files of the NYO contain numerous references to

S.G.S. Associates, HARRY SALTZSTEIN, ANTHONY PROVENZANO,

SIGMOND J. BROVARSKI and ALFRED REGER. REGER was found

guilty on

16/5/57, of three counts of extortion, NY 122-524 and

122-526, and is currently under indictment in New York

County on a four count extortion violation NY 159-35.

This matter was discussed with AUSA KELLY, EDNY

on 10/18/61,

and he stated that the consultant fees paid to

S.G.S. Associates do not appear to constitute a violation of

the IMRA statute, even if it could be proven that part of

this fee is being used to enable the companies to continue

operating.

He stated he does not feel that this matter

warrants further investigation.
