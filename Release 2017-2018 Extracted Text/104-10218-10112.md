Venezuelans, Cubans and other anti-Comunists.

The

article stated that the existence of this group was know

by the Herald, but it became generally know to the

public on June 26, 1961, after Plorida Senator George

A. Smathers disclosed that Cuban exiles are training in

Florida. The article said that Senator Snathers' dig-

closure on a nation wide radio network brought other

newsmen and television cameramen to Interpen headquarters

on June 26, 1961.

The article described Renming as a "young

glant, 6 feet 7 inches tall, with long wavy hair, a

trimmed baard, an Australian bush has, who looks

like Errol Flynn In his earlfer matinee days." The

article stated that Hemming said the recruits are

first housed at the headquarters, and then sent to

a training site in the Everglades, accessible only

by boat.

The article continued, stating that Interpen

holds parachute rigging classes in the middle of a

street In Miamt, and one elderly Miami couple stated
