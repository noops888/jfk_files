that it 1s not policy anyhere to promote the distribution of it or for that

matter, equally clearly, any other book. liter all, if the head man himsele

charter that rould authorize him to promote it in his sapiclal capacity on

the contrary. Nothing anywhere agalist you personally or the book; it's just

that, there la no polloy to promote any book of that side scope.

Re "Stalin" biotahy and/or sirlin phota book.

That leares the question whether you are supposed to be working on

completion af the "Stalin" biogranhy or on the Stalin pioto book, or on

both.

That is your on oference?

On the one hand, /dos is ardous to got the photo book done, and

(2) the friend who was mentioned to you at lunch the other day

is Interested In it, and. (3) me have already made a beginning on it, and,

parhaps nost important, (4) it could be completed in less tine than mould be

roquired to complete the blography.

(Incidentally, please be particularly careful not to say anything to

Anybody about the publisher who was mentioned at lunch. LSwon/. It could

raise a really firsiclass stirk. Llinson thinls othar publishers would

raise hell if they found out the Goverment had gone into competition with

then /. Very important).

On the other hand, what are your and your father's current obligations

a to vanguard, in so the stalln blograni, and mould you hit outy in

explaining to Varguard why and on whose behalf you were taking tho nonths (more

or less) to do the photo book, before resuring work on the biography? If s0,

that wight be an argunent for conleting the biography first.

Please dive no all relevant details as to the current status with Vengard.

As far as anyone here knows, you have only oral instructions to samplete the

blography. According to my rough notes of a talk we had July 3l, you had a cong

tract sath Vanguard, July 149, calling for a boak "by David & Boris Shib" to be

coapleted jarch 1,

1950.

ind as of June 10,

1950 your father had had a $900

NCHORANTIN OF CONTERSATION

SUNTAI: Congress for Cultural Teodo

On 15 August, ¿ discussed the Berlia Cultural Congress

Tulth particular dmasis on the proble

of bringing the continting Congress organisation under control

and, at the sane tine, exparding l? into an offectire antl-

corrunist weapon.

R. I expressed to

our concern over the manner 1n

which

had conducted Wiself during the Congress,

and

Trolled that he had bees equally conceruca.

Ee

said,

howevor, that while

Tactivition had crused an unfavorable

raaction

on the part of a nmber of the delegatee, that reactior

has been more directed againet |

persoually than agalast hir

as a representative of the gover-cent.

Inpreed with my

suggestion that two bito of silver lining could be found in the

cload, sanely that he had taken sost of the opposition

heat himself, thas spartas sono of our otter pooplo, and that

he had condicted hingelf liko ayrthing dut the "polisolepltsel"

the communist press of Germany bade bia out to be.

8a1d

'general attitnde was such as to cause some

of the delegates to disremerber that

was attached to the.

coverment in any fashion or presumably subfect to any discipline

at all.

aaid. that nost of the dolegates with whom he

had talked vero perfectly willies so accept the explanation that

the Congress was uniled upon bj: the Uaited Statos Govornment to

the extent that some official funds vere suppliod for the physical

ateging of the meeting (as indeed they vere) but that the rest

of the money cano from somewhat rogue aroffleial sources in the

United States.

Those sho suspected sonething nore, with the

excention of the Trevor-Roper froup, vere generally hoppy that

the united States was doing something of this kind and were ir

no mood to sat any erbarrassing questions of raise any delieate

polats.

It was also recognised that

Die Vorträge kann man ihrem Inhalt nach in einize Kategorien

aufteilen. Da gibt es solche, die das Grundsätzliche und Dogna

uber Lenina worke oder über die Geachichte der Partel der Bolschei

Andere Vorträge haben außenpolitische Fragen zum Gegenstand;

z.B. ein Vortragssyklus über die dußenpolitlk der UdSSR, ferner

über den "Sieg der Volkskräfte in China", über den "Freiheite

kamp? der kclonialen Volker" oder die "Hintergrunde der amerika-

nischen Außenpolitik".

Weltaus die meisten Vorträge befassen sich mit inneren I

ständen der UdSSR.

Es ist selbstverständlich, dal alle sinrich

Auf nehreren Landkarten werden-sodann die Feldeuge des Bürger-

die frenden Invasionstruppen sowie 1hre Inneren Peiß russischen

Osten anrückenden Truppen Koltschaks, nachdem schon 1918 briti=

In einer Inschrift zu 10 groden strateglschen Bewegungen der

Armeen im Jahre 1944 beißt es: "In der so entstandenen Situation

war 89 klar, daß die Sowjetunion auch ohne Hilfe der Verbündeten

Im Stande ist, gang Deutschland su besetsen und auch Frankreich
