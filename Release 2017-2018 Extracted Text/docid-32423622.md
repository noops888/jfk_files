That was his Joke in that moment.

After that we went to the debate, and I think that you have the whole history

of the debate, you have the transcription and everything, [so] that I don't have

to go inside that, because

that is subjective, not objective. You have the ob-

Mr. LIEseLfR. That is rigbt. We do have a transcript and we listened to it on

the tape last night over at the television station too.

to you about the training camp that were across the Lake Pontchartrain.

[Indicating photograph.] This is the spy

who was inside the training camp.

The Christian Democratic Morement turned

bin over to the FBI, and the FBI was questioning him in Miami.

The Christian

Democratic Movement found a letter, according to this information, from this

guy directed to Carlos Lechuga, former Cuban Ambassador to Mexico and now

Cuban Ambassador to the United Nations in New York.

In that letter the spy,

Fernando Fernandez, was warning. Lechuga that they have to be alert from that

Mr. LIEBELER. Let me see If I can understand what you are saying. You say

that Fernandez wrote a letter to Lechuga?

Mr. BRINGUIER. Fernandez wrote a letter to Lechuga in Mexico.

Mr. LIFßELER. Lechuga is a member of the Castro government?

Mr. BRINGUIER. Right.

MIr. LIFELER. He is now Ambassador to the United Nations?

Mr. BRINGUIER. In New York; right.

NIr. LebeLer. Fernandez is the person who was the Castro spy who had in-

filtrated the training camp in Louisiana?

aIr. BRINGUIER. For the Christian Democratic Movement here in Louisiana.

LIEBELER. Now the Christian Democratic Movement is-what? Pro-

Mr. BRINGUIER. Anti-Castro.

Mr. LIEBELER. It is an anti-Castro organization?

Mr. BRINGUIER. Yes; they were training Cubans over here to make a com-

mando action against Castro, but they find out that there was a Castro spy

inside the truining camp, and they went back to Miami with the people and with

him, and they turn him over to the FBI.

I think that after that the leader

for the Christinn Democratic Movement—or that the FBI didn't found nothing,

because was not against the law to spy inside an anti-Castro organization.

was against the law to spy inside the U.S. Government but not inside the anti-

Castro organization.

And my feeling-and this is the question that I am asking

myself-in New Orleans we are about 900 miles from Miami. In Miami is wbere

the headquarters of all the anti-Castro groups.

I cond not find any reason

for Oswald to come to me and offer me his service to train Cubans in guerrilla

warfare at the same moment when there was a secret anti-Castro training camp

in New Orleans and a Castro spy was inside that training camp.

is- because, if he was willing to infiltrate one active organization, he will go

directly to Minmi and he will offer his service over there in Miami, but not in

New Orleans where it is not publicly known thit here was something going on

at that moment. I believe that that was the only time here in New Orleans that

there was something like that, and It was a coincidence.

coincidence too for me, and that is that when Oswald left the city he went to

Mexico, and the letter from Fernandez that was Intercepted bere was to. Mexico

too, and Oswald visit the Cuban consulate In Mexico, and the Fernandez letter

was to the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico. For me, that is a big doubt.

Mr. LIEBELER. Go ahead.

Mr. BrInGUIeR. You see, after the debate, the same night of the debate, I

went to the radio station here in New Orleans and the local papers and the

United Press International office, and I gave a press release.

If you want a

copy, I could give you a copy. I gave a copy to the Secret Service.

The most interesting thing is the four things that I asked to the Secret

Service of New Orleans. I think that this is the second one where I said,

"Write to your Congressman

asking for a full Investigation of Mr. Lee H.

Ostald, a confessed Marxist" [producing document]. And that wag 3 months

before the assassination.

Mr. LIEBELEB. Do you have another copy of this?

. Mr. BrInguier. I have the original of that. You can have that.

Mr. BRINGUIER. No, August 21.

Mr. LIEBELER. August 21, 1983?

Mr. BRINGUlEE. August 21, the night of the debate.

Mr. LIBELEs. I mark it as "Exhibit No. 3" to your deposition, and I have

initialed it. Would you initial it?

[The witness complied.]

Mr. LIEBELER. Let me

go over some of this testimony that you have just

given to see if I understand.

Fernandez wrote to Mr. Lechuga a letter

in which Fernandez said that we meaning the Castro people?

Mr. BRINGUIER. Yes.

Mr. LIEBELER. Must be on guard up until August 8?

MIr. BRINGUIER. August 8, that is right.

NIr. LIEBELEB. Of 1963?

NIr. BRINGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. You indicated that Oswald had come to your store or offices

on August 5, 1983?

NIr. BRInGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. Oswald came to you offering to assist in the military training

of Cubans?

Mr. BRINgUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. At that time, there was, in fact, a training camp near New

Mr. BRIngUIeR. That is right.

Mr. LIEBELER. For the training of people for milltary action against Castro?

Mr. BRINGUIFe. Right.

Mr. LIEBELER. And that was not public knowledge at that time?

AIr. BRInGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIebeLer. So you are tying this up in your mind by considering the pos-

sibility that Oswald was, in fact, a Castro agent?

NIr. BRINGUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIeBeLer. And did know about the existence of this training camp, be

cause Mr. Fernandez had already himself infiltrated that training camp?

Mr. BRINgUIER. That is right.

Mr. LIebeLeR. And that Fernandez had told Oswald about the existence of this

camp and had asked Oswald himself to try to infiltrate that camp for your

organization?

Mr. BRINGUIEE. Excuse me.

Mr. LIEBELER. Is that correct?

Mr. BRINGuIER. Well, the only thing that I don't believe is that Fernandez

had told directly to Oswald.

What I believe is that Fernandez had informed

some people outside the United States, and these people had informed Oswald and

had gare to Oswald the order to try to infiltrate the Cuban group here in New

anything to do with Oswald?

Mr. BaNGuIer. Well, what I think is this: He send that letter to Lechuga, and

on August 5 Oswald came to me offering his service to train Cubans, all in the

same period of time.

Something that

was happening here in New

Orleans, that there was a secret anti-Castro training camp, and the chairman

of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee trying to join the Cuban group bere in

New Orleans. Those are the facts.

I don't want to tell something that I ain

not sure about. I just want to show you that tremendous coincidence or that

Mr. LiebElEr. Now it doesn't seem likely, does it, that Oswald would go around

handing out literature in the streets like be did if he was actually attempting

to infiltrate the anti-Castro movement?

Mr. BRInguIER. Remember that that was after I turned down his offer and

after I told him that I don't have nothing to do with military activities and

that here there is nothing, and that I turned down completely him.

went openly to do that before the attempt to infiltrate the training camp;

he went openly to do that after he was turned down.

Mr. LIBELER. Do you know of any conceivable association between anybody

in the pro-Castro movement and Oswald that could have acted as a source of

Information to Oswald-conducted the orders to him?

Mr. BRInGUIEk. No.

Mr. LiebeLeR. Would you have any way of obtaining information of that sort

as a result of your anti-Castro activities and contacts?

If there were such a

person as this, do you think you would be likely to know about it?

Mr. BRINGUIER. Beg your pardon?

Mr. LIEBeLeR. If there were such a person, that is to say, some agent of the

Castro movement who had been working with Oswald, do you think that you

would have had access to that information or you would have been likely to

Mr. BRINGUIER. You see, that is a hard question, because here in the city you

hare a lot of persons.

There are some who are pro-Castro, there are many

who are anti-Castro.

Even among the Cubans you could have some Castro

agents here in the city and you could not have control of everybody.

But there is something else: The owner of the Havana Bar-the Havana Bar

drinking the lemonade, be start to say that, sure, the owner of that place liad

He was telling that that was too much for a lemonade, and he feel bad at that

moment, Oswald feel bad at that moment-he had some

These persons here from

the Haraua Bar told me that the guy, the Mexican, who was with Oswald, was

Fair Play for Cuba Committee materials on one uneventful oc-

casion in Dallas sometime during the period April 6-24, 1963,316

Oswald's first public identification with that cause was in New Or-

leans. There, in late May and early June of 1963, under the name

Lee Osborne, he had printed a handbill headed in lurge letters "Flands

Off Cuba," an application form for, and a membership card in, the

New Orleans branch of tie Fair Play for Cuba Committee.317

first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the

vicinity of the U.S.S. Wasp, which was berthed at the Dumaine Street

wharf in New Orleans, on June 16, 1963.318 Fle distributed literature

in downtown New Orleans on August 9, 1963, and was arrested because

of a dispute with three anti-Castro Cuban exiles, and again on August

16, 1963.310 Following his arrest, he was interviewed by the police, and

at his own request, by an agent of the F'BI3 On August 17, 19633, he

appeared briefly on a radio program 321 and on August 21, 1963, he

debated over radio station WDSU, New Orleans, with Carlos Brin-

quier, one of the Cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on

August 9,322 Bringuier claimed that on August 5, 1963, Oswald had

attempted to infiltrate an anti-Castro organization with which he was

associated, 323

While Oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above,

his "organization" was i product of his imagination. a The imaginary

president of the, nonexistent chapter was named A. J. Hidell,as the

name that Oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon. 326

Marina Oswald said she signed that name, apparently chosen because

it rhymed with "Fidel," 32? to her husband's membership card in the

New Orleans chapter.

She testified that he threatened to beat her if

she did not do so.328

The chapter had never. been chartered by the

national FPCC organization, 32 It appears to have been a solitary

operation on Oswald's part in spite of his misstatements to the New

Orleans police that it had 35 members, 5 of which were usually present

at meetings which were held once a month. 330

Oswald's Fair Play for Cuba activities may be viewed as a very

shrewd political operation in which one man single handedly created

publicity for his cause or for himself. It is also evidence of Oswald's

reluctance to describe events accurately and of his need to present

himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than

was justified by reality. This is suggested by his misleading and some-

time untruthful statements in his letters to Mr. V. T. Lee, then

national director of FPCC. In one of those letters, dated August 1.

1963, Oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed to

have rented for FI'CC activities had been "promply closed 3 days

later for some obsure reasons by the renters, they

said something

about remodeling ect., I'm sure you understand." ast He wrote that

"thousands of circulars were distrubed" a2 and that he continued to

receive inquiries

through his post office box which he endeavored

"to keep ansevering to the best of my ability?" sa

In his letter to

V. T. Lee, he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf

of FPCC, but he attributed his lack of support to in attack by Cuban

407

## Page 8

exiles in a street demonstration and being "officialy cautioned" by the

police, events which "robbed me of what support I had leaving me

alone." 33+

In spite of those clains, the Commission has not been able to un-

cover any evidence that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration

in which Oswald was involved, except for the Bringuier incident men-

tioned above, which occurred 8 days after Oswald wrote the above

letter to V.T. Lee.335

Bringuier, who seemed to be familiar with many

anti-Castro activities in New Orleans, was not aware of any such

incident, 3 Police reports also fuil to reflect any activity on Oswald's

part prior to August 9, 1963, except for the uneventful distribution of

literature at the Dumaine Street wharf in June.337

Furthermore, the

general tenor of Oswald's next letter to V. T. Lee, in which he sup

ported his report on the Bringuier incident with a copy of the charges

made against him and a newspaper elipping reporting the event, sug-

gests that his previous story of an attack by Cuban exiles was at least

greatly exaggerated. 38

While the legend "FPCC 541 Camp St. NEW

ORLEANS, LA." was stamped on some literature that Oswald had

in his possession at the time of his arrest in New Orleans, extensive

investigation was not able to connect Oswald with that address, al.

though it did develop the fact that an anti-Castro organization had

maintained offices there for a period ending early in 1962330 The

Commission has not been able to find any other indication that Oswald

had rented an office in New Orleans.

In view of the limited amount

of public activity on Oswald's part before August 9, 1063, there also

seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed "thousands"

of circulars, especially since he had claimed to have printed only 2,000

and actually had only 1,000 printed. In addition, there is no evidence

that he received any substantial amount of materials from the na-

tional headquarters.30

In another letter to V. T. Lee, dated August 17, 1963, Oswald wrote

that he had appeared on Mr. William Stuckey's 15-minute television

program over WDSU-TV called "Latin American Focus" as a result

of which he was "flooded with callers and invitations to debate's ect.

as well as people interested in joining the F.P.C.C. New Orleans

branch." 341

WDSU has no program of any kind called "Latin Ameri-

can Focus." 942 Stuckey had a radio program called "Latin Listening

Post," on which Oswald was heard for less than 5 minutes on Angust

17, 1963.343 It appears that Oswald had only one caller in response to

all of his FPCC activities, an agent of Bringuier's attempting to leurn

nore about the true nature of the alleged FPCC "organization" in

New Orleans. 344

Oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers

and invitations to debate.

This would have made him a real center of

attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the Soviet Union

and as he was to some extent when he returned to the United States.

The limited notoriety that Oswald received as a result of the street.

fracas and in the subsequent radio debate was apparently not enough

to satisfy him. He exaggerated in his letters to V. T. Lee in in appar-

that

a Cuban American had crossed the border

from Texas into Mexico,

on November 23

and arrived in Mexico City on November 25.

He stayed in a hotel until the evening of

November 27, when he departed on a

regularly scheduled Cubana airlines flight

to Havana using a Cuban

courtesy visa and

an expired U.S. passport.

He was the only

passenger on the flight. In March, 1964

the Agency received a report from a

source which alleged that the same Cuban

American had received a permit to enter

Mexico City on November 20 in Tampa,

Florida.

The same source said the Cuban

American was somehow involved in the

assassination.

The Agency did not follow up on this

report other than to ask a Cuban

defector about his knowledge of the

Cuban American's activities.

The FBI

did investigate the reported unusual

travel but did not fully report the

results of their investigation to their

Warren Commission.

Their investigation

showed that this individual had lived

in Tampa and Key West and was pro-Castro.

He had

traveled to Cuba in May of 1962

and had a brother in the Cuban military

who was studying

in the Soviet Union.

On November 17, 1963, the Cuban American

was at a get-together at the home of
