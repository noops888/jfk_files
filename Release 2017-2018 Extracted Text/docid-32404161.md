MEMORANDUM FOR:

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Chief, Historical Review Group

Robert J. Eatinger, JI.

Assistant General Counsel

Litigation Division, OGC

MHCHAOS Material Concerning Activities of U.S.

Persons Overseas

1. This memorandum responds to Frank Most's request for

guidance on how to process certain MHCHAOS material.

Specifically, I was

asked whether the standards for processing

the MHCHAOS documents that I provided in my 8 May 1993 memorandum

to you would change if the MHCHAOS reporting was of the

activities of U.s. persons

in foreign countries. The standards

do not differ if the reporting was of the U.s. person's

activities overseas.

2.

The authority of the Central Intelligence Agency to

collect information on U.S. persons is based on the rationale for

the collection, not the location of the U.s. person.

While the

foreign activities, as opposed to domestic activities, of U.s.

persons are more likely to be of a foreign intelligence or

counterintelligence interest, it does not mean all foreign

activities may be collected.

Additionally, the fact the

activities of a U.S. person take place overseas does not, by

itself, remove the U.S. person's privacy interests.

I recommend that you treat MHCHAOS reporting of a U.s.

person's activities in a foreign country in the same manner as

you treat MHCHAOS reporting of a U.S. person's activities in the

United States.
