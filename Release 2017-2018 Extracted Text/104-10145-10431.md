MEMORANDUM FOR: 33SDB Chtono

Mokey Goldsmith (after some phoning back and

forth) called and sald that the pages on the attached

Jollow shoots are the ones wanted for use in the

Goodpasture iepositions, (They constitute some 200 pages).

24. I pointed out that these are samplings from

fot a station, the basis for asking dor ft

being a five day visit by a man who killad the president.

It could not be considered relevant to the Committee's

charter, by any stretch of the imagination. I said I would

get thn message to the dosk and have them report back to

me what 1s involued. He wants to have access by COB

tomorrow..
