On 1-23-65 BALSAN advised that further inquiry at the

Hotel Bristol had reveled that subject had departed the hotel

on 1-20-65 and that his destination and present whereabouts are

unknown.

BALSAN stated that hotel authorities had previously

agreed to advise the PJSN of subject's departure but apparently

had neglected to do so.. It should be noted that during the

period in question German Chancellor ERHARD was reportedly

residing at the same hotel, and BALSAN speculated that hotel

authorities were so preoccupied with their distinguished visitor

that they inadvertently neglected to advise the PJSN.
