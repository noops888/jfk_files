Senator Tower. The Committee will come to order.

4

Beford we proceed to hear the witness, I think we should

5

have a report from the team that went down to the White House

6

this morning to examina some documents, and I believe thay

7

will report to us and have a racommendation on how the committee:

8

should agree to handle this material, and shall I call on --

Sanator Mondals. Howard has the notes.

10

Sonator Tower. I call on Senator Baker.

1]

Senator Baker. Mr. Chairman, Rill Radar has the notes.

Senator Mondale. Well then, call on ma. I can read them.

13

Serator Tower. Mr. Bador?

14

MI. Bader. Thank

you, Senator.

14;

The documents that wa reviewed briufly at the white louse

16

situation room were four different catagorius.

In the first category, there were copies of the so-caller

"Mongoose files. These files contain minutes of the Special

1'1

Group Augmented and copies of the rest of the Mongoose files,

arranged in chronological ordur. And these holdings are from

2!

¡the files of the Fxecutive Secretary of the an Committee and

2r.

¡include the files of the Chairman and the Executive Secretary

of the special Group Mugmented.

Also these trust files are turned over to the Chairman by

The second group of documents are CIA's Mongoose files,

icourse, we didn't have a chance to go through them with any

position of the Rockefeller Commission as such.

That is the way I interpret their language.

1:

I: sooner or later we would have to find a way to utilize those

Rod Hill seemed to think well of that idea. I told him

In this position I was able to travel quite extensively

This was very unfortunate, because when they did this --

would only leave the Embassy lines open so thorefore I was not

At about 6:40 or 6:30 or 6:40, a telephone call came in

G-a-i-l-o-n-g. And it was at this point that Diem talked to

Big Minh for the sirst time.

He asked

for full honors if -- he wanted to capitulate,

full honors. Big Minh renliod to the

President that he could not quarantee full honors, if and
