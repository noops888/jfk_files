advised that his

DITIce had received intormation that

BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed, on an installation

of Bull office machines being usedrby! the Prefecture of

â€¢ Police in Paris.

This information has been furnished to the

Prefecture of Police, and while

their inquiry is continuing,

preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.

In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned

THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR. which sets forth

background

information concerning him appearing in Bufiles, and which

was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to Baltimore

3-19-64, was made available to the prefecture of police.

It appears that the information contained in the memorandum

would be of interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH of the

local office of U.S.I. Sathe Direction de la Surveillance

du Territoire (Bar)

shash fomestic counterespionage service,

We are therefore furnishing

copies of that memorandum to them.

As mentioned previously, we will continue to

follow this matter closely and promptly transmit to the
