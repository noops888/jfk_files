1.

The SMABOVES are still bombarding the Station (although

the volume has diminished) with trace requests on correspondents

of Subject.

The Station has several times made clear our feel

ing that wholesale tracing of AEVALIANT/1 contacts two and three tim

removed is a poor expenditure of effort, but the requests still

continue to come.

2.

The latest request received on 13 February 1963 relates

to the following:

19 Jan 63 Sankei Bussan Co. Ltd.,

P.0. Box 213, Kobe Port,

Hyogo Pref. Japan

21 Jan 63

Universal - W.E. Polna

Poland

25 Jan 63 Svenska Bindgarn Sfabrikens,

Stockholm, Sweden

3. In view of the above, the Station will appreciate the

"review and reevaluation of the AEVALIANT case" which has been

discussed on several occasions in the past and which would have

as its objective "the resolution of outstanding leads and the

termination of active investigations of this case".

The Station

believes that until KUBARK takes a firm position and provides

guidance in this respect, the sMABovEs will continue to expend

their limited investigative assets on the wide range of AEVALIANT

personalities at the expense of more current and more potentially

productive activities.
