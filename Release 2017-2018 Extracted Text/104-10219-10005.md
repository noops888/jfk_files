ON 26 JUNE 1970 GERENDE AND

LIEMPTY-TO SIGNED QUIT CLAIMS AND SECRECY AGREEMENTS.

GERENDE wAS

PAID 510,000 AND LIEMPTY-LO $2500. AS TERMINATION BONUSES. AND THE

PAYMENTS

WERE MADE ON A MONTHLY BASIS SO THAT THE STATION WOULD HAVE

SOME CONTROL OVER THE TWO AND THEREBY KEEP THEIR RTACTION STATUS

FROM EMERGING DURING THE DIVORCE PROCEEDINGS.

LIEMPTY-TO UNEXPECTEDLY APPEARED AT HOS IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER

NEMORANDUN FOR: Chief, Western Henlaphere Division

BUBJECT

: Raymond H. GERENDE (P) and H11e.

1.

Raymond H, GERENDE 18 a

citizen and con-

tract agent who has been employed by loe Agency in l

781nce 18 March 1955

J during which time

he hag served this agency well.

During the past fifteen

Year GERENDE has been generally engaged in, the area of

operational support activities i

For the

past two years he served as a principal agent bandler

for a sensitive fixed survoillance project, LIEXPTY; was

used in unilateral recruitment approaches against the

Cubar target; and in special support investigardong.

whO is LIEMPIY/19, has been

employed off

Are: GERENDE, 1958 as & support asset, (transcriber/trana-

and on since

lator) under BOC,

and during the past tuo yoars has worked

Intermittently transcribing unilateral telephone tap tapes.

3.

During the past year GERENDE and his uife have

had serious marital probleng which culminated in a sepa

-ration in Novenber 1969, and divorce actions sere initiated

by both parties.

The divorce proceedings are still in

the courts, and

bitter disputoa have resulted botween both

parties concerning custudy of the children, division of

personal proporty, and the monetary settlenents.. The above

problem is compounded by the fact that GERENDS'& wife knous

in sone considerable detail of GERENDE'S activities on

behalf of

the Ajincy and 1f she exposed him, it could lead

to the surfacing of GERENDE's Agency employment and pos

aible compronise of operations LIEMPTY, LINESA, LISMBRACE,

and LIFSAT, as well as numerous individual Station assets

such as LISTERINE, LIRAZOR/1, LIBAND/1, and David i.

WILSTED (P) .

Since late 1909,

Station bas

been in touch with both GERENDE and hia wife on this prob

lem, and every effort has been made by the Station to have

= 2=

both parties settle

the divorce anicably and to protect

GENENDE'S cover and that of the projects.

Because of the

above family problems which threatened GERENDE's personal

cover and security, he vas relleved of all operational

responsibilities and placed on half salary in December 1969.

3.

In March of 1970,

Station docided

that GRENDE's personal problens were not being resolved,

and because of the continuing security threat, plans vere

made to terminate both GERENDE and his wife by

the end of

Py 1970.

The LIEUPTY Project reneval, approved in May

1970, was amended to include a termination bonus for

GRRENDS of $10,000 for 15 yeare of service with the Agency,

and in addition approval was received to pay Hre. GERENDE

the sua of $2,500 as a security neasure designed to keep

her from revealing her husband's teeny aspsitation and

what she knous about Agency operationa

This

project approval carried the ADDI caveat that the ter-

nication bonuses to both GERENDE and bia wife be paid on

a monthly baals rather thay to one lump sun as a security

neasure to assure at least an elesent

of control over

both iodividuals, slace the continued receipt of these

monthly paynenta

deponded on their loyalty to the agency.

GERINDE and big wife were terminated by Station represen

tatives

on 26 June 1970 under at ndard Agency.

procedures, and separate Quit Clalas and Secrecy Agree-

monte were sinned by both GEHENDE acd bis wife.

Neither

GERENDE nor his wife had any objection to the wording of

the Quit Claims or the Security agreements, and both

appeared to bu satiafied with the termg of

the settlement,

and with the fairness of the Agened's position.

On 8 July 1970 at 1115 hours, Mrs. GERENDE appeared

at the main gate of the Headquarter'g

building, and requested

to see an official from the Cfiur fl Secarity. During thu

subsequent interylew, Mrs. GERENDS established her identity,

and supplied the interviewer with dotaila on ber and ber

husband's past employment with the Agency

and the fact that they had terminated said employment in

late June 1970.

Mrs. GERINDE made three specific requests

of the Agency:

details of the

termination of CaRED and 17 vate and

recommended against seeing her.

I discussed this matter briefly with

'Legal Counsel's Office, who felt even il Station

should recommend seeing GERENDE and his wife, that it

would be limited to WH Division representation.

On

7 July

I advised Mr. Raymond of the Station's answer

as contained

He said he would

contact GERENDE's wife approximately 8:30 of the evening

of. 7 July, and tell her that his liaison contact had

been unable to find anyone who would see her.

Mr. Raymond

was uncertain as to what GERENDE's wife might do.

The GERmiDE problem is unquestionably a serious one.

are forwarding under soparate cover copies of several comoranda

prepared by GIRliDE. Ono outlines the history of his marital

problens, snother describes the current legal situation, and a

third outlines proposals for a settlement.

There is no

reconciliation.

The Station's position with GLINDE from the

start has been

that he must agree to an anicablo settloment with

his wife in order to insure that sho would not icel forced to tako

steps which would jeopardize the security of Station operations.

For this reason, the station insisted fion the beginning that aby

financial sottlement with his wife would have to take into account

the fact that he was receiving a certain salary fron anock, and

that he could not fairly keep

this salary out of the settlement on

the grounds that his wife could entic no lezal claim to that

salary, GRINDE's wile was made avare of our position on this, and

she was frateful, even though she rcalized that this arrangement

was strictly informal.

The Station felt that GERINDE could not be

allowed to uso his IVROCK salary as a weapon in the dispute with his

wife; because if he did, she could hardly be expocted to refrain

from

exposing his connections. Indeed, events have shown that

GEREIDE's wifo is a vindictivo wozan,

and if it had not boen clear

to her that she, as well as GERmiDE, would lose money if he loses

his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago.

GERINDE, 10X

his part,

would have preferred to keep his ROCK salary entirely

out of the picture. Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station

position vas fals, and he said he would conform.

opinion, busically fair

*. The attachod memoranda from the Desire le the station's

was inclined to vive GERENDE'S NifO (LIEUPTY-19) the benefit of the

doubt, largoly because her description of GALIDE's character

weaknesses came as no surprise (particularly his tendency to

procrastinate, even when his marriage was at stake).

Early in the

copilict, LILITY 19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked point blank what

she could tell her lawyer about GRADE's salary.

sbe could not mention the KVROCK portion under any circumstances,

and that if she told anyone that GRENDE bad any connection with

the connection would be denied and GRINDE would be

terminated. She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the

level of GRENDE's overt income (GRaDE's nonthly salary fron

RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos

teaching English,

and he has since rented their house, for which

he is receiving slightly. less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Subsequently, LIEMPTY-19 was told that the Station would see to 1t

that as long as GERENDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he..

would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts

determined should be paid from his overt incone.

This, of course

was strictly an informal arrangenent,

one which

would stop the

minute GRENDE stopped receiving a

salary.

- Later, as LIDPTY-19's

position hardened and her Vindictiveness began to rule her actions,

LIEIPTY-19 was reminded by the Station that the longer it took for

an anicable solution to be reached, the greater was the chance

that GRENDE would lose his job.

If she persisted in having hin

arrested (which she succeeded in doing twice), his job would be

Jeopardized. "hile she continued to repeat sweetly that she had no

intention of causing his terination, and bad never breathed a

word to a soul about his RVROCK 2ifiliation, her attitude ras in

fact jeopardizing his job and if he lost bis job, she and the

children, as well as GIPEDE, would lose incone.

The complicating

prior to the current peroonal crisis he had been told that he

would have to work harder at a creater variety of tasks in order

to retain his position. As Headquarters is alare, he had been

given auditional tasks, and, as reported in reference, he had begun

to respoud very well.

There has never been any question of GERADEs

In certain fields.

On the other hand, there has long been doubt

about his seriousness of purpose, his

initiative, and his ambition.

The "roversnl of roles" which he describes in one of the attached

menos, which took place when he was confined to his hore as an

iLl ceper, did norc than cause domestic problens - it apparently

deprived him of the discipline of a daily job.

reputation for boing Inzy was oarned years ago.

6.

The question which

must be answered is whether or

not to terminate GERINDE.

He can be useful to the Station, but

the station has learned to got along without him.

What are the

security hazards involved?

The gencral range of his knowledge is

described in paragraph 5 of reference.

If all of this tere blown,

the loss to the Station, particularly in torns of support operations

againsts the MIHARSH target, would be considerable.

since she would feed that she had nothing to lose,

The LILYNIC coverage is a fanily enterprise

with the work equally divided among LIPTY-13, 11,-26, and -27,

who split up the hours of duty so that there is uninterrupted

coverage Mondays through Fridays from 0800 to 1800 hours, and

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays..

(Extra-hour or woel-end coverago may

be requested as necessary, and the LILYIC personnel responded to

the Station request for such extra. coverago during the AMIDRIFF

and AESEASICK cases.)

The fanily has continued to provide reports

during the reporting period on all activity centered on the front

entrance of the MHHARSH Embassy. Such coverage included,

as in the

past, daily logs on the comings and goings. of MIARSH officials,

up-to-date recording of SHHARSH license numbers, special activities

and visitors (particularly. Americans, of whom five were spotted and

reported on during the reporting period), and sone 3, 500 photographs.

As an example of the value of LILSRIC coverage, within one weok of

SECURITY

10.

Other than the security problems inherent in GIRLIDE's

personal problems, there have been no security problems during the

reporting poriod.

FUTURE PLANS

11.

for GERENDE, the Station has reached the conclusion

that he must be terminated.

This is not an easy decision to make,

nor will it bo easy to confront GERENDE with this decision.

He

has, after alli, devoted 15 years of his lifc to RVROCK.

Horever,

as noted above, in spite of his talents the Station has beon able

to getralong without his services.

Furthernore, the constant

security risk posed by his wife is, frankly, an unacceptable risk.

To try to molify her by promising her a portion of his salary is

probably unworkable in realistic terms, particularly since her

attitude has progressively hardened.

The Station, therefore,

Intends to terminate GERENDE prior to the end of FY 1970:

GERINDE's

contract calls for a ternination bonus of one month's salary per

full year:

This would come to $8,750 (USD). For various reasons,

Including

the need to preserve the security

ensuring that the termination is amicable, it will probably be

necessary,

as stated in paragraph 6, to give GERENDE about $10,000

(USD) •

Furthermore, it will be necessary to inform LIBPTY-19 of

she will undoubtedly

the termination, and'have to be given some noney herself.

to keep her from revealing what she knows,

The

Station does not believe that it would beequitable or sound from

& security point of view to use the money which GERENDE himself has

earned for this

purpose:

Therefore, while the figure will remain

negotiable, the Station believes that the sun of $2,500 (USD)

would be a reasonable anount.

Total obligations for FY 1970 in:

the LIDIPTY Project are currently estimated at slightly less than

The Project has been approved in the anount of

$38,970 (USD)

$33,000 (USD) leaving unobligated approximately $6,000 (USD). It.

is tberefore requested that the LIMPTY Project be

anended for

FY 1970 to provide an additional $8,000 (USD) to be used in the

GERINDE termination. Funds will be available at the Station.

SUBJECT: GERINDE Status Report

The presont situation of the marital conflict between GERIDE and

his wife (LIEUPTY-19) 18 as follows:

GERENDE is living at his mother's apartment at 99 Carlos

B. Zetina Street, Apartnent 9.

He has rented a three-bedroom

apartmeut at Torncl 3 corner with Pedro Antonio de los Santos whore

¡ho has stored

the

housebold effects and furniture renoved from his

former address at Ladera $9, Lomas de Bezaros.

2. The house at Ladera 39 is rented to an executive of

Chrysler Corporation International, Dr. Leon MARKIENICZ,

his wife,

and fifteen-year old daughter, all of Argentine nationality.

The

monthly rent is 6,700 pesos M/N and the contract is for two years,

beginning 1 February 1970.

3. LIEPTY-19 and the four children are apparently still

living at the rosidence

of the Netherlands' Ambassador, Baron

Sclelto Van Heemstra at Peña 360,

Jardines del Pedregal.

It seems

fairly certain they are at that address from things that the two

older children, Adriana and Chris, have said to GarENDE on the last

two occasions he has seen ther.

They have been there since

5 December 1969.

LIE:PTY-19 has denied that she has a fired address

and says that she is staying with "friends."

LIBPTY-19 is continuing to use the services of

Jas her lawyer and, through him, is pressing for even more

advantageous terms in the divorce than she had asked in November.

Please see the attached copy and translation of the latest proposal

Fraud . this charge was made by LIF!PTY-l9 and her

lawyer on l1 December 19G9, tho day after GERBiDE left the

Villa Obregon Jail aftor having spent a weel: there for

disoboying a court order.

(The court order had consisted of

an unfounded request to have GERIDE expolled from his house

and to have LIBIPTY-19 reinstated there with her father, as

the temporary custodian of the childien.

GEREDE refused then

admisson under those terms, hence disobeying the Villa Obrogon

judgo's. order, so the judgo's secrotary arbitrarily ordered,

on,the spot, a 10-day detention.

Subsequently, the Judge,

LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after seven

days and dismiss hinself from the case and divorco proceedings

as incompetont. The judge has had to face charges of

collusion from

and with

the lawyers of both partics, i.e.

Magallon and Jurado.

The chargo of fraud rests at Mosa 31a

o1. the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal.

The Public Ministry

Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERKEL Cruz.

LIEUPTY-19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for

butlding the house at ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GERENDE, knowing they were carried under

the separate proporty marriage clauseid wrongfully placed

tho property in his name only, thereby committing fraud.

Actually,

the land was bought by GERLiDE before Christnas 1965

ina complicated transaction involving three other partners:

Robert Bancroft HHITZHOUSE, John (Dick) RENNA,

and Janes

Walter HURLEY, and each of

the partners placed the property

in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their

Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen

months the deeds were issued.

LIE!PTI-19 supervised and prodded

the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware

that the property

was in GRENDE's name.

In August 1967 when

construction of the house began, LIDIPTY-19's father's noney

was used which he had deposited

for the purpose.

Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan

agreement, GERENDE has been paying it off and has receipts fron

LIEPTY-19 to show for it.

Neglect - this charge was nade by LIXPTY-19 in

Decenber 1969 at the 7° Jlegado Mixto de Pas clzining that

GARELiDE had abandoned LIElPTY-19 and the children to their fate

and that they wore utterly destituto.

GERINUE was not

notified of this charge and on 9 February after attending a

bearing at the Villa Obregon jugado (see belor), once out on

the sidewalk, Judicial police agents detained GEEIDE, tool:

bin to the Procuraduria and fran there to Lecumberri.

This

process involved being finger-printed and mugged.

The

following day GERMiDE was out on a 2,000 pesos bond and three

days later, 13 February, the justice of the peace (a woman)

fornally set GELINDE free for lack of evidonce.

GERENDE and

Magallon went back on s llarch to pick up the bond money and

6. On 14 Novembor 1969, one day after LIEIPTY-19 disappearod

hose taking the children with her, GRaNDE brought charges

against ber for ninor lesions and showed medical proot thereof.

The hearing of 9 February after which GENIDE was detained, was

called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA.

GERENDE reiterated

the charge, LIENPTY-19 denied it, the judge ruled against her,

ordered ber to prison but since the injurics were minor,

not require privation of liberty and she must only go and signin

once & week.

7 LIENPTY-19 is at present teaching school at the Edron

Academy on Caleri Strect in San Angel Inn.

The two older children

are going to school there. During the latter part of November, all

December and half of January, the children did not attend any

school.

On three occasions GERONDE has been to the school at 13:30

to try

torspeak to LIZIPTY-19 and see the children.

LIE PTY-19

has objected to this and the meetings lave been short and fruitless

except

for GERINDE learning that they are still staying at the Dutch

Ambassador's.

GEHINDE'S last visit there was on 3 March (Tuesday) •

B.. After the Villa Obregon judge disnissed himself from the

divorce proceedings, according to standard procedure, the case

went to Coyoacan and Xochimilco respectively where the judges.

In turn, excused themselves from the case and it has finally come

to reside at the lst Juzgado Civil in the D.F.

The judge is. Olda

CORREA (sonan) and has the reputation of being tough and pretty

straight.

Since LIE:PTY-19 has not given an address where divorce

suit papers can be served her, the suit has not yet been initiated

on GERENDE's part.. LIEMPTY-19, on the otherland, has not had

Although this report might normally be subnitted one month

from now, the use of Oliver G. SCANTLING tas shifted sufficiently

to warrant a special report at this time.

Our next progress report

will be submitted for the period 1 October through 31 Decomber un-

less exceptional circunstances

justify another change.

Tho fundamental change in the use of SCANTLING (who bas

suifered tho post six wecks from paratyphoid) is that he has been

divorced from routino cut-out operations and will henceforth bo

used for priority tasks and taigets which will better utilize lis

proven talents.

in late September ZARBOCK took over LICASA-1

for direct handling.

The LICASA oporation offered no particular

challengo to SCASTLING and it is doubtful that his intormediary role

offered any particular additional security in this case.

if & flap should ever develop in this case SCANTLING would just add

one more local who would have to be extricated from the tongs of the

SUBJECT

Executive Officer, Western Hemisphere

Division

WE/FI

WH/CONTRACTS

Recommendation to Amend the Contract of

Raymond H. GERENDE (Contract Agent) to

Include Improved Termination Benefits

and a Salary Increase

1.

During the past year

Station has

submitted several dispatches recommending

that paragraph

11 of Subject's contract be amended to include rew benefits

in the event of Subject's termination and'or resignation

from Agency service.

These Station recommendations have

been carefully reviewed by C/WH/Contracts and a lenorandum

was forwarded to C/WH/l containing guidance on the suggested

contract amendment.

The above information has been reviewed again by

AC/WHl/1, and we

are requesting approval for the following

amendments to paragraph ll of Subject's contract:

: 4)

In the event of GERENDE's termination by the

Agency he will receive three month's pay plus one

month's pay for every full year of service since

18 March 1955, calculated at the rate applicable at

tea at the rate ap

the time of termination.

•B) In the event of resignation and/or voluntary

retirement upon 60 days notice the following schedule

would be acceptable to the Agency as being in its best

interests and a payment considered as a terminal payment

as follows:

(1)

Less than 15 years service (prior to March

1970) 20 days pay for each full year of service.

(2) Over 15 years service,

but less than 20

years service (prior 18 March 1975) three months

salary plus 20 days pay for each full year of service.

SECRET,

SEGLET.

(3) Over 20 years

service, three monthg

salary plus one month's pay for each full year

of

service.

(4) All payments above are to be calculated

at the rate of pay applicable at the time of

retirement and/or resignation.

3. As to the points raised by WH/Contracts in their

Memorandum concerning this amendment we would like to note

the following:

A) . GERENDE 1s

working for the

Agency since 18

himself to

Maren 1955 under an MOC, who considers

be a "career" employee of the Agency, and

whose initial local employment for cover purnosee une

largely notional under a system of

GERENDE received no income or benefits from this "cover"

position which terminated due to the demise of

the

company on 31 December 1967. GERENDE'g other "cover"

is sell generated in that he gives English lessons in

his spare time to middle management

employed by American owned companies

His income benefits from this

"covert

are minimal, but

suffice for satisfying acquaintances as to the source

of his income.

In conclusion, GERENDE ig considered by

the Station to be a full time contract agent,

on call

at all times for operational activity.

During the past two years GERENDE has served as

a principal agent handler for a sensitive fixed sur

velllance project; has carried out unilateral recruitment

approaches

against the Cuban target; has been used in

special support investigations; and

is presently being

considered for use in special

operations of a sensitive

nature.

A review of

the progress reports in GERENDE'S

operations discloses that the Station has been more than

satisfied with GERENDE's performance and is anxious to

take advantage of his full potential.

GERENDE's last

salary increase from $6,000 to $6,500 per annum was granted

in July 1965, and there have been no increases since.

Since the Field Station/Headquarters negotiation over

amendment of paragraph 1l of GERENDE's contract has been

in progress for over

one year and a half, we are of the

belief that the Station wished to finalize this amendment

prior to requesting a

salary increase for the agent.

It

is therefore requested, considering the above, that approval

be given for a salary

increase from $6,500 to $7,000 ef-

fective 1 August 1969, and that his contract be so amended.

The Field Station will be queried for their approval via

cable prior to implementation of the contract amendment.

Ravrond H. GERINDE's Cover Status

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERLACES

In preparing a recent request for

amendment to Raymond

H. GERIND&'s contract, it occurred to us that it would probably be

useful to bring Headquarters up-to-date on GERLNDE's cover status.

As a full-time contract agent, GEKEND is on call at all times for

operational activity.

His cover activity not only provides hin wito

the necessary flexibility,

it is also solid enough

to provide hin

with a plausible explanation of his existence and his incono.

2.

GERINDE has two major cover activities. One is the teaching

öt English, mainly to middle-managenent personnel of American-owned

This is done on a regular basis for a few

OSRA

hours each day and earns GERUNDE an income of about 5000 pesos per

month.

His second cover activity, and one which is largely a cover

and not really activity,

ts working as a salesnan for IDiN A. GERaNDA

actually earns only about 500 pesos per month

irom this, but this lact

is a closely guarded secret.

GERINDk's acquaintances assume: that a

good part of his income

comes from this cover.

Previously, GERENDE

CEASA

had been able to "prove" a total income of about 8000 pesos per month,

ostensibly from IDay.

IDEN B was owned by LISTERINE, and for years

Te had carried GEFEND:

on his payroll as an independent salesman on

commission. He would ostensibly pay GERENDE a certain arount of

noney, and

IDEN B's accountant would duly file income tax returns

and

Social

security based

on this alleged payment.

IDEN B would also

pay whatever taxes were called for by the statements filed. This

is quite common in

,, as everybody

gains:

the company because its declared profit is lower than it

really is and, therefore, subject to less

tax, and the individual

because he is

ordinarily

given a kickback for allowing his name to

be used (or in GRINDE's case, because it provided cover).

3.: All this ended on 31 December 1967,

when LISTERINE

sold

IDEN B

to IDIN A.

For a while thereafter, GRINDE paid taxes caly

on the money he actually earned with IDEN

A, which was, as stated,

about 500 pesos per month.

As of 1 July 1968, however, LISTERINE

rranged, at GRINDE'S request, to have his accountant

(who continued

to handle GRENDE'S taxes as a

favor to LISTERINE to lump together

all of GRINDE's earnings (from teaching as well ag IDEN A)

"professional earnings" and to file returns for GERENDE which included

the total amount.

This is not quite as satisfactory ag the old

arrangement (among other things GRINDE must now pay his own taxes)

but for cover purposes it is entirely adequate. Other than LISTERINE

and the accountant, no one knows that GERINDE's ostensible earnings

have dropped, and, as far as we know, LISTERINE is the only person

who 1a aware

of GERINDE's tie with WOFIRM.

GERENDE's contract to provide him with a certain amount of job security

2.

First,

Ref B raised the point that there harl been no efficiendy

reports written on GERENDE or "evidence of outstanding periormance."

GERLNDE's performance has been evaluaied regularly within the context

of the regular LIMPTY Proiect progress reports, and a

review of the

past several reports will denonstrate that the

Station has been more

than satisfied with GERLNDe's periornance

and is anxious to take

however,

The Station does not believe,.

that "evidence of nutstanding perfornance" should be a

prerequisite

for the type of contrart

anendment being requested.

It

is perfectly true, as pointed out in Ref B, that the Station had gone

on record in 1959

that GERINDE should not be paid & termination

bonus if he should resig! simply to net the extra money or to pursue

another career.

By now, however, GERENDE has cast his lot with

undoubtedly wish to reard his long years of loyal service with a

generous termination

payment.

He has earned it,

and only termination

fron receiving it.

3.

law (it is the law,

not custon) says that an employce

who is fired nust be paid three months"

salary plus twenty days'

salary for each full year employed by the company at the pay rate

existing at the time of separation.

GERINDE's current cover company

adberes to this formula.

Since GERENDE'S termination clause has

always read that he would be paid a full month's salary for every

year of service (iu the event of his termination oy NOFIR!), we would

not want to change that, and in fact we wish to add to it the three

months' pay guaranteed by

law. At the sase time, we do see

some virtue in the suggestion in paragraph 3 oi Red B that tull

retirement benefits (in the event of GRINDE's resignation) would

apply only after 20 years'

service, with lesser benefits until then.

Our suggestion would be that in the event of his resignation prior to

15 full years of service (1.e. prior to 18 March 1570) he be paid

twenty days' salary for each lull year,

that alter lo yoars but prior

to 20 he be paid this amount plus three full months' salary, and that

aiter 20 years he be paid three months' salary plus ono months' salary

for every full year.

It is true,

of course,

that

law does

not make any provision for payment of a termination bonus to an

employee who resigns, but most enlightened compadies have some sort

of retirement program, and, as Ref B correctly points out,

"working

for WOFIRM is a very special case and deserves exceptional financial

consideration." In the case of GERENDE,.

we are not attempting to

establish any pattern.

This is a special case (as are nost) and the

Station merely wishes to Insure that GERENDE, who has made HOMIRN a

career without receiving any career benetits

in return,

is rewarded

for his loyalty and is given

some incentive for the future.

GERENDE

Is not without his faults, and he is being adequately compensated for

the work he performs, but

we cannot expect to get nore out of him

without showing bim greater respect.

4.

The Station requests, therefore,

that the following amendment

be made in paragraph 11 o1 GERENDE's contract:

In the event

of GERENDE'S termination by WOFIRS, he will

receive three months' pay plus one month's pay for every full

year-of service since 18 larch 1955, calculated at the rate

applicable at the time of termination.

b.

GERINDE's resignation upon 60 days' notice will be

accepted by WOFIRl as being in its best interest, and GERENDE

• will be eligible for terminal payment according

to the following

formula: Prior to 18 March 1970, GERINDE will recelve. 20 days'

pay for

every full year of service since 18 March 1955; after 18

March 1970 but prior to 18 March 1975, GERENDE will receive

three months' pay plus 20 days for every full year since 18

March 1955; after 18 March 1975 GRINDE will receive three months

pay plus one

month for every full year of serrice since 18 March

1955.

All payments are to be calculated at the rate applicable

at the time of resignation.

5. Paragraph 10 (D) will, of course, remain in force.

6.

Ref D asked that GERENDE's contract be extended for another

year without change.

We assume that this has been done, although we

have

not been notified

During the reporting period, the project's principal

agent, Raymond H. GERENDE,

was assigned additional tasks, aimed

at broadening his uscfulness to the Station.

These tasks

Included spotting and assessment as well as the handling of a

recruited agent, ERFAIN-3.* GERENDE did well, and it 1g believed

that a new dimension has been opened for him, and by the sane

token,

the Station has, in effect, gained a new asset.

The

LIEMPTY baso houses continued to produce at their usual rate

and with their usual effective support to Station REDTOP oper

ations.

The LIMITED Base House and its operator, LIENPTY-6,

were terminatod on 31 May 1968.

Termination was decided upon

partly to save money and partly because advancing age had measur

ably decreased the reliability and cilectiveness of LIEIPTY-6°g

vouse to give us the samo total hours of coverage as LILyRic

LIENPTY-26 was rehired, which permitted the LILYRIC Bage

and LIMITED had together in the past.

2. During the reporting period,

the case officer has been

meeting GRINDE an average of three

times per week.

Nectings

are usually pre-arranged, at various sites and times. Neetings

average 20

to 30 minutes.

GERENDE turns over to the case

officer noratives, prints, logs, and other reports which he bas

picked up from the base houses since the previous meeting,

alone with brief contact reports on his meetings with base

house representatives.

Reports on other operational activities

are also turned in and discussed, and GRINDE 1s given instruc

tions, notes for the base houses, and negatives for any enlarge

ments which may be desired by the Station.

Also, LIENVOY tapes

and transcripts are exchanged at each meeting.

April 1968 left the Station without &

BEDOX transcriber.

As a temporary solution, pending the return

of LIACUTE-1 or the recruitment of another BEDOX transcriber,

GERENDE's wife, LIENPTY-19, has been hired at the rate of 31.50

pesos per hour

to transcribe the Spanish language portions of the

3.

GERENDE has the direct agent-handling responsibility for

the

following LIE.PTY agents: LIE.PTY=4 (photo-processor; net

twice per week); LIEMPTY-G (LIMITED; met once per week until

termination); LIEUPTY 13, 14, 26, and 27 (LILYRIC; LIEMPTY-13

normally met twice per week -- in his absence LIE:PTY:27 makes

meetings); and LIENPTY-9 (LICALLA; met twice per week).. Ho is

responsible for directing their work, paying them, and handling

all or the administrative problems which may develop. To judge

results, GERENDE has excellent rapport with these agents

and is able to get a consistently high purformance rate from

then - particularly LICILlA and LILYRIC personnel.

A: As noted in reference, GERENDE was employed by the

MITRAVEL committee,

which ve found a useful side benefit.

His HRAVEL activity during the reporting period has been minimal,

but we expect it to start picking up again... GERENDE has con-

ducted a few discreet inquiries and investigations for us within

the KHRAVEL complex, and wo have instructed him to try to get

en assignment which will keep him as close to the EJSTEAL

delegation as possible.

Reference also pointed out that GERENDE had performed

nicely in the cultivation and development of an operational

lead, and that the Station planned to give GERENDE more of the

Same. Furthernore, GERINDE's standing assignments (LIEPTY

base houses, AHRAVEL activity, and occasional support o JIROD

requirements) were not challenging enough or occupying enough

Of GERENDE's tire.

GERENDE is. rather firmly committed to

WOFIR by virtue of the fact that he has worked for NOFIRM for

over 13 years and has no other outside employment of any.

By the same token, he was,

through no fault of

bis own, doing less work

for WOFIRy than at any time in his

GERENDE's operational exposure through the years

dictated more and more restrictions on his activity, for sound

security reasons. The solution to GERIDE'S problem (lack of

pronising future) and the Station's (not betting its money's

worth) seemed to be to give GERENDS additional tasks which he

could handle under suitable cover and with due regard to security

precautions.

Since most of GRENDE's support activities had

been against the FJSTEAL target, particular care would have to

be taken in cormitting him further in this direction..

decided, therefore,

that his principal retooling would be in

• non-FJSTEAL field.

G. In line with the above reasoning, GEREiDE was introduced

on 17 February 1968.

The idea was that

GERANDE would be trained to assist

GERINDE'S principal

duty thus far has been to tave over the handling of EAPAIN-3,

close supervision and guidance.

perforned quite creditably in this task. He seens interested

in the sork and has learned quickly.

On the other hand, an

apparently ingrained habit o! procrastination has resulted in

dilatory reporting.

If GERLIDE can overcome this (and both case

officers are working hard to teach GERENDE the importance of

prompt and complete reporting) there seems to be cvery reason

to believe GERENDE 11l develop into a competent agent handler.

GERENDE was also given the task of locating and developing

assignsent, he did an excellent job of meeting the girl and

Gaining her confidence.

It is quite likely that he could have

recruited the girl as

an access agent against AERODINT, but as

this point was reached another operation against AERODENT was

launched and it was not felt. that attempting to recruit the girl

would serve any useful purpose, for the time

being at

(among other things, there was

no indication

least

that she had had

any contact with AERODENT for some months).

The only flaw in

GERENDE's performance was the time it took him to get around to

doing the job.

It should be mentioned, however, that at the

Same time GERINDE had a number of pressing personal matters to

attend to, including overseeing the completion of his new house,

which he finally moved into on 10 March 1968, even though

construction is still not entirely completed.

Among other assignments completed by GERENDS in the

reporting period were the renting of an apartment for use as a

listening post; and initiating a relationship with a Russian

translator working for the KERAVEL committee.
