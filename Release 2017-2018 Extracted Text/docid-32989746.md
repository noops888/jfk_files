Mr. Patterson obtained copies of FBI files relating to

your reference.

In contacting the Committee in this regard, I was advised

that "Mr. Patterson's testimony before the Committee was

not responsible for the recommendation by the Committee to

the Department of Justice that Mr. John Ray be investigated

for perjury before the Committee."

In view of the above, I would appreciate your review of this

matter and your comments concerning the memorandum which

cites Mr. Patterson's testimony as being responsible for the

Dear Mr. Webster:

During my association with both the F.B.I. and House Select Committee on

Assassinations I was involved in and saw certain investigative techniques

employed by these agencies which I believe to be of questionable nature.

I question both the legality and ethics of some of these practices.

I am bringing this matter to your attention because i have nopes,

will recognize the gross improprieties involved by these investigative

agencies.

Enclosed is a copy of a statement I have written which details these

techniques used by these agencies.

I have also written a letter similar to this one to Attorney General

Griffin Bell.

I have written letters to Congressman Louis Stokes, Ohio, Chairman of

the HSCA, none have been answered. I have called his office and my

calls have not been returned.

I have written G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel for HSCA and my letters

have gone

unanswered.

Mr. Blakey returned

one of my phone calls and

to every statement he responded, "no comment".

I called Congressman Samuel Devine of Ohio to make him aware of my allega-

tions about the HSCA staff. Instead of returning my call, Mr. Devine

called the HSCA investigators and told them to contact me.

The same

investigative staff I had made my allegations about.

In most of the letters and/or phone calls I volunteered to talk to the

members of Congress and/or the Congressional members of the HSCA to

make them aware of the investigative practices of their committee. My

offers have not been accepted:

Out of twelve Congressmen on the HSCA, four have pulled away from the

HSCA entire findings and six out of the twelve have pulled away from

the fourth shot theory in the Kennedy assassination.

The HSCA has wasted 18 months and 5 million dollars and is now preparing

to release some

volumes of findings on the King assassination and

some 28 volumes

on

the Kennedy assassination.

Stoner in fact has nothing to do with bringing Patterson and Geppert to

Atlanta but it was entirely the HSCA that did.

It is also of interest that during the September 15th interview the H.s.C.A.

held with Patterson in New York City, Mr. James Wolf of the H.S.C.A. stated

that if Patterson was in fact an informer for the H.S.C.A.,

It was later determined that the breakout attempt was to occur

around the 17th of May,

According to Pete Baetz, a

special meeting was held in Washington with Attorney General

Bell, FBI head William Webster, HSCA Chief Counsel G.

Robert Blakey,

and a fourth party to

examine the tape recordings,

stolen letters and mapjand it was decided at that meeting to

put Jerry Ray under 24 hour FBI surveillance.

The tape recordings,

if not illegal, were certainly contrary to the HSCA own rules

and regulations which strickly forbid any electronic surveillance

and of course, the stolen papers were in possession

of those at the meeting. (On Sept. 15, 1978 in a speech in St.

Iouis Griffen Bell was highly critical of Mitchells role as

Attorney General under the Nixon Administration in the handling

of the Watergate

tapes.)

--Hair samples from Jerry Ray. chief Deputy Counsel Michael C.

Eberhardt would contact me to verify expenses and to check on any new vital

information which I might have uncovered.

No new evidence linking Jerry

Ray to Raoul, J.B. Stoner as the money man, or any other new evidence was

ever uncovered.

I laughed with Pete Baetz and Michael C. Eberhardt on numerous occassions

when they would call Jerry Ray and tell him that he should not leave Atlanta

because the HSCA was going to recall him to testify again any day. It

was a never-ending game of harassment to keep Jerry Ray from going to

Chicago to look for a job.

The HSCA had no intentions of recalling Jerry

Ray until the later part of the year, (November), and they were successful

in keeping Jerry Ray unemployed.

On one occassion, I talked to Michael C. Eberhardt at about 2:00 in the

morning and in the course of the conversation I asked him if he had

listened to

the audio tapes and watched the video tapes of Jerry Ray,

and he said that as of then, 'he hadn't had time to as yet'.

In August, Mark Lane became aware of my involvement with HSCA and the HSCA

became aware of his knowledge.

My code name was changed from Davia Rockers

to Carl. Drake.

Pete Baetz said that if I wanted they could probably get

the Justice Dept. to give me a change of identity and relocate me.

Baetz also 'suggested'that I might have a press conference and expose infor-

mation on the Ray Case, Mark Lane's sex life, and other information which

Baetz would give me.

The HSCA arranged a press conference with the New

Jork Times for me on August 6, 1978 and postponed it until the seventh

because of the publicity of the Pope's death.

On August 5, 1978, Baetz gave me a handful of notes to use at the press

conference dealing with information on Raoul, Lane being homosexual, and

other scurrillous information.

In August 7, 1978, Horrock of the New York Times called me and made

arrangements for the press conference to be held later that afternoon.

Later, Horrock denied ever talking to me until I produced a tape recording

of the conversation, then he ignored the situation.

At noon of the seventh

Anthony Marro of the New York Times arrived in St. Louis to interview me

but when it became obvious that I was not having the press conference which.

the HSCA had set up for me, but instead 'my own', Marro engaged in a brief

shoving match with Mark Lane and Donald Freed. Marro quickly returned to

his room and called someone and was overheard saying, "I blew it".

reporters present who knew about the press conference as mine, not the

exclusive leak set up by the HSCA, were Chuck Neff, KTVI-TV ABC, John

Auble, KSD-TV NBC, James Polk, NBC News Washington, and reporters from

In January of 1978, Jim Haggerty of the St. Louis office of the FBI met

me at a restaurant to warn me that the House Select Committee on Assass-

inations,

(HSCA), would be calling on me to testify regarding the work I

had done in the early 170's for the FBI.

The evening after the meeting

I wrote Haggerty a letter telling him to keep me out of it. I had done

nothing for the FBI since 171 or 172 and knew nothing that could possibly

help the HSCA.

In early February of 1978, I was approached by two HSCA investigators,

Conrad 'Pete' Baetz and Mel Waxman.

They asked if I would do the same

for the HSCA that I had done for the FBI.

I told them that I was planning

a vacation to Florida and that I was not interested in becoming involved.

the HSCA would pick up the expenses for the trip.

I asked if they would

Baetz would hand me notes

with questions to ask during these

conversations.

Baetz would take the tapes with him and regularly replace

them with new government issue tapes.

Baetz spent between a 3 hour up to sometimes four or five hours a day

usually four or five days a week at my house watching pornographic video

tapes, playing my pinball machine, shooting the bull, and even having

intercourse with one of the porno

The investigative techniques

employed by the HSCA certainly left no stone unturned!!

Toward the middle of February, Baetz had made the final arrangements for

the trip to Florida. My girlfriend, her two children, and mysell leit for

Florida and of course stopped in Atlanta to 'visit' Jerry Ray,

Stoner, and

At the time the HSCA was trying to link Stoner as the money man,

and Jerry Ray as Raoul.

We spent four days or so in Atlanta and were

unable to turn up any new evidence!

From there we continued the trip to

Daytona Beach to meet with both Mel Waxman and Baetz.

The 'purpose' of them

traveling to Daytona was to tell me to get hair samples from Jerry Ray, Stoner,

The meeting in Daytona with Baetz and Waxman was actually for

a few days in sunny Florida rather than for any investigative purpose.

In discussions both before and after the trip, Baetz, Waxman,

and myself,

searched for reasons to return to Florida, and elsewhere south, and use

the Ray-King case again and again for mini-vacations.

figure out how to carry the investigation to the Virgin Islands, which

seemed like a nice place for an investigation.

On the return trip from Florida we once again spent several days in

"visiting' Ray, Stoner, and Fields.

My girlfriend got hair samples

from a hair brush in the bathroom of the NSRP headquarters where Ray and

Stoner lived.

She had even searched the bottom of the tub and sink,

around the toilet, and the shelves in the medicine cabinet. The samples

of hair that she did find on this trip were lost on the trin back home

to St. Louis.

Jerry Ray and I were scheduled to appear in Washington,D.C. to testify before

the committee in early March but were both rescheduled in mid-April because

health problems which made it impossible for me to travel.

Jerry Ray was re-

scheduled with me because the H.S. C. A wanted us to travel to washington to-

gether so that we would have plenty of time to talk, but, more importantly

share rooms while in Washington for the sole purpose of searching his luggage

and personal belongings for

'clues' that might be helpful in the investigation.

I was told by Pete Baetz to copy anything I could on the copier in the lobby of

the hotel and mail it to his P.O. Box in Wood River, Ill.

Some of the things found and interpreted by the HSCA were:

--Letters from James Earl Ray to Jerry Ray which possibly listed

subjects which Jerry Ray should testify about.

•- A map of Brushy Mountain Prison with notes on it planning another

breakout attempt by James Earl Ray in James Earl Rays on handwriting.

During 1968 or 1969, I joined the 'Minutemen' organization.

The M.M. is

a right-wing proup with headquarters in Norborne, Missouri, whose leader

is Robert, B. DePugh,

I joined the groun to learn more about it because

my interest had been aroused by numerous articles concerning the group

in the St. louis 'Post-Dispatch'.

I was very interested

During my high school and college years

in politics and worked for several candidates in

various elections.

My interest in the M.M. was waning as I found out more about the

but within a few months after joining I was approached by an agent of

the FBI who asked if I would simply send my correspondence from the M.M.

After several months of forwarding mail with lessening contact

from the agent, I began to lose interest in that also.

Once again, a few months later, I was again contacted by another agent of

the FBI,

Stanley F. Jacobsen.

We met and Jacobsen told me the first

had retired and that my file had been turned over to him. He asked me to

resume the mailings and

Box.

address them to a Bruce Hudman in care of a P.O.

My code name would be 'Phil'. My M.M. identification number was

105-823.

I was married in 1970 and was given permission to tell my wife of my

activities with the FBI.

more

time passed, the work with the FBI became

and more time-consuming.

I was instructed not only to show more interest in the M.M. group but

also told to join other organizations such as the White Citizens' Council

of St. Louis!

and the 'National States Rights Party' out of Savannah,

I was given membership and subscription fees including appli

cations for the various groups.

More and more time and now trips was spent cultivating relationships

with these organizations.

Trips included:

-An expense paid trip to Kansas City, Missouri to see 'Hair!

which was banned in St. Louis for the sole purpose of putting

me in western Missouri which would give me the excuse to stop

by Norborne, Mo. to meet the leaders of the M.M., Robert Taylor.

Taylor,

was temporary head of the M.M. because

De Pugh was in jail

of Chicago' for gun-running. Taylor also enjoyed the

weekend at government expense.

--An expense paid trip to a resort area of Arkansas for a racist

rally to which I drove and took three St. Louis area racists

attendence would have been questionable if transportation

had not been provided.

-Trip to outstate Illinois for a racist rally.

-- An expense paid trip to St. Louis from Chicago for Robert Taylor

so that Taylor would not miss a press conference that had been

arranged for him

at the Bel-Air Hotel in St. Louis so that

the BI could monitor conference so they would know where M.M.

(all arrangements had been made but Taylor

had run out of money for the trip, so the FBI had to contribute.,

--An expense paid trip to Savannah,

Georgia, (with a sidetrip to

Florida for vacation) to meet Dr. Edward Fields, editor of the

'Thunderbolt'; J. B. Stoner, head of the Mi.S.R.P. and perennial

rubernatorial candidate from the state of Georgia; and Jerry Ray,

brother of James Earl Ray.

In the FBI report

of that trip, (Savannah), it shows Jerry Ray

stating that

James Earl Ray 'did pull the trigger'.

The original page of that report

quoted Jerry as sayings

at different times to different people, that his

rother did pull the trigger,

that he didn't and maybe le will Thogent,-

Jacobsen, came by my house as he sometimes did, read the report, and told

us to pull the page, retype it with all the contradictory statements removed,

and to leave in just the one statement and fill the rest of the page with

'filler' so that, the report would not look doctored.

The FBI still insists that an informers identity is never revealed to any-

one without the approval of the informer, but yet the House Select Committee

on Assassinations learned of my idenity through the FBI.

The FBI files on me in St. Louis number approximately 100 to 150 pages

the files in hashington number approximately 1000 pages.

The HSCA interviewed me in New York City in the office of my attorney.

Melvin Wulf, on September 15, 1978.

In the oth day of September, 1978.

the HSCA cleared itself of any wongdoing, nine days before they talked

to me or examined any of my evidence.

To this day they have never even

contacted one of approximately a dozen witnesses I have to back up my

They have labeled me an "affidavit witness" which is partic-

ularly interesting since I have never signed an affidavit with or for the

They have paid me for a portion of my expenses but yet deny that

I ever did anything for them.

I have tape recordings of:

--Pete Baetz arranging press conference.

--Pete Baetz assuring me that I would be paid for my work.

-Horrock's telephone call to me arranging for Marro to come

to St. Louis.

-Diane discussing her sexual relations with Baetz (relations

took place during investigative time).

I have affidavits signed by witnesses who saw or heard:

-Pete Baetz give me information to use at press conference.

-Pete Baetz replace cassettes that were used to tape phone

calls with new government issue tapes.

-Pete Baetz monitor, using earphones, the phone calls while

hey were being taped.

-Pete Baetz help install the listening devices

-Pete Baetz make arrangements for me to be paid for work done for

LoC.

-Pete Baetz and Menhuesman fellne me to retrieve hair samples

from Jerry Ray, J.B.

which might be interesting to investigation.

--Pete Baetz making arrangements with me to be sure to share róoms

with jerry Ray while in Washington for the purpose of searching

Jerry Ray's personal belongings and copying anything which might

be of investigative value.

On August

11,1978, I was given a polygraph test administered by Chris

Gugas, past President of the American Polygraph Association, of which the

results were favorable.

of power by the HSCA is demonstrated by an FBI file dated

August 2, 1978 which shows that the HSCA notified the FBI that the testimony

of Oliver Patterson Cata Clarencex Haynes), "was responsible for establishing

the fact that John hay (another brother of James Earl Ray) perjured himself

As a result of this perjury,

John Ray's parole on a bank robbery conviction has been revoked'.

John fay was jailed on the perjury charge for 6 month's, almost all of

which was spent in solitary awaiting the hearing.

The hearing, came and

went without the HSCA producing any evidence to support their charge.

In a letter to my Congressman, Harold Volkmer, from G. Robert Blakey,

Blakey denies that my testimony was responsible for the perjury charge

but yet the FBI files show that Blakey's HSCA specifically cited my

testimony as the reason for the perjury charge.

In a letter to Volkmer,

I questioned which statement from Blakey did he believe. Volkmer has

since turner the matter over to the FBI.

I have called on the United States Attorney in St. Louis, Robert Kingsland,

and showed him proof of my allegations. He said that he could turn the

matter over to the FBI but then they would be investigating themselves

He also said that noone much cared about possible civil

rights violations involving any of the Rays. He stated that Hoover was a

I mailed Senator Ted Kennedy a letter with numerous attachments and have

received no response. (Kennedy is Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Comm.)

I mailed Speaker of the House Tip O'Neil a similar letter with attachments

and received a post paid envelope asking me to contribute to his next

campaign.
