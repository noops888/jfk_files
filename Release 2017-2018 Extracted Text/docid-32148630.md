ReBuairtel 5/26/64, with which was furnished a copy

of a translation of a Mexican Government document furnished to U

the Bureau by Mexico City airtel of 5/12/64.

ReBuairtel called attention to the reference in the

translation to a list of reservations said to be in lieu of a

passengers' list of the Transportes Frontera Bus Line. This

reservation list mentioned in the translation is the same as

the manifest of Transportes Frontera Line (Exhibit D106) on

which the name "OSHED" was manifested in seat No. 4. As has

been pointed out previously to the Bureau, officials of

Transportes Frontera indicate that this list is utilized both

for reservations and for assistance in the accounting office

of the company.

Mexican Immigration Inspector JOSE MARIO DEL VALLE,

who assisted in the preparation of the document which was

translated, has advised that there is no list of passengers

related. to the Transportes Frontera bus trip on 10/2-3/63

from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo in addition to the reservation

list mentioned. Previous investigation by this office confirms

this statement of Inspector DEL VALLE.

The so-called reservation

5/26/64 transmitted to

the Bureau copieslof the final official

report of the Mexican Government prepared in the Secretariat

of Foreign Relations and furnished to the Embassy here.

This

airtel pointed out certain discrepancies which existed

between

this final official report

and the letter of 5/6/64 prepared

by Acting Secretary of Gobernacion LUIS ECHEVERRIA, the

translation of which letter was furnished with reBuairtel of

5/26/64.

The latter instructed the Legat to furnish his views

as to the course of action to be taken concerning the

dissemination of the translation if the final official report

of the Mexican Government differed in substance from the

vas preparec

information plained in the letter for which the translation

As was

pointed out in Mexico City airtels of 5/12/64

and 5/26/64, neither the final official report of the Mexican

Government nor the ECHEVERRIA letter appeared to contain

information which had not been previously reported to the

No apparent purpose would be served in furnishing the

President's Commission with a translation of the ECHEVERRIA

letter for use in making a comparison of it with the final

official report of the Mexican Government which was forwarded

to the Commission through the State Department by the Embassy

here. At the same time to do so might result in the compromise

".of MEX-192, who furnished a copy of the ECHEVERRIA letter to

this office on

a very confidential basis without the knowledge

of ECHEVERRIA."

Unless the Bureau perceives some very strong

reason for furnishing the Commission with a translation of the:

ECHEVERRIA letter, it is recommended that this not be done.
