TESTIMONY OF JOHN S. D. EISENHOWER

Mr. Schwarz. MI. Eisenhower, I understand from your

conversations that you want to make a statement, and

as I told

you, we always go through a procedural matter

in the first

place, which is, first would you just state your full name and

address for the record.

MI. Eisenhower.

House Road, Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.

MI. Schwarz. And then the second thing is, as I told

you, we always ask all our witnesses if they know that they

have a right to counsel, and so forth.

Mr. Eisenhower. I am aware of that, sir:

MI. Chairman, my opening statement or my whole statement

is first of all to say how delighted I am and how complimented

I am that you all allowed me to come here:

My motivation, of course, is that I understand that a

lot of the testimony

that is before this Committee is getting

nature, and perhaps

I could throw a little bit of light and make a consideration

to it.

WARDS A

PAUL

I am most appreciative to have the opportunity to come,

as I know you all are busy.

I realize that in a situation like this the only prob-

"lem that I am addressing, of course, is the possible Presiden-

• ' tial involvement in any planning, say, the latter part of 1960,

planning for the assassination of any individuals, not

only thinking in terms of heads of states or governments, but

1

any individual at all, Presidential involvement.

I realize that I would be somewhat of a suspect witness

in a case like this, being the son of the President at

that time.

:..

But I would justlike to give a couple of facts that might have

, a bearing.

The facts are that to a very lagge extent throughout

our adult years my father -- 1s that the correct terminology? -

confided in me to a very large degree. As an example,

in July of 1945, the

evening he returned from

the Pottsdar

Conference to Frankfurt, he told me about a new bomb they

had invented thatmight shorten the war but which might have

some terrible consequences, namely, the atomic bomb, which

was dropped sometime after that.

Of course, you realize that this was secret. Whether ar

was correct

in telling me things like that or not I don't

know. But it is factual.

YOu have seen M.. Gordon Gray, you have seen General

2

Goodpaster. And when you have me as a third of the trilogy, you

will have all of the witnesses who were staff officers who had

access to the President in the latter half of 1960 on national

5

security affairs.

7

As such, I was told by my father of the U-2 in 1956. This

is four years before it went down. From the time of reporting

to the White House in 1958, as General Goodpaster's assistant

I was shown the flight plans of the U-2 up until the time that

the U-2 went down May 1 of 1960.

I say all this only to establish that the relationship

1: between my father and I in confidences was. very close, par-

1:" ticularly during that period. And that is my first point.

And the second is pure and simple, thatnothing -- and,

i of course, my exposure to the White House -- can be construed

!' in my mind in the remotest way to mean any Presidential knowl-

7: edge of or concurrence in any

assassination plots or plans.

' I wouldn't say for one moment that there weren't plenty of

plans being dreamed up in various agencies. I was a member of

the Joint War Plans in the Army Staff, Army General Staff

we made contingency plans

for all sorts of things. Like the

:: umpire said, they ain't nothing until I call them. And to

:

the very best of my knowledge absolutely nothing came-to the

White House.

contemplating requesting this opportunity that I would trust

that I haven't gotten so blase over the years that something

like an assassination plan would have slipped my memory.

That is the end of my statement, sir.

5

The Chairman. Mr. Schwarz, do you have any guestions?

6

Mr. Schwarz.. Your opinion is that if your father had

7

been told about any CIA activity with respect to Mr. Castro,

and specifically with respect to Mr. Castro and the Mafia,

" that he would have told you, and that your testimony is that

j'? he did not tell you?

!:! . MI. Eisenhower. My testimony is that he did not.

1: " My conjecture, based

on the other things he has told me, is

i." that in all likelihood he would have. But that is only

:; conjecture.

Mr. Schwarz. I think when we talked on the phone you

said something further in support of that conclusion, unless

"I am mixing up something that General Goodpaster said, which

had to do with your father's attitude toward the control of

the Central Intelligence Agency after the U-2 incident.

Mr. Eisenhower.

My guess is that you got that from

General Goodpaster. But General Paster

and I - after all,

I sat as far away from him as I am from you for two and a

half years, or 27 months, going in -- either he or I went

in to see the President when we were buzzed for on those

things. So, quite logically I think that General Goodpaster's

L'"

and my thinking might be very much the same. And, of course,

after the U-2, when you have something. like that, I think

it is only natural that you keep a little bit of a jaundiced

eye on the organization which has done this.

So we made a real point, never to let anyone, even

6

the Secretary of State, get in to see the President unless

7

one of us were there.

We were not according this privilege with Secretary

John Foster Dulles.

MI. Schwarz. In the earlier years?

MI. Eisenhower. But those are earlier years than the

:: years we are covering here.

1:

When Secretary Herter took over in the spring of

14

1959, General Goodpaster and I tried an experiment.

We

it tiptoed in behind the Secretary of State when he went into the

Oval office and we got away with it. And from that time on

we monitored everything.

I saw the document we talked about on the telephone,

I saw the document that indicated 10 minutes where the Presi-

dent was alone with Allen Dulles on the 25th of November

::.

1960. If I had not been made aware of that, or discovered

it myself going through

those same black books that you have.

if I had not been aware of that, I would have testified to thi

i. i

best of my knowledge and belief that the President never

saw Allen Dulles alone.

MI. Schwarz. We also talked on the telephone about --

I told you the nature of the testimony, We have heard from

an officer of the Central Intelligence Agency who said that

he had no knowledge of such a meeting, but that he assumed

that Allen Dulles would have spoken to your father about the

Maila activity, and that the nature of that conversation

would have been speaking in riddles or circumlocutious form.

And I believe we discussed your opinion as to whether

9

your father would tolerate a discussion which was circumlo-

cutious. It is a confusing question, because your opinion

is that no such conversation occurred. But getting down to

1:

testing the way in which the person who has testified descrihed

irit, and the elements he has put into it, can you cast any

?.;

light on that?

MI. Eisenhower. Now, we are getting into an area of

In! conjecture in which my testimony would be suspect.

"It is very much conjecture. And I would like to point out

that if I were in the position of anybody in this type of

operation, I would certainly have assumed, rightly or wrongly,

:

that I had some sort of authority from above before I went

ahead and did such a thing. I think it is only logical

that this gentleman who was testifying would assume that he

:.:

had some

authority. That is a pretty big burden to take on

yourself. You

say, look, it was my

idea, and I just went ahi..:

and did it.

cor,ne 19188 2021548-6000

That is one part of the conjecture.

2.

The other part of the conjecture having to do with my

father's way of doing things, I think I could say with a

certain amount of assurance that he was never cute, cute

was one thing he was not.

And being circumlocutious and

6

saying one thing and winking at you was not his way of doing

it. Something might get past him. But that is not the way

you make decisions to mount assassination plots, and

...

especially the details of it, no way.

]

MI. Schwarz. Do you have an opinion from your knowledza

i: " of your father as to how he would react to any suggestion

1:: " that the U.S. ought to employ the Mafia?

MI. Eisenhower. Well, highly negative. I would say

i: this, that his viceral reaction to the Mafia -- he didn't

care for that kind of thing.

Now, if you have to do something -- I don't know whether

that would stand in the way ornot. I have in mind -- 100k

at Darlan in November of 1941. There was nobody more

despised in the Western World than Darlan was. But Dad

had to deal with him for a short period of time in order to

::

get the French to stop fighting in North Africa.

I don't think I could really contribute much to that

;::

question.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one final question.

We have been wrestling with certain language in minutes.

And this is one minute of -- were you shown this minute?

Yes,. sir.

-- of a minute of a meeting on September

2, 1960 of the National Security Council.

And you were

present in your capacity as Assistant White House Staff

Secretary, I think.

Mr. Eisenhower.

That is listed here, yes.

MI. Schwarz.

Now, on the 15-page of the memo there is

a discussion of Mr. Lumumba in the Congo, in fact it starts

•3.:

on the l4th page. And at the end of the first paragraph of

;:page 15 there is this language:

"Mobutu appeared to be the effective power in the

!:Congo for the moment, but Lumumba was not jet disposed of and

; remained a grave danger as long as he was not disposed of".

:.

I suppose you don't have any recollection of that meetingì

Mr. Eisenhower. No, I don't have a direct recollection.

I remember in general terms that the U.s. position was very

much anti-Lumumba, there

is no question

about it.

Mr. Schwarz. Focussing on those words, do you take

the words "disposed of" as intended to mean an assassination?

Mr. Eisenhower. No, I don't. And I wouldn't be too

surprised -- in other

words, I have no quarrel with this

document. This document fits in pretty much with

any recollec-

tion of the atmosphere.

Now, I would not be surprised if the words "disposed !!:

It is some Freudian, I would not conjecture that the words

"disposed of" meant an assassination, if for no other reason.

The Chairman. Any questions, Mr. Smothers?

Mr. Smothers. Is it your testimony that between you

and the General that all activities of the President were

monitored, that you were monitoring both phone calls and

visits and everything that went on

in the Oval office?

MI. Eisenhower.

Essentially, yes. I think I so say --

thing having to do with national security, which would

involve State, Defense, AEC, CIA primarily, USIA, anyone

from any of those departments of agencies that went into the

Oval office, either General Goodpaster or I went.

Mr. Smothers.

Let me take it a step at a time.

First of all, if there was a phone call, did you monitor

the phone call?

MI. Eisenhower. No, sir. But Mrs. Whitman did sporadica!:.

As a matter of policy, she monitored the phone calls. She

else.

PAUL

C:

MI. Smothers. That is what you mean by monitoring, she

listened to the phone calls and gave you a memorandum or

transcript?

Mr. Eisenhower.

She didn't give the transcript to me,

7

she made it for herself. And Mr. Kelley can give you more

details on this than I can. He has been looking in Abilene.

: =

She would put in the files a day's phone calls -- Cliff

Roberts called from Augusta National and he said this and.

" that. And then this might be an official thing on that, which

makes it difficult to clear the papers out of Abilene. I

would not say that her records are complete, but they were as

::complete as she could take memoranda.

The Chairman.

Did she do this pursuant to the Presi-

'' dent's instruction?

MI. Eisenhower. Oh, yes.

As a matter of fact, that

is not an unusual habit, I don't think, in government.

Mr. Smothers. I wasn't suggesting that there was

anything unusual about that or your going in to the President.

But was it your feeling that no one talked to the President

about national security until you were fully aware of the

contents of that discussion?

Mr. Eisenhower.

There would certainly be leaks in thi

system, no question about it.

ings, his telephone calls would not be monitored. So some-

body could sneak in. If somebody was going to make a plan to

assassinate somebody over the telephone at six o'clock in

6

the evening, at the cocktail hour, my conjecture is that

that is not very realistic.

Senator Huddleston. Maybe that is where this plan was

hatched.

Mr. Smothers. I assumed that maybe you didn't go to the

golf course -- or maybe you did?

MI. Eisenhower. I was there most of the time, but not

MI. Smothers.

Are we saying, then, that -- I am a little

i bit disturbed by the notion that if anybody did it it was

Allen Dulles, and he must have come in at a time when the

office wasn't covered I think as I understand your testimony

the gist of it is that this is not the kind

of thing that

your father would have had agreed with, and to the best of your

knowledge there was no opportunity at least for any extensive

consideration of this kind of option.

Mr. Eisenhower. There could have been none, extensive --

Eisenhower.

To your knowledge, did President Eisenhower ever call

• the Director of the CIA and give them specific instructions

on any subject of any operation?

Mr. Eisenhower. You say do I recall it? No.

Senator Huddleston. YOu do not recall it?

Mr. Eisenhower. No, I do not.

Senator Huddleston. Or any other person in the CIA?

MI. Eisenhower. He would have dealt only with Allen

Dulles or General Cabell. But the nature of the CIA operations

is such, or was such, that it is not the kind of thing

that the President dreams up and says, well, we will get the

CIA to do this. Maybe that is in conflict to some of the

things that have happened since then.

But I have no recollets.

asking the CIA to do anything.

House for him to directly call the CIA direct or any of the

Director's subordinates issuing any kind of an --

Mr. Elsenhower. That would be inconsistent with his

6

7

habits, yes. And also an operation of this size, or this

significance, I can't imagine that being done without consult-

ing with the Secretary of State, or somebody.

One thing, his philosophy, which I know quite well, was

that no man is indispensible, and so killing somebody off is

10

not going to change the situation that much?

For example, when we were on this l1 nation trip in

1:.

December of 1959, the Presidential

aircraft had to go through

1: a little 80-mile corridor between the Soviet Union and Irag.

And Iraq was extremely unfriendly at that time. And there

1:.

were some people saying, isn't it a little dangerous for you,

President, to be tightrope walking through this 80-mile

corridor?

And he said, the silliest thing in the world they could

do is knock off the President of the u.s.

He just laugher

at it. He didn't regard assassination as a feasible way of

i:

doing business, because

somebody else would step in, and

MI. Eisenhower. No. To the best of my recollection, I

or whatever you call it. I remember Mr. Leavitt was one of

the members of it. They were former public servants -- they

were sort of a advisory committee, and they met with the

for the im-

doing, which did not seem to

And I remember ver well that the Committee was critical

of the CIA operations, and the recommendations were completely

rejected by CIA --

Senator Huddleston.

Does that preface what the state

of mind or attitude was?

Mr. Eisenhower.

His attitude was that the CI could be

doing better, but MI. Dulles is so indispensible that we have

off a bridge or something like that. And

as Iremember, Lord

Hume said, it so happens that we have lost the technique of

old-fashioned diplomacy. And I discount that. I was there.
