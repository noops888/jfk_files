ReNYairtel, 9/24/64.

On 18/19/64, at 8:00 p.m. at Manhattan Center,

34th St. and ith Ave., New York, NY, the subject appeared

with MELVIN BELLI, former attorney for JACK RUBY, in a

debate entitled "Lee Harvey Oswald - Guilty or Innocent?"

The debate was sponsored by the Citizens' Committee of

Inquiry (CCI).

On 10/20/64, NY 4098-PSI advised that about 4000

people attended this debate, having paid from $1.50 to $5.00

for admission.

LANE and BELLI were each allotted 40 minute

opening statements and a

15 minute rebuttal period.

LANE spoke first. He reiterated points made in

his previous appearances in NYC such as his claim that the

doctors' reports were changed and that the photographs of

OSWALD's rifle were touched up in various magazines.

He made

reference to witnesses that were not called before the Warren

Commission and stated that witnesses were told not to talk

to anyone else.

He commented that the FBI, Secret Service

and Dallas Police Department kept evidence from the public.

BELLI quoted the Warren Commission report which

he stated proved OSWALD was guilty and was the lone assassin.

He refuted some of LANE's points through the facts appearing

in the Warren Commission report. BELLI stated we have to

have faith in the FBI and the Secret Service. He commented
