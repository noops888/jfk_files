King further stated that he, along

with other civil rights leaders, plan to go to Boston in the Spring of

1965-to "scare the pover structure in that area. King did not elaborate

on what methods they would use in "scaring the, pover, structurel; nor did

he indicate that this visit would coincide vith the testimönial planned

Lor him by the Governor®

The Governor of Massachusetts is John A. Volpe (R). He was

elected 11/3/64 and had previously served as Governor Ix'om 1961-1963.

No adverse securIty IntormatIon concerning VolDe In bureau Illes.

Relations with him have been cordial and in January, 1961, upon his first

election as Governor he was sent a congratulatory letter and a copy of

"Masters of Deceit" by the Director.

Pursuant to your request of SAC

a planned "Day"

Because of the known communist influence on King coupled with

in the interest

of the Bureau to have SAC Handley"

briet him concerning King. Although arrangements

have progressed so tar

for the King Day that the

KING has indicated, however, that he aid not

However,

is now the policy of the Police Department to afford KING

a uniformed officer detail whenever he makes a public ap-

pearance.

KINSELLA said his office has liaison with "KING'S

office," the SCIC office in New York City, and tries to be

aware of KING's schedule of activities whenever he comes to

New York. KING is usually met at the airport by a detail

of uniformed police, and on many occasions in the recent

past he has been given a police escort into the city to his

hotel.

He has also been given police escorts when traveling

about

the city in connection with scheduled public appearances.

KINSELLA said that under ordinary circumstances,

or in the absence of some specific necessity, the Police

Department would not keep officers outside KING's hotel

room door,, for example, or in an adjoining room, for pro-

tective purposes.

In response to a carefully guarded question as to

whether the Police Department would try to be informed of

any of KING's conversations or intimate activities for"in-

telligence reasons, KINSELIA said that ordinarily the Police

Department did not consider KING

interest; however, KINSELLA said BSS was always very anxious

to develop information from any possible sources concerning

racial activity or plans of racial leaders, and said that

under appropriately secure circumstances,

the Police Depart-

ment would consider employing technical sources against

KING.

• Inspector KINSELLA volunteered to furnish

this orfice

any information learned from such sources, but added that

to date BSS has not learned anything of any significance

concerning KING's activities other than his public appearances.

It was apparent that Inspector KINSELLA was exer-

cising discretion in advising us at this point concerning

BSS activities, since on other occasions he has been much

more frank and open in admitting technical activities of his

agency. It should be noted that this office has developed

evidence on at least one occasion where the Police Department

had employed misur coverage of KING in a New York hotel.

In an effort to keep the Bureau more fully informed

in this matter, the additional information is included, which

might have some bearing on the Bureau's decision.

telephone taps were on them.

BERNARD LEE, while in discussion with an unknown

male,

said there had been a recent-burst of pressure.

ANDREW

YOUNG then mentioned that KING had taken the previous Tuesday

off and went to the apartment of EDWINA SMITH in Atlanta to

get some sleep, vinen he was awakened by a false fire alarm.

This prompted KING to wonder how he had been traced to the

apartment

so'quickly.

It was

agreed that as a consequence of all the

confusion, efforts would be made to meet Director HOOVER to.

inquire if he could shed some light on the matter.

Another observation which tends to indicate that

KING is now conscious of security is that when coming to New

York on recent visits, he has made reservations at a

hotel,

then, upon arrival, goes to another.

It is to be noted that as recent as 5/13/65, when

of their meeting since they either left the suite of went

deactivated immediately upon King's departure, probably 11/30/65,

we will promptly submit a memorandum to the Attorney General

advising when the installation was made and when it was taken

off.

FROM : SAC JAMES E. McMAHON

SUBJECT:

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

At 5:00 P.M. on 10/15/63 Asst. Director WILLIAM C.

SULLIVAN telephonically contacted me in Atlanta. SULLIVAN

stated that in connection with our recent request for a

tesur on MARTIN LUTHER KING it had been decided by the

Bureau that a clandestine tesur should be placed on him

for a trial period of 60 days.

SULLIVAN stated that this must be maintained in

absolute and strict confidence and that only the minimum

number of employees necessary to handle the matter should

have knowledge of it. He stated that mature, experienced

agents should monitor the tech and no Investigative Clerks

should be permitted to handle it. He stated nothing should

be placed in file concerning this particular phase of the

investigation of KING.

He stated that all mail, memos,

etc., should be personally handled by the sAC and should

not

be serialized, indexed or filed.

He stated that at the appropriate time the Bureau will

send a sound trained Agent to Atlanta to complete the

installation inasmuch as the Atlanta sound man is known to

KING as an FBIAgent.

I requested SULLIVAN to advise me prior to sending

the sound man to Atlanta in order that all other work could

be completed and in order that the Bureau sound man would

only have to be here for a minimum period of time. I further

suggested to SULLIVAN that in view of his above instructions

that no Investigative Clerks monitor the installation, and

that information concerning this tech be limited to the

minimum number of personnel, it would be better for the

monitoring point to be other than the FBI field office, due

to the fact that we have another similar installation on

another Individual that da being monitored in 0 2 52 0 5-18

office and there is no other space within the confines

of the office for complete security to be assured.

SULLIVAN agreed and I told him we would attempt to obtain

a suitable monitoring point and I would let him know.

Information concerning this matter has been furnished

only to the ASAC, Supervisor HENRY G. ROWSE, SA'S ALDEN F.

MILLER and FRANK R. SOUTHERLAND, the two Atlanta sound men,

and Miss MAXWELL, SAC's secretary. They have been instructed

that this must be maintained in complete confidence.

these references know nothing whatsoever about this

matter but both readily agreed that if they are contacted

concerning Mr. RICHARD NICHOLS of Southeastern Engineering

mendations.

Pertinent information above concerning the apartment

rental, the fact that we need several days to obtain five leased

lines from the Telephone. Company, plus one additional telephone

in the apartment, was telephonically furnished to Inspector

JOE SIZOO at the Bureau on 10/17/63, at which time authority

was requested to rent the apartment and order the leased lines.

Inspector JOSEPH A. SIZOO, Domestic Intelligence

Division, called at 11:45 a.I. on 6/21/66. He instructed that

our technical coverage on SCLC and MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

be discontinued immediately. He said this coverage should be

discortinued in such a way that it can be re-established on

short notice, but it is not to be re-established without

specific Bureau instructions.

I told SIZOO we would discontinue this operation

at once, but that we would not renove any of our equipment

from the plant, and that we would leave an Agent on duty round

the clock to insure the security of the installation. We will

continue to man the plant for security reasons for about a

week at the end of which time we will check with the Bureau

for further instructions if none have been received in the

meantime.

I called SA DAVIS then on duty at the plant at

71:55 All and he at that time discontinued this source.

Bureau was subsequently advised by teletype that this source

was discontinued at 11:55 a.m. 6/21/66.

". of same, consideration

an anonylous source; however, its noted that on one occasion

It was reported. that STANLEY D. JuVISON had apparently provided.:

$500 in funds to be utilized for

"night watchman purposes."

It is further noted there are approximately 40 employees at

this tine in the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Office, whose hours of employment are most irregular and

include weekends on occasions. It is considered that a

physical surveillance of all employees of Southern Christian

Leadership Conference for such an anonymous source development

could not be conducted with sufficient discreetness to insure

the success of this type operation.

It is further noted that

the building which houses the offices of Southern Christian

Leadership Conference is also occupied by a Negro Radio

Station inich has most irregular hours for its employees.

Another portion of the building is occupied and utilized for

Loage purposes and there is considerable traffic in and out

of the buiiding at unusual or irregular hours.

This office

space is located in an exclusively Negro neighborhood for

approximately one

mile in radius except for the downtown

business district.

From the above the security problems are obvious;

however,

there is room

to explore this further and our investi-

sation will be designed to determine any weakness which we can

Background Investisation of Southern Christian

Leadership Conference Employees

The Atlanta office currently is maintaining separate

fles on all SCIC employees

and is in the process of discreetly

investigating the background. of twelve key employees and

associates in an effort to obtain some weakness that could

be used for counter-intelligence activities.

To date no

pertinent data has been developed on these individuals which

is recognized as an opportunity for counter-intelligence purposes

with the exception of KING's girl friends'

activities.

Recommendations will be forthcoming if and when weaknesses are

developed.

D. Disgruntled Employees

It is to be noted that Atlanta sources

have disclosed.

recently that RUTH RAILEX, an employee of the New York office

of SCIO, was discharged.

She contacted an employee of the

Atlanta Office of SCIC and showed her displeasure because ,

her discharge date was prior to the notification date.

In

showing this displeasure she brought out that STANLEY LEVISON

was in someway undesirable and that KING had been warned

by unknown individuals about associating with him.

Sources

advised, however, that upon reconsideration SCIC retained the

services

of BAILLY.

Aslanta suggests this matter be followed

closely both in New York and in Atlanta and if the opportunity

presents itself to exploit BaILEY's discontent.

At this tine,

however, it is felt that because BAILEY was rehired that the

time for appraising her should be delayed.

Sources further reported a certain trend of dis-

content and dissatisfaction on the part of employees in

the Atlanta Office of SCIC based over preferential pay to

individu.lo perfomninz the some duties.

This discontent

has been scmporarily alleviated by recent pay increases made

to all employees.

Financial Dealings of KING and the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference

Analysis of recently received tax returns through

1962 and Internal Revenue Service investigation of KING and

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for the years

1957, 1958 and 1959, reflects that the main question of

contention was the status of money received by Southern Christian

Leadership Conference. KING's contention was that these receipts

were gifts, while Internal Revenue contends that income from

business operations, namely SCIC, was in reality income.

Atlanta sources have recently reported

• that the •

Atlanta Retail Creait Company was furnished details to the

eflect that sCLe had receired $750,000 during 1903.

Sources have also advised that one

"WILLIE" RICHARDSON,

Internal Revenue Service employee, was making a current income

investigation regarding the Southern Christian Leadership

Sources at Internal

Revenue Service report that WILLIE RICHARDSON is the only

Negro Internal Revenue Agent of the Atlanta Regional Office

and has been so employed for appreciately one year

It is pointed out that KiNd has authored several

books and it is believea tnot lunds received froin this auchor-

ship are the funds most aifficult to report as.

contention has been In the past, rather than as intones kINd's

iron the return it is apparent that SCLo is

classified as a tax-exempt organization; however, contributions

to it are not allowable by the donor. as

a tax deductible

contribution to a charity organtation. SCIC is considered

a tax-exempt civil organization. It is noted that in order

of the organization's charter, By Laws, financial

statements

and alist of sizeable contributors to this organization 1s

also filed.

•***

It is suggested that the Bureau may desire to

obtain through liaison further data available regarding

SCLC and the basis of any current investigation being conducted.

on MARTIN LUTHER KING, TR., Or SCIC.

It is felt the list of contributors of sizeable

gifts to SCLC may be important as with future information it

may be possible to compare whether KING is recording all

of his contributions as gifts or whether in fact, there

is a discrepancy in the amount donated to SCIC and the

amount KING reports as gifts.

If such a discrepancy does

exist it is likely KING is utilizing these funds for his

own personal affairs.

It is believed that through various past incidents

as reported by Atlanta sources a trend can be established

to show collusion on the part of donors who are making

contribution to SCLC by various and devious means. Points

in contention in this regard relate to a sizeable contribution

of fundis collected at a benefit held in California by SAMM

DAVIS, Fo, the entertainer.

It was proposed that these funds

be made payable to a church in Califoria.

These funds were.

then forwarded by the church in California to Ebenezer Daptist

Church, Atlanta, and thence to scIC, or MARIIN LUTHER KING,

Jh. personally.

Another point in contention relates to the recent:

gift by an unknown automobile dealer through a Reverend

Atlanta sources

reported that this dcaler was interested in establishing

a capital loss in his business operations

and was utilizing

the gift of the vehicles in so doing. In order to establish

this capital loss and as well claim a contribution, the

vehicles were actually given

to the west Hunter Baptist

Church, the benezer Foptist Church and to the United Church

be made available to the ScLC.

Lu is further panted out that Atlanta sources: i.

advised that SCIC is currently short on funds and is

known to owe Darby Printing Company, Atlanta, approximately

$12,000.

It is believed that donors and creditors of SCIC

present two important areas for counter-intelligence activities.

in regard to the donors it is suggested that official SCLC

stationery bearing KiNG's

signature, copies of which are availade

to the Atlanta Office and will

be furnished by separate communi-

cation to the Burei Laboratory for reproduction purposes,

be utilized in advising the donors that Internal Revenue

Service is currenily cecking tax records of SCLC and that

KING through this phoney correspondence wants to advise the

donor insuring that he reported his gifts in accordance with

Internal Revenue rcquizements so that he will not become

involved in a tax investigation. It is believed such a letter

of this type fron SCIC nay cause considerable concern and

eliminate future contributions. From available information

it is apparent that uny of these contributors to SCIC are

doing so in order io claim tax deductions and in order to be

eligible for such deriuctions, the contribution is being made to

the duenezer baptist Church, which in turn is forwarded to

KING or the southern Christian Leadership Conference.

•It is also rroposed that pretext calls be placed.....

to Darby Printing Colony, impressing upon them the linancial

pligio of sold so that

oney may ve incited into collection

eiforer or tie printing bill owed to them in the amount of

$12,000.

KING in settling his accounts and if credit cards are used,

appropriate checks of these credit card accounts may develop

pertinent information regarding KING's financial dealings

Atlanta confidential sources also advised that

KING has a personal account in New York City and Atlanta; Georgia,:

at the Citizens Trust Company. The New York bank is unknown.

There is also an SCIC banking account in New York City and

Atlanta, Ga., also at the Citizens Irust Company. Mr. I. D.

President of the Citizens Trust Company,

Atlanta,

Georgia, has in the past been extremely cooperative with

the Bureau in other investigative matters; however, it is

known that he is personally acquainted and considered friendly

with MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR., and other members of his

immediate family.

It is therefore felt that the necessary

monitoring of his bank account could not be effective with

the desired security warranted in this investigation. It is

noted that this bank is owned and operated entirely by members

of the Negro race.

F. Subversive Information Reg rding Southern

Christian Leadership Conference Employees

It is noted that Reverend CORDY I XVIVIAN, Director

of Affiliates of SCLO, was identified by a springfield

Informant In 1947 as a menber of the Communist Party in

Peoria, Illinois.

Investigation regarding VIVIAN has been

instituted to deternine his activities since 1947 and whether

he has any other subversive affiliations.

by KiG for his clandestine romances (FRED BENNETT's apartment)

It is

The apartment building is one of approximately

buildings in a projoci all of which are occupied by

member of the regro race.

This apartment project is surrounded

on either side by other muti-dwelling unit Negro apartments.

Directly behind the apartment occupied as a hide-away, a

Consideration has been given to requesting Bureau

authority for a technical survey in this area; however,

Atlanta sources: have on numerous occasions indicated

..::

an interest on the part of KING and BENNETT of obtaining

another apartment in another area.

In the event this does

not materialize, Bureau authority

for technical survey of

this

facility will be requested. In regara. to the utilizacion

of a misur, it is noted that the same basic security problem

of an all Negro neighoorhood is involved.

Recently

certain modifications have been made in

the office space occupied by scLc..

Quarters were enlarged

and additional employees hired.

It is unknown but believed

that additional telephone facilities may have been obtained

and are possibly being installed at this time.

Atlanta will

in the near future, through sources, determine what facilities

now service the office and make appropriate recommendations

therefrom.

The Atlanta Office will, by separate communication,

request Bureau authority for making a survey realting to

possible installation of trash cover in the office facilities

The above analysis

is being set forth with

certain recommendations bearing in mind the main objective of thin

The Attorney General orally informed me today that he had been

considering the request he made on July 16, 1963, for a technical surveil-

lance on Martin Luther King at his home and oftice and was now of the

opinion that this would be ill advised.

At the time the Attorney General initially asked for such a

surveillance, he was told there was considerable doubt that the

productivity of the surveillance would be worth the risk because King

travels most of the time and that there might be serious repercussions

should it ever become known the Government had instituted this coverage.

These were the very thoughts that the Attorney General expressed today

in withdrawing his réquest.

With reference to the other technical surveillance requested

at the same time, namely, the one on Clarence Benjamin Jones, the

Attorney General felt this was in a different category and we should go

forward with this coverage. It is noted that this was previously approved

in writing by the Attorney General.

The memorandum we sent to the Attorney General on

July 23, 1963, requesting authority for the King surveillance has been

getrieved and is attached.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

'We will take no further action to effect technical coverage on

Martin Luther King, either at his home or at his office at the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, in the absence of a further request

from,the Attorney General.

Dear Mr. Levi:

At the close of his testimony on September

Mx.. Charles Srennan, former Chief

Gi Domestic Intelligence

Division, indicated that he could not answer a question

posed to

The question

relates to the status of

a so-called "closed" FBI Domestic Intelligence case file.

Suppose that the individual who is subject of the file is a

mender of the military service or

applies for employment

with a federal. government agency, and the agency requests an

FBI name check. What information would be provided to the

federal agency by the FBI as the result of that name check?

What infornation would be provided to that agency if the FBI

I conducted a background investigation on that individual?

With respect to surreptitious entries for the pur-

pose

of installing electronic surveillance eguipment, which

are referred to on page three of the September 24, 1975 letter

Exom Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., to myself, I would appreciate

• answers to the

following additional questions:.

1. What has been the number of such entries for

each year since 1960?

2.

3.

What has been the number of separate targets

for each year since 1960?

What has been the total number of separate

targets, since 1960?

I would also request access, under agreed upon pro-

cedures, to a list of such targets, and

, the dates of the entries.

NOTE FOR SAC, NET YORK, CONTINUED:

(100-106670), Southern Christian Leadership Conference (100-438794)

and Communist Influence in Racial Matters (100-442529) were

reviewed in an attempt to locate a document indicating disapproval

on 4/25/65 of a telephone surveillance involving King. A direct

disapproval of a telephone surveillance involving king vas not

located. A nemorandum to the Actorney General dated 5/5/65

indicates the FBI had been operating a telephone surveillance of

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, an organization

headed up by King, and that, unless advised to the contrary, this

telephone surveillance would continue for another six months.

This document has initials in the upper right-hand corner which

appear to be those of Mr. Katzenbach (100-442529-1051) •

The National Security Electronic Surveillance

(NSES)

file located in Special Records and Related Research Unit, IS-3,

INTD contains

following documents:

(1) The original of a memorandum to the Attorney

Ceneral dated 5/24/65, captioned "Stanley David Levison, Internal

Security - Communist"

requesting authority to install a

technical

surveillance dirccted to Levison's residence. Levison is char-

acterized as a close advisor of King-

This document states "King

and Levison personally met in lew York City on Hay 13, 1965, at

which time Levison advised King concerning voter registration

activities in Alabama

and also urged that king support demands

for peace in Vietnam."

The 5/17/65 memorandum shown to

Ilx. Katzenbach on 10/22/75 reports King had been the subject of

a trespassory microphone surveillance in New York City on 5/13/65.

This 5/24/65 original memorandum regarding Levison in the lower

left-hand corner following the word approved has initials which

appear to be those of lix. Katzenbach.

the handwritten date of 5/25/65. In addition, there is a hand-

written notation which reads, "you should discontinue if at any

time I. is acting as attorney for clients litigating with the U. s."

This notation is folloved by initials which appear to be those of

Mix. Katzenbach.

(2) The original of a memorandum to the Attorney

General dated 5/27/65, captioned "Clarence Benjamin Jones,

Security Matter - C" which states unless the Attorney Ceneral

instructs to the contrary, technical surveillance of Jones at

The Attorney General

NOTE FOR SAC, NEW YORK, CONTINUED:

his law office and residence will be continued for an additional

six months.

The memorandum reports information gained from the

surveillance regarding Jones' contacts with King.

The memorandum

has a handwritten notation in the lower left-hand corner which

"Mr. Hoover - Problem here is the law office. O.K. if

initials which appear to be those of Mir. Katzenbach.

(3) The original of a memorandum to the Attorney

General dated 6/4/65, captioned "Bayard Rustin - Security Matter -

Communist" which states Rustin is frequently an advisor to king,

reports information regarding King gained probably as result of

technical coverage and states unless the Attorney General

instructs to the contrary, technical coverage of Rustin will

continue for an additional six months. This document has

initials in the upper right-hand corner which appear to be those

of Mr. Katzenbach.

•During the 10/22/75 interview Mr. Katzenbach stated

he could not recall any instance of microphones being installed

and the FBI advising him of this action after the fact other than

those involving King. The NSES file contains five original

documents dated in the period 1/23/65 to 12/3/65 advising the

Attorney General of microphone installations that are being made

on a contemporaneous basis (i.e., the installation is being made

on the same date as the communication to the Attorney General,

Two are dated 4/23/65; one is dated 6/2/65;

one iterated 6/9/65, and one it dated 12/3/65. "All have initials

Mr. Katzenbach.

The above is being furnished to the New York Office for

their information in the event the Department desires additional

On 10/21/63 Inspector JOE SIZ0O telephoniecally

contacted the Atlanta Office and advised that it was

o.k. for us to rent the apartment which we had surveyed

for $250.00 per month and to go ahead with the necessary

installation of the five leased lines on the SCLC and one

line on the residence of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

He said

that when all of this had been done and the

leased lines

had been connected, Atlanta should call Miami and request

them to send SA BILL HEIST to make the final installation.

Mr. SIZOO said that the additional equipment which we had

previously requested was being forwarded separately to

Atlanta.

He further stated that when this installation

is made we should furnish the Bureau immediately the date

and time of installation, symbols for the five lines, and

at the end of thirty days submit an evaluation with recom-

mendations for its continuance

or discontinuance. He

further stated that any mail sent to the Bureau should bear

the caption, "COMINFIL, RACIAL MATTER, ATLANTA DIVISION,"
