Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) requests Dallas to search

for records and forward records to the JFKTF.

Enclosure: ARRB letter requesting material; a copy of EC dated

4/1/97 requesting Dallas files 176-PCI and 137-1292.

Details:

In 1992, Congress signed the Act mandating federal

agencies to release all documents concerning the presidential

assassination or information related by conspiracy theory to the

assassination.

The Act narrowly defined the types of information

that agencies

2017.

could still protect by postponement until the year

The Act also established the Board as a separate entity to

oversee the release of material from federal agencies to the

National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). Beyond the

Board's oversight responsibilities, the Act charged the Board

with the duties of reviewing agencies' proposed postponements

with the agencies' evidence for approval or denial and

researching additional areas of information for any new material

related to the assassination. The FBI has been working with the

king math tae

Board since its inception to meet the recent beat 733

On November 29, 1996, the Board wrote a letter to the

FBI setting forth a formal compliance program.

The letter

requested the FBI's cooperation with the Board "in discharging

its responsibility of assuring Congress and the American people

that the goals of the JFK Act will be accomplished to the

greatest reasonable extent."

The compliance program is the

Board's answer to demonstrating "to the American public that a

thorough, good-faith, and diligent effort has been made to locate

and release all remaining assassination-related records within

the control of the United States government (and that the

Government is not hiding any such materials from public

disclosure)."

with this philosophy in mind, the Board has

forwarded letters to the FBI requesting additional information

for their review and possible inclusion in the JFK collection.

Re: 62C-HQ-1029205, 04/30/1998

•on 03/19/97, the JFKTF received a letter from the Board

requesting Dallas field office informant files.

The JFKTF

sent

an EC dated 04/01/97 requesting Dallas files 176-PCI and 137-

1292. The records of the JFKTF show no documentation that these

files were sent to HQ or were not located at Dallas.

The JEKTF

therefore requests that Dallas conduct a search of its office for

these files and forward the documents, if located, to the JFKTF.

The original documents are necessary to meet the

requirements of the Act.

Should the Board determine the

documents to be assassination records the originals will

eventually be transferred to NARA. Therefore, any responsive

documents should be copied before forwarding to the JFKTF.

If

the Board decides the documents do not fall within the realm of

the Act,

the documents will be returned to your office, but not

until the Board completes this project.

should respond even if the search is negative.

The response is important for the FBI's compliance with the Act.

If you have any questions, please contact Catherine Lamey at

(202) 324-6185.
