Director of Security

SUBJECT: Robert Maheu

1.

On 4 August 1976 Mr. James P. O'Connell, formerly

Deputy Director of Security for Physical, Technical and

Overseas Security, now retired, called to inform me that-he

had been contacted by Robert Maheu concerning a book which

Maheu is writing.

2. Mr. O'Connell indicated that Mr. Maheu wanted to

the book with him, together with Mr. Maheu's ghost

writer, one Joseph Frank.

Mr. O'Connell stated that he

to meet with Maheu but wanted me to know that he

would not provide Maheu with any information of a classified

nature.

,3. On 5 August 1976 Mr. O'Connell called Mrs.[

to advise that he had decided against meeting with

Maheu. Mr. O'Connell stated that he told Maheu that he just

simply did not want to get involved.

4. On 8 August 1976 Mr. O'Connell called me at my

home to advise that he had been contacted by a reporter from

The Washington Post in response to the news story concerning

the death of Johnny Roselli. The Post reporter wanted to

interview Mr. O'Connell to obtain the

"general background and

color details concerning Johnny Roselli."

Mr. O'Connell

advised that he told The Washington Post reporter he had

nothing of interest to provide him.

5. Mr. O'Connell elaborated further concerning Mr.

Maheu's book, stating that Maheu was now in London where

Mr.

0'Connell

speculates he will publish the book. Mr. O'Connell

believes that

the book will be concerned primarily with Maheu's

relationship with Howard Hughes and that Maheu's connections

with CIA will be of minor importance.

Mr. O'Connell volun-

teered to contact Maheu and request galley proofs in order

to review the book prior to publication to determine if he,

Mr. O'Connell, is portrayed in an accurate manner and if

information sensitive to CIA is included in the book.

explained to MI. O'Connell that whatever action he wanted-

to take was a private matter but that CIA was of course

interested in protecting classified information and infor-

mation concerning sources and methods.

I thanked Mr. O'Connell.

for the above information and he advised that he would contact

me further should he obtain additional information concerning

Maheu's book.
