COPIES TO

Jo At 1630 on 9 July I returned Mr. !lee's call.

He said that they

had been told by the State Department that Pedro Luis DIAZ Lans, former

chief of the Siban Revolutionary Air Force,

was no longer available to the

people who marted to see him.

lie

said thatldficial stand of DiS on the

matter is inni DiAl lans has been admitted as a restient alien and that

INS cannot be excected to keep track of him since tais la a free country

He also said that unofficially he wanied to infora se that DIAZ Lans 1a

under subpoena to the Senate Internal Security Subcormittee and that wa

could get in touch with hin by contacting the Comitted's offices. I 1

thanked him for the Inforation and said that I would rofer the matter

to my supervisors imediately.

2. I noticed that the conversational tune used by Nice in telling

no the above was somewhat formal, and bellove tbat this call was obviouly

for the record. Re-enforcing my belief la the fact that Nice said he had

called me outside of custonary liaison channels becanse ho wanted to malte

sure that the nan who would have to do the work inrolved would be amaru

of the atuation.

3o: I asted. bin then 18 his meaning was that we could invite DIAB

Lans to be our veluntary piest for the pertod of tine necessary for the

Intelligence ocmunity to debrief hill, and he afreed that tris was the?

case.. I told his that we had only learned that DIA: was being brought

to inshington yesterday afternoon and that there vere nany Intelligeno

requirements involved in the matter which we had not had mufficient tim

to pouch to our san in Miarl.
