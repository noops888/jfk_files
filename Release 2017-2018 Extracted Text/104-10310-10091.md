SA/DDO

SUBJECT:

REFERENCE:

CIA Dealings with William George Gaudet

Senate Select Committee Request, Same Subject,

(R$ 76-0110), dated 20 January 1976

1. Cover and Commercial Staff (CCS) files contain only one refer-

ence to a Mr. William G. Gaudet, who appears to be identical with the

William George Gaudet of the reference.

2.

The document in question is the report of a meeting on 4 May

1962 with Mr. Richard J. Cahill, sole owner of R. J. Cahill and Com-

pany of Panama City, Panama. Mx. Cahill offered to CIA a cover posi-

tion in his firm's office in Panama. He also is reported to have

stated that he and Mr. Gaudet owned 51% of the issued stock of a news

magazine, Latin American Report, and to have proposed that the covered

Agency employee in the R. J. Cahill Company work in the Central American

area selling advertising and otherwise supporting the magazine.

3.

CCS files contain no further information on the outcome of this

cover offer or of other dealings with Mr. Gaudet.
