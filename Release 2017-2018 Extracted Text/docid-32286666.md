Misur survey of the residence of SANTO TRAFFICANTE,

JR., 2605 Bristol Avenue, Tampa, revealed the following

information:

Subject lives in a one-story yellow brick house

having a barrel tiled roof. This house has at least three

bedrooms and two baths with attached two-car garage having

an inside entrance to the house.

The house has a front door.

facing Bristol Avenue and a rear door facing the back yard.

The back yard is completely surrounded by a six-foot chain

link fence with three strands of barbed wire around the top

of the fence. All windows and doors appear to be of a secure

type of construction.

The garage doors of this house are operated electric-

ally by one or more of the four automobiles used by members of

the household. This house is located in an upper middle class

neighborhood with a new home being constructed on one side and

with neighbors on the other side and to the rear where no alley

exists.

A small park faces the front of the house with neigh-

bors living directly across the park facing the subject's

residence.

The house under

construction next door to the subject's

nome is in the early stages of construction, having only form and

concrete work done at the present time.

This house is being

constructed by HERBERT GOLDBERG,

Assistant State Attorney in

charge of criminal cases for Hillsborough County. The house

on the other side is occupied by L

who have no children and are elderly persons who are

approaching the state of being

senile. They are not believed

to be reliable enough to consider this as a plant site, although

these two persons have been opened as PCIs to attempt to obtain

information regarding subject's activity. This has

proved

fruitless to date:

Investigation is being conducted to determine the

reliability of neighbors to the rear of subject's residence.

A garage apartment directly to the rear of subject's house

would furnish a clear, unobstructed view of the rear of

subject's house and would be an excellent location for an

antenna to receive any type of radio transmission from

subject's house.

Access to this apartment, which appears

vacant at the present time,

would be from a street not under

zeneral observation from subiect's residence.

A physical observation plant has been established

at the home of SAM MENSH, 2404 Bristol Avenue, at the corner

+.

of Lakeview and Bristol, giving an excellent visual coverage

of the front entrance of subject's home and of activity in

and out of his garage.

No means of exit from the rear of the

house exists except into the fenced-in rear yard, and a gate-

type entrance to this fenced-in yard opens to the front of the

home adjacent to the garage.

Presently living in subject's home are five adults--

Mr. and Mrs. SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR., Mr. and Mrs. AUGUST PANIELLO,

who are the daughter and son-in-law of subject, and SARAH ANN

TRAFFICANTE, who is a freshman at the University of South

Florida, and is a daughter of subject. It has been noted

that SARAF ANN TRAFFICANTE has odd and irregular hours at

the university, where she attends various lectures and classes:

A schedule of her hours has been previously obtained.

She

drives either a Chrysler or a Plymouth automobile to school.

She has a boy friend, EDWARD VALDES, who attends the University

of Florida at Gainesville; he has visited her

on a daily basis

for the past few days. Subject has been observed to visit the

the rear of the various houses, and in the case of the subject's

house these conductors would extend across the fenced-in back

yard.

The subject has non-published telephone number RE 6-6973.

The type of telephone in subject's house is not known but is

likely to be an instrument manufactured by Automatic Electric.

Tampa Television Labs, Inc., 510 South Howard Avenue,

Tampa, have been seen to appear at subject's home, where they

apparently were working on the electronic mechanism which opens

the garage

doors.

It is noted that SANTO TRAFFICANTE or some other

members of the household have a small dog which is usually

kept inside the house but appears outside occasionally and

is seen being taken for walks by members of the family.

A colored woman believed to be WILLIE MAE JACKSON (ph)

has been observed to enter subject's home at irregular and

infrequent intervals. Investigation is being conducted to

identify this woman and to determine her reliability.

It is

not known at this time whether this woman has a key to the

TRAFFICANTE residence.

To obtain access to subject's residence, it is believed

that the garage doors could possibly be opened electronically,

+.

allowing access to the garage. A locked door would then have

to be entered.

It has not been possible to obtain a key to

the TRAFFICANTE residence, nor has a close examination of

the type of lock uséd by subject been made. No access to

this residence could be had at the time of the survey.

It appears that due to the location of the house,

the fenced-in back yard, the way the telephone wires leave the

house and extend across the rear yard to the telephone poles,

and because of the activity of the occupants. of this house,

it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to attempt to

extend a line from any installation inside the house to a plant

located in another area. .

It is felt that if any installation

could be made, the type of installation using a radio trans-

mitter to an antenna located in the nearby garage apartment

to the rear of the house would be the most secure type of

installation.
