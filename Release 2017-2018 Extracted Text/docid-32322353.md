Synopsis: Dallas is requested to forward the documents listed

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but

the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened

full. Therefore, the serials will not be returned to Dallas.

Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the serials should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ.

The serials should be received at FBIHQ no later than

c.O.B. 08/28/98.

Please ship the following serials to FBIHQ, JFK Task
