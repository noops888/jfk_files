something Constructive:

This G1ll recently, a few years

or less ago Made a trip to the Soviet Union ete on the

Youth Conference know as the World Youth Conference,'

He will probably emerge from the New York thing as a

full time organiser in sone special field suchas youth.

At the start of the Meeting Genne brought out

her brief case full of clippyngs (Newspaper) ete she

also had a lot of penciled notes which she was

undoubtedly going. to use to show what she was doing

and to give others hell for not co-operating with her.

But the first discussion by A. Johnson centered around

the late Pres. Kennedy.

Arnold explained that since Oswald was Considered a

Conmumist then a wave of hysteria was about to explode

against the C. party of America but by the time the

reactionaries were getting started it was announced

that it had been disclosed that it seemed like the

extreme E

Fight had been active. This was bore out

by the declaration of Russia that it was not

the

C. party that had done it because Kennedy was a

friend of the working class but the work of the extreme

right or almost a fascist act. This seemed to sober

the masses that it was the same caliber of people who

had insulted Stevenson only Weeks before in Dallas,

Texas.

Arnold stated he was asked by C.B.S. News about this

Oswald as to a letter he had written to the party, he

told them he gets lans of letters of enquiry about the

C. party and he probably answered it as he does hundreds

of othors and even sent him literature if he requested

It. They (C.B.S.) wanted him to go on the air with a

statement but he

stated to them he would have to dig the

letter.out. and.be.sure. before he Made any statement.

Randal Gorby asked Arnold Johnson if when he got back to

New York to look in the files 1f he had a letter from d

asked Johnson to compare the letter of pokey's with

Oswald's to see if they didn't have

a lot In common.

Palmer stated that

he thought the statement by the

Methodist Minister Covered the situation very good

when he stated that the fact that the Murder of B111

Moore,M Edgar Evers and others In the south going

by without punishment had set the stage for the

Assassination of Pres. Kennedy. Everyone rsadily

agreed.

Arnold Johnson further stated that no real Marxist

Could do such a thing.. There 1s not Much doubt that

since the

soviet Union had expelled him by not

giving him a Citisenship in the Soviet Union because

they thought him to be an Agent of Fascist. Genne

Meanwhile was Chomping at the bit trying to get her

story told about the N.A.A.C.P. and CORE.

She finally got her Chance

to unload.

She stated that about the time of the Civil Rights

March on Washington a

few days before she had been

working with CORE and NAACP the reporter from the

Wheeling paper Intelligencer had Called and wanted

to talk about her.

She gave him answers on the

phone and finally hung up on him.

from the time

this phone conversation was completed she had been

quoted in the newspaper and exposed as a Communist

party Member, which brought about her expolsion from

the N.A.A.C.P., but since has been restored to

Membership.

Then lately a Man (Negro) by name of Johnson

head of

the local ColE group

was

bus driver in Steubenville,

indicted for sobbing a

Gemne had got In

taunt with A Gorby an stue thought Ichson was being

framed. Gorby found out and told her at this Meeting

that he had did the robbing and was Not being framed.

The best thing to do stated Gorby was to give him

help but do not put core and the NAACP out on a limb

by doing it.

"Palmer stated that it was News to him as the only thing

he Knew about It Was the articles in the paper and the

first one looked as if Genne

had stayed on the phone

too long should have hung up quick.

He also

stated that

In 1948 when he had this trouble.

everyone Knew about

It and then he got more help and was successful in

defeating the reactionaries.

You have to always work

together on these Matters If you will be guccessful.

The hour was drawing Near ten d'clock P.M. and the

steuberville delegation had to work that Nite.

Lunch was furnished by each and everyone with the

exception of A Johnson and he put away plenty.

Johnson stated that he had been down this way about one

ago and had Contacted some of his old friends by

phone,

one in particular was Adolph Pacifico he

wanted to talk to him on a so called Applachian Coal project

which has been going on for some time Atolph wanted to

meet with hin if he could find time later

Was unable to

see him at this time.

Everyone present asked A. Johnson when he was coming

back but he would not state exactly only he would notify

the Next time he could make it.

No Literature

No Collections

During the time tenne Kuhn was belly aching about not

getting help fron the valley group it was polnted out

by A Johnson that some years back when the wheeling group

was a part of l. Virginia group that difficulties existed

and now with the wheeling group

In with Ohio valley the

trouble still exists. He also pointed out that distance

has a lot to do with it too. Gene stated that Fred

Walchli was supposed to show up with the beer.. She

was urged to call him against her wishes but she got

no answer on the phone"
