GABRIEL MANNARINO, ala.

Ô

SANUEL, NANNARINO, ala.

On 6/23/62, PO 612-0 advised SA THOMAS Q. FORSYTH, III!

In the past

ten days three men

were beaten/severoly in

New Kensington, Pa.

Each of thesa men was delinquent

in the payment of gambling debts owed to the MANNARINO

organization, and as has been the traditions? manner of

handing tron an each man attassed by as boast ano

collectors, probably SONNY QIANCUTTI and

ANDY MANGINI.

The ident101es of

the beaten men are not known,

but even if they were, these men would not cooperate with

any lav renforcementre agincy due to the fear of further

beatings and because of

the preveler better that the

MANNARINO organization

"owna

the polloe.

One reason for tho

spate of beatings may be attributed to a

rumored shortage of cash in the HANNARINO organization.

It 1s

so slow for the past two months that the

are gotting dose

to the point of desperation.

BOTH SUAJECTS SHOULD IS CONSIDEED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
