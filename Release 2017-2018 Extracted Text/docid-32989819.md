Memorandum to MI. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (ESCA)

DETAILS: By letter to the Attorney General dated 4/12/78,

the ESCA requested access to files on our informants

within the Invaders, a Memphis youth gang.

This request

was apparently made after, a review of the

Invaders file at

FBIHQ which disclosed the Memphis Office had five iniormants

who were providing coverage of that organization.

Mr. G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, had advised Legal

Counsel Division that the usca is trying to resolve whether

or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to get king to

return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed and to

determine 1f

any of these, informants acted as "agent

provocateurs" In starting, this violence.

None of the five informants involved are currently

active. Only one informant actually became a member of the

Invaders and that was not until after king's assassination.

Memphis files on these informants total 47 sections.

By Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated

4/27/78, It was approved to release FBIHQ files on these

informants with all informant identifying data excised. It

was hoped these files would satisfy the HSCA that informante

were not responsible for violence. This action was taken

primarily as a "compromise" to demonstrate cooperation with

the Committee.

Any additional afforts by the iSCA to review

field office files of the informants or to determine informant

identities would be opposed. Access to FBIHQ Informant files

was limited to MI. Blakey, since some starf members were

familiar with substantive, file on the Invaders and to allow

staff access could jeopardize Informants' identitles.

As reported in Mr. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandun

dated 5/19/78, MI. Blakey, reviewed excised copies of all

five FBIHQ informant files on 5/17/78, in the presence of

two Agents of the CIU. Following a review, Mi. Blakey stated

he found no avidence

that any of our informants acted as

"agent provocateurs." He furnished FBIHQ 15 pages of notes

which he took during review and desired these notes be kept

at FBIHl for possible later use in constructing a paragraph

in the final uscA report to the effect that he found no

evidence that any of these informants instigated violence.

Following this review, Mr. Blakey made no verbal request that .

field office files of these informants would be needed.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U, S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (USCA)

By latter to the Attorney General dated 5/23/78,

MI. Blakey requested access to Memphis Field Office files of

these same five informants.

risis lotter statad that the

procedure used for raview of PIll files was unacceptable and

contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, but could be

utllized again.

In response to this request, a letter frol the director

to Congressman Louis 3. Stokes, Chairman, USCA, dated 6/13/78,

was sent denying access to these flles.

A copy of this

letter and the letter transmitting it to the Department of

Justice are attached to this memorandum. Our denial vas based

primarily on the overall detrimental effect this access could

have on our informant developuent program and, as this letter

pointed out, the lives and safety of our Inforwants could

be placed in joopardy.

This latter also stated that our

decision to make the PBIll Informant files avallable was not

meant to serve as a precedent for the EscA to request fiole

office files for the same informants. MI. Robert I. Reuch,

Deputy Assistant Attorney. General, concurred with our position

in the absence of additional information Iron the HSCA bearing

on the allogation that our informants acted as "agent

provocateurs® in instigating the violence in Memphis.

On 7/12/78, representatives of the CIU and Legal

Counsel Division net with Mr. Keuch, at which time MI. Reuch

furnished a copy of a letter Irom Congressman Stokes to the

Attorney General dated 7/5/78.

A Copy of this letter 19

This letter sets out in detali

the basis on which the usch feela it has for requesting access

This letter appealed to the

Attorney General to resolys the matter of the intormant riles

the issues involved.

prepared to subpoena these files. In his opinion, sir. Kouch

the files and it would be in the Bureau's best interest

to comply with the ISCA Taquest of 5/23/78 and allon accoss.

Mt. reuch reguested that the iBl reexamine lis position ano

On 7/13/78, MI. Keuch advised that if files were

them, an action to commence 7/17/78.

At a meeting with representatives of the CIU,

Mr. Bassett and MI. Bailey on 7/13/78, MI. McDermott

directed that all five informants be contacted to determine

If they have any objections to their identities being disclosed

to the HSCA. If any did not object, then a signed waiver

would be obtained authorizing release of their files to the

RSCA.

Subsequent to the meeting, MI. Keuch was telephonically

advised of this action..

On 7/17/78 and 7/18/78, the field advised that

all five informants had been contacted and refused to allow

their identities to be disclosed to the HSCA. On 7/18/78,

Mr. Keuch was telephonically advised that all five informants

objected to their identities being disclosed to the ESCA.

By letter to the Director dated 7/24/78 (copy attached),

Mr. Reuch outlined the basis which he, as Special Counsel to

the Attorney General, believed that excised copies of these

Informant files should be made available to the ESCA. In hiB

opinion, Mr. Keuch believes the ESCA's legislative and

Investigative needs for the files are not based on "pure

decision regarding subpoenas, access would be broadened

and informants' identities.coula be disclosed; the nature of

the Conmittee 1s "that the Bureau and Department of Justice

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECY COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U, §, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (USCA)

Subsequent*

to receipt of thia letter, Mi. Keuch

was informally furnished by the CIU a list of points against

making these files available to the HSCA.. These points

wera derived as results of discussions by Interested

divisions at FBIHQ and a review of Congressman Stokes'

letter to the Attorney General dated 7/5/78.

While it was

belleved Mr. Keuch's position in this matter is sound, we

also desired he be made aware of our arguments in opposition

to making these informant, files available.

These points

given to Mi, Keuon Informally are as follows:.

1. As stated in our letter to Congressman Stokes

dated 6/13/78, If It becomes general knowleäge that FBI

Informant files are being opened to outside parties, informant

privilege is threatened and our Informant development

program can be severely hampered.. Despite the HSCA's statement

In the letter from Congressman Stokes that it is not seeking

the informants' identities at this time, this is not the

central asue in point.

The central Issue 1s the principle

of opening a field office informant file to outsida partios.

The HSCA was providod.access to FBIHQ files

concerning informants who reported on the Invaders.

Although the HSCA feals these were administrative in

nature, the polloy of the Bureau at that time reguired that

ald intormation oi a substantive natura be turnished to iiiia.

Data such as informant's travel, amount of paymente and a

mummary of background material are examples of such infor-

mation provided to FBIHQ..

Therefore, FBIHQ feels that Its

files contain significant Information concerning the operation

of any informant.

3. All Information of substance concerning the

Invaders organization furnished by these informants would be

reported In the Invaders file at FBIHO.

The 'ESCA has had

accoss to this file since December, 1977. The HSCA has

shown no interest in reviewing the Memphis Field Office

file concerning the Invaders, a file which would contain

all reports from informants covering the Invaders.

It

would appear logical to examine this file in detail prior

to pressing for files of informants, none of whom were

even members of the invaders at the time oi or pIloI to

King's assassination.

4. Review of FBIHQ Informant files was restricted

to Mr. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ESCA,

and not to his staff because, since the staff had access

to the Invaders file at FBIHQ, their knowledge of the

organization could possibly result in identification of

informants through a cross checking of the files. Subsequent

to MI. Blakey's review of the informant files, the FBlio

Invaders file was delivered to the HSCA on 7/6/78. NOw

MI. Blakey himself has acess to the substantive Invaders

file, and similarly, his

possible new knowledge could result

In source identification if allowed access to field office

files.

5.

On 7/17/78"

and 1/18/78, all five Informants

were contacted to determine if they would permit disclosure

of their identification to the HSCA.. All declined.

6. Pollowing his review of FBIHQ files on

5/19/78, MI. Blakey told agents present that he found

no evidence that any of our informants acted as "agent

provocateurs."

He furnished notes taken during his review

to FBIHQ and

reguested the notes be maintained by the FBI

for possible future use in writing into his final report a

paragraph to the effect he had found no evidence that any of

these informants had instigated violence.

He made no reguest

at that time to review field office informant files. It 18

possible that Mr. Blakey Is satisfied with the review of

FBIHQ Informant

files.

7. The FBI desires to maintain consistency

with regard to our position in this matter. In our letter

to Congressman Stokes

dated 6/13/78, access to these

files was denied.

This position was decided upon after

careful deliberation between interested divisions in the

FBI and in our view the MISCA has provided no basis to cause

a change of this position.

8.

Providing the HSCA access to field office

Informant files, although excised, could serve as an

undesirable precedent for other outaide groups to review

Buch files.

9. Because of the large number of excisions

In these files to protect the identities of informants,

it is unlikely the uSCA will be satisfied with its review,

if granted.

It will probably ask for fewer excisions and/

or the identities of the informants.

10.

Finally, the letter from Congressman

stokes dated 7/5/78, has been analyzed at FBIHQ and,

generally, It le not belleved it contains additional infor-

mation giving substance to the allegation that our informants

acted as "agent provocateurs."

specifically, the following

points are noted:

-. =

The letter states (pages I and 4) that the

ISCA had access to relevant Bureau personnel and has

conducted extensive interview among those who may also

be subfects of this aspect of the Committee's Investigation.

The Committee claims need to review the files to determine 1f

the wiltten record supports or refutes the oral testimony

on the relevant questions. However, the letter offers

no specific results of interviews of personnel or

others concerning the basic allegation. It has not identifled

any specific individual who has furnished Information

bearing on this allegation.

• *.

The letter states (page 4) that based on

field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis, at the time of the march, the

"Invaders were in fact a proximate cause of the violence."

This is not new Information.. The FBIHO file concerning the

Invaders, media reports issued then and more recently verifies.

the Invaders culpability regarding violence during the march.,

The letter also states (page 4) that "it is universally

followers who caused the violence

belleved that the Invader. The FBI considers this statement

a sweeping generalization and again the Committee offers

no specific identities of Individuals who belleved those

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (ASCA)

were instructed to instigate violence. However, as shown

in our files, FBI knowledge of impending violence was based

on Information from various informants and officials,

resulting from a tense situation brought about by the

Sanitation Workers Strike, all of which made knowledge of

Impending violence rather, obvious.

d. The letter states (pages 4.and 5) that "members

of the Invaders were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting

the crowd and readying weapons from signposts la fact later

testified to under oath by these agents).". A revlew of the

Invaders and informant files at FBIHl disclosed that none

of the Informants were members of the Invaders at the time

violence occurred. Only one of these five Informants was

ever a member and that was subseguent to the assassination.

The letter

states (page 5) that "Professor

Blakey's review of the files revealed that at least one

Informant subsequently joined a more violence-prone

organization."

It is assumed this statement is to demonstrata

the Informant's propensity for violence.

However, the fBI

believes that King's death and the rioting that followed

Intensified racial feeling and tended to make some organiza-

tions more violent. Therefore, it is logical that whatever

organization our informant was redirected into, It would be

more violence prone.

On 7/27/78, MI. Reuch telephonically advised a

representative of the CIU that he reviewed our arguments

and found them persuasive, but still he belleved the decision

as outlined in his letter of 7/24/78 was the best course

of action in this matter..

He stated, however, that he

desired to use our arguments in responding to the letter

from Congressman Stokes and asked that this information be

furnished him on a formal, basis. Mi. Keuch also stated

he had contacted the United States Attorney In New York

handling the Sociallat Workers Party case and had received

clearance that our action in this matter mould have no

bearing on that litigation..

ATTI DORIATION CONTAINED

VERDIT IS INCLEEDIN

LATE 718-01 03 60290 BeE/dey/S

Dear MI. Attorney General:

+4271176427113

In connection with the Committee's investigation into

the circumstances surrounding the death of DI. Martin Luther

King, JI., I write to request that you make certain field

office informant files available to the Comnittee so that

serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Inves-.

tigation and the death of DI. King may be resolved. The

Committee has already had access to the relevant Bureau

personnel, and it has conducted extensive interviews among

those who

may also be subjects of this aspect of the Com-

mittee's investigation.

The focus of the Committee's

effort now is to determine if the written record supports

or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant questions.

These files have been denied to the Committee by the Director

of the Bureau by letter dated June 1l, 1978, with the con-

currence of the Criminal Division. I write this letter to

ask that you give your personal attention to resolving this

serious matter.

On October 7, 1977, you and I signed the Memorandum

of Understanding between the Department and the Select Com-

mittee. As you will recall, it was intended that the

Memorandum should cover what materials the Department of

Justice would release to the Committee, (I.A.C.).

In a letter dated April 12, 1978, Professor G. Robert

Blakey, the Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the Com-

mittee, confirmed an oral request in which he asked for

"the informant files on all informants in the Invaders

(a Black militant group in Memphis, Tennessee) during 1968

and provide the Committee with access to these files."

(see 11. B.) Apparently, this group was involved in

the

violence that occurred in Memphis when Dr. King was there

in 1968.

The files were to be examined in a form in which

only the identity of the informants had been exercised from

• them.

The letter also expressly noted the "Committee ...

reserves the right to reguest...the identity of all Invader.

Informants during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent

interviews be inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by

the Committee." (See I.B. (1))

During the week of May 14, 1978, the Bureau, in partial

response to the April 12th request, permitted only Professor

Blakey to review the duly excised FBI Headquarters informant

files. The staff of the Committee was denied access to the

files. Professor Blakey agreed to this form of limited access,

reserving the right to insist that the terms of the Memorandum

of Understanding be complied with.

In a letter dated May 23, 1978, the Committee then

requested "that the Memphis Field Office files for these

same informants be prepared for access by the staff."

The

Headguarters

files contained basically administrative data;

it was felt that the Field Office file might be more en-

lightening.

The letter also observed, "While the Committee

feels that the procedure by which... (Professor Blakey) was

permitted access to the first set of files was unacceptable

and

contrary to the Memorandun of Understanding, pending

further discussions to arrange to broaden access, this pro-

cedure may again be utilized."

It should be clearly understood that the Committee's

request for these files, as well as the other informant

files, is predicated on the precise language of the Memo-

randum of Understanding.

Section I.B. (2) of the lemorandum sets out the

"Specific Rules"

by which access to materials may be ob-

tained. Section I.B. (2), in pertinent part, provides:

Where.. requested materials reveal the

identity of FBI sources who are or were

informants...The D(epartment) of Justice)

will appropriately sanitize, including ex-

cising.

if necessary. information identifying

such operations,

sources or informants.

added.)

of access.

Under I.Bnial" the only matter at issue is the terms

of access is not contemplated. Blz

clearly allows

access to the files at issue, subject. only

to proper sanitization. Nothing else is asked for here.

The Committee is fully cognizant of the issues raised

by the Bureau in its letter of June 13, 1978, in response

to our request.

It is, of course, recognized that a measure

of confidence in the Bureau's informant program would, in

fact, be eroded should it become general knowledge that

the FBI identified its informants in anything but extra-

ordinary circumstances, where, under the prevailing view,

they must be identified. See Roviaro v. United States,

353 U.S.

53 (1957).

Nevertheless, all this is premature;

the Committee has not requested, as yet, that the identity

of these informants be revealed.

All that is requested is

access to the files, in order that serious allegations

Involving the informants and the Bureau be resolved.

The Director's letter of June 13, 1978, offers instead

of access to the relevant files, sworn

affadavits denying

the Bureau's informants acted as "agents provacateurs".

The

Committee feels that this procedure for resolving this issue

would be unacceptable.

As you know, with respect to the Ring

investigation the Committee is, in effect, performing for

death of DI. King the same function that the Warren Commission

performed for the death of President Kennedy. One of the most

frequent criticisms of the Warren Commission is that in at-

tempting. to resolve the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey

Oswald was an FBI informant, the Commission accepted sworn

affadavits from the Bureau.

The Conmittee feels, therefore,

that it is unacceptable in this instance merely to rely on

sworn denials without an opportunity to examine and cross

examine the relevant witnesses-ánd to examine primary source

documents. Our investigation must command the confidence of

the American people it it is to achieve its goals.

quently, it will not be possible for the Committee to accept,

• not to posite d

Conse-

as the Director suggests, that this issue be resolved by the

taking of affadavits from the Bureau.

After noting that the allegation that the Bureau of

persons employed by it instigated violence is not new, the

Director's letter of June 13, 1978, denied the Committee

access to the files, referring to "overwhelming evidence

disproving the...allegation."

In support of that assertion,

the committee is told that

"The Memphis Office advised that

these informants did not advocate nor take part in the

planning of any riot."

Next, our attention is drawn to the

Department of Justice Task Force's conclusion, stated in two

sentences of their report.

NW 55244 DocId: 32989819 Page 23

---

## Page 24

The, Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Page •4

"There is no evidence that the activities

of these informants related directly to

DI. King.

Moreover, there is no evidence

that would suggest that these informants

were connected in any way to the assassina-

tion of DI. King.

(HQ 134-11867; 170-1841;

170-1922; 170-2530, and 157-4885)."

From the Connittee's perspective, this "evidence" is

hardly overwhelming.

But that is largely beside the point.

Without access to this evidence, it cannot be evaluated.

Mere denials and conclusions cannot be accepted in lieu of

records and sworn testimony. The Committee has completed

the compilation of an oral record of the events that trán-

spired in Memphis during March and April, 1968.

This record

consists of interview notes, testimony under oath before the

Committee, and witness depositions.

It is now imperative

that these witnesses'

current recollections be compared with

the contemporaneous written record, particularly that con-

tained in the Iciciant informant files.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the Com-

mittee has attempted to move with restraint.

It was not until

our field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed:

that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and 2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives that we requested access to any informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders,

King and Southern Charter Leadership Con-

ference files.

It had also reviewed the Memphis Police

Department files,

and it had interviewed their undercover

operative within

the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

Lusought would be contained in the Headquarters files.

are, as noted above, largely administrative, containing only

general information

on informant reliability, payment of fees,

and justification for continuing the informant's status. They

do not contain agent instructions; they do not reflect in

detail the working

relationship between agents and informants.

From the Committee's perspective, therefore, the information

contained in the Headguarter files proved inadequate.

Sub-

sequent interviews with current and former agents have also

revealed that: 1) the Memphis Field Office had prior know-

ledge of impending violence (a fact memorialized in FBI

documents) and 2)

members of the Invaders were observed by

NW 55244

agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and readying weapong

from signposts la fact later testified to under oath by

'these agents.) Professor Blakey's review of the files

revealed that at least one informant subsequently joined

the reasons why access to the files, duly excised, is es-

sential.

I feel that this is a matter that can best be resolved

by our discussing the issues involved. Since the Select

Committee's investigation is in its last stage - our public

hearings will begin in August -- I suggest that you give me

a call this week and we can meet as soon as possible to dis-

cuss this matter.

Sincerely,

The Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

DATE:

mbert I. Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

'House Select Committee on Assassinations

Request for Memphis Field Office Files

RLK:mal

By letter dated July 5, 1978, directed to the Attorney

General, the Select Committee has

repeated its request for

access to the Memphis, Tennessee, field office informant files

concerning informants in the Invaders, a black militant group

It is my judgment, as Special Counsel for the

Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to

excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief

Counsel, Professor G. Robert Blakey. I have made an oral

request to have the files processed and this is to reguest

that this task be completed as soon as possible and that

Professor Blakey be provided access to the processed files.

As you are aware, we haä, by letter of June 13, 1978,

previously refused

• the request of the Committee. I

concurred

in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact

that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee

for access to the

field office files rested on naked allega-

tions which had been denied in the past.

In the Committee's

latest demand, presented by the July s letter, the Committee,

on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail

the justification for its request.

While it may be our judg-

ment that the information set forth by the Committee is not

sufficient to substantiate the allegations made about the

55427160

activities of the informants at issue, it is equally clear

that we can no longer take the position that the Committee's

legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula-h

tion and/or naked allegations.

That being the case, the

limited access outlined above should be granted in response

to the Committee's request.

I am, of course, aware of the deep concern held by the

Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing to

disclose informants or release information which will lead

to their disclosure.

I share that concern and my decision

in this matter has been reached only with the greatest

possible consideration of that concern.

-2.

In addition to the further justification submitted by

the Committee for their request, I believe there are other

factors which support my conclusion that we should provide

the limited access discussed. An important factor is that, :

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue subpoenas for the informant

files.

The only way we could respond to such subpoenas other

than by providing the requested information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a federal court.

While

this type

of confrontation may ultimately be necessary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer

the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant

files by the entire staff thereby increasing the possibility

that the informants could be compromised through the knowleage

of the members of the staff who have studied the other files

In the matter in greater detail and, in any case, would broaden.

the number of individuals who could

learn the identity of the

informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevail in the litigation, a

possibility which, in my judgment, is remote given the subject

matter of the Committee's inquiry and the allegations and

Information that formed the basis of their request, we can

only win if we show a reasonable posture to the court. An

absolute refusal to comply would not do that.

An attempt

to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests

by providing limited access to excised files would do that.

Further support for the procedure of providing Iimited

access stems from the very nature of the Committee's investi-

gation. Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or

lawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets

or subjects of the investigation.

Under such circumstances

our obiigation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible

with the congress is obvious. The public conception of our

cooperation is going to be a very important factor in the

acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts

and determinations in these investigations.

To put ourselves

in a posture of confrontation with the Committee over this

particular issue without first attempting some accommodation

of competing interests would only serve

¿ to revive all the

allegations and criticisms of us and our actions concerning

the assassinations.

;

•3.

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of

this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more

subject to public comment and criticism. The present interest

in, and repeated stories related to, the allegations in the

case of Mr. Rowe makes this one of the worst times to come

to .a.point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-:

tions advanced by the Committee. If and when we reach the

ultimate confrontation over the possible disclosure of

informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by

any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect

our informants to provide the Committee with necessary

evidence and information.

That balance, at least at this

stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under

discussion.

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally

to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the

Committee is preparing for public hearings in the near future,

and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on

my representations that we were making immediate efforts to .

respond, we should not delay our response to the committee.

Therefore, I am sending a copy of this reguest to the attorney

General.

If the Bureau disagrees with my determination and

decides

not to comply with my decision, your response should

be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved

quickly.

SUBJECT:

Habert i Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Request for Memphis Field Office Files

RLK:mal

By letter dated July 5, 1978, directed to the Attorney

General, the Select Committee has repeated its request for

access

to the Memphis, Tennessee, field office informant files

concerning informants in the Invaders, a black militant group

It is my judgment, as Special Counsel for the

Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to

excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief

Counsel, Professor G. Robert Blakey. I have made an oral

request

to have the files processed

and this is to request

that this task be completed as soon as possible and

that

Professor Blakey be provided access to the processed files.

As you are aware, we had, by letter of June 13, 1978,

previously refused the request of the Committee. I concurred

in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact

that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee

for access to the

field office files rested on naked allega-

tions which had been denied in the past.

In the Committee's

latest demand, presented by the July 5 letter, the Committee,

on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail

the justification for its request.

While it may be our juag-

ment that the information set forth by the Committee is not

sufficient to substantiate the allegations made about the

activities of the informants at issue, it is equally clear

that we can no longer take the position that the Committee's

legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula-

tion and/or naked allegations.

That being the case, the

limited access outlined above should be granted in response

to the Committee's request.

I am, of course, aware of the deep concern held by the

Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing to

disclose informants or release information which will lead

to their disclosure.

I share that concern and my decision

in this matter has been reached only with the greatest

possible consideration of that concern.

In addition to the further justification submitted by

the committee for their reyuest,

I believe there are other

factors which support my conclusirn that we should provide

the limited access discussed. An important factor is that,

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue, ubpoenas for the informant

files.

The only way we coul?

anund to such subpoenas other

than by providing the reques. . information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a feieral court.

while this type

of confrontation may ultimate y be neressary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer

the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant

files by the entixe staff thereby increasing the possibility

that the informants could be compromised through the knowledge

of the members of the staff who häve :tudied the other files

In the matter in greater detail and,.1 any case, would broaden..

the number of individuals who could learn the identity of the

informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevuil in the litigation, a

possibility which, in my juagment, is remote given the subject

matter of the Committee's inquiry ind the allegations and

information that formed the basis of their request, we can

only win if we show a reasonable po:ture to the court. An

absolute refusal to comply would no: do that. An attempt

to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests

by providing limited access to exciscd files would do that.

Further support ior the procerire of providing limitec

access stems from the very nature of the Committee's investi-

gation. Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or

Milawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets

or subjects of the investigation.

our obligation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible

with the congress is obvious. The public conception oi our

cooperation is going to be a

very important factor in the

acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts

and determinations in there irvestigations.

To put ourselves

in a posture of confrontation with the Committee over this

accommodation

to revive all the

allegations and criticisms of us and our actions concerning

tie assassinations.

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of

this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more

subject to public comment and criticism. The present interest

in, and repeated stories related to, the allegations in the

case of Mr. Rowe makes this one of

the worst times to come

--

to .a.point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-

tions advanced by the Committee.

If and when we reach the

ultimate confrontation over the possible disclosure of

informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by

any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect

our informants to provide the Committee with necessary

evidence and information.

That balance, at least at this

stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under

discussion.

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally

to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the

Committee is preparing for public hearings in the near future,

and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on

my representations that we were making immediate efforts to

respond, we should not delay our response to the Committee.

Therefore, I am sending a copy of this request to the Attorney

General.

If the Bureau disagrees with my determination and

Bureau diso

decides not to comply with my decision, your response should

be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved

quickly.

Reference is nade to your letter dated July 24, 1978,

In rexponse to your request in referenced letter,

Memphis Field Office Illes of five informants, who reported

on activitias of the Invaders, are being processed by the

Congressional Inguiry Unit (CIU), Records Management Division,

FBI Beadquarters (PBIHQ). As indicated in referenced letter,

excised verzions of these files will bo made available only

You will be advised when file processing is completaa.

Elles Involved total 47 sections.

In referenced letter, you advised you shared the

FBI's concern regarding the release of these files.

Based

on this concern and belleving your position to be sound, a

representative of the CIU, subseguent to receipt of referenced

letter, informally furnished you a list of points against

making these files available.

On July 27, 1978, you advised that you revlewed our

arguments and found them persuasive, but stili bellevea the

decision as outlined in referenced letter was the best course

of action in this matter.

However, you desired to use our

Congressman Louis B. Stokes, Chalrman, ISCA, dated July 5, 1978.

You asked that this information be furnished you on a formal

basis.

=.

As stated in our letter to Congiessman Stokes

dated June 13, 1978, 11 It becomes general knowledge that FBI

informant files are

being opened to outside parties, Informant

privilege is threatened and our informant developuent program

can be severely hampered. Despite the ESCA'& statement in

the letter from Congressman Stokes that It is not seeking

the informants' identities at this time, this 18 not the

central issue in point.

The central lague 1u the principle

of opening a field office informant file to outside parties.

2. The USCA was provided accass to FBIHQ files

concerning informants who reported on the Invaders.

Although the ESCA feels these were administrative in

nature, the policy of the Bureau at that time rogulred that

all information of a substantive nature be furnished to fBIHQ.

Data such as informant's travel, anount of payments and a

summary of background material are examples of such infor-

mation provided to FBIHo.

Therefore, FBIHQ feels that Its

files contain significant information concerning the operation

of any informant.

3. All information of substance concerning the

Invaders organization furnished by these informants would be

reported in the Invaders file at EBIHQ.

The uSCA has had

access to this file since December, 1977. The ESCA has

shown no Interest in reviewing the

Memphis Field Office

file concerning the Invaders, a file which would contain

all reports from informants covering the Invaders.

would appear logical to examine this file in detall prlor

to pressing fox files of informants, none of whom were

even members of the Invaders at the time of or prior to

King's assassination.

Review of FBIQ informant files nas restricted

to MI. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ESCA,

and not to his staff because, since the staff had access

to the Invaders file at FBIHQ, their knowledge of the

organization could possibly result in idantification of

¿niormants through a cross checking of the ílles.

Subsequent

to MI. Blakey's review of the informant files, the FBIKQ

Invaders file was delivarad to the lisca on July 6, 1978. don"

HI. Robert I. Kauch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

MI. Blakey himself has access to the substantive Invaders

file, and, similarly, his possible new knonlodge could result

In sourco identification if allowed access to field office

files.

on July 11 and 18, 1978, all live Iniormante

ware contacted to determine it they would permit disclosure

of their identification to the HSCA. All declined.

E. Following his review of FBIHe files on

May 19, 1978, Mr. Blakey told agents present that he found

no evidence that any of our informants acted an "agent

provocateuis."

He furnished notes taken during his raview

to FBIHQ and requested the notes be maintained by the FBI

for possible future use in writing into his final report a

paragraph to the effect he had found no evidence that any of

those informants had Instigated violence. He made no reguest

at that time to review field office informant Illes. It is

possible that MI. Blakey is satisfied with the review of

FBIHQ Intormant filas.

7. The FBI desires to maintain consistency

with regard to our position in this matter. In our letter

to Congrossman Stokes datad June 13, 1978, access to these

files was denied. This position was decided upon after

careful deliberation between interested divisions in the

IBi and, in our view, the HSCA has proviued no basis to cause

a change of this position.

Providing the uscA access to iield office

informant files, although excised, could serve as an

undesirable precedent for other outside groups to review

such files.

9. Because of the large number of axcisions

In these fides to protect the identities or intormants,.

It is unlikely the HSCA will be satisfied with its review,

1í grantaõ.

It will probably ask for fewer excisions and/

ot the identities of the informants.

10. Pinally, the lotter from Congressman Stokes

dated July 5, 1918, has been analyzed at EBIla and, generally.

it is not believed it containg additional Intornation giving

substance to the allegation that our informants acted as

"agent provocateurs."

specifically, the following points are

noted:

a. The letter states (pages 1 and 4) that the

#SCA had access to relevant Bureau personnel and has conducted.

extensive interview among those who may also be subjects of

this aspect of the Committee's investigation. The Committee

claima noad to revlew the files to determine if the written

Iecord supports or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant

questions.

However, the letter offers no specific results

of intervions of personnel or othars concerning the basic

allogation.

It has not identified any specific Individual

who has furnished information bearing on this allegation.

b. The letter states (page 4) that based on

Liald Interviens with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis at the time of the march, the

"Invaders were in fact a proximate cause of the violonce."

This 18 not new inforuation.

The FBINQ file concerning the

Invaders and sedia reports issued then and more recently verily

the Invaders culpability ragarding violence during the march.

The lettar also states (page 4) that "It 18 universally

balleved that the Invader followers who caused the violance

Mera paid PBI operatives." The FBI considers this statement

a swasping generalization and again the Committee offers

no specifio identities of Individuals who believed those

causing violence were FBI informants.

Other than articles

appearing in "Neusday" magazine in 1976 and, more recently,

statements by lark lane and possibly former nembers of the

Invaders, who else shares this bellet?

The letter fxom

Congressman Stokes identifies no one.

c. This letter states (page 1) that the "Mamphis

Fold office had prior knowledge of impending violence la

fact memorialized in IBI documenta)."

This statement

Implies the FBI knew of violence because its informants

vero instructad to instigato violence. However, as shown

In our silas, IBI knowledge of impending violence was based

on information from varlous informants and officials,

resulting from a tense situation brought about by the

Sanitation Horkers Strlko, all of which made knowledge of

Impending violence rather obvious.

The letter states (pages 4 and 5) that "nembers

of the Invaders were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting

the crowd and readying weapons from signposts la fact later

testified to under oath by these agents)."

A Iaviow of the

Invaders and informant files at FBIlll disclosad that sone

of the informants were nambers of the Invaders at the time

violence occurred. Only one of these five informants was

ever a member and that was subraguent to the assassination.

The letter statos (page 5) that "Professor

Blakey's review of the files revealed that at least one

informant subraguently joined a nore violence-prone

organization.*

It i8 assuned this statement 18 to demonstrate

the informant's propensity for violence.

However, the FBI

belleves that king's death and the rioting that followed

Intensified racial feeling and tended to make some organiza-

tions more violent.

Therefore, it 18 logical that whatever

organization our informant was rodirected into, it sould be

more violence prone.
