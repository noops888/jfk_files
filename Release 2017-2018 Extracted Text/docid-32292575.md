SPECIAL INVESTIGAT.

* DIVISION

During February, 1965,

efforts were

made by Chicago top hoodlum Gus

Alex to have the

Swiss authorities lift a ban which

they had

interposed against his entry to Switzerland.

It was learned in confidence from Swiss

authorities that letters in support of Alex's

appeal had been received from Senator Dirksen

and Congressman Dawson of Illinois. Chicago

"Sun Times" reporter developed the information

from his sources and learned

from Alex and his

attorney that the latter had solicited these

letters from the Senator and the Congressman.

The reporter interviewed Dawson who reportedly

admitted to having written such letter.

Senator Dirksen, on the other hand, denied

having any knowledge of a letter being written/

on his behalf and denied knowing Alex. The

reporter has prepared a feature article on this

situation. which is expected will receive con-

siderable publicity at some time in the near

future.

It is noted Swiss authorities advised

June 22, 1967, that the ban has remained in

force as a result. of information

received

the swiss

from Chicago

authorities
