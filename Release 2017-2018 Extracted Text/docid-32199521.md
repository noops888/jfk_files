MEDIA RELATIONS

RESPONSE TO CRITICISM OF FBI

CONCERNING ACTIONS TAKEN

AGAINST MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

During the recent past, there have been many allega-

tions in the media concerning the FBI and actions taken by the

FBI against Martin Luther King. Jr.

In order to assist you in responding to inquiries,

not only from the media but also to questions posed to you

during public appearances, I am setting forth some of the more

frequent allegations, together with responses which have been

made in regard to these allegations. You may feel free to

utilize these responses whenever the subject of Martin Luther

King arises.

(Do not type BEYOND

THIS MARGIN.)

involved--the early and mid-1960's--not. today.

Those were years

of considerable racial strife throughout the Nation when sub-

versive and other disruptive elements were attempting to

capitalize for their advantage on the social awakening in our

country on the civil rights issue.

Media, congressional and public criticism of our

investigation of King have occurred in the following major

areas:

RE: MEDIA RELATIONS

ALLEGATION: The FBI had no valid basis

for investigating

King.

RESPONSE: This is not true.

The FBI had a valid

basis for investigating King to determine the extent of communist

influence being exerted upon him.

However, for reasons of

national security and ongoing investigations, the FBI is unable

to provide any specifics.

It can also be pointed out that this

communist influence was of concern not only to the FBI, but also

the President and Attorney General of the United States, who

spoke

noted hasonally with king concerning the matter.

It should be

that the bona fide civil rights activities of King were

never under FBI investigation.

ALLEGATION: That the FBI conducted illegal electronic

surveillances of King.

RESPONSE: This is not true. All electronic surveil-

lances of King were legal.

ALLEGATION: The FBI mailed an anonymous tape and

letter to King.

According to interpretation by various individuals

in

the media and the Senate Intelligence Committee, contents of

this letter suggested King commit suicide.

RESPONSE: There is no record in the official FBI files

to verify that any mailing of anonymous letter or tape recording

to King was an official FBI action or with FBI approval. As to

the suggestion that the letter sent to King urged his suicide,

we can find no basis for any conclusion that the anonymous letter

urged King's suicide and we do not know what the letter urged.

All we do know is that the draft, or original of what might have

been the letter, was found in papers left at the FBI by a former

Bureau official.

ALLEGATION: The FBI played tapes of monitored King

conversations to persons outside the FBI.

RESPONSE: There is nothing in the files of the FBI to

substantiate such

an allegation.

Airtel to SAC, Albany

RE:

MEDIA RELATIONS

ALLEGATION: Information developed during our

investigation of King

was disseminated outside the Executive

Branch of Government.

RESPONSE: This is true.

Although our primary dissemi-

nation regarding King was made within the Executive Branch, there

was some limited dissemination to other U. S. Government elements

such as Congressmen. In several instances, on a highly selective

basis, dissemination was made outside the Federal Government to

leaders in religious, academic and news media fields. Dissemina- •

tion did not include playing of any tapes.

ALLEGATION: The FBI conducted

a campaign to discredit

and neutralize King.

RESPONSE: The FBI during its investigation of King

initiated

actions,

including several under our Counterintelligence

Programs, to neutralize and discredit King. There was no

statutory basis for such actions.

As to the possible motive for

the activity, because of reasons of privacy and delicacy, possible

motive is not proper subject for public discussion.

ALLEGATION:

. That the FBI was in some way involved

in the assassination of King.

RESPONSE: False. There is no evidence to support

such an allegation.
