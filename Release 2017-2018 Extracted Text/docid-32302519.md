GABRIEL MANNARINO, aKa

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

AR

It is noted that PG 545-C advised that as of the early

1950's he knew PHILLIP BETTOR to be the bookkeeper of

MANNARINO organization as regards: their Income from illegal

sources.

This informant now is not certain as to whether

or not BETTOR currently maintains, books but has no reason

to believe he does not.

on 5/10/61, informants and sources of the Pittsburgh office,

familiar with some phases of the MANNARINO activities,

were alerted to develop as much information as possible

regarding BETTOR's activities, associates, habits and

travel.

The above information, when received, will be

reviewed with a view towards determining the possibility

of contacting a highly confidential source who might reveal

whether or not BETTOR is still the MANNARINO bookkeeper.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
