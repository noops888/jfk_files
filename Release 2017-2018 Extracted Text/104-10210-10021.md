Ia that NOSENKO

trivelled in a rather influential circle of frlends in

All these

cited a, reasons

for NOSENKO being an

"Irportant catch"

for drerican

Intelligence, but no one

really knows exactly

how nuch information NOSENKO

- had concerning the KGB.

29 June 196:

• COLIISYN (Eron personal

acquaintance): NOSENKO, che son

of the former Minister of Shipbuilding,

waS & KGB

afficer

who had worked in the American

Department and the Seventh

Department of the Second Chief

Directorate.

GOLITSYN, while

on his own Flost Chief Directorate Dudlnese, met NOSENKO CHo

of three times in the American

Embassy Section in 1953,

and had seen hin occasionally at work during 1958 and 1959.

When COLITSY: asked him where he was working in 1959, NOSENKO

replied that he was assigned to the Seventh Department.

NOSENKO served in the American

Embasay Section

from 1953

until 1957 or 1958, and Was

specifically responathle for

KGB coverage of Ancrican ailitary personnel In Moscow during

1953.

For the remainder. of hio gervice in the Embasy Seetion

untll 1957 or 1958, NOSENKO may have had the same responsl

bilitles or may have been working againat other Embasay

personnel or correspondente, but he was definitely in the

American Departuent during the

entire period.

In 1957 01

1958 NOSENKO was transferred

to

che

Sevench Department, and

was a senior case officer there as of 1959.

NOSENKO did not

work in the Arerican Department

of the Second Chief Directorate

American

Department at any time during 1960; GOLIISYN vialted

the Embassy Section

on at least. three occasions from early

1960 to early 1961,
