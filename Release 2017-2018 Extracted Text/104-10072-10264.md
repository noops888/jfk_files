FRONT OF THE ESCAMERAY (SEGUNDO FRENTE DEL ESCAMARAYO SENE).

THESE LEADERS WERE PRIMARILY CONCERNED WITH THEIR PERSONAL AMBI

TIONS TO HEAD AN EXILE COVERNMENT AND WERE NOP PREPARED TO SUB-

MERGE THEIR INTERESTS IN A SUFFICIENTLY EROAD REPRESENTATION.

IN LESTAD'S VIEW, AN EXILE GOVERNMENT MUST MAVE THE SUPPORT OF A

BROAD MAJORITY OF THE EXILES AND ITS LEADERS SHOULD BE MEN WHOSE

NAMES WOULD COLANAND RESPECT AND CONFIDENCE ON THE PART OF

ELEMENTS WITHIN THE FRESENT CASTRO REGIME WHO MIGHT BE INDUCED TO...

OVERTHROW CASTRO. THE ESSENTIAL FURPOSE OF SUCH AN EXILE GOVERN

MENT WAS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE DESIGNED TO ENCOURAGE

A REBELLION INSIDE CUBA. LEITAO SAID IT WAS NECESSARY TO FOSTER

DIFFERENCES AMONG THE GROUPS IN THE CASTRO REGIME UNTIL THESE

DIFERENCES ERUPTED IN VIOLENCE.

Z. LEITAO SAID THAT CARLOS MARQUEZ STERLING WAS TOO CLOSELY

ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLITICAL INTERESTS OF BATISTA. FOR EXAMPLE

MARQUEZ MENTIONED EUSEBIO MUJAS BAFNIOL, LABOR LEADER UNDER

CATISTA, GUILLERMO BELTO FORMER AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON UNDER

BATISTA, AND JOSE ELEUTERIO PEDRAZA, FORMER BATISTA AFIAY OFFICER,

AS PRINCIPAL FIGURES OF HIS PROFOSZO GOVERNMENT. LEITAO REMARKED

IN A SARCASTIC VEIN THAT SUCH NAMES WOULD HARDLY INSPIRE CONFIDENCE

IN THE ELEMONTS INSIDE CUBA UFON WHOM THE EXILES WOULD HAVE TO

DEPEND FOR THE OVERTHROW OF CASTRO.

3. BEITAO SAID CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS WAS THE BEST QUALIFIED

AMONG THE LEADERS WHO HAD TALKED TO WIM BUT THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL

HO LEITAO MENTIONED ERIEPLY THAT ME HAD TALIED TO MANOLO RAY.

WHO HAD APPEARED WELL ADJUSTED BUT STILL BELIEVED HE COULD CARRY

OUT, RESISTANCE ACTIVITIES WITHIN CUBA, WHICH LEITAO BELIEVED

C IMPOSSIBLE IN VIEW OF THE TERROR AND TIGHT SECURITY MEASURES EMPLOYED

P

BY THE CASTRO REGIME. ANDRES NAZARIU SARGENT ALSO TALKED TO LEITAO..

Y

NAZARIO'S THINKING WAS QUITE SIMILAR TO RAY'S.

5. ON 21 DECEMBER IS64-ÁNDRES NAZARIO SARGENT SAID HE TALKED

TO VASCO LEITAO DA CUNHA IN. WASHINGTON ON 2S0 DECEMBER. NAZARIO
