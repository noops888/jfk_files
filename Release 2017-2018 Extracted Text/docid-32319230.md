Dear Ms. Keeley:

This is in response to your letter dated May 30, 1997, requesting Commission review of

portions of one unclassified FBI document (FBI File No. 105-100081-155, MM Report, dated

12/18/64, two pages consisting of pages one and four of the document) and of one FBI

document classified SECRET (FBI File No. 105-100081-81, HQ Airtel, dated 04/23/63. two

pages consisting of pages one and two of the document). You indicated that the review was

being sought to determine whether any information contained in the designated portions

should be deleted prior to permanent transfer of the documents to the National Archives. You

ask that we cite the relevant provisions of the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act (JFKARCA) with regard to any deletions deemed appropriate and advise you

whether classification is still warranted. For internal procedural Commission accounting

purposes, your request was handled as a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request with the

above number assigned.

We have reviewed the portions of the documents referred to above and have determined that

no deletions are necessary or appropriate. With regard to classification, we do not see any

need for the portions of the SECRET document to be classified. We note, however, that the

Commission does not have original classification authority, but only derivative authority

based on prior classification actions by other agencies. Thus, we defer to the FBI regarding

any continuing need to maintain SECRET or other classification on the one classified

document referred to above. All of the documents sent to us are being returned and are

enclosed

628-49-102-9205-1836

Sincerely,

Leung it. Sake
