Mr. Goldsmith: Miss Goodpasture, I am going to state

ducted on April 13, 1978. We are taking testimony today in

Resolution 222, 1 am

Before 1 take your statement concerning the various

questions the committee

has of you, let me take care of some

procedural matters.

Are you hear voluntarily today and without a subpoena?

Miss Goodpasture: Yes.

Mr. Goldsmith: Have you received a copy of the .com-

mittee Rules

right to receive a copy of the statement that you give us

at a deposition.

I am going to ask you to give up that right

to

receive a copy of your statement and let me explain to you

why. If you were appearing before the committee at Executive

Session as you did in April, the committee Rules do not pro-

vide for you to receive actually in your possession the trans-

cript from the hearings. As

a matter of convenience to you

and

also because of the committee's relationship with the

agency, we are taking this statement in the form of a depo-

sition.

The agency has requested us to ask its present and former

employees to give up the right that they have under the com-

mittee Rules to receive a copy of the transcript because there

was classified information in the transcript, and for you to

have the transcript in your personal

possession would be

contrary to security interests.

Now, I want to make it very clear though that even

though we are asking you to give up your right to receive

copy of the transcript, you are not giving up your right to

"get access to the transcript. In other words, you have the

right to read it and we can arrange for that at any time.

are simply asking you to give up your right to receive a

copy of it. Do you understand that?

Miss Goodpasture: Yes.

May I ask you something?

Mr. Goldsmith: Certainly.

Miss Goodpasture: Can the agency receive a copy of the

transcript, the Inspector General's office, so that they

would know in case I make a statement which is not true based

on faulty memory. If there is no objection to the committee,

I would like for some responsible person

in the agency to

know what my testimony is so that they could check to see

whether my memory is faulty.

Mr. Goldsmith: I understand.

Miss Goodpasture: But I don't know.. I just wanted to

raise that question.

Mr. Goldsmith: The Committee Rules do not provide for

the witness' testimony to be made available to a third per-

son such as the agency. The agency, if it is interested

in

receiving a copy of your testimony, would ask the committee

and the committee would then take a vote on whether or not

your testimony should be released.

Now, by you indicating on the record that you prefer for

the agency to have access to the material, the benefactor would

20

¿have an effect on the committee's vote.

21

I should

also add that if the Committee ultimately de-

22

pends to some extent upon your testimony and uses that testi-

23

mony to make a finding of fact, we would as a matter of

24

routine tell the agency in advance and if the agency has a

25

problem

with that, they can get back to us.

Well, I was responsible for the day-to-day handling

for that reason, a lot of the people came to me and asked

Let me ask you this: What was Mr. Scott's reputation

for professional competence, integrity and honesty?

Well, reputation. To me, I felt that he was honest.

I•

had no reason to ever believe that he was dishonest.

I

think he had a PhD. in history. He had extensive government

service before he was sent there. He was assigned by the

Director, Mr. Dulles, at the time, over a number of people who

had been in Latin America in posts that they thought would

leave that chief of station assignment, so there was no

reason for me to ever doubt that he was highly qualified, in

my opinion. Now, I cannot speak. for how other people felt

about him.

O: In your personal working relationship with him, did

you find him to be a very competent and honest man?

A. Yes. The ambassador called on him almost every

day. I think we went through five ambassadors during the time

that I was there and his relationship. with all of them was

the same.

In 1963, was the Mexico City station the largest

Q

And it was considered to be a very

important

station?

A I think so. I don't know how headquarters per-

sonnel considered it but in my opinion, it was.

Q

When did Mr. Scott retire, approximately?

I came home in 1968 and I think that he retired in

June, 1969.

Q

Do you know why he retired?

A It was my understanding that he retired because he

had been asked

to stay in Mexico until December, 1970. He had

asked me to stay in Mexico until December, 1970 because I had

been there for a long period of time and it was easier to keep

someone there than it was to break in a new person. At that

time, the president was Diaz Ordaz and his term expired

in

December, 1970.

I wanted to return to the States because

my

parents were both not well and I had been outside the

United States for the better part of some 28 years, and I

wanted to be near them in their very old age.

I also wanted to take advantage of early retirement at

20

lage

50 because I wanted to do something else with my life.

21

Mr. Scott let me come back and he came to the states

22

later.

I came home at the end of 1968. He came to the States

23

later on consultation or something and he had decided to re-

24

tire because he received an administrative message saying

25

that he was age 60 and he was eligible; that was mandatory

O so, how would you describe his position towards the

agency when he left?

A Well, at the time that he left, I think he felt

that he wanted to stay on in Mexico, that he was on

good re-

lations as far as I know with the Director because he was

given a medal and he came up to receive that. The agency

also, I think, was considering using him in an undercover

capacity outside.

Q

So although he was initially annoyed by having re-

ceived this administrative notice, by the time he left the

agency, he was favorably disposed towards it; is that correct?

A I think so. I think he just decided, well, he would

go ahead and retire while the present administration in

Mexico was still there and they could help him with his im-

migration papers, which took months to get under a new ad-

ministration, and

it would be easier for him to get settled

in

and if there was any question in Washington about whether

they wanted him to stay or whether they did not, it really

didn't matter. I don't know but that is my feeling about

what happened.

Q

After his retirement, Mr. Scott stayed in Mexico

A In April, 1977 but this was never discussed with me.

Mr.

scott had no knowledge of this if he wrote it.

Let me identify this for the record. It is marked

Folder Number 1, Chapter 24 from draft manuscript of "The

Foul Foe," the book which purports to be a book of the writer's

career in intelligence. The writer is lan Maxwell, believed

to be the pen name of Mr. Win Scott.

Now, you testified that Mr. Scott was

a competent

individual and an honest man. Would you comment upon the

accuracy of the contents of this manuscript?

A Well, to me it appears that he was writing this for

sales appeal and as far as I could tell, it does conflict

with the records... I don't know, but I think that this may

have been several years after he stopped working or certainly

long time after the assassination occurred or the investi-

gation occurred and maybe his memory was faulty; I don't know,

but I think it conflicts with what we have.

What sections of the manuscript conflict with the

record? Let's go through it.

A Well, it leads one to believe that we had photo-

graphs here. He says that he is known to have visited both

the Soviet Embassy and the Cuban Consulate. Well, we con-

cluded from the conversations that he actually went to this

Soviet Embassy but I didn't see any actual proof that he was

in the soviet Embassy from the records.

Now, one telephone call was made, as

I remember,

From the Cuban Embassy but I don't think he made a telephone

call to the Soviet Embassy.

I may be wrong but I don't think

he did. That is one instance.

Q What proof did

you have

that he went to the Cuban

Embassy or Consulate?

A .

He made a call from inside the Cuban Embassy and we

picked it up on the telephone tap line from the Cuban Em-

bassy. I should clarify that by saying a person whose voice

was considered to be the same by the transcriber made the

call and the conversation in that call was in continuity with

previous conversation in which he identified himself.

Here is another place that I don't think can be

checked out with the records.

"Persons watching these

embassies photographed Oswald as he entered each one and

clocked the time that he spent on each vitis."

As far as my mrmory goes, we never photographed

Oswald or identified a person

as Oswald entering or leaving

either place.

I said we--the people--that I didn't see

any

information to that effect.

O: Are there any other sections of that manuscript that

you think are inaccurate?

A .There may be. You have to take it sentence by.

sentence to check with the record, which I have done, but

I

point those two things out.

Excuse me. So, the section here where it states:

18

"This contact became important after the Warren Commission

19

report on the assassination of President Kennedy was published

20

¡for on page 777 of that report the erroneous statement was

21

made that it was not known that Oswals has visited the Cuban

22

Embassy until after the assassination! Every piece of infor-

23

mation concerning Lee Harvey Oswald was reported immediately

24

after it was received to U.S. Ambassador Thomas Mann," et

went over

those records so many times and made so many trans-

lations that it is hard to distinguish between the time after

that defector cable was received and the assassination in-

vestigation, but after the defector cable was received we did

try to get all the information together.

Q

Let me show you at this time CIA Document 243,

which is a copy of an article dated 21 October 1964 and

specifically there is a paragraph in there that reads:

"The investigators also are trying to determine why

the CIA and its pre-assassination report to the State Depart-

ment on Oswald's trip to Mexico City gave details only of the

defector's visit to the Russian Embassy and not the Cuban

Embassy.. The CIA did not report the latter visit until

after

Kennedy's assassination in Dallas."

Thank you.

Let me show you CIA Number 183, which is the head-

cable that was sent to the Mexico City

station--I am sorry, this is the Mexico City station copy of

that cable. You may recall that we have shown it to you

before. This is the one that makes reference to Oswald as Lee

Henry Oswald and Win Scott apparently drew an arrow and wrote

down "sic," underlined, pointing to

the middle name "Henry."

Now, the committee has received testimony that this

notation was made prior to the assassination and we have

here on the one hand a manuscript where Scott says that

Oswald spelled his name slowly and clearly, and we have here

Scott aware apparently that Oswald's middle name was not

Henry. Does that suggest to you that perhaps there was a

transcript where Oswald did spell his

name slowly and clearly?

2

A Well, I don't think so because I saw those trans-

3

cripts before Mr. Scott did. The way the paper-work

ran was

4

that those transcripts were given to the outside contact who

5

brought them to me. I looked at them and in case

of someone

7

who

was speaking in Russian or a language that the monitors

could not transcribe at the listening post, that one copy

of that transcript and the tape went immediately to the person

9

handling the other transcriber.

10

In the case of the soviets it would have been Mr.

11

Manell. Sometimes the outside person could take that tape to

12

the transcriber but I don't recall any instance when Mr. Scott

13

saw the transcript before I did and I don't think that he

14

spelled his name

slowly and carefully. That is not the way

I

15

remember it.

you have referred to as being in conflict or--let me see if

Are you

saying that they are inaccurate because of

• And

essentially you are indicating that this manu-

script prepared by Mr. Scott is exaggerated?

In my opinion, it is. The only thing that we could

compare it with is the record of events.

Q Why would Mr. Scott have any reason to exaggerate

these things?

A ..

Pardon me?

O Why would Mr. Scott have any reason to exaggerate

these matters?

A He had written books for sale and I think that he

probably felt that it would have more sales appeal. That is

my guess.

He had published a couple of books. I don't know

how many books he published but I received a flyer of two

books that he had published and I didn't bother to read

them.

Then it goes on.

Now in this first paragraph scott is trying to dis-

they suddenly became known Soviet

I felt

that was an exaggeration, that they may have been going there

to get propaganda, and I discussed those things with him.

Q

Did Mr. Scott maintain a personal safe?

A He maintained several personal safes but I think he

had

about three or four.

Q. Where?

A He kept them in the office. Some of them had very

sensitive coded materials in them

that he had custody of and

he dealt directly with headquarters on. Some of those pro-

jects I worked on that were not related to this investiga-

tion.

He

also.had a personal safe in his home.

What type of materials did he keep in that safe?

A Well, now I never inspected the materials in that

safe at his home.

•I know that from time to time he took

classified documents from the office home to work on them at

night.

I don't know whether he brought all the copies back

with him.

After he died, at the time of his death, I went

to a man who was then Director of Counter-intelligence and

told him that I thought there might be classified documents

in his home.. Some of those documents I was told were later

turned over to the Station Chief and sent back to Washington.

not written a page of that history.

His

name was Brady, B-R-A-D-Y. I came back from

Mexico and they told me that I had to write it. I tried to

cooperate in working on it.

To satisfy headquarters' requirement.

When they asked you to prepare the history, with

what goal in mind did they ask you to prepare it?

A

Pardon me?

Q When they asked you to prepare the history, they

must have explained to you what purpose they had in mind, why

they wanted the history to be written.

A They didn't ask me to prepare it; I was ordered to

prepare it and it was from a headquarters director.

Q. When they ordered you to prepare the history, they

must have told you what were important factors to consider in

writing a history. Did they just ask you to write a history

without giving you any guidance at all?

A.

There was a

historian who was brought in, I think,

from Michigan, one of the large universities, who had several

general discussions about how to write history and how to

coordinate material, but there was no one there immediately

above me with any experience in research or in writing a

history. I did it mostly. on my own.

And you do not know why these station histories are

prepared?

A.

No, unless it was just to make it easy for briefing

material for people who were going there.

I would like to show you at this time CIA Number

and ask you

if you can identify this document?

Now, I was told that this would not be used in any

to call attention to the names of people.

giving this

testimony in April?

Yes.

Q

Please read that document.

I didn't remember my precise answers but I think

they are still valid as far as my memory goes now.

I don't think I ever saw this before.

Q

Have you read both

pages?

Yes. That second page, in the middle '60's there

was a proposal

to reorganize the station and I was going to

be given a job as executive officer or personal

assistant to

the chief of station to create a slot so that I would be given

a

promotion.

My personnel file, perhaps over at the headquarters

records, may reflect that but it never came about. One of

the reasons that I wanted to retire was that they talked about

the

job. but they

never gave it to me.

Q

• So in. fact you are saying that you were not a spec-

ial

assistant to the chief of Station?

• Not in reality.except for those projects which I

worked

on and he made the decisions on. What I mean by that

know except that I am sure that the other people did not want

to do it because they didn't want to be sitting here talking

to you and discussing it.

Q Now, we have taken a great deal of testimony from

various other agency employees and I would like to ask you to

comment about some of their testimony in which they character.

¡ze you specifically.

Question by. Mr. Goldsmith:

"Was Ann Goodpasture

acting in a supervisory capacity with regard to the liaison

operations?

"Mr. White: That is very difficult to say. That

is very difficult to say. She carried with her a lot of

invisible authority that devolved upon her because of her

operational relationship with the

Chief of station who had

absolute confidence in her. She had a marvelous memory; she

was meticulous in detail; I think he had every reason to put

that kind of trust in

her.

"She reported directly to him and while she may not

have been invested with any command authority by virtue of

her position at the station, certainly she was a kind of un-

official deputy for the purposes of the operations that she

was involved in.

"For example, we had this old ex-FBI guy on the

outside who worked with the Mexicans with the taps and when

Ann spoke to George Munro and said something to him, George

knew damn well it had the backing of the chief of station.

If he didn't, he could go around and check it out.

"Let me rephrase the question. Upon which indi-

viduals did he tend to rely the most?

"Mr. Shaw: He had one deputy who was Alan White.

As far as reliance on other people, I would say he relied

very heavily on Ann Goodpasture, not in any way in a command

function, but as a girl Friday."

Miss Goodpasture: I would rather be a girl

Friday than a right-hand man.

(Laughter.)

Well, I made more of those statements as those

people saw it in their relationship with Mr. Scott's pro-

jects. They are true the way they saw it but I had no

responsibility outside the projects that we worked on, but

the liaison projects and the telephone tapping project touched

every operation in the Mexico station.

A No. Well, yes, I had contact. I had a call from

Russell Holmes who told me that he could not locate some

photographs and he wanted me to come up before. I testified,

that I would have to testify. Mr. Leader told me that I

would have to testify. When I came in, I thought I would be

seeing someone for an interview.

In the corridor I saw Mr. Manell and he asked me

what I was doing here and I said I was going tò

talk to him.

He said, "We all had to talk to them but don't worry because

they are only going to ask you about some of the details that

are down there in the records. " He was the only one that

had already talked to you. The others had their dates set up

or something; I don't remember precisely what dates.

Q

questions that were asked of him?

A He said generally they want to know about what hap-

pened down there and the things you will know the answers

to

and the photographs. I don't recall anything specific,

any specific questions.

O After your testimony in April, did you have con-

tact with anyone from the agency about that testimony?

said. I didn't discuss the testimony with anyone I recall

over here. I discussed this document with the Inspector

went into Mr. Holmes' office that it was really rough or

something like that but we didn't go into many details.

Q Have you had any contact with the agency prior to

your testimony today?

A Yes.. I came in Tuesday, called you from the edge

of town. When I arrived at my friend's home she said,

"Someone is trying to call you; his name is George somebody."

The name didn't mean anything to me. The next morning a man

who identified himself as George Joannides called to tell me

that you had been trying to get in touch with me, and I told

him that I had already talked with you and explained to him

that 1 had called your office before I left Dallas and I had

to go to a family funeral.

no other discussions with him.

Washington or in Virginia and do any work for the agency?

pay the agents, what hours they worked, where the meetings

were held.. He hired them; he fired them and he knew the

He brought in the photographs, the product.

dumped it on my desk and he was finished with it. I took

the product film and prints and the contact file and dis-

tributed those.

I could levy any requirements of him or other people

in the station which as he remembered it it might have been

for supervision, but when he was out of town I met with one

agent with his so-called cut-out.

The photo project was first set up by Mr. Mahoney and Mr.

Anderson and they brought the photographs in to me.

A bit of history. It was my understanding that the

reason there were two bases so close together at that time was

so that in case something happened to one--if, for instance,

a

police van moved up there and sat all day and this one had

to stop work, there would be an alternate or if something

happened, we would have another base that could take over.

Q But normally they both would not be working at the

same time?

A

I think they were set up in a way that they alter-

nated. They provided the coverage at different hours.

Q

It would not really make any sense any other way.

A : No.

Q Let me show you some documents which seem to be

consistent with that; in other words, documents which seem

to

be consistent with your testimony. I am first going to

show

you some pages from a document that is a

request for the

approval of a project for the period December, 1960 through

30 November 1961.

Excuse me for a moment.

of this request for project approval from the year 1960--

why don't you read paragraph B. This is requesting renewal

of the project for 1961. This was written in 1960 for

A I cannot remember who was--now, this was when?

Puckett was there as case officer before Tom Keenan came in.

Q

I understand.

Now, drawing your attention to paragraph B, are the

contents of that paragraph accurate?

A .

I think so.

Now, let's take a look at CIA Number 4063 which is

the request for approval of the project for the following year,

and I direct your attention to paragraph B-1. Does that

paragraph indicate that there has been no change in the cov-

erage as described in the 1960 request?

A Yes.

Q. Now, CIA Number 4055, which is the request for the

following year 1962. I draw your attention to paragraph B-1.

Does that paragraph indicate

that to avoid repetition the

station is omitting the usual description of the functions of

these three bases and though they contribute to the above

objective? This was described in detail in the 1960 request

for project renewal.

Is that indicated there?

•It indicates that there was not any change.

Q

Finally, this is the request for approval for the

year 1963, CIA Number 4047.

Q

What

are you referring to?

When we were talking about supervision.

Yes.

A Now, Tom Keenan made his own project renewal re-

quest for the project and his name is not shown in here.

I

made up the ones that I worked with win Scott. This. is not.

consistent with the statement in the efficiency report.

Q

For the record, Miss Goodpasture is referring to

CIA Number 4025.

Now, let me refer you to CIA Number 4047, which is

the request for project approval for the year 1963 and

specifically to paragraph B-1.

Yes.

There was no change.

• So, in essence, these documents support your testi

mony that the coverage was designed to be complementary rather

than duplicative?

Did. either of these photo bases take photographs

of oswald during his visit to

Mexico City?

A

Pardon me?

Q Did either of these photo bases take photographs

of Oswald in his visit to Mexico City in 1963?

Not to my knowledge.

Q Do. you know why?

A I don't think he went there during the hours when

they were working.

Well, we have established from these documents that

the hours essentially were all daylight hours and these docu-

ments also indicate that there was Saturday coverage. Oswald

went there on. Friday and Saturday.

A This project outline was a proposal in theory that

the only way that you can determine when they were actually

working would be to take the location and check the logs

because every time they took a photograph, they turned in

daily report. Every time they made a photograph they put

down the time, the exposure number and what happened. So,

to see when

they

made pictures, they may have

been working and

not made a picture.

O Well, at the very least, we see that these docu-

ments indicate that the station had informed headquarters that

by design these photo bases operate in a

complementary manner

and also that saturday coverage was to be included.

Now, you are saying they may not have been working

that way in

fact but that is what the records indicate?

A That is right. The only way you can tell that they

were actually working would be to check the logs.

Q Miss Goodpasture, are the logs from the LILYRIC

operation

for 1963 available today?

A

..I believe that some of the LILYRIC logs were not

in the files when I checked and we thought that they had

been destroyed when the files were reduced in size.

2 When was that?

A I wrote a memo on that which is in the record based

on what we found

at the time we made the file search.

I am not sure exactly what date it was but the

memorandum which I prepared, and I think you have a copy of it,

which shows the backs of some of the files marked LILYRIC

in this period that were interested in and had been used:

for other photo files. I was not in the Mexico station at

the time that that happened so I don't know how it came

about or why.

Miss Goodpasture, I would like to show you your

testimony before the committee on pages 47 through 51.

I

would like to ask you

to read that testimony and to tell me

if it is still accurate in your mind.

Yes. How far did you want me to read?

Read through page 51.

Right here there is something confusing.

Q

Please read the entire testimony and it is possible

that in context everything will be consistent and clear.

Please read that and then we will let you correct or modify.

A: What I was referring to here when ---

This is page 51.

I thought you were asking me about photographs

made during the time span of the Oswald visit between 27

September and 2 October, when I said one page was missing.

Q. That is what

I was asking you about. . I was con-

A Now, the photographs which were destroyed, there

would have been one page for the 27th of September that would

have been LILYRIC. That one we could not find.

Q But the negatives were still in existence?

A Because at the time that we sent the photograph to

Washington

in 1963, shortly after I think we sent those photo-

graphs to Washington after the assassination, the negatives

of the LILYRIC photographs I believe were forwarded to

Washington; I am

not sure.

O So, the negatives were still in existence but the

photographs you were not able to find.

A : For

that day.

troyed?

Q

I think it was reduction of the files.

Why did they keep the LIMITED photographs and not

the LILYRIC?

I don't know but I will say this: That for the size

of the files, the file room was about four times the size of

this room and you could not walk through there by the time

I

left.

There was a new Station Chief and he didn't have the

same feeling for all of those records that his predecessor

had had and he had a new staff with him.

When

I went back there a

few months after I had left,

you could have played ping pong in the place, there was that

much

paper that had been reduced.

Miss Goodpasture, have you ever heard that

Charlotte Bustos found a photograph of Oswald at CIA head-

quarters?

A

You told me that when I was here in April but I was

not aware of that.

Mr. Goldsmith: I think this may be an appropriate

time for us to break for lunch.

Miss Goodpasture: I think it might.

Mr. Goldsmith: We will break until 1:30.

EXAMINATION

By Mr. Goldsmith:

l I believe that you have a statement, Miss

Goodpasture, that you would like to clarify for the record

at this time?

A Yes. You asked me earlier if I had been in

touch

with anyone from the agency after my last testimony in

April. In July 1978, I believe it was the 15th of July,

a very close friend of mine died, and I came to washington

just for the funeral. While I was here, Scott Breckinridge

called the house and asked if he could come by and see me.

He and Russ Holmes came by,

and he said

that he wanted

to know where the records were, if I could give them any

information to locate any additional records on the photo-

graphs for Cuban and Soviet embassies. He was mainly

interested in Cuban embassy photographs because he thought

that I had given testimony before that was not consistent

with information in the files.

I didn't recall giving specific testimony on

I have before me CIA No. 4087, which is apparently

a

log from the photo coverage, and I would like to ask you on

what basis the report was made that the unidentified man had

been in contact with the embassy on October Ist?

According to the log, it indicates he was there on

October 2nd.

A

I think that the person that wrote the cable -- I

am

not sure who wrote the cable, but I think that when they first

looked at it, they thought that this was the Ist of October,

that everything here was the first of October. He didn't

read the log here.

I But in the original of that log; I should point out

that each day is marked off with a red row.

A

Yes.

@ We have a. Xerox here which doesn't reflect the

fact that this was actually sort of a multicolored document.

A

But that is theionly explanation I have, just

that it was careless reading.. I don't know.

were you the person that went and retrieved that

photograph and made the connection with the date, or wat

it someone else?

A

It could have been me or it could have been the

person who sent the cable, but I usually gave copies of the

photograph to the analysts to do whatever they wanted to

with it.

Because at the time that we got the intercept and

thought we had identified, we passed it to the Chief of

Station and the Deputy Chief of Station, and the men for

the Soviets, Mr. Manell.

Now, we were not supposed to report on American

citizens unless they were subjects of ongoing investigation

and we had permission to pass that information to the FBI.

guess it was because of the civil rights thing, but we just

had a standard regulation that we had

to have permission from

that it was probably. Oswald, but I don't know.

I can't -- I

don't remember who -- how that photograph was connected with

Oswald later. It was

the only person, the only photograph

in the bunch that could have been a non-Latin that day.

Well, let me show you this here. On September 27th

'63, there were two other unidentified American males.

A .

But these people had been there

several times

before. We knew who they were.

How did you know that then?

A

Because of that license plate.. That car: had been

there previously.

What about the individual on line 13?

A

I think that they were Mexicans.

There is a

notation here which says this is a

Mexican man, Gutierrez, license plate changed in February

'64 to Mexican, so and so.

A

Yes, we identified him and I believe he was in a

travel agency.

I am not sure.

But was he identified in 1964, or was he still

unidentified as of September 27th, 1963?

A He had been identified, I think, before. I don't

know, I would have to check the records to be sure. I think

that he had been identified through a previous visit in the

same care with the same Texas plates, and this was another

visit that he had made there.

that that call came from inside the Cuban embassy, calling it

to the attention of someone else would not have been that

significant because of all the other things that we were doing

at the same time.

Ms. Goodpasture, was there a photo surveillance

operation against the Cuban consulate in 1963?

A

There was a photo surveillance capability against

the Cubans. I am not sure if it was located in front of

the Consulate or in

front of the embassy because I didn't

have responsibility for handling any of the Cuban photographs.

Do you know whether this surveillance operation was

able to obtain a photograph of Oswald during his stay in

Mexico City?

A

I don't think it did.

Do you know why it was unable to?

Well, now, that is part of the grey area. I heard,

but I don't recall seeing this in the record, that that

camera was down, not functioning at that time.

2.. Let me show you now a series of documents from

that record which the Committee is attempting to clarify.

And hopefully by showing you these documents,

your memory

may be somewhat refreshed as to what happened. The first

is a document dated 18 October 1963 which is a monthly

report for the month of September 1963 dealing with these

No.

I really wasn't involved in this operation.

This was one that was directed by what they call the Technical

photographs was when they had

a photograph and they wanted to know if that person had gone

activated by motion, and they wanted to know about putting

that in one of the Soviet bases, but it produced a voluminous

amount of film and we couldn't handle it because everybody

that went by triggered the camera.

Thank you.

Turning to another area now, Ms. Goodpasture, did

the Mexico City Station maintain records and files on employees

of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate?

A Yes.

@ How extensive were the Station's filed on Sylvia

Duran, who was the secretary to the Cuban Consul with whom

Oswald had a contact when he applied for a visa?

A. I don't think I looked at that file until I came

back to washington, when I was here for the three months. .

seems to me that it was a couple of volumes.

Q.. Did the Mexico City Station maintain material in the

file concerning Duran's sexual affairs or love life?

A

• The Mexico Station policy on files. was to put a

copy of every bit of information about an individual that came

to their attention in that file.

So that would include those types of matters.

A

That would include everything.

only the case officer would be able to answer because he

would have a better idea of what her reaction would be.

an individual in an assessment, personality assessment so

.. Now, according to this document, a CIA source is

providing information that Oswald may have had sexual affairs

or relations with Sylvia Duran.

Do you recall when the first time was that this

type of information concerning Oswald and. Duran came to the

attention of the Mexico City Station?

A

No.

My only connection with Sylvia Duran that I recall

was the Mexican police picked her up after the assassination

and interrogated her. The man who obtained the interrogation

report gave them to me to carry back to the office.

That

was George Munro whom you mentioned earlier with Mr. White.

He handled that outside project. He was the outside case

officer.

I Did he give you the interrogation report or did he

give you transcripts as well?

A I don't remember because I think that he only

gave me the interrogation reports in Spanish, and I think

Dave Phillips had someone do the translation.

He may have given me the initial report and then

Yes, I think there was a lengthy transcript.

And George Munro was --

A

It had her photograph in it. I think they gave us

copy of the Mexican file on her which had a copy of the

arrest, her photographs and the interrogation report.

A.

I'm not sure about that now.

Was George Munro the person who was principally

involved in handling this matter with the Mexican authorities?

Yes: I think he was.

I. Do you know why the Mexico City Station requested

the Mexican

government to arrest Sylvia Duran?

A

No, I don't know exactly why.

Do you know why she was selected as opposed to

anyone else at the Consulate or Embassy?

No.

prior to the Mexico City Station requesting that Duran be

arrested?

couldn't say.

embassy, that there might be - that the Cuban embassy might

Why did the - why did headquarters request the

Mexican Government to keep the arrest absolutely secret?

A I don't know.

I Do you know why the Mexico City station did not

contact headquarters prior to requesting the Mexicans to

arrest Sylvia Duran?

A

No.

Frequently Mr. Scott took independent action without

getting headquarters' approval on some cases, and I believe

that he discussed this, but I am not sure. I'd have to

check the records, I think he discussed it with the Ambassador

before it occurred. The Ambassador Mann I think would

Yes.

of Charles Thomas, III, who was a Foreign Service officer in

the political section in Mexico, had a wife whose name was

Cynthia.. The

two of them knew some Mexicans who were

literary types and little theater types. I believe that

Thomas and his wife were interested in little theater groups

of art groups, and they had met Garro. at some function.

wrote a memorandum with information in it that she had given

up to the ambassador's office, and the minister gave it to

Mr. Scott and asked Mr. Scott to confirm it. Mr. Scott asked

That's the notation made. by Mr. Rocca, and this

Unless there was another person by the same name

from San. Luis Potosi at that hotel, which I doubt.

That would be my deduction, yes.

part of

it, but it would have been up to Stan watson probably

to read the material when it came in.

Do you know why it would have taken almost a year

to have confirmed this aspect of Elena Garro de Paz's story?

I might add that --

A

Well, you almost could never

get

an answer out

of Charlie Thomas when you asked him sometning.. He wrote

these memos constantly. Then you would ask him for additional

information,

it would be just like dropping a rock into

It never. came back up. But I don't know.

e.

So are you saying that because Mr. Thomas was

slow in responding to inquiries by the station, that that is

why it took so long to confirm this aspect of his story?

A

Well, he reported information that he had heard,

and then I think that he was not always able to go back

to

the source and say, you said such

and such a time this.

Can you give me more information? He didn't want to be

as follows: On December 10th Mr. Thomas made his report

about Elena Garro. He was asked

to get more specific informa-

tion and between December 10th and approximately December

25th -- this is 1965 -- he went back to Elena Garro, talked

to her, personally accompanied her to the hotel where she

claims she had stayed, and reported that information back

to the station, and yet it wasn't until October of '66, almost

a year later, that the FBI confirmed this aspect of her

story.

that important, but the answer to your question I don't know.

O. How seriously were Elena. Garro de Paz's allegations

taken in Mexico City?

A

I don't think they were taken too seriously.

I Why not?

A.

Because she and her husband was -- her ex-husband

was flighty, and they -- her general reputation was one

that she dealt a lot in fantasy.

Now, after one aspect of Elena Garro de Paz's

story was confirmed, the fact that she had stayed at the

hotel, did the Agency at that point attempt to do any

follow-up investigation to confirm other aspects of the

story?

In other words, it seems that although she may

have

been flighty, at least she appears to have been telling the

truth about staying at the hotel immediately after the

assassination.

A Well,. I don't think that the Agency had any assets

that could be used to confirm the allegations about the

Sylvia Duran having sexual relations with him.

A

Well, what about Oswall having --

You know, we used to work on it -

What about the central allegation which was

that Oswald had been at the party?

A

Pardon me?

What about the central allegation that Oswald had

been at the party?

A

well, that was another case of where we -- too

much time had gone by. We just could not -- we didn't

have any leads to work on, I think.

This was just two years after the assassination

though.

Was there a record kept of the Agency's efforts

to investigate this allegation?

A

Pardon me?

I Was there a record kept of the Agency's efforts

to investigate this allegation?

And also her 201 file?

The 201 file.

So that would be her Mexico City file and her file

A

Well, not --

At headguarters.

A

Not all of the raw material would have been reported

from Mexico to headquarters unless it had some results.

But if we asked the Mexicans to help us identify

her, a

copy of it would have been included in

the periodic operation-

al report on the Mexican liaison operations.

The history of the Mexico City station which you

prepared contains a statement that Oswald made his contact

with the embassies on September 26th and October 6th, 1963.

In fact --

A

October 6?

Yes. In fact, the records suggest that he was

there and made his contacts from September 27th to October

1st.

A That's what it should have been.. That was

probably a typographical error.

Did you review that report after it had been

prepared?

A:

Not completely because I

was

1n

o then to a casted as

the process of

being transferred from one section to another and I was

held up waiting

for that report to be typed, and it hadn't

been completely typed when I finally left, but it was my

understanding that the draft of that report was to be

retained. I went over the draft a number of times.

@ Do you recall that Oswald made any contacts with

these embassies on: October 6th or September 26th?

A No, that would have been a mistake. I think the

dates were the 27th and Ist.

The first of October.

A

And. there would have been no material for me

to use for research other than the same material that has

been used here. It was the transcripts.

Q ..

Is it possible that Oswald called back on October

6th to find out whether he had obtained a visa?

A.

If he called back on that, we would have had it

on the transcripts?

I Do you think --

A "No matter what time of the day or hour, I think,

because they were set up to activate when you call.

I Do you have any memory of that happening?

A . No.

I Miss Goodpasture, I have no further questions of

you today. You have been very helpful..

Now, the Committee rules,

in

the

case of executive

session hearings, are such that a witness

is given five minutes

to make a statement for the record. This is not an executive

session hearing today; this is a deposition, but if you

would like to make a statement for the record for five minutes

or less, you are free to do so at this time.

A

The only thing I would like to say is to thank you

for your patience.

A

Well, thank you very much.

And

I hope that there has been clarification,

and if there is anything else I can do, I will be willing

to come back.

Mr. Goldsmith: Thank you. Thank you very

much.

(Whereupon, at 2:37 o'clock p.m., the deposition

in the above-entitled matter was concluded.)

script of the answers made by

me to the questions therein

recorded.
