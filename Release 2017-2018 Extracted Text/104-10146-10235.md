14. (Confidential - MMP) HEARING Saw Loch Johnson, House

Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff, who said that

Representative Les Aspin (D., Wis.), Chairman, Subcommittee on

Oversight, wanted to have what would be the last hearing on propaganda.

It will be closed and last for roughly two hours. Loch requested this

briefing for Thursday, 27 April. Subsequently, Loch called and requested

that the briefing date be changed to Wednesdav. 3 May or Thursday, 4 May.

I have alerted Don Gregg, SA/DO/O, and (

C/CAS/DDO.

Loch also asked for a personal briefing sometime in the next week

or two on U.S. publishing houses with whom CIA has or had any

relationship. I have passed this request on to Don Gregg, SA/DO/O.

15. (Unclassified - THW) LIAISON Emerson Brown, Department

of State, called and referring to the article in the Washington Post this

morning, asked if it accurately reflected the DCI's statements of yesterday

concerning the role of the ambassador. I told him "no" and added that we

were trying to get a copy of the transcript today. He asked if we could

send him a copy of the transcript when we received it; I told him we would.

I also mentioned that the DDCI had been in contact with Ben Read, Deputy

Under Secretary for Management, Department of State, and had assured

him that the

Post article was in error.

16. (Unclassified - THW) LIAISON Bob Blakey, Chief Counsel,

House Select Committee on Assassinations, called and said he felt the

restrictions we had placed on the Committee's access to raw documents

was unworkable. I told him that I felt the restrictions were necessary to

maintain the physical control over the documents. He said that he thought

we should discuss the matter in person and we decided that we would meet

at 9:00 a.m. on 22 April to go over the full range of security problems

arising out of Committee business.

17. (Unclassified - DFM) LIAISON Received a call from Danny

Coulson, Legislative Affairs, FBI, who said he had spoken to Bill Miller,

Staff Director, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, about my request

to Coulson for information on the FBI's anti-terrorist programs and

Miller had told him that nothing further was needed from the Bureau on this.
