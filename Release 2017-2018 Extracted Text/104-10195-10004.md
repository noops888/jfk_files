Richard E.

SNYDER

(born 10 Dec. 1919, Passaic, N.J.)

You advised me that Robert KENNEDY of OP had called

asking about

Subject's file (apparently he retired as

a Foreign

Service Officer (20. years, age 50) on 30 April

1970: he would like

on project or part-

time basis).

BURNES had requested flagging of OP file

quiries would be referred to CD/Pers for further check with

RI files?.

Subject is the subject of CS file 201-748009, re-

stricted to CI/R&A (Paul HARTMAN)..

From the file it

noted that Subject worked for CIA

27 Mar.

'50-26 Sept.

'50, resigning

for personal reasons.

The file was

restricted

because of

involvement with Lee Harvey OSWALD, assassin of

the late President John Kennedy.

While Subject was

on 31 Oct.

1959, he

Intervicwed Lee Harvey

at the

US Embassy, stating that he wished to renounce his US

citizenship and hecome a citizon of the USSR.

shows nothing reflecting adversely on Subject in connection

with that episode). An article in the 28 Feb. 1964 edition

of° the Northern Virginia Sun, written by Robert S. ALLEN and

and Paul SCOTT, alleged that

"State Department rocords show

that OSWALD had several meetings with the CIA representative

interviewed by the CIA and other embassy officials." In a

memorandum dated 18 March 1961,

addressed to Mr. J. Lee

RANKIN, subject "Article Alleging that OSKALD Was Interviewed

• Mr. Richard Helms, then Deputy Director

commented on the allegation as follows:
