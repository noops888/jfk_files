MEMO FOR FILL

SUBJECT C

OTS (late ISD) and Jim McCord's Cuban Activities:

1 Ben Colling phoned to say that one of the fellowin jail

is still around, and after he got out he inquired around and got no

indication that McCord was ever involved. None of the other OTS people

have any recollection of McCord's involvement.

2o. I said that I was sure that the man who was rolled up

might not have any idea of Melord's involvement, if indeed he was

involved. If McCord's involvelement was merely headquarters planniis

and no releasing operation was ever undertaken his role might never

surface. However, we had been told that planning did involve TSD

pople at the time, along with

ecurity. For instance, I knew that

the Security man with TSD at the time had a job of hand-bolding with

the families of the thre

men; there may be some ISD record of that.

which would lead to soneone who would know.

3. Colling was pulled out of a staff meeting to talk to me ard

said he would call back later.

SUBJECT

Summary OiLSTESCALADE'- Audio Operation

Against the New China News Agency in Havare

?lo

In May 1959, the New China News Agency (NGNA) opened

an office in Hayana in the El Medico Building which is occupied:

partly. by business concerns and partly used for residestial apa-fe.

ments.

Shortly thereafter, the Havara Station obtained the con

currence of Ambassado. Bonsal and Miss Carolya O. Stacey, 2n

Embassy employee, to mount an audio operatic against NGNA through

the wall of the adjacent apartment in which Mies Stacey lived. " In

November 1959, the FE Division sent one case officer and one I'SD

teconician to Havana, and the installation of a microphone and tape

recorder was completed in Miss Stacey's apartment on 29 November

1959.

By June 1960, it had become evident that two other ooms

occupied by NCNA possibly housed communication equipment aid

were used for conferences," At that time

FE Division

case officer, went to Haraca and explored the possibility of improving

the operation, Mé managed to lease an apariman: directly over the.

NONA office and arranged for a stay-behiza agent to occuyy this space.

•3.

In August 1950, a team of three TSD technicians who were

in Havaza on 2 separate SR Division operation agreed to install the.

additional equipment required for the NCNA operation. A second FE

Division case officer, Robert Neet, carre down to Havana; and be,

sogether with the technisians,

installed sprobe microphone and tape

recorder in the apartment obtained byl

over the NONA office.

About this time the eguipment was removed from Miss Stacay's

apartment, with the exception of the plastic probe which was laft

in the wall and plastered over.

4. As an additional security precaution to provide a safe

haven, and after consultation with ine Acting Chief of Stacion, a key

to an apartment in the same building leased by Mrs. Majorie

Lennox, an Embassy secretary, was cotained, Mes. Lennox was

told that access to her apartment was nesded for photographic

surveillance purposes.

F5. The Station was then faced with the probability that time

and security would work against holding indefinitaly the lease to

the apartmest over NCNA since the owners of the building were

cancelling sub-lessors' contracts and recalling leases. It was,

therefore, decided to install transmitters and switches in order to

permit continued monitoring of the target from a distant listening

post. Another three-man team of TSD technicians consisting of

David I, Christ falias Carswell), Walter E. Szuminski (alias

Taransky) and Thornton J. Anderson (alias Danbrunt) documented

as tourists had been sent to Havana to install audio equipment in the

Chinese Natioralist Embassy bajore it was due to be turned over to

the Chinese Communits..

This operation aborted, This team was

then sent to work on the installation of the transmitters in the apart-

ment over the NCNA oifice.

6. At 2400 hours on l4 September, Christ, Who with the

other technicians was working in the tagget apartment, failed to keep

a scheduled appointment with Neet.

At 0100 houns on the 15th of

Septembar, the apartment of Mes. Lenno: was entered into and

searched by Cuban authorities, and she was taken inio custody, At

1540 hours on 15 Saptember, Naat, the siay-becied agent and his wife."

were picked up by the Cuban authoricies and detained.

7..

As of today the agent remains in the custody of the Cuban

zuthorities, His wife bas been released and is still in Havana. Neet

was released. 1715 hours l6 September and has subsequently returned.

to Washingion whare he is being debriefed. Mrs. Lannox was

subsequently relzased and has also zeturned to Washingion where she

is being debriafed, The three TSD technicians remain in confinement,

They bave been saen in confinement but not contacted by an Embassy

officer when ba first attempted to secure the zalease of Mis. Lennox.

Christ was last seen by Neet whee they were jointly interrogated

the mozning of 15 September, At that time Christ did not appear

to have been maltreated.

8.

According to articies in the Cuban papers she three

technicians were arrested while in the apartment over the NCNA

office and completing the installation of the eguipment, The

press article adds that the key to Mrs. Lennos's epartment was

found on one of the technicians who identifled the apartment to

which it belonged. All Cuoan press releasas have reterred to the

men by alias and.have sos. identified them as Government or Agency

employees. It is urclear at present what story had been agreed

upon by the technicians and station personnel to be used in the eveat

they were caughl. (While being interrogated with Neet, Christ

indicated that Neet was his boss,

and Neet consistently denied any

Knowledge as to why he was being bald,): The sub-lease for the

apartment in which the mer were caught is in the name of the stay.

behind agent with the original lease being in the name of

the

FE Division Case Officer.

9. Initial information indicated that the thrae tachnicians would

be charged with espionage "'againsi the people cí Caina"... Subsequent

press releases bave been unclear on this point.* An atterapt by Consul

Hugh Kessler to contect the three men at 1730-hours on 17 September

was unsuccessiul.. He was not permitted to see them but was told

they were in custody.

10, The three technicians travelled to Cuba as tourists under

vazy light commarcial cover, two of them working io= a company in

New York and the third, one in Baltimore," In each case the cover

company consists of a telephone answering service azd a name on the

¿oor. Telephone messages and ¿nail are picked up periodically by 3a

Agency contract employee. The men were provided with tais cover

as well as unbackstopped come addresses for use when entering or:

leaving: Cuba as tourists since the filling out of the landing card

requires tais information, Subsequent do their detention the home

addresses have been partially backstopped so that inquiries will

indicate that someone with this alias name had lived in she aparticent

house in question. Insolar as the cover comparies are concerned,

eiforis are being made to provide a backstop to withstand inquiries

from the press should the Cubans reveal this incorzation. In view

11. A cleared and vatting law firm in New Tock bas been briefed

by Mr. I. Houston on the situation with the bought thes inquiries

received by the cover company could be reierred to the firma of

lawyers from whom no comment would be obtained by the press or

other inquirers. The law firm has been brieied on the entire sitia-

tion so that they may be in a position to act if any action by them

appears dssirable or feasible.

His father, a cook in a diner in the Boston area, has been contacted

by the Cifice of Security, and he will get in touch with Security if

he receivas any inquiries on this matter, Security, by the same

token, will keep in touch with him as the Cubans reveal their inter-

tions and course of actior.

13. The wives of the other two technicians have been toid whai

has happened and are being contacted at least once daily by ISD

staifers and their wives who have been brialed on the situation. A

conference with the two wives was held in ISD'on 19 September to go

over the whole situation and determine il there era any persoral

probiems on which the Ageacy could be of help.

For the time being

the wives are telling their neighbors that theis husbanda are ca a

tip. This story will be adjusted depending on vicat course of action

the Cuban Government takes, whether the aliases remain unbroken

and whether recognizable photographs of the individuals ase raleased

to the press." The two wives so fa= have taken tha bad nevis exceedingly"
