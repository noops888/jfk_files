In Chicago, GROSBERG was in

Chicago, and received a

telephone

Call fIOM JAMES E. HOFFA,

and loss statement also,

was the one which had been presented

to the Central States Pension. Fund for the

purpose of obtaining

a loan.

NAIMAN and TRISCARD tOId GROSBERG that NAIMAN had not

been successiul in getting & loan from the Central States Pension

Fund because the fund

not permitted to lend to a foreign

corporation.

GROSBERG concluded from the tinancial statement

that the firm was s "going"

concern, but was not "too profitable"

After looking at the statement and while NAIMAN and TRISCARO

were in his room, GROSBERG made & long distance, person-to-person

call to ROBERT E. MC CARTHY at the Public Bank, DetroIt.

GROSBERG TOLD MC CARTHY that NAIMAN was going to contact MC CARTHY

regarding a loan, and that GROSBERG was Calling MC CARTHY

NAIMAN subsequently went to Public

Bank, but GROSBERG did nOt knOw iI TRISCARO went to the bank.

GROSBErG was Iater told by MC CARTHY land possibly by JOSEPH

VERHELLE,

President of Public Bank) that the loan was granted

by Public Bank.

On more than one occasion while GROSBERG waS in the

International Office of the International Brotherhood of

Teamsters in Washingtol, D. C, VERHELLE and MC CARTHY called

HOFF and discussed this loan and others.

It waS GROSBERG'S

recollection that HOFFA's remoks in reconnending that the above

mentioned loan

be made by Public Bank for NAIMAN were to. the

effect that "Il you could

possibly grant the loan, I would.

like you to grant the loan."

On August 14, 1962, FRENCH

1962, WALTER J. SHERIDAN of the Department of Justice received

information that at the time of the above mentioned meeting in

GROSBERG's hotel room, GROSBERG already knew TRISCARO and was.

call to MC CARTHY at publiC Bank, VERELLE subsequently called

GROSBERG, wanting

moreinfornation.concerning

VERHELLE indicated to GROSBERG

at the time that he

want to make

After that,

VERHELLE

called GEORGE

FITZGERALD, an attorney for the

Teansters, and

wanted

As pointed

out under number 3 above,

PB filed

a claim for its loans to both

ANG and NCS against the

bankrupt estate. of NCS.

In settlement of its claim,

PB received notes aggregating $800,000 of Port Colborne

of these notes

depends entirely upon the future

office. He said that he did not know what GROSS was doing

there.

He recalls something being mentioned about TRISCARO

being

in difficulty in Florida. He said that BARTONE made

many

trips to Miami during this period and ran up a $12,000

bill

with Eastern Airlines. He said that BARTONE brought in

an attorney named GONOONE from Toledo to represent the Company.

He said that he believes that the company still owes GONOONE

about $5,000.

NAIMAN said that the Companies were still in need

of money and in approximately April, 1960, BARTONE tOld NAIMAN

that they were going to obtain another $150,000 from the Public

Bank of Detroit.

He said that he and BARTONE went to the

Public Bank and met with VERHELLE in his office. Also present

was an attorney named KOZEL representing a lending organiza-

tion called Bantum Industries, Boston, Massachusetts.

NAIMAN

recalls signing a check in the amount

of $30,000 which he

understood was interest on the loan. He also signed a check...

for $1, 500 to KOZEL.

He said that the net proceeds of the

loan therefore were less than $120,000. NAIMAN said that the

proceeds of the loan were split between the Alvin Naiman Corpora

tion and the Niagara Crushed Stone Corporation.

He said that

the total indebtedness to the Public Bank was being paid back

at $5,000 a month.

He believes that they paid back a total

approximately $100,000.

NAIMAN said that to approximately July, 1960, his

son became extremely upset because the Corporations were in

dire financial straits.

His son got into an argument with

BARTONE and when BARTONE started berating his son, NAIMAN

slapped BARTONE. He said that BARTONE thereupon left but

returned the next day to apologize.

NAIMAN said that he told

BARTONE that he wanted to get rid of the business and give

BARTONE power of attorney for this matter.

He said that the

next thing he knew the Corporations were in bankruptcy.

NAIMAN said that he then decided to see what he

could do to remedy the situation and went to Canada to talk

with Mr. McGRIFFIN of the Canada Steamship Company which had

taken over the Niagara Crushed Stone Company.

He learned

from MCGRIFFIN that his Company had assumed $700,000 in debts

to the Public Bank of Detroit. NAIMAN said that he could not

understand how the indebtedness could still be that high when

they had paid off $100,000 and had only borrowed a total of

$630,000.

NAIMAN said that in addition he learned that BARTONE

had assigned $240,000 in good accounts receivable to the Bank:
