MM 134-1191

WM T-3 is MM 635-S.

This letterhead memorandum has been classified

"CONFIDENTIAL" because it contains information from informanta

of continuing value. Unauthorized disclosure of this infor-.

mation could result in compromising these sources and affect

the national defense.

General WESSIN's letter to HECTOR GARCIA GODOY was

translated by Miami translator SOPHIE SALIBA.

General WESSIN was interviewed on 9/15/65 and

9/17/65 by SAS EDWARD J. DAHL and EUGENE L. PAYNE in the

Spanish language inasmuch as WESSIN claims to speak no English.

WESSIN expressed admiration for the Bureau as the

only serious agency in

Florida. He stated he would be avail

able for future interviéws by

Bureau representatives:

WESSIN appears tired and remote.

He is undoubtedly

bitter, as expressed in several press releases, toward t. S.

authorities since he believes the U.S. betrayed his

efforts

in the Dominican Republic.

As noted in the enclosed letterhead memorandum,

WESSIN on 9/15/65 was encountered at the residence of ANTONEO

LIANO MONTES, in company with Cuban exile MARCOS DIAZ LANZ,

Bufile 105-80115. On 9/17/65, MARCOS DIAZ LANZ and FRANK

FIORINI, Bufile 2-1499, were observed in contact with General

WESSIN.

On 9/17/65, LIANO MONTES advised that individuals,

mostly Cuban exiles whom he has not been in contact with for

more than three years, 'have continually appeared at his.

residence or telephonically contacted him in an effort to

gain access to General WESSIN. WESSIN has been thus occupied

during most of his waking hours with these contacts, as well

as with widespread representatives of local and national

press, radio and television.

This situation will more than

likely continue for some time.

Because of the situation

regarding DIAZ LANZ and FRANK FIORINI, as described in the

enclosed letterhead memorandum, it is possible that WESSIN's

attitudes will undergo a change if

and when he perceives

their intention to exploit WESSIN's own anti-communist

ambitions.

As explained in referenced Miami teletype, Miami

will endeavor to cover the activities of General WESSIN

through contacts with established sources who are among

those Cuban exiles who are ir contact with him..

In addition,

WESSIN will be contacted at such times as deemed appropriate

for the purpose of entarging our channel of communication

with him and looking toward the possibility of explorting

his admiration and confidence in the Bureau.

RE:

GENERAL ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN

INTERNAL SECURITY - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

On September 12, 1965, MM T-1, a confidential source

abroad; advised as follows:

General ELIAS WESSIN Y WESSIN, commanding officer of

the Central de Ensenanzarde las Fuerzas Armadas (CEFA) (Armed

Forces Training Center); was retired, appointed Dominican

Consul General in Miami, and sent out of the Dominican

Republic (DR) to Panama on the night of September 9, 1965.

Indications were that WESSIN was to travel from Panama to

Miami and it was expected that he would be joined by his

family in Miami by September 12, 1965.

WESSIN has stated that had not United States troops landed

- According to Mu I-la

the DR in April, 1965, the country would have been lost to

communism. According to information available to MM T-1 on

September 9, 1965, WESSIN was visited by Brazilian General

HUGO ALVIN, Commanding General of the Inter-American Peace

Force, and General BRUCE PALMER, Commanding General of U.S.

Forces, DR. This visit was made at the express instructions

of American Ambassador. ELLSWORTH BUNKER, American Representa-

tive to the OAS Committee in the DR. It appears that ALVIN

and PALMER directed an ultimatum to WESSIN to depart the DR.

The September 15, 1965 edition of the "Miami News,"

a local daily newspaper, carried an article entitled, "Bayonet

Forced Me - Wessin."

This article attributes WESSIN with

alleging that an American lieutenant put a bayonet in his back

and forced him out of his country and carried WESSIN's

rejection of a consulate post in Miami.

The article quoted

WESSIN as saying,

"The American official who ordered my

expulsion in such a humiliating way has given the coup de

grace to the fight for democracy in Latin America." This

article further contained excerpts from a letter

purportedly

written by WESSIN to the Dominican

Provisional President,

HECTOR GARCIA GODOY.
