NY I-I IS MIGUEL ANTONIO SANCHEZ RAMOS, SUbjeCt Of

Buffle 97-4351, who was interviewed on 12/17/60, ROY SAS EDWARD

J. DEVINS and HEINRICH VON ECKARDT In Room 615,

W1lliams Hotel, 28 East 31st Street, NYC.

His identity must

be concealed.

It should be noted that SANCHEZ Is acquainted with

a Priest named Father (first name unknown) VELAZCO.

It 1s

thought that this individual is most likely identical with

RICARDO VELASCO ORDONEZ; however, the Bureau may desire to.

withhold dissemination of the attached memorandum pending

the reinterview of the subject by the San Juan Office.

SANCHEZ was personally present in the Office of

ABBES on 8/14 or 15/59, just prior to the departure of the

c-46 for Cuba.

He personally heard ABBES tell a runner "Go to

the El Paz Hotel and wake up the Priest. - I bet he's drunk"

SANCHEZ did not see Father VELAZCO on this occasion, and

did not personally see Father VELAZCO until approximately

February or March, 1960, when he saw Father VELAZCO in the

office of CANDIDO TORRES.

SANCHEZ was personally present

in TORRES' office when VELAZCO furnished information

Impilcating the Roman Catholic Church with the January, 1960

plot.

He sat next to Father VELAZCO in the Cathedral

at the time of the stink bomb incident. Father VELAZCO did

not recognize him.

When Father VELAZCO mentioned "sacriligeous,

profane,

etc,, SANCHEZ told him "Shut up Father, this 1s an

SIM deal", at which time Father VELAZCO made no further

mention of the stink bombs. SANCHEZ personally observed

Father VELAZCO receiving a yellow envelope from Lieutenant

COLON®

It is noted that during the continuous interview

Of SANCHEZ, he has made referenceto the SIM campaign against

the Roman Catholic Church in the Dominican Republic.

During the continuing interview, full details concerning this

matter will be obtained from SANcHEz and the results will be

made the subject matter of a separate communication.
