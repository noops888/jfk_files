Director, Center for The Study of

Intelligence

Newly Released JFK Assassination Records

This memorandum is in response to your request for

information on recently released JFK assassination records.

(U)

2.

The documents released by the JFK Assassination

Records Board over the past three months cover Lee Harvey

Oswald's trip to Mexico City in September-October 1963.

The

basic information on this subject was released by the Agency

in 1992/93.

The latest releases do not contain significant

revelations; they primarily fill in gaps and add details to

a known story. (U)

The new information

in these releases

â€¢ is the

official confirmation of CIA's unilateral telephone tap

operations against the Soviet and Cuban Embassies in Mexico

city.

The existence of

intercepted Oswald phone calls has been reported in the

press for years, and the transcripts of these calls have

been available at the National Archives since 1993. Most

of the other new releases are pseudonyms and aliases of

employees, document and file numbers, and cryptonyms. (S)

4.

The Board has released some information that we

initially preferred to protect, e.g., details on some

operations and sources and the names

of several Agency

employees. To date, we have concluded that the damage to

national security or risk to these individuals was not

sufficient to justify an appeal of the Board's

decisions.

(U)

5.

The Board and its staff have been cooperative in

reconsidering issues and tabling documents in response to

our concerns.

The issue of whether to release certain staff

employee names has been tabled until December to give the

Agency an opportunity to contact the individuals concerned.
