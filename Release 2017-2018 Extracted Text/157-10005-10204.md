11. Lawrence Houston. First mentioned on page 62

of the report. He was requested by Colonel Edwards to call

on an Assistant Attorney General to explain the bugging incident

in Las Vegas.

It appears from the IG report that Houston was

witting of aspects of Phase I which led up to the wiretapping

incident.

On May 7, 1962, Houston, along with Sheffield

Edwards, briefed Attorney General Kennedy on the Phase I

operation.

12. General Carter. Carter was DDCI under John

McCone. In April, 1962, he was briefed by Houston on Phase I.

He said he "understood"

the situation and "in due time might

brief the Director, Mr. McCone."

However, the 1967 report

states, "There is no indication that General Carter was

further briefed

on the full details of the assassination plot

against Castro."

13.

Robert A. Maheu. Maheu, of course, was the

private investigator who served as the Agency's contact with

Roselli during Phase I.

14. Edward P. Morgan. He was Maheu's attorney in

1966 when the CIA intervened with the Long committee. He

excused Maheu as a witness in its investigation of invasions

of privacy.

According to the IG report, Maheu indicated that

he might brief his attorney Morgan fully about his past acti-

vities so that Morgan would be able to decide how best to

represent him.
