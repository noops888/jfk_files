New York and Washington Field open case utilizing caption

of thes communication, however, before any active investigation is

conducted regarding the possible FRA violation, New York should

recontact its source in an eifort to further identify location of

Rock Hill and thereafter,

through established reliable contacts,

attempt to determine identity of the Washington bank which financed

this project.

Washington Field should review its office files for

pertinent information concerning Ogilvie and for any references to

a recently disclosed irregularity at First National Bank,

Washington, D. C., of the type alleged by the source.

Until the Washington bank is identified and more specific

facts are known concerning a possible Federal violation, no open
