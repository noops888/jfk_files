Conversation with Will Wilson, Wednesday, February 6, 1974

I spoke to Will Wilson, former Assistant Attorney General in

charge of the Criminal Division, on February 6, 1974, at approximately

• 6:15 p.m. Wilson presently has offices at 1003 International Life Building,

Austin, Texas. His home telephone is 512/GL3-0559, and his office phone

:- is 512/472-1766. The purpose of the telephone call was to learn if Wilson

had any information relating to the waived grand jury appearance of Robert

Maheu in early 1971 or relating to the acquisition of the Dunes Hotel by

Hughes in 1970.

Wilson recalled that the Justice Department had an investigation

going on in Los Angeles back in 1970 and 71. He believes that the strike

force had an investigation into skimming in Las Vegas and had requested

Robert Maheu's presence before a grand jury out there. Apparently, Maheu

did not want to appear before the grand jury, and informed the U.S. Attorney

in charge that he would voluntarily appear before officials at the Department

of Justice rather than go before the grand jury. When the U. S. Attorney

checked with superiors at the Department of Justice, everyone apparently

thought that the appearance in Washington would be sufficient, and so

Wilson could recall no conversations with John Mitchell about

and

the appearance of Maheu

at the Department of Justice, he said that

Maheu's appearance was well-known wi thin the Department. He said that

he received no direction from Attorney General Mitchell to make these

arrangements.

Wilson stated that the details for the appearance were worked out

• by Lynch, Wilson, and the attorney out on the strike force who subsequently

• became chief of the Kansas City Strike Force. (At one point in the interview,

Wilson thought this individual was David Nissen.) Wilson stated that the

-..

!.- purpose for his close examination of Maheu was to discover if there had

Fo been any secret trades among the casino owners in Las Vegas and if there

were any "capitalized skim" that was included in the sales price. Wils on

stated that he did not find any such skim after his examination of Maheu.

Wilson stated that he was convinced that Parvin-Dohrman as

sellers of a casino had retained an over-ride ("skim"), but that that was

always difficult to prove in the cases that came before the Department.

Wilson indicated that he got nothing from Maheu that was very satisfactory

to support his theory of capitalized skim.

Wilson was also

aware that the organized crime section had

discussed the matter with staff of the Anti-Trust Division of Justice. The

Organized Crime division wanted Anti-Trust Division personnel to be assigned

to the strike forces themselves. Wilson took up this problem of getting the

Wilson stated that a lot of effort was going into the skimming

operations in Las Vegas by the Criminal Division. Wilson felt that Maheu

would be a very helpful witness because of his hostility with Hughes because

of the recent break. However, even with Maheu's hostility, he was not a

particularly helpful witness (surprise!).

Wilson could recall no meeting with John Dean and Attorney

1) General Mitchel in which they discussed the acquisition by Hughes of

the Dunes Hotel. While Wilson stated that he wouldn't rule it out, he

said that it was unlikely. Wilson also recalls no investigation into the

:= Dunes, although there was a large investigation into Continental Connectors

and Parvin-Dormann. Wilson noted that Justice Douglas was on retainer

to Parvin-Dorhmann, and that he was convinere Parvin-Dorhmann ran a

is

skimming operation in Las Vegas.

Wilston stated that he learned of all this background information

concerning Maheu from a secret file in the Justice Department. He stated

that there was a Giacamo file in the Organized Crime Section, and among .

those files was

a special secret file on Robert Maheu.

Wilson recalled

discussing this matter with I. Edgar Hoover, since Hoover had apparently

fired Maheu upon learning of his organized crime connections. This makes

no sense.) Wilson stated that these files were either in the central filing

room in the Department or possibly could be back in the Criminal Division.

Other individuals who saw these files on Giacamo and Maheu included Bill

Lynch, Attorney General Mitchell, Henry Petersen, and Jack Keeny. Jack

Keeny now heads up the fraud section of the Criminal Division, and Ed
