coverage. From the time the Mexico Station was opened in

_(by Bill Doyle) until arrival of Win Scott as COS in 1956, Charles

Anderson III (still in LA/HQ) had developed a support apparatus to Fees

exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy. This unbrella type project (LIFEAT)

consisted of multi line phone taps, three photo sites, a mobile surveillance

team and

a mail intercept operation.

a. Thore taps were placed by!

handled by David WILSTED (pseudo). The number of lines

tapped

was linted

by availability of a listening post nearby

(since the taps were not rade in the main central) and English/

Spanish (Soviet, Polish, Czech, etc) transcribers. Generally

these agents (mostly Mexican or Mexican American) were related

which the station at that time felt was good security in that

if they talked about shop, they would talk to each other.)

b. Three photo sites

were handled by Arderson with the help

of Harry Mahoney (retired, living in Chicago) and IDY ISD

people checking

the best type of canera, film, and concealment

devices. These had sub-cripts under LIFEAT (LINITED, LILYRIC,

and LICALLA) • LIMITED vas a fixed site bang opposite across

the street from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy which had

both a vehicle and foot entrance. The Soviet gate was

on the

Northliest corner. of their compound and LIMITED was diagonally

across a double barrelled street on the Southeas

o: arinental basis in the early stages.

I trink the lexi Station Lought

one storey

this property (a/Sranish Colorial stone house) through LINOUSIE (check to

be sure). Later this house began to fall apart. This base was closed when

the Station got word that the photo of "uniden man" was being releasea to the

puolic by the Warren Cormission. The photo operators were noved to another apt

nearby. The property vas sold (under an operational agreenent with LIMOUSINE

for a long term lease on the top floor of a new apartment biding to be built

on this site). LILYRIC was planned es an alternate photo base to LIMITED.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the same

side of

the street

as LIMITED but in the midale of the block South. It had a slanted view of

the front gate of the Soviet Erbassy. The agents in LIMITED and LILYRIC (both

l'exican fanilies) as far as we knew, were not acquainted with each other.

LILYRIC was a rented apartment. LICALLA, the third photo site, was located

in one of a row of four houses on the South side of the Soviet Embassy compound

which the Mexico Station purchased in about 1958 (check date), also using

LIMOUSINE as the purchaser (check). This site overlooked the back garden of

the Soviet Embassy compound. The purpose of this

operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (no at that time vere largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites vere handled by

Ramon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S. mother

to accumulate, the inside CO (l'ahoney) becane disgusted and

took the filn out

for Ramon's brother-in-law to

process (probably early 1959). Thus Paron became

the handler for all three photo bases.

IIUST,, cte). This was ha:dled by Glen WIDDaY (outside ISD officer) and

Yakoney using HQ TDY teams for monitoring. This opsration vas also separate

fron LICALLA. The two houses

in between were rented to unsusrecting tenants.

c. jobile surveillance was developed by Anderson and later placed

under lahoney and Joseph Sancho. This team consisted of a half

dozen or so agents who used three to for late model cars aná a

panel truck (which could be used on stake_outs for photo covera e).

The plan was to activate this group by radio (fron LINITED BASE)

when someone of interest left the Embassy gate and stay with then

until they made their meetings.. These agents knew about the LnITED

SASE belause they had LDINFD photos for identification purposes.

This worked fairly well until about the middle of 1958 (check date)

when one of the surveillance agents got too close to his target and

was arrested by the Mexican transit police and turned over to the

Mexican Secret Service. By the time the Station could arrange through

a cleared attorney to bail him out (Juäd Austin of the Goodrich,

Little and Riquelme firm), the agent: had identified Sancho (uno ves

evacuated across the border at Nogales by Bob Shaw) and the inside.

there was usually a time lag of a day or so. Those transcripts nich had

Russian or another language besides Spanish or English vent out of the listening

post the day after the transcript (of other conversations on the reel)was

typed.

These reels were taken to another location where they were translated

and typed. In the case of the Russian translations, Boris Tarasoff usually ran

about a week behind the date of the conversation because of the volume of

Russian conversations among the lembers of the Soviet Eubassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were procably being brought into the station

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to
