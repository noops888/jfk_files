LORAN EUGENE HALL, also known as

INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

The following information is submitted to re-

flect the activities of LORAN EUGENE HALL in the Miami

area.

On July 9, 1959, RUBEN MIRO GUARDIA, a Panamanian

then residing in Miami, advised that in April, 1959, he

was detained by Cuban Police in Havana, Cuba.

During his

detention he met a United States citizen named LORAN HALL,

who was also under detention

at the time.

HALL, a white

male, approximately 30 years of age, 5'10" tall, black

hair, said he was from the State of Kansas, and had served

in the United States Armed Forces for about six years.

HALL told MIRO that he had arrived in Cuba in about March,

1959, and had subsequently been contacted by CAMILO

CIENFUEGOS, a Cuban Rebel Army Commander. CIENFUEGOS wanted

HALL to train a group of men who were goino to participate

in an invasion of Nicaragua. HALI, claimed he trained a

group of men on a farm known as La Lisa, located near

Havana. HALi said the food fos the trainees came from the

Cuban Military Stafff Headquarters, on the orders of

CIENFUEGOS.

MIRO

stated that HAll caid he was arrested on

April 8, 1959, by Cuban authorities, who alleged HALL was

suspected of being an FBI Agent.

On MIRO's departure from

Cuba on July 1s 1959, HAll was still in the custody of

Cuban authorities but MIRO believed that HALL was going to

be released and deported to the United States.

LORAN EUGENE HALL

MM Tol, who has been involved in Cuban revolu-

tionary activities for the past six years, advised on March

10, 1963, that HALL had been in Miami for about the past

three months, and associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,

an American adventurer, mercenary and soldier of fortune.

MM T-I stated HALL is disagreeable, is not liked by the

other mercenaries in Miami, is of low moral character,

and appears to have a criminal background.

On March 18, 1963, LUIS BALBUENA, 908 S.W. 5th

Street, Miamilla Cuban exile, advised that his brother,

along

with some Cubans and Americans, was involved in

some plan to try and overthrow the government of Haiti.

Somehow connected with this group is an American, LORENZO

HALL, also known as LAWRENCE HALL, a soldier of fortune,

who appears irresponsible and at

one time was a member of

the Cuban Rebel Army.

On April 5, 1963, the Miami Office received a

telephone call from a LORENZO HALL, 142 S.W. 21st Avenue,

Apartment 6, Miami, Florida. HALL said he understood

that the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Central Intelli-

gence Agency and Immigration and Naturalization Service

were trying to

locate him, and he wanted to report his

address.

On November 11, 1963, MM I-1 said that LORENZO

HALL, a white male, 25 years of age to 26 years, 5°7".

155 pounds, ruddy complexion, was unemployed and had in-

dicated to the informant that he was from Los Angeles,

California. He is always on the move, is in and out of

Miami, is the confidence man type, and it was not known

if he was then in Miami. MM T-1 advised that HALL

claimed to have been in the Cuban Rebel Army, but the

other mercenaries in Miami doubt this.

MM T-1 said HALL was then loosely connected with

Cuban revolutionary activities, which he uses as a gimmick

to try and obtain money donations. In Miami, he loosely the

associated with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING,

"MEXICAN" LARRY

HOWARD and WILLIAM HOUSTON SEYMOUR, all unemployed ad-

venturers. -

MM I-1 stated HALL and HOWARD made a trip to

California several months previously in an attempt to

collect money by representing themselves as members of an

anti-CASTRO movement: It is doubtful they collected any

sizeable amount of money. Their practice is to contact

local chapters of the John Birch Society, claiming they are

anti-Communist freedom fighters, and ask

for money to carry

on their work. They do obtain some money this way, and

use the money for living expenses.

In October, 1963, according to MM I-1, HALL and

SEYMOUR visited Dallas, Texas, trying to collect money

donations under the guise. of representing anti-CASTRO

organizations. Among the persons they contacted was

LESTER R•/LOGUE, 628 Meadows Building, Dallas,

a geolo-

gist. It is unknown if LOGUE gave them any money.

On December 5, 1963, MM I-1 advised that HALL

had not been seen around Miami for about a month, and his

whereabouts was then unknown.

On November 1, 1963 the United States Customs

Service, Miami, Florida, furnished a report concerning the

boat PITUSA I, which was observed on October 29, 1963

being trailer hauled by a 1955 Oldsmobile sedan, south of

Miami in the direction of the Florida Keys. This car was
