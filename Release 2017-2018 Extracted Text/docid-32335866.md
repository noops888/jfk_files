to thirty members in Tarrant County.

Dallas T-l stated that

the name of the organization as such has only been used twice

• In two years and that proper nanes are seldom, if ever,

used

and that this makes it very difficult to determine identitles

of members.

members of the organization:

Arthur Pollard, 2707 Berrybill Drive, Fort Worth, Texas

Otto (Duke) Koling and Shirley Bob Renshaw,

2341

Closely associated with the organization and perhaps

a nember is Bichard i. Dawson,

who lives on Highway 121 on

the outskirts of Fort Worth and who has formerly lived in the

neighborhood of 2820 Northwest 29th in the early 1950's. Dallas

I-d advised that an attornoy whom members of the group have

asen advised to contact 11 "they get into trouble'

Windor, -th offices in the Silis Building in Fort worth. Alfred

Tol advised he does not know whether or not windor

is a member of the organization.

Dallas T-I advised the primary purpose of the

organization is to fight against the present Federal control

of national and local Governments and to fight for "States'

rights".

The group is supposedly national in origin and

believes that the Federal Government is in the process of

selling out to the communists and that the group is the last

line of defense agalnst this sellout.

The group secondarily

is racial in that it belleves in white supremacy.

Dallas T-1

advised that the organization suffered a severe setback

because of the assassination of President Kennedy but now is.

attempting a full-scale reorganization.

The group recruits

basically from those who do not have criminal records and is

organized in such a manner that no one is supposed to know

the names of other members in the organization. This is to

prevent effective infiltration by the Government. Dallas T-1

advised that the group has no immediate plans for action,

but that several times locally this group has determined

to

act on their own and this action, has been curtailed because

of orders relayed from higher authority in the organization.

These higher authorities are unknown to Dallas I-1, except

that a person by the name of Bay (last name unknown) at the

ranch in the vicinity of Venus, Texas, appears to be in contact

with the group's organizational leaders.

Ray is described

as a personal and close friend of retired General Edwin Walker

and about one and one-half to two years ago was apparently

implicated in some manner in the burning of a newspaper in the

area. of Midlothlan, Texas. Ray is also apparently a warehouse

supervisor in Dallas.

Dallas I-I also advised he has been recently con-

tacted by a man whom he does not know but who apparentiy lives

in the Fort forth area, and this unknown male advised Dallas

I-l to disassociate hingelf from the small group he is now

attached to for the apparent purpose of moving into a position

of more prominence in the organization.

Dallas I-1 advised

that the small group with which he has

been associated is the

lowest level in the organization and that their primary

purpose is to do the "dirty work".

Dallas I-l stated that the group is also prepared,

in the event of a Negro uprising in the Fort Worth area, to

take action against various Hegro leaders Including Di. Flint,

Dr. Fleming and Dr. Ransom, and a Fort Worth hoodlum named

Madison Hogan, who is apparently a Nation of Islam leader

in the fort Worth area.

Dallas I-l advised that the only overt action tenta-

tively planned for the winter months is that the effect of

a .30 caliber rifle on power transformers in the area may be

tested. Dallas

T-l further stated that the group apparently

has a contact with an individual in northeast: Texas who goes

by the name of "South" and that this contact may be utilized

In the raiding of a northeast Texas armory during the winter

months.

The primary interest is obtaining mortars and mortar.

ammunition and automatic weapons; therefore, Dallas I-l

believes that the armory would probably be of a tank

infantry group.

Dallas I-l advised that the group locally is

attempting to gain control of the Panther City Motorcycle

Club for the purpose of gaining land apparently owned by this

club, in the area of Lake Arlington, Texas, and thereafter

selling this land and using the monies therefron for purchases:

of the group.

Dallas I-l advised that it has been learned the group

has organizations in Stephenville, San Angelo, Italy and

Brownwood, Texas.

Dallas T-l further advised that Arthur.

Pollard has in the past made trips to Alabama, Hyoming,

Hontana, California, and that the group has a contact with

an individual by the name of Jim Scott in Kansas City. Dallas

I'ol advised that he has seen pamphlets from national Minutemen

headquarters, but that these

dealt primarily "ith the fighting

of any National Flrearms Act which would involve licensing of

private weapons.

in the area,

speaking more of retired General Edwin Halker's

guidance and leadership of the organigation. He speaks in

near reverent terms concerning latker.

¿ Dallas T-1 advised

that "Bay" was arranging a meeting with General

appropriate at this time, because

Walker becomes suspicious

of those who too quickly attempt to meet him.

"Ray" advised

that it would be wiser to wait until the General requests

to see him or until he

had been in the organization a longer

period, of time.

Dallas I-l further stated that Hilllam Seals of

Houston,

Texas,

formerly of fort worth, has not been recently

in contact with the group in Fort worth.

Dallas T-l advised he had no information that the

group had yet established a local storehouse or arsenal for

weapons and that the embership and leaders in the local

group have remained unchanged.
