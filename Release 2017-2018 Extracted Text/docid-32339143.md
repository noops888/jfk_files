Dear Friends:

I am deeply honored by the

as well as writing, which is not possible to

, change.

I enclose a message to the gathering.

With it go by heart-felt greetings to you and to

all the people associated with you in planning this

A MESSAGE OF GREETING

TO THE INTERNATIONAL METING OF WRITERS

BERLIN AND WEIMAR,

1965

It seems to me that your gathering,

and Heimar is an occasion of major historical importance.

You commemorate the past, the defeat of Nazi tyranny. But

you speak for the present and for the future, for the

continuity and immediacy of the struggle for peace and

freedom. Writers of the world have a unique responsibility--

to their consciences, to their people, and to all peoples.

The creative conscience cannot rest or retreat. There are

today writers and artists who hold that culture is subjec-

tive and related only to the inner life of the mind of

spirit!

But there is no hiding place in the soul; the man

or wonan "who tries: to hide from the world makes the heart

a prison.

May this meeting affirm the deathless spirit,

the creative spirit that honors life and unites the writer

with all humanity in creating a world of peace and plenty

and brotherhood.

reasons, but the most urgent

relate to commitments which I cannot dismiss

(writing, lecturing and teaching).
