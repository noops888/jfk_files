RE:

FD-379

Bureau authority is requested to interview subject in accordance with

existing instructions relating to interviews of security subjects. Care will be

exercised to protect the original source in this matter. No direct questions will

be asked during the interview which will disclose to the subject the identity of

the official or the establishment contacted, the method used in the contact, or

the fact we are aware of the contact. The interview will be conducted in a

manner so that the subject will volunteer the details of the contact. If this

subject is cooperative, no affirmative steps will be taken during the initial

interview to direct his activities, but a separate communication will be directed

to the Bureau setting forth the results of the interview and requesting authority

to recontact the subject to determine his asset potential.

Request WANTED notice when subject's apprehension or location is desired.

Request FLASH notice when subject is placed on parole or probation and you desire to be advised if he is arrested while

in this status. Fingerprints for offense must be in Identification Division files or FBI number furnished when requesting

flash notice.

Request CANCELLATION when subject's custody is secured or you no longer desire information conceming him.

The Name, Number, and Agency should be exactly the same as they appear on the Fingerprint card in the files of the FBI.

In all instances when the FBI number is known, it should be indicated.

In the event a Law Enforcement Agency is not certain there is a previous Fingerprint Record for the subject in the files of

the FBI and desires a Wanted Notice posted, the descriptive data indicated on this form should be completed. If a possibly

identical record is located by the FBI, it will be furnished in order that the Law Enforcement Agency may determine whether

or not this record is identical with the subject wanted. Wanted or Flash Notices are not posted in our files unless positive

identifications can be effected. Therefore, if an identification with a particular Fingerprint Record is made by you after

receipt of possibly identical information from us, it will be necessary to resubmit this form so that the notice can then be

posted in your behalf.

Memorandum

TO

: SAC,

DATE:

FROM : Director, FBI

SUBJECT:

FOREIGN POLICE COOPERATION

BUDED

00: BUREAU

The enclosed request for assistance from a foreign agency must

be complied with promptly, and the Bureau advised of all action taken.

Instructions for handling this inquiry are found in Section 103

of the Manual of Instructions. Refer to and follow them carefully.

Submit the results of your inquiry in a letterhead memorandum,

observing the following points in its preparation:

1. Sources and techniques must be fully protected.

2. The names of Special Agents are to be omitted. They must be

deleted also from any signed statements submitted.

3. Provide a security classification, if warranted, but omit

declassification markings.

4. Omit the property statement, unless special reasons exist for

its inclusion. Explain any such reasons in the cover communication.

5. Secure authority to disseminate to the interested foreign govern-

ment any information which was obtained from other agencies. Your

cover communication must state this was done.

The established reputation of the Bureau within foreign agencies

is a valuable asset. The manner in which this type of case is handled will

largely determine the cooperation which we receive in turn from them. It

is imperative, therefore, that these investigations and the reporting

thereof meet the highest standards of the Bureau.
