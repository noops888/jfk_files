The Passenger on the 27 November 1963 Flight

At pages 61-63 and 104, the SSC Final Report describes in considerable

detail information concerning a Cuban-American who came to the attention of

the CIA and the FBI in the period following the assassination of President

Kennedy.

The introductory comments of the

SSC Final Report

state that:

one source alleged that the Cuban-American was

in the assassination!"

'involved'

The SSC Report states that the CIA reported the case to the FBI "almost

immediately," but that the Bureau did not conduct a follow-up investigation

"as part of (its) work for the Warren Commission.

Further down the same

page the SSC Report states that "(t)he FBI did investigate this individual

after receiving the CIA report of his unusual travel.

At page 63 the SSC

Report observes that "

... the suspicious travel of this individual coupled

with the possibility that Oswald had contacted the Tampa chapter (of the Fair

know just what the Bureau did in thsi respect, nor have we tried to resolve

the apparent inconsistencies in the SSC Report noted

but the SSC

Final Report contains considerable detail about the man, presumably re-

flecting the results of FBI inquiries.

While this section of the SSC Report is directed primarily at the FBI,

we reviewed the reporting because of CIA's initial role in reporting about

There is also one implicit criticism of CIA, which will be noted.

Book V of the SSC Final Report has the following summary statement at

page 104, in the chronology section:

"December 5- Mexico Station cables that someone who saw the Cuban-

American board the aircraft to Havana on November 27 reported that

'looked suspicious'

At page 61 it states that there "is no indication that CIA followed-up

on this report (that the man was "involved in the assassination"),

except to ask a Cuban defector about his knowledge of the Cuban-American's

activities." (sic.)

The presentation of this matter in the SSC Report contains some

First, the Mexico City Station did not cable Washington that

"looked suspicious."

There was a cable, (Mexi-7253, IN74227, 12/5/63)

but it reported that the man had "crossed at Laredo,

dated 5 December 1963, that he registered at a certain hotel in Mexico City

Texas on 23 November,

at a certain time

and departed for Havana "as only passenger on Cubana

Flight on night 27 November," and that there was a

photograph of hin

taken at the airport.

This was followed by a dispatch HMMA-22579, 12/5/63

the same date, repeating the basic information in the

cable, enclosing the

photograph, and containing the following cryptic statement:

'Source states the timing and circumstances surrounding Subject's

travel through Mexico and departure for Havana are suspicious.

This comment is cryptic,

at least, and--given that dramatic moment in history

--doubless reflects a preliminary comment of a person who was on the alert

at that time

for anything that might be construed as possibly unusual.

There was an internal memo (See Memorandum for the

Record, 3 December 1963) in the Station that was even more cryptic, but

which was in the nature of an informal reminder, which stated

formulation never found its

way into the more careful statements that usually characterize

The point is that the observaiton was cryptic and impresionistic,

rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic activity or final

conclusions.

There is one piece of reporting that could confuse those reviewing the

record, but which is essentially resolved when considered in the context of

known facts.

On 19 March 1964,1

cabled that a source of a locall

JIN 43193, 3/19/647

"agent of the federal judicia

police" had information on a man; the description seems to have the same

Cuban-American in mind.

The following should be noted about the report:

it misspelled the man's name; it offered a bare statement that he "was

involved in Kennedy assassination"; it states that he entered Mexico "on

foot" from Laredo, Texas (according to the SSC Final Report, the FBI con-

cluded that he entered by automobile); it asserts that he

tion and check-out at a specific hotel in Mexico City, where he stayed,

were known; it gave an incorrect number for his passport; and,

that his Mexican tourist card was issued in Nuevo Laredo

to have been issued in Tampa, Florida).

There is one additional aspect of the matter, in which the record is

the Monterrrey report contributes to such confusion as may exist

When Mexico City received the Monterrey cable the Deputy

chief of Station replied (MEXI-8740, IN 43940, 3/20/64) that the information ir

place of entry into Mexico.

The mistake of that cable cannot be explained

today, but wrong it obviously was.

It does, however, serve to highlight

the basic unreliability of the report and indicate how it shouls be consid-

ered responsibly

Implicit criticism of CIA's not collecting more information on the man

is not well founded. It had no real sources with access to information

concerning him; when a defector from Cuba became available with such in-

formation he was queried and the results were provided the authorities.
