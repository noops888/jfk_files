Dear Mr. Innes:

This has reference to your letter of

April 2, 1964 concerning Joseph and Reva BERNSTEIN.

2.

No doubt this couple are identical to

the BERNSTEINs mentioned in our exchange of corre-

spondence under our reference D 933-2328 (your file

100-1134)• This deals with requests from your office

for the names of registered owners for two automobiles

observed at the home of Joseph BERNSTEIN in Detroit,

in 1958 and again in 1961. Investigation at that time

revealed that Reva BERNSTEIN has a sister, Zelda (Mrs.

David Alkin) ROBINSON, residing at Hamilton, Ontario.

3.

your letter under reference, we are having enquiries

carried out at Hamilton in an effort to determine if

Joseph and Reva BERNSTEIN were visiting that point in

November 1963. Also, should it be learned that they

were in Canada, our investigation will be extended to

determine if,

in fact, they were interviewed as stated.

You will be advised promptly of our findings.
