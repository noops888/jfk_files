Item 2: On page 159, paragraph 6, the report states,

Mr.

Blakey agreed to the

Jerry's

general response to a question concerning

brother's involvement in the assassination was:"

Item 3: On page 195, line 2, it is stated that "One

The FBI objected to this wording because it implied

that the HSCA learned of informant's identity through a

review of FBI files.

Mr. Blakey agreed to a revised wording of this sen-

tence, which

is as follows:

"The committee learned of the

identity of the FBI's SCLC informant when he acknowledged his

former status in a committee interview.

He was asked about

the nature of his relationship with the Bureau:"

Item 8: On page 240, paragraph 7, the report states

that the FBI's conduct was

"morally reprehensible, illegal,

felonious, and unconstitutional."

The FBI objected to this

statement in discussing the FBI Counterintelligence Program

because

the HSCA, in its

report, failed to point out suffi-

cient evidence to warrant such language. Mr. Blakey refused

to make any change in this statement.

Item 9: On page 247, paragraph 1, the report states,

["washington instructed the FBI legal attache in Ottawa to con-

duct a similar

review of Canadian passports, with the assis-

tance of the Royal canadian Mounted Police (4) #

to refer to the FBI's relationship with a foreign intelligence

service. (Ku)

authorities to review Canadian passport records. : (127) "

CONFIRENEIAL

Memorandum D. Ryan to Mr. Bailey

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Appendix-Volume XIII - MLK

Item 1: On page 117, last paragraph, the panel

report, in paragraph 32, lists

the results of fingerprint

comparisons on numerous photographs.

In paragraph 33, the

panel report states that the HSCA panel, in examining these

reports,

agreed with earlier findings of the FBI. However,

the report stated that "In addition, the panel determined

that the previously unidentified photograph 115, developed

from a, coupon from Eric S. Galt to Modern Photo Bookstore,

bears

an impression made by the left thumb of James Earl Ray."

It was pointed out to Mr. Blakey that this sentence

is misleading and

incorrect in view of the fact that the FBI

initially identified photograph 115 as an impression of Ray's

left thumb, and

therefore the HSCA only confirmed this finding.

Mr. Blakey agreed

to make the following changes

in

the report:

(1) On page 116, under photograph

115, the l

number of 326 was added in parentheses following the word

"Store"; (2) on page 117, information concerning the identifi-

cation of photograph 115

would be listed in the correct chrono-

logical order under paragraph 32; (3) the sentence in the last

paragraph

on page 117, in paragraph 33, beginning with "In

addition," would therefore be deleted.

Item 2: On page 127, bottom of the page, under item (c),

there appears the sentence _"The FBI received this specimen

from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on June 4, 1968. "I (e) 4)

(ud The FBI objected to inclusion of this information

because

it disclosed the FBI's relationshipp with a foreign

intelligence service. Mr. Blakey agreed to delete this

sentence.
