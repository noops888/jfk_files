Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: New York

is requested to send requested files to

Headquarters/JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an

Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter requiring the

FBI's response.

Details: Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA)

any materials considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full.

Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field

Office. Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the files should be made for record purposes prior to their

shipment to Headquarters. All files should be received at

Headquarters no later than C.O.B. 04/04/97.

If you have any questions, you may call Brian J. Fields

(202) 324-9535

Please ship the following files to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention

Brian J. Fields, Room 6362.
