3. Will consider requesting Bureau authority to

review subject's toll calls.

ADMINISTRATIVE

Dallas anticipates an early interview of subject in

view of his rather friendly attitude toward the reporting Agent. Subject

was originally met through DL 275-C-TE who used to be MILLER's partner

in substantial bookmaking operation as identified in details of this

report. MILLER appears to be working pretty much alone, at least in

the operation of the booking location as revealed through spot check

coverage. He may be getting his line locally from other bookies in Dallas,

but eventually it will have to be determined through check of toll calls

any one e

whether there is any out of state connection..
