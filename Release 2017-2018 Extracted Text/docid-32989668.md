NOTE:

192 JUN 24 1970

The Blackstone Rangers is the largest of the egro

youth gangs in the Chicago area and operate on the South

side.

Its membership is estimated at 2,000, with the majority

of its members being teenagers. The organization has

approximately 40 subdivisions operating as individual gangs.

There is an ever present danger should this large Negro

youth gang develop black nationalism and align themselves

with black extremist organizations such as the Black Panther

Party.

A confidential informant advised as follows on

August 6, 1969:

• "Muhammad Speaks," Vol. 8, No. 41, June 27, 1969,

page 7, set forth an interview of Captain Edward Buckney,

Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU), Police Department, Chicago,

Illinois.

The interview set

forth Buckney's answers to various

questions about gangs engaged in slaughter on the streets and.

schoolyards of Chicago.

In recent days, Jeff Fort, President of the Black

"p" Stone Nation, was in

contact with officials of the NOl at

Muhammad's Temple No.

2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago, and

protested the above article claiming the NoI had joined

ranks

with the GIU and the political machinery of Chicago.

Fort pro-

claimed the article to be an insult.

Foit advised his group

• was willing to try and work out in any way the problems that

beset their people but added they would not continue to tolerate

• misinformation from the NOI or any other group which would

alienate the black community from its children.

For't protested recent articles in "Muhammad Speaks"

tended to hold his group responsible for all gang slayings;

tended to imply his group was worse than the hoodlums; tended

• to indicate his group was accepting money from whites

to per-

petrate criminal acts, on black people.

YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE

MAY, 1969

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

• A Chicago Police Department (PD) source advised on

May 28, 1969, a truce had been declared between the Blackstone

Rangers and the Disciples, the two largest youth gangs oper-

ating on Chicago's South Side.

Spokesmen for each gang advised

they would discipline their members and reprimand those

creating any trouble in South Side neighborhoods.

Spokesmen

for the gangs were critical of recent pleas by the Cook

County State's Attorney in local news

media requesting

neighborhood

cooperation by citizens in reporting gang

activities.

Captain Fogerty, Watch Commander, Second PD District,

advised on May 29, 1969,

Gregory Green, a

Negro male, age 14,

residing at 4120 south Prairie Street, Chicago, was shot and

killed at approximately 11:00 PM on May 28, 1969. The shooting

occurred in the vicinity of 4000 South Indiana Street.

Captain Fogerty also advised that Edward Payne, Negro

male, age 16, residing at 4928 East 78th Street, was shot in

the hip in the vicinity of the above killing.

This shooting

occurred at approximately the same time as the one noted above.

Payne was in good condition.

According to Captain Fogerty, both

were separate incidents. He concluded by saying that both

incidents were believed

to be related to youth gang recruiting

drives in the area.

Detective Breen, Area 1, Homicide,. Chicago PD, advised

on May 29, 1969, the individuals set forth below were arrested

and have been charged with the murder of Gregory Green:

This source advised that there are continuous

rumors of members of the Blackstone Rangers becoming involved

in many illegal activities such as armed robberies, burglaries,

and strong-arming. Source advised that fron time to time arrests

have been made of individuals involved in such illegal activities

and it has been learned that many of these youth have been

affiliated with the Blackstone Rangers.

Source advised that there appears to be a growing

number of shooting incidents involving members of the Blnckstone

Ringers and the number of firearms in the possession of

Blackstone Ranger members also seems to be on the incrensc.

Source advised that the Blickstone Rangers as a

group have from time to time endeavored to be involved in

legal and constructive programs such as youth training in the

theatre and musicnl events.

Source advised that because the

BInclistone Rangers in the pest have had access to considerable

amounts of funds, this has created an atmosphere of competition

from other youth gangs. This competition seems to be crented

so that funding agencies will male money available so as to

prevent further gang activities.

This has apparently made

gang recruitment more active and consequently intra-gang fights

and shootings have been on the increase.

The source advised that the BlackstoreRangers

have been affiliated with several churches on the south side

of Chicago and has access to several church facilities

for

their mectings and places of entertainment.

The source advised that some individuals apparently

members of the Blackstone Rongers have in the past several

months been approaching businessmen on the south side of

Chicago suggesting the businessmen "donate" money to assist

the Rangers in preventing violence..

Source advised that

few of these events have proven to be prosecutable extortion

Re: BLACKSTONZ RINGERS.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. Il was organized by Bobby George seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BP! Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther"' is the statement, "

...

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

.. of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various

locations throughout the United States.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newsyaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland

, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. I was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Hucy P. Newton, B11 Minister of Defense. Newlon

is presently serving a sentence u1 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "Tie Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BP? advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themsulves against the police who are con-

sistently rcferred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Frecdom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

• October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United Staics.

RANGERS still exist in Montgomery since BENNIE, BURTON and

he had been jailed.

connected with or receiving direction from Chicago.

He

stated the only two members associated with the Chicago

organization were BURTON and himself. JACKSON advised

he could not offer any additional information on the Chicago

group as he had not had any word from anyone since being in

, Montgomery.

On this same date, ED WRIGHT, Captain, Youth Aid

Division, Police Department, Montgomery, Alabama, and

Lieutenant O. M. STRICKLAND advised that no activity from

the group associated with JACKSON and BURTON had been re-

ported since they were both placed in jail. WRIGHT advised

that this group associated themselves more in the criminal

field and no evidence of any of the group being involved in

racial matters had been presented.

Re: Mobile airtel to Bureau, 9/4/68

In view of the information contained in memorandum

dated 9/4/68 at Mobile, Alabama, indicating certain sections

of Peoria, Illinois, will be burned down during the month

& October, the Chicago Office should immediately contact

racial informants and other strategically placed sources

who can report on plans of Blackstone Rangers for specific

plans regarding the forthcoming incident at Peoria, Illinois.

Chicago should capitalize on any rapport developed through

interviews of Blackstone Rangers' members during Demcon

investigation into their activities, and attempt to enlarge

upon information contained in memorandum dated 9/4/68 at

Mobile,

Alabama.

Upon development of positive information,

it should be expeditiously furnished Springfield Division so

appropriate authorities may be notified.

In the event Chicago obtains information indicating

information provided by the Mobile Division by PARKER LEE

JACKSON (PROTECT IDENTITY) is without foundation in fact, this

should also be provided Springfield,

together with documentation

which contradicts allegation of racial incident to occur atl

Peoria during that time.

and other weapons in the church.

Source advised that the weapons

and open barber shops, dance haris, ice cream parlors ano

restaurants in the Cermack District and that the proceeds

are turned over to the Blackstone Rangers.

which had never come off and that the Blackstone Rangers

On 3/13 and 18/68 Investigator ROBERT PIERSON

and Detectives EDWARD SPELLAR and WILLIAM CORBETT, all of

whom are assigned to the Office of the Cook County (Chicago)

State's Attorney,

were contacted for possible information

in their possession regarding youth gangs in Chicago. These

men conduct investigations in connection with prosecutions

of youth gang members by that office for various violations

of law.

They furnished certain information and the results

of a question and answer interview on

217/68 at the Algiers

Motel, Chicago, Illinois, with GEORGE\ROSE, aka "Watusi,"

N/M, age 23, who then resided at 6117 'S. Kenwoad Ste Chicago.!

All of the officers participated in the interview which was

recorded from notes taken by PIERSON. They requested their

identities be protected. The following is a sumnary of the

pertinent information furnished by ROSE, all of which was

elicited from ROSE by means of specific questions.

Until the middle of the Summer of 1967, ROSE

was a member of the Blackstone Rangers, hereinafter

called the Rangers,

a Negro youth gang on the South Side

of Chicago.

At that time he held the position of "War

Lord" which was the third highest in the chain of command.

The two leaders who were above him were EUGENE HAIRSTON,

aka "Bull"

1, and JEFF FORT, aka "Ange)" ROSE also supplied

the names

of eighteen other main members of the organiza-

tion, which he said then had a membership of about 6,000.

He said there are Rangers in Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San

Francisco, and Detroit, but they are independent organiza-

there are no

national dues involved.

• ROSE stated money had been donated to the Rangers

by "Youth Job, Urban League, Catholic School

Board, and TWO."

At one time he saw $29,000 in "JEFF's mother's house," which

money came from dues and protection money collected from

businessmen.

The money was used for bond money and guns

which were purchased from people on the street and gun shops

:, in the suburbs.

He estimated they could muster about 200

guns if necessary.

ROSE said at one time they had about fifteen hand

grenades, both smoke and fragmentation types, which GENE

bought from a fellow named BOB*

He had also

seen about

seven 30-30 carbines. The ultimate aim of the Rangers, he

added, was "to have a city full of Blackstone Rangers.

and BULL said they would cause a riot and then make demands,"

which demands would be jobs, playgrounds, and building

renewal.

ROSE/further stated that FORT, HAIRSTON, ImbAlm 1!

BELL, BERNARD GREEN and EDDIE-BEY, all Ranger members,

"traveled to Philadelphia, Michigan, and California,

did not know who they contacted except "KARENGÃ in California."

He said that in the past he has seen HAIRSTON or FORT meet

with DICK GREGORY, KARENGA, and STOKELY CARMICHAEL.

In connection with dope activities, he said at

one time he had "a few hustlers" working for

him and that

one JIMMY LEE STRAUDER, a dope peddler, wanted the approval

O1 MALANION to aLLOW his peddlers a free hand in the area,

but he refused because of the crime syndicate. From con-

versation he heard from others, ROSE thinks some Rangers

may have killed STRAUDER.

With respect to weapons possibly hidden in the

Ranger Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, 6400

South Kimbark Street, Chicago, he said he had seen a

few

hand grenades hidden

in a piano in the Assistant Pastor's

office and that a false ceiling in the balcony in the gym

and a tunnel under the church had been used.

ROSE further stated that the Disciples, another

Negro South Side youth gang, at one time stole some guns

from a train car and kept them in a church at 74th Street

and Maryland Ave., Chicago.

He stated that a riot in the downtown area of

Chicago with looting and fires was discussed by the Rangers

for 8/67. It was proposed that the Vice Lords, another

youth gang, would come from the north, the Puerto Ricans from

the west, and armed Rangers from the south and east. He

said that during the discussion, Rev. JOHN FRY, W/M, Pastor

of the church, "was there for his two cents and then would

leave."

ROSE

thought the Army would surround them and that would be the

end of the Rangers.

In connection with possible activity at the 1968

Democratic Convention, ROSE said he had seen KARENGA and

some people he was told were from Detroit talking with FORT

and HAIRSTON, but he did not state the nature of their con-

versation.

He said, "The Tigers of the Sun (black nationalists)

are with DICK GREGORY." He added that MARTIN LUTHER KING

would be in Chicago and would lead marches and would block

a11

routes to the Amphitheatre.

He did not think the Rangers

bad been comnitted to anyone but a lot of money had been offered;

to them for help this summer.

He further stated that when the Rangers made an

agreement with the Chicago PD and Agents of the U.S. Treasury

non-operating guns and zip guns made for this purpose,

the working guns were kept.

He said this was HAIRSTON's

and FORT's idea and Rev. FRY agreed with them. He said Rev.

FRY hid him in the church on one occasion to

escape arrest

when police raided the church and arrested others.

ROSE stated he does not know what power, if any,

directs Rev. FRY, and he knows of no direct connection

between the Rangers and the black nationalists or the CP.

The aforementioned officers stated that they cannot

vouch for the veracity of sose or the accuracy of his infor-

mation. hosE said that his life vas in danger from the

Rangers and they believe much of the information he furnished

was supposition in that he was scared and gave answers to

questions when he did not know the answers. ROSE was unable

to give names or any details regarding persons who allegedly

offered the Rangers money for help this summer and they think

ROSE is guessing regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING's proposed

summer activities as hereinbefore stated. ROSE was unable

to state the purpose of HAIRSTON's meeting with KARENGA or

others. The officers stated they have never heard of an

organization called the Tigers of the Sun although they have

been familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago for many

years.

In connection with ROSE's statement regarding a

theft of guns for the Disciples, they said that this rumor

occurred about three years ago and the church at 74th and

Maryland was searched by police and no guns were found.

Furthermore, no theft of guns from a train car was ever

verified.

Concerning guns allegedly hidden in the Rangers

Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, they stated

that about two years ago it was common knowledge that some

guns were there and the police raided the church and obtained

about forty guns.

At that time, Rev.FRY said he was keeping

the guns to prevent the Rangers from using them and charged

police harassment.

In any event, they stated, ROSE has been out of

the Rangers since 8/67

and is in no position to furnish

accurate, current information.

ROSE has fled Chicago and

they do not know his present whereabouts. At the present

time HAIRSTON and FORT are incarcerated awaiting trial on

a murder charge and ROSE said he was ordered killed to keep

him from trying to take over command of the Rangers in

their absence.

They added that Rev. FRY has no control

over the Rangers especially since CHARLES EDWARD BEY took

over as their leader.

hereto.

On 3/15/68 Lt. EDWARD BUCKNEY, Gang Intelligence

• Statements regarding mounted 105 millimeter guns is unbelievable.

He stated that the police dept. is unable to state whether the

statements about the communists are true or not but it should

be kept in mind that ROSE is a former gang member and has been

a dealer in narcotics and a possible user.

In connection with the tape of the interview with

ROSE as described in the article, Lt. BUCKNEY said the tape

has been given to the Office of Chicago Mayor RICHARD DALEY.

He said the Chief Investigator of the McClellan Committee

(Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations) was allowed to

hear the tape but he does not know if he was given a copy.

BUCKNEY

stated he does not know who released the information

to the "Chicago Tribune" but that it appeared only in one

early edition and was then undoubtedly stopped because of

its uncorroborated and inflammatory nature.

On 3/19/68 Sgt. GARLAND DAVIS, Youth Division,

Chicago PD, advised that the information in said newspaper

article is,

in his opinion,

a figment of ROSE's imagina-

tion. He said ROSE, according to police information, had

looking for help and protection

has been no information developed by police sources to

substantiate ROSE's information. DAVIS is in the position

of correlating all information developed by Chicago PD con-

cerning all phases of youth gang activity.

With respect to the inability and disinclination

of the Blackstone Rangers to partake in any city-wide or

even area-wide disturbances in cooperation with other gangs

or black nationalists, the Bureau's attention is directed

to CGairtel and LHM 2/15/68 entitled, "BLACKSTONE RANGERS;

RM and YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE; RM." Said LHM states in part

that reliable confidential

sources of the Chicago Office

and sources of the Chicago PD, all of whom are well acquainted

with gang activities, stated the Blackstone Rangers are pre-

sently disorganized due to the incarceration of their top

leaders on a variety of criminal charges and said sources

have heard no information or indication that the Rangers

or any other youth gang is attempting to organize other

gangs for the purpose of violence,

Said sources stated that the chief gang concern

is the protection of their own gang territory and as a

: result most gang violence has not been directed at the

community, white or Negro, but has resulted over other

gang incursions into their territory and recruitment attempts

not known as black nationalists in outlook although some

individual members do listen to black nationalist talk and

may be susceptible to their literature.

Furthermore, the Blackstone Rangers have an

Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) funded program of

dropout education currently in progress through TWO and

are not likely to jeopardize this grant totalling nearly

•a million dollars.

The best estimate of their membership

from sources is that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance of

one degree or another to the Rangers.

AddItIonally, there is no intormation available or

developed by sources of the Chicago Office which would tend in

any way to substantiate or corroborate the major allegations

made by ROSE in his statements to police. Specifically,

this is

in reference to the alleged riot in Chicago's Loop in 8/67, or

the information reflecting that people with "funny sounding

names... from Russia", had offered the Rangers jeeps with

105 (millimeter) canons mounted thereon.

As Sergeant DAVIS, above, has stated in a discussion

and analysis of the information provided by ROSE, his background

character and past record must be taken into account. He is a

long-time youth gang member, does not operate on a commonly

accepted level of truth, and as with most gang leaders, has

developed the ability to "con" to a fine degree.

The Chicago Police Department has frequently received

the allegation concerning handgrenades, as an example, and have

established to their satisfaction that

there are not,

not been such explosives in the Rangers' possession.

The closest

the Chicago Police have come to such was a dummy grenade, in

the raid on the First Presbyterian Church, in 1966.

In connection with ROSE, it should be noted he is

reportedly out of Chicago at present, in hiding, with his

whereabouts unknown to the Police Department. The tape recording

of the interview with ROSE is currently in possession of the

office of Mayor DALEY. Chicago feels that until such time as

this tape is again in possession of the Police Department, no

effort should be made to obtain it. Likewise, no interview with

ROSE is at this point feasable

or deemed desirable by Chicago.

Chicago will, however, aggressively pursue this matter

with the

Police Department,

and with sources of this office

who are knowledgeable in such matters.

Any subsequent pertinent

information developed will be provided the Bureau.

Chicago is not making any local dissemination of the

above information,

due to its nature and that of

the source,

ooth of which in themselves tend to reflect so adversely on Its

credability.

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

The following information relates to a report that

the Blackstone Rangers, a Chicago, Illinois, juvenile gang,

has worked out agreements with other gangs in Chicago.

According to the report, each gang has "staked out" a

particular area of Chicago in what has been described as

"interlocking directorates" in which the gangs plan to

"bring havoc" to the City of Chicago.

Confidential sources of this Bureau, all of whom

have furnished reliable information in the past, and a

. number of whom are well acquainted with the activities of

the Blackstone Rangers and youth gang activities in Chicago

generally, furnished the following information on

February 13 and 14, 1968:

The Blackstone Rangers gang is a large Negro

youth gang operating generally in Chicago's South Side.

The so-called "Ranger Nation" is composed of subgangs of

varying memberships. The Blackstone Rangers gang is

estimated to be one of the largest in Chicago. Membership

estimates vary, but the best available estimate indicates

that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance to the gang in one

degree or another.

The gang at present is in a state of disorgani-

zation because of the incarceration of three of its most

prominent leaders on a variety of criminal charges.

for any purpose. The sources of this Bureau contacted

specifically stated that they have heard no information

or rumors, and have seen no indication, that the Blackstone

Rangers, or any other Negro youth gang, is presently

attempting to organize with other gangs in Chicago for

the purpose of violence or disturbances.

These sources advised that, based on past

experience with gangs, it is highly unlikely that these

undisciplined youths would consent to influence or

direction from another gang. The chief concern of these

gangs is a protection of their own strictly defined gang

area.

As a result, most gang violence is not directed

at the community, either white or Negro, but against the

intrusion of another gang in the gang's

area, recruitment

efforts by another gang, and similar activities. The

members of the: Blackstone Rangers are not known to be

• black nationalists in their outlook, although undoubtedly

some individual gang members do listen to black nationalist

talk.

The Blackstone Rangers participate in an educa-

'tion and rehabilitation program 'funded by the Office of

Economic Opportunity. This program is administered

through The Woodlawn Organization, a Woodlawn neighborhood

improvement group. The sources contacted do not believe

that the Blackstone Rangers would want to take any action

which would jeopardize this program, the grant for which

totals nearly one million dollars.

As an indication of the lack of cooperation

between gangs, the sources noted that even in the course

of this program of The Woodlawn Organization the Blackstone

Rangers and their chief rival gang have had serious disputes,

including shootings, in the facilities of The Woodlawn

- 2-

Organization occasioned by their intense rivalry and tradi-

tional enmity. The sources concluded that it was difficult

to imagine any issue of sufficient seriousness to cause

these gangs to forget their past differences. They felt

that the gangs in Chicago would have to face a real and

apparent threat to their actual existence from outside

the gang structure before they would consider a merger,

consolidation, or voluntary joint action.

On February 13 and 14, 1968, sources of the

Chicago Police Department who are generally knowledgeable

in the racial field, as well as those specifically involved

in the daily investigation of youth and youth gangs in

Chicago, provided substantially the same information as

the sources mentioned above. These sources stated

categorically that they have developed no information

indicating that the Blackstone Rangers or any other

youth gangs are attempting to cooperate through "inter-

locking directorates" to "bring havoc" to Chicago. All

these sources consider such gang activity highly unlikely

and feel that such cooperation runs counter to traditional

gang activities and intergang hostility.

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

The following information relates to a report that

the Blackstone Rangers, a Chicago, Illinois, juvenile gang,

has worked out agreements with other gangs in Chicago.

According to the report, each gang has "staked out" a

particular area of Chicago in what; has been described as

"interlocking directorates" in which the gangs plan to

"bring havoc" to the City of Chicago.

Confidential sources of, this Bureau, all of whom

have furnished reliable information in the past, and a

number of whon are well acquainted with the activities of

the Blackstone Rangers and youth gang activities in Chicago

generally, furnished the following information on

February 13 and 14, 1958:

The Blackstone Rangers gang is a large Negro

youth gang operating generally in Chicago's South Side.

The so-called "Ranger Nation" is composed of subgangs of

varying nemberships.

The Blackstone Rangers gang is

estimated to be one of the largest in Chicago. Membership

estimates vary, but the best available estimate indicates

that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance to the gang in one

degree or another.

N

NEMORANDUM

The gang at present is in a state of disorgani-

zation because of the incarceration of three of its most

prominent leaders ona variety of criminal charges.

Con-

sequently, the Blackstone Rangers are suffering from

Internal friction and are currently incapable of formu-

for any purpose. The sources of this Bureau contacted

specifically stated that they have heard no information

of rumors, and have seen no indication, that the Blackstone

Rangers, or.any other Negro youth gang, is presently

• attempting to organize with other gangs in Chicago fox

the purpose of violence or disturbances.

These sources advised, that based on past

experience with gangs, it is highly unlikely that these

undisciplined youths would consent to influence. or

direction from another gang. The chief concern of these

gangs is a protection of their own strictly defined gang

area. As a result, most gang violence is not directed

at the community, either white or Negro, but against the

intrusion of another gang in the gang's area, recruitment

efforts by another gang, and sinilar activities. The

members: of the Blackstone Rangers are not known to be

black

nationalists in their outlook, although, undoubtedly,

some individual gang members do listen to black nationalists

talk.

The Blackstone Rangers participate in an educa-

tion and rehabilitation program funded by the Office of

Economic Opportunity. This program is administered

through The Woodlawn Organization, a Woodlawn neighborhood

Improvement group. The sources contacted do not believe

that the Blackstone Rangers would want to take any action

which would jeopardize this program, the grant for which

totals nearly one million dollars.

As an indication of the lack of cooperation

between gangs, the sources noted that even in the course

of this program of The Woodlawn Organization the Blackstone

Ringers and their chief rival gang have had serious disputes,

including shootings, in the facilities of The Woodlawn

BLACKSIONE RANGERS

Organization occasioned by their intense rivalsy and tradi-

tional ermity. The sources concluded that it' vas difficult

to incaine any issue of sufficient seriousness to cause

these gangs to forget their past differences. They felt

that the gangs in Chicago would have to face a real and

apparent threat to their actual existence from outside

the gang structure before they would consider a merger,

consolidation, or voluntary joint action.

On February 13 and 14, 1968, sources of the

Chicago Police Department who are generally knowledgeable

in the racial field, as well as those specifically involved

in the daily investigation of youth and youth gangs in

Chicago, provided substantially the sane information as

the sources mentioned above. These sources stated

categorically that they have developed no information

indicating that the Blackstone Rangers or any other

youth gangs are attempting to cooperate through "inter-

locking directorates"' to "bring havoc" to Chicago. All

these sources consider such gang activity highly unlikely

and feel that such cooperation runs counter to traditional

• gang activities and intergang hostility. -

"Muhammad Speaks," Vol. 8, No. 41, June 27, 1969,.

page 1, set forth an interview of Captain Edward Buckney,

Gang Intelligence Unit (GIU), Police Department, Chicago,

Illinois.

The interview set

forth Buckney's answers to various

questions about gangs engaged in slaughter on the streets and..

schoolyards of Chicago.

In recent days, Jeff Fort, Prestdent of the Black

"p" Stone Nation, was in contact with officials of the NOI at

Muhammad's Temple No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood, Chicago, and

protested the above article claiming the NOI had joined ranks

Fort pro-

claimed the article to be an insult. Fort advised his group

• was willing

to try and work out in any way the problems that

beset

people but added they would not continue to tolerate

• misinformation from the NOI or any other group which would

alienate the black community from its children.

For't protested recent articles in "Muhammad Speaks"

tended to hold his group responsible for all gang slayings;

tended to imply his group was worse than the hoodlums; tended

• to indicate his group was accepting money from whites

to per-

petrate criminal acts, on black people.

YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE

MAY, 1969

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

A Chicago Police Department (PD) source advised on

May 28, 1969, a truce had been declared between the Blackstone

Rangers and the Disciples, the two largest youth gangs oper-

ating on Chicago's South Side.

Spokesmen for each gang advised

they would discipline their members and reprimand those

creating any trouble in South Side neighborhoods. Spokesmen

for the gangs were critical of recent pleas by the Cook

County State's Attorney in local news media requesting

• neighborhood cooperation by citizens in reporting gang

activities.

Captain Fogerty, Watch Commander, Second PD District,

advised on May 29, 1969,

Gregory Green, a Negro male, age 14,

residing at 4120 South Prairie Street, Chicago, was shot and

killed at approximately 11:00 PM on May 28, 1969. The shooting

occurred in the vicinity of 4000 South Indiana Street.

Captain Fogerty also advised that Edward Payne, Negro

•male, age 16, residing at 4928 East 78th Street, was shot in

the hip in the vicinity of the above killing.

This shooting

occurred at approximately the same time as the one noted

above.

Payne was in good condition. According to Captain Fogerty, both

• were separate incidents. He concluded by saying that both

incidents were believed to be related to youth gang recruiting

drives in the area.

Detective Breen, Area 1, Homicide, Chicago PD, advised

on may 29, 1969, the individuals set forth below were arrested

and. have been charged with the murder of Gregory Green:

following information to a representative of the Federal Bureau

The source advised the ßlackstone Rangers is a

Negro youth gang operating in a large territory on the south

side of Chicago.

This organization is considered as one of

the better organized street gangs in Chicago and becnuse of

much publicity in national nevs media, this gang has been

given added recruiting power. Because of the apparent

expansion of the Blackstone Rangers they have now endeavored

. to

expand to some of the suburban areas to the south of Chicago

and generally use

the none of the Black F. Stone Nation, in

• the areas of this current expansion.

Source also advised that many Negro youth clain

affilintion with the Blackstone R'ngers since it seems to serve

a particular purpose when in tact the youth may not be a member.

in the legro communities.

operations give. the appearance of having affiliation with

highly unsavory individuals.

This source advised that there are continuous

rumors of members of the Blackstone Rangers becoming involved

in many illegal activities such as armed robberies, burglaries,

and strong-arming. Source advised that fron time to time arrest:

have been made of

individuals involved in such illegal activities

and it has been learned that many of these youth have been

affiliated with the Blackstone Rangers.

Source advised that there appears to be a growing

number of shooting incidents involving members of the Blnckstone

Ringers and the number of firearms in the possession of

Blackstone Ranger members also seems to be on the increase.

Source advised that the Blackstone Rangers as a

group have from time to time endeavored to be involved in

Legal and constructive programs such as youth training in the

theatre and musical events.

Source advised that because the

BInckstone Rangers in the pest have had eccess to considerable

amounts of funds, this has created an atmosphere of competition

from other youth gangs. This competition seems to be crented

so that funding agencies will male money available so as to

prevent further gang activities.

This has apparently made

gang recruitment more active and consequently intrn-gang fights

and shootings have been on the increase.

The source advised that the BlackstopeRangers

have been affiliated with several churches on the south side

of Chicago and has access to several church facilities for

their mectings and places of entertainment.

The source advised that some individunls apparently

members of the Blaclistone Rongers have in the past severnl

months been approaching businessmen on the south side of

Chicago suggesting the businessmen "donate" money to assist

the Rangers in preventing violence.

Source advised that

few of these events have proven to be prosecutable extortion

cases, however, a suggestion of pressure is created.

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BPP Minister of Defense. Newton

is presently serving a sentence vi 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service," states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther"' issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Education, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "...

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tse-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun."

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

• APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY

According to its official newspaper, the Black Panther Party

(BPP) was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can take control of the life, politics, and the

destiny of the black community. It was organized by Bobby George Seale,

BPP Chairman, and Huey P. Newton, BP! Minister of Defense.

Newton

is presently serving a sentence 01 2 to 15 years on a conviction of man-

slaughter in connection with the killing of an Oakland police officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther," which further

describes itself as the "Black Community News Service, " states that the

BPP advocates the use of guns and guorrilla tactics in its revolutionary

program to end oppression of the black people. Residents of the black

community are urged to arm themselves against the police who are con-

sistently referred to in the publication as "pigs" who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968, contains an

editorial by BPP Minister of Educalion, George Mason Murray, which

ends with the following: •

"Black men. Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere! Arm yourselves.. The only culture worth keeping

is a revolutionary culture. Change. Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!

Black Power. Use the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing in the

October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the statement, "

we will not dissent from American Government. We will overthrow it."

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain quotations

from the writings of Chairman MAO Tsc-tung of the People's Republic

of China and feature MAO's statement that "political power grows out of

the barrel of a gun. "

The national headquarters of the BPP is located at 3106 Shattuck

Avenue, Berkeley, California. Branches have been established at

various locations throughout the United States.

November 6, 1968

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

On November 4, 1968, source who furnished reliable

information in the past, reported that "No-Voter" signs are

being painted all over the southside oi Chicago,

and that

these signs are the work of the Youth Gang known as the Black-

stone Rangers.

source attributes the idea of the signs to

recent statements of Reverend John Fry, of the First Presbyterian

Church, 64th ad Kimbark, Chicago, Illinois. Reverend Fry is

closely associated with

the Blackstone Rangers, and the Rangers

meet regularly at his church.

Source believed

that the Black-

stone Rangers may attempt, by threat of violence, to intimidate

voters away from polls on election day, November 5, 1968.

Further source noted that similar signs are appearing on the

westside of Chicago, which is not Ranger territory.

On November 4, 1968, Chicago press media quotes

Blackstone Rangers spokesman

to the effect that he is claiming

Rangers are distributing literature on a citywide scale, urging

Toters to stay home on Election Day, November 5, 1968,

repudiation of Mayor Daley. Spokesman claims

that this

is the

first. step. to the takeover of the Chicago political apparatus

by 1970 (presumably the Rangers).

.:'

.On 'November 5, 1968, Officer Chanski, Office of the

•Deputy superintendent of Field Services, Chicago, Illinois,

Police Department, reported-to the Chicago Office of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI), that he had just been notified by

•the communications conter of

his department,

that an anonymous

telephone call had been

received concerning

the Blackstone Rangers.

Officer Chanski Sated that the caller indicated the Rangers

would cause distupbances.at a polling place located at 55th ano

In view of the information contained in memorandum

dated 9/4/68 at Mobile, Alabama, indicating certain sections

of Peoria, Illinois, will be burned down during the month

6T October, the Chicago Office should immediately contact

racial informants and other strategically placed sources

who can report on plans of Blackstone Rangers for specific

plans regarding the forthcoming incident at Peoria, Illinois.

Chicago should capitalize on any rapport developed through

interviews of Blackstone Rangers' members during Decon

investigation into their activities, and attempt to enlarge

upon information contained in memorandum dated 9/4/68 at

Mobile, Alabama.

Upon development of positive information,

it should be expeditiously furnished Springfield Division so

appropriate authorities may be notified.

In the event Chicago obtains information indicating

information provided by the Mobile Division by PARKER LEE

JACKSON (PROTECT IDENTITY) is without foundation in fact, this

should also be provided Springfield,

together with documentation

which contradicts allegation of racial incident to occur att

Peoria during that time.

late July, 1968, a letter sent out by the Blackstone

Rangers to the merchants in the Woodlawn Area.. This letter,

four

paragraphs in length, addressed to businessmen of the

Woodlawn, South Shore, Englewood and Hyde Park area, was more

This letter also stated that the members wanted to clear

their name of the act of extortion and other blasphemous

acts which have been done by others using their name.

The letter also states that a committee made up of

Blackstone Rangers

should act as sort of a police

with the police department in cases involving extortion

and false representation.

This letter did not ask

for payment for service but any donations to this

worthy cause would gladly be appreciated.

BLACKSTONE RANGERS

A source, who has furnished reliable information

In the past, advised on July 12, 1968, that the Blackstone

Rangers will make a fund raising tour of certain large

cities on the East Coast.

Source stated it is possible that

the Rangers' musical group will also make this visit in an

effort to raise funds for the Blackstone Rangers.

A second source who has furnished reliable infor-

mation in the past advised on July 12, 1968, that some mem-

bers of the Blackstone Rangers are supposedly going to make

a trip to the East Coast in an effort to raise funds for the

Blackstone Rangers organization.

This source also advised

that probably the musical group known as "Opportunity Knocks"

will be part of this fund raising group.

A third source, which collects intelligence type

information in the Chicago area, advised on July 12, 1968,

that information has come to them which indicates that some

of the Rangers' leaders will accompany the musical group

mentioned above on a fund raising tour to the East Coast.

This

source also advised that the group will probably also

visit Harlem located in New York City inasmuch as they made

a smilar fund raising trip in 1967 which included Harlem.

source also advised that rumor has it that Eugene (Bull)

Hairston, recognized as leader of the Blackstone Rangers,

would be unavailable Monday and Tuesday, July 15 and 16,

1968,

which would indicate that he may accompany instant group on

their fund raising tour.

It shoul be noted that Hairston

recently was convirted on a charge of solicitation

to commit

murder and is presently free on $15,000 bond.

It should be

noted also that Hairston will be sentenced on July 18, 1968.

city to a more pleasant atmosphere and to sit down

and talk with them and discuss problems which face

the Rangers and south side communitees and in an

effort to stop the shooting and killing of inocent

youths on

Chicago's south side.

G4:

Until the middle of the Summer of 1967, ROSE

was a member of the Blackstone rangers, hereinafter

called the Rangers, a Negro youth gang on the South Side

of Chicago. At that time he held the position of "War

Lord" which was the third highest in the chain of command.

The two leaders who were above him were EUGENE HAIRSTON,

aka "Bull", and JEFF)FORT, aka "Angel" ROSE also supplied

the names of eighteen other main members of the organiza~

t202, which he said then had a membership of about 6,000. |

He said there are Rangers in Milwaukee, Los Angeles, San

Francisco, and Detroit, but they are independent organiza-

tions and

there are no national dues involved.

-1!

• ROSE stated money had been donated to the Rangers

by "Youth Job, Urban League, Catholic School Board, and TWO."

At one time he saw $29, 000 in "JEFF's mother's house," which

money came from dues and protection money collected from

businessmen. The money was used for bond money and guns

which were purchased from people on the street and gun shops

'., in the suburbs.

He estimated they could muster about 200

guns if necessary.

ROSE said at one time they had about fifteen hand

grenades, both smoke and fragmentation types, which GENE

bought from a fellow named BOB.

He had also seen about

seven 30-30

carbines.

The ultimate aim ot the rangers, he

added, was "to have a city full of Blackstone Rangers.

JEFF

and Bull said they would cause a riot and then make demands;"

which demands would be jobs, playgrounds, and building

renewal.

-

"ROSE/further stated that FORT, HAIRSTON, JAMAR

BELL, BERNARD GREEN and EDDIE BEX, all Ranger

members,

have

"traveled to Philadelphia, Michigan, and California,

an' but he

did not know who they contacted except "KARENGÀ in California."

He said that in the past he has seen HAIRSTON Or FORT meet

With DICK GREGORY, KARENGA, and STOKELY CARMICHAEL.

In connection with dope activities, he said at

one time he bad "a few

hustlers" working for

him and that

one JIMMY LEE STRAUDER, a dope peddler, wanted the approval

of HAIRSTON to allow his peddlers a free hand in the area,

but he refused because of the crime syndicate. From con-

versation he heard from others, ROSE thinks some Rangers

may have killed STRAUDER.

With respect to weapons possibly hidden in the

Ranger Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, 6400

South Kimbark Street,

Chicago, he said he had seen a

few

hand grenades hidden

in a piano in the Assistant Pastor's

office and that a false ceiling in the balcony in the gym

and a tunnel under the church had been used.

ROSE further stated that the Disciples, another

Negro South Side youth gang, at one time stole some guns

from a train car and kept them in a church at 74th Street

and Maryland Ave., Chicago.

He stated that a riot in the downtown area of

Chicago with looting and fires was discussed by the Rangers

for 8/67. It was proposed that the Vice Lords, another

youth gang, would come from the north, the Puerto Ricans from

the west, and armed Rangers from the south and east. He

said that during the discussion, Rev. JOHN FRY, W/M, Pastor

of the church, "was there for his two cents and then would

leave." ROSE

said that he talked them out of it because he

thought the Army would surround them and that would be the

end of the Rangers.

In connection with possible activity at the 1968

Democratic Convention, ROSE said he had seen KARENGA and

some people he was told were from Detroit talking with FORT

and HAIRSTON, but he did not state the nature of their con-

versation.

He said,

"The Tigers of the Sun (black nationalists)

are with DICK GREGORY." He added that MARTIN LUTHER KING

would be in Chicago and would lead marches and would block

all routes to the Amphitheatre.

He did not think the Rangers

had been committed to anyone but a lot of money had been offered

to them for help this summer.

He further stated that when the Rangers made an

agreement with the Chicago PD and Agents of the U.S. Treasury

Dept. to surrender their guns, they turned in all rust but

non-operating guns and zip guns made for this purpose,

the working guns were kept.

He said this was HAIRSTON'S

and FORT's idea and Rev. FRY agreed with them. He said Rev.

FRY hid him in the church on one occasion to escape arrest

when police raided the church and arrested others.

ROSE stated he does not know what power, if any,

directs Rev. FRY, and

he knows of no direct connection

between the Rangers and the black nationalists or the CP.

The aforementioned officers stated that they cannot

vouch for the veracity of ROSE of the accuracy of his infor-

mation, ROSE said that his lifé was in danger from the

Rangers and they believe much of the information he furnished

was supposition in that he was scared and gave answers to

it not on the a wan

questions when he did not know the answers. ROSE was unable

ito give names or any details regarding persons who allegedly

offered the Rangers money for help this summer and they think

ROSE is guessing regarding MARTIN LUTHER KING's proposed

summer activities as hereinbefore stated. ROSE was unable

to state the purpose of HAIRSTON's meeting with KARENGA or

others.

The officers stated they have never heard of an

organization called the Tigers of the Sun although they have

been familiar with youth gang activities in Chicago for many

In connection with ROSE's statement regarding a

theft of guns for the Disciples, they said that this rumor

occurred about three years ago and the church at 74th and

Maryland was searched by police and no guns were found.

furthermore, no theft of guns from a train car was ever

verified.

Concerning guns allegedly hidden in the Rangers

Headquarters at the First Presbyterian Church, they stated

that about two years ago it was common knowledge that some

guns were there and the police raided the church and obtained

about forty guns.

At that time, Rev.FRY said he was keeping

the guns to prevent the Rangers from using them and charged

police harassment.

In any event, they stated, ROSE has been out of

the Rangers since 8/67 and is in no position to furnish

accurate, current information.

ROSE has fled Chicago and

they do not know his present whereabouts. At the present

time HAIRSTON and FORT are incarcerated awaiting trial on

a murder charge and ROSE said he was ordered killed to keep

him from trying to take over command of the Rangers in

their absence.

The Three Star Edition of the "Chicago Tribune," a

Chicago daily newspaper, dated 310/68, carried an article by

WILLIAM JONES entitled,

"Negro Gang Leader Tells Arms Offer."

The article contains results of a taped interview with ROSE

by Chicago Police and a

a copy of the article is attached

hereto.

On 3/15/68 It. EDWARD BUCKNEY, Gang Intelligence

Unit, Chicago PD, stated that the information in the newspaper

article regarding narcotics and the obtaining of guns in the

suburbs is possibly true.

He added, however, that the

• Statements regarding mounted 105 millimeter guns is unbelievable.

He stated that the police dept. is unable to state whether the

statements about the communists are true or not but it should

be kept in mind that rost is a former gang member and has been

a dealer in narcotics and a possible user.

In connection with the tape of the interview with

ROSE as described in the article, Lt. BUCKNEY said the tape

has been given to the Office of Chicago Mayor RICHARD DALEY.

He said the Chief Investigator of the McClellan Committee

(Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations) was allowed to

hear the tape but he does not know if he was given a copy.

BUCKNEY

stated he does not know who released the information

to the "Chicago Tribune" but that it appeared only in one

early edition and was then undoubtedly stopped because of

its uncorroborated and inflammatory nature.

On 3/19/68 Sgt. GARLAND DAVIS, Youth Division,

Chicago PD, advised that the information in said newspaper

article is,

in his opinion, a figment of ROSE's imagina-

He said ROSE, according to police information, had

marked for death by the gang and, therefore, he was

looking for help and protection and gave information that

he believed

the police wanted to hear. DAVIS said there

bas been no information developed by police sources to

substantiate ROSE's information. DAVIS is in the position

of correlating all information developed by Chicago PD COn-

cerning all phases of youth gang activity.

With respect to the inability and disinclination

of the Blackstone Rangers to partake in any city-wide or

even area-wide disturbances in cooperation with other gangs

or. black nationalists, the Bureau's attention is directed

to CGairtel and LHM 2/15/68

entitled, "BLACKSTONE RANGERS;

RM and YOUTH GANG VIOLENCE; RM."

Said.LHM states in part

that reliable confidential sources of the Chicago Office

and sources of the Chicago PD, all of whom are well acquainted

with gang activities, stated the Blackstone Rangers are pre-

sently disorganized due to the incarceration of their top

leaders on a variety of criminal charges and said sources

have heard no information or indication that the Rangers

or any other youth gang is attempting to organize other

gangs for the purpose of violence.

Said sources stated that the chief gang concern

is the protection of their own gang territory and as a

result most gang violence has not been directed at the

community, white or Negro, but has resulted over other

gang incursions into their territory and recruitment attempts

not known as black nationalists in outlook although some

individual members do listen to black nationalist talk and

may be susceptible to their literature.

Furthermore, the Blackstone Rangers have an

Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) funded program of

dropout education currently in progress through TWO and

are not likely to jeopardize this grant totalling nearly

a million dollars.

The best estimate of their membership

from sources is that some 1, 500 youths owe allegiance of

one degree or another to the

Rangers.

CG 157-1258

Additionally, there is no information available or

developed by sources of the Chicago Office which would tend in •

any way to substantiate or corroborate the major allegations

made by ROSE in his statements to police.

Specifically, this is

in reference to the alleged riot in Chicago's Loop in 8/67, or

the information reflecting that people with "funny sounding

names..: from Russia", had offered the Rangers jeeps with

105 (millimeter) ccanons mounted thereon.

As Sergeant DAVIS, above, has stated in a discussion

and analysis of the information provided by ROSI, his background

character and past record must be taken into account.

He is a

Long-time youth gang member, does not operate on a commonly

• accepted level of truth, and as with most gang leaders, has

developed the ability to "con" to a fine degree.

The Chicago Police Department has frequently received

the allegation concerning handgrenades, as an example, and have

established to their satisfaction that

there are not,

and have

not been such explosives in the Rangers' possession.

The closest

the Chicago Police have come to such was a dummy grenade, in

the raid on the First Presbyterian Church, in 1966.

In connection with ROSE, it should be noted he is

reportedly out of Chicago at present, in hiding, with his

• whereabouts unknown to the Police Department.

The tape recording

of the interview with ROSE is currently in possession of the

office of Mayor DALEY. Chicago feels that until such time as

this tape is again in possession of the Police Department, no

effort should be made to obtain it. Likewise, no interview with

ROSE is at this point feasable or deemed desirable by Chicago.

Chicago will,

however, aggressively pursue this matter

with the Police Department, and with sources of this office

who are knowledgeable in such matters.

Any subsequent pertinent

information developed will be provided the Bureau.

Chicago is not making

any local dissemination of the

above information, due to its nature and that of the source,

both of which in themselves tend to reflect so adversely on its

credability.

who is close to the White House and the McClellen Committee,

are

aware of its existence.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE

i BLACKSTONE RANGERS, NEGRO

YOUTH GANG, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

Reference is made to memorandum from S. B.' Donahoe

to Mr. C. D. Deloach dated february 132 1460, captione

"Blackstone Rangers, Racial Matters,

" advising of a request

from Mrs. Mildred Stegall at the White House for information

concerning the validity of an allegation that the Blackstone

Rangers, a Negro youth gang in Chicago, Illinois, had worked

out agreements with other gangs to "bring havoc'' to Chicago.

An inquiry by the Chicago Office failed to

¡develop any information to substantiate the allegation. In

fact, the Bureau sourçes in Chicago thought it highly

unlikely that these undisciplined youths would consent to

influence or direction from another gang.

The Chicago Police Department was also consulted

• during the inquiry and stated categorically that they have

developed no information indicating that the Blackstone

Rangers, of any other youth gang, are attempting to cooperate •

through "interlocking directorates" to "bring havoc" to

Chicago. All these sources consider such gang activity

highly unlikely and feel that such cooperation runs counter

to traditional gang activities

andantergang hostility.

A review of Bureau files concerning the Blackstone

Rangers revealed no information to substantiate the allegation.

BLACKSTONE RANGERS.

The following information relates to a report that

the Blackstone Rangers, a Chicago, Illinois, juvenile gang,

has worked out agreements with other gangs in Chicago.

According to the report, each gang has "staked out" a

particular area of Chicago in what has been described as.

"interlocking directorates" in which the gangs plan to

"bring havoc" to the City of Chicago.

Confidential sourcés of this Bureau, all of whom

have furnished reliable information in the past, and a

number of whom are well acquainted with the activities of

the Blackstone Rangers and youth gang activities in Chicago

generally, furnished the following information on

February 13 and 14, 1968::

The Blackstone Rangers gang is a large Negro

youth gang operating generally in Chicago's South Side.

The so-called "Ranger Nation" is composed of subgangs of

varying memberships. The Blackstone Rangers gang is

estimated to be one of the largest in Chicago. Membership

estimates vary, but the best available estimate indicates

that some 1,500 youths owe allegiance to the gang in one

degree or another.

The gang at present is in a state of disorgani-

zation because of the incarceration of three of its most

prominent leaders on a variety of criminal charges.

Con-

sequently, the Blackstone Rangers are suffering from

internal friction and are currently incapable of formu-

lating a plan for city-wide or area-wide gang cooperation

The sources of this Bureau contacted

specifically stated. that they have heard no information

* or rumors, and have seen no indication, that the Blackstone

Rangers, or any other Negro youth gang, is presently

attempting to organize with other gangs in Chicago for

the purpose of violence or disturbances.

These sources advised that, based on past

experience with gangs, it is highly unlikely that these

undisciplined youths would consent to influence or

direction from another gang.

The chief concern of these

gangs is a protection of their own strictly defined gang

area.

• As a result, most gang violence is not directed

at the community, either white or Negro, but against the

intrusion of another gang, in the gang's area, recruitment

efforts by another gang, and similar activities.

The

members of the Blackstone Rangers are not known 'to be

• black nationalists in their outlook, although undoubtedly

some individual gang members do listen to black nationalist

talk.

The Blackstone Rangers participate in an educa-

'tion and rehabilitation program funded by the Office of

Economic Opportunity. This program is administered

through The Woodlawn Organization, a Woodlawn neighborhood

improvement group. The sources contacted do not believe

that the Blackstone Rangers would want to take any action

which would jeopardize this program, the grant for which

totals nearly one million dollars.

As an indication of the lack of cooperation

between gangs, the sources noted that even in the course

of this program of The Woodlawn Organization the Blackstone

Rangers and their chief rival gang have had serious disputes,

including shootings, in the facilities of The Woodlawn
