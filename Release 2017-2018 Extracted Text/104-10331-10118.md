Memo for DCI Er C/HRG, dta 13 June 96,

Same Subject

(U) This memorandum provides background information for a

meeting between you and the JFK Assassination Records Review Board

(ARRB), which is scheduled for 16 October 1996 in your office

between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m.

The meeting was requested by ARRB

Chairman, John Tunheim as a courtesy call.

(U) Background: Mr. Tunheim, recently appointed a federal

judge in Minnesota, asked that he and the other four Board members

have an opportunity to provide you with a brief description of the

Board's purpose and activities.

The Board's Executive Director,

David Marwell, and General Counsel,

Jeremy Gunn will also parti-

cipate.

The ARRB members were appointed by President Clinton in

1993 as required by statute.

Their principal responsibility is to

ensure public disclosure of all government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy.

(FOUO) Topics the Board May Discuss: The Board probably

will discuss their concern about whether they will be able to

complete their work by the congressionally-imposed deadline of

October 1997. This concern relates to the very time-consuming

process that the ARRB and its 30-person staff is obliged to use

in reviewing

all of the thousands of relevant documents that are

redacted, which for CIA comprise the bulk of our documents.

(FOUO) The Board may also seek your personal commitment to

continue the Agency's dedication of resources--people and

computer capability--to the review of JFK documents. CIA has

worked closely with the Board and its staff from the beginning.

SUBJECT: Courtesy Visit of JFK Assassination

Records Review Board, 16 October 1996

We have succeeded thus far in working out cooperative arrange-

ments for resolving differences of opinion as to what information

can be released to the public and what should be withheld because

of sensitivities.

(U) The Board may also express interest in gaining access to

records that are not part of the JEK records (the sequestered

collection), but which the Board regards as possibly containing

useful background information or leads for further inquiry. We

have released some 227,000 pages of relevant Agency records thus

far and are continuing

to collaborate with the Board to identify

additional information that can be released.

(U) Suggested Talking Points: You may want to emphasize the

Agency's commitment to continuing the very positive relationship

with the Board, including making people and computer expertise

available to process relevant documents.

(S) You may want to assure the Board that CIA is determined

to give the Board and designated staff full access to all assas-

sination records, as required by the JFK statute. At the same time,

it would be helpful to stress that there are certain categories of

sensitive information that require continued protection and should

not be released. Among the types of information contained in the

JEK records that we need to protect are:

- Identities of agents and CIA officers who retired under

cover.

- The Agency's relationships with liaison services, and

information received from foreign governments.

-- A specific example in this category is the' Agency's

current request to the Board to protect the liaison

(relationship with

documents received from

and to withhold

- Need to protect non-official cover.

-- The Board is planning at its 15-16 October meeting

to review documents that identify (companies that

provided (commercial cover. We are arranging to have

the DO brief the Board on the potential, damage to the

non-official cover program and (companies' involved if

such cover is compromised.

DAVID G. MARWELL

Biographical Information

On July 1, 1994, the Berlin Document Center (BDC) was transferred 10 the German

Federal Archives (Bundesarchiv) marking the end of nearly 4S years of American control

of this unique organization. With an esimated 25 million Nazi-cra personnel related files.

the BDC was once a crucial source.of evidence for the Nuremberg Trials and is today an

incalculably important source for the study of the Third Reich. The transfer also marked

the end of David Marwell's cnure as Director of the BDC.

A well-trained scholar with a PH.D. in History, Manwell came 1 Berlin in 1988 from

the Office of Special Investigations (OSI), U.S. Department of Justice where he held the

position of Chief »f Investigative Research. Al OSI, he was involved in researching and

preparing cases against accused Nazi war criminals residing in the United States. In

addition, he was selected to participate in the Klaus Barbie Investigation (1983) and played

a major role in the Josef Mengele investigation (1985), both of which received

international attention.

In connection with the Joseph Mengele and Klaus Barbie investigations, Marwell was

in charge of assembling all relevant documentary evidence relating lo any possible

connection between these individuals and U.S. institutions or personnel.. The

investigations were to of the most unusual ever undertaken and through them he gained

significant experiences in the identifying and locating documentary respurees. The former

Director of OSI, Allan A. Ryan, Jr., in his book Quiet Neighbors: Prosecuting Nazi War

Criminals in America, described Marwell as "an experienced and careful historian who

could find documents in archives when no one else could."

When Marwell arrived at the Document Center, the instrumon had been rocked by i

scandal involving a significam theft of documents. The resulting focus on the Center

revealed that it had been neglected in many areas for many years and suffered from an

outmoded administrative structure, a disaffected and undertrained staff and a lack of

professional guidance. It was Manwell's job to bring the Center up to standard and prepare

il for tumover 10 the German goveminent. •

The challenges facing Marwell were not only to manage a complex insulution (with

an annual budger of cight million deutschmarks) and repair past deficiencies, but also 1o

defune a future for an institution in transition. He prepared a "five year plan" for the BDC

that ser five, goals, developed a corresponding program to meet each goal. and designed a

system to monitor the progress. In achieving all of the goals. Marwell

Introduced computer technology (there was not a single computer at the

BDC when he arrived) and developed a sophisticated, integrated infonmation

retrieval system that has been described as a model for archive

administration;

• Created a fully professional document conservation and restoration program:

• Develoded a staff 150 Game and on, a...
