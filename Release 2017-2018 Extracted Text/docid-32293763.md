the FBI any pertinent information and that MATTHEWS should

leave OWENS alone. CI further advised that DAVIS'

employee, GARLAND POLLARD, has svailable the latest

changes in the "line" shortly after 10:00 &.w. each

Friday and Saturday morning.

CI also advised that DaVIS

and pOLLArD continue to have available the "big line"

which contains a point spread on practically every game

scheduled between major colleges while the other line

available in dallas

is limited

to about half the number

games being played.

CI advised that MATTHEWS (DL 166-10%) 8nd

JOSEPH "SOFIE" GEBRON are presently operating as bookmakers

in the Dallas area, but CI has been unable to obtain their

phone number unless it is the number where MATTHEWS is

presently residing in Irving, Texas, with prostitute

DONNA SUE HELTON.

Re NORVELL YOUNG STANFIELD, 8k&. (DL 165-153),

CI advised that STANFIELD And his boss, GEORGE FREDERICK

RECHENBERG continue to have their bookmaking operation

located in the Dorchester House Apartments.

(This was

verified through daily observation by Bureau Agents of

STANFIELD's car parked at this apartment house during the

past week.) CI also advised that on 11/11/63 RECHENBERG

closely questioned CI concerning possible "leaks" of

information concerning RECHENBERG's operations.

RECHENBERG

was seeking CI's assistance to ascertain who was talking

to the FBI about RECHENBERG, and RECHENBERG did suspect

CI.

RECHENBERG is convinced someone is talking as the

FBI seems to know whenever RECHENBERG moves or sets up

a new place of operation.

RECHENBERG seemed to be extremely

worried.
