Re Los Angeles report dated 8/30/68 by SA RICHARD

F. KILCOURSE.

Enclosed for the Bureau are five copies of a

Letterhead Memorandum (LHM) captioned as above.

The enclosed LHM is classified confidential as

it reflects an Investigative Interest in Soviet Nationals

who are official representatives of the Soviet Union in the

United States,

the unauthorized disclosure of which could

be prejudicial

to the best interest of the United States

The source used in the LHM as LA T-I, 1s

LA 4178-S, who furnished information to SE EARL F. DUDLEY.

The records of the Mayflower Hotel,: 535 South

Grand, Los Angeles, California, were made available to

SA CHARLES J. NAGLE, JR. by Mr. RHODES, Resident Manager.

No interview of JOHN HOWARD LAWSON is being

contemplated at the Los Angeles Office at this time

because of his status as an active Communist Party member

as recently as June 1955, and because of his employment

as a writer and lecturer, which has potential for

embarrassment to the Bureau.

LAWSON was identified by the

fisur agents fron

SI photograph.
