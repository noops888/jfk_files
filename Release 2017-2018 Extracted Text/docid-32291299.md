that which pertains to the gambling casino, mentioned above,

will be cleared at this office.

MM 806-C* reported that the total play in bolita

action has decreased approximately 15% since recent increased

interest by law enforcement agencies in the Miami area.

MM 606-C advised that due to the increased interest

on the part of law enforcement and in an effort to keep the

law enforcement agencies from locating their counting houses,

HYMAN MARTIN (MM 92-218) and his associates have hidden some

of the counting house employees on the floor of an automobile

and then drive them to some motel or apartment on a Friday

night.

He was told that once they enter the motel room of

apartment they do not emerge from same until they have finished

their counting duties.

He said only the employees who are

trusted are used by MARTIN and his associates for this type

of operation.

This source also advised that RO!

reportedly

a "bag man"

, now collects payoff money for the Homestead area

and South Miami.

MM 822-C reported that word has been circulated

around the Fontainebleau Hotel that anyone who plays cards -

with MAX EDER's (MM 92-467) group in the card room of the

hotel will lose, as the games are dishonest.
