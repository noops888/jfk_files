subject, to explore its potential for cover support. At 10:30

B.I., on 14 Narch 1963, Mr. Hackenhut, Mir. Wes Reynolds, and I

met at Mr. Reynold'& home, 3809 37th Street, Morth, Arlington.

4. Mr. Wackenhut wants to expand abroad, In view of bis

successful venture into Puerto Rico. However, he has no definite

plans as of the present and seemed to be seeking [

Jfor entry Into areas of interest to us. He 1s pre-

pared to furnish persounel himself

5. It is not epparent to me that there is any significant

market for Wackenhut's services in foreign countries, except

possibly among Anerican businesses with physical plants overseas.

The nature of these services, I vould presume, would make rather

difficult acquisition of the necessary occupational permite 1n

many countries.. The potential for clandestine Intelligence acti

vities would be too obvious to host governments, and the emphasts

on Iorner i'll personnel probably would enhance such suspicions,

particulerly 1n Latin Anerica where 'FBI" means "intelliyence"

since 1ts W II activities there.

6. CCS/IC on occasion receives requests for advice to busi-

ness organizations as to setting up security systens at overseas

Installations.

We recently referred & request of this type,

involving a major oil company, to the thyaical Security element of

the Security Office.

Concelvably, the Agency might make some

errangement to advise wacrenhut of such requests, providing our own

Security Office 1s satisfied es to Wackenhut's competence. We 2

could then

should his compery successfully

secure the contract.

T. Wackenhut said he would be willing to dispatch teams to

set up personal security systems for foreign chiefs of state

whom the Agency wants protected. He 15 amenable, in fact, to any

reasonable application of his capabilities to Agency problems.

He would be willing to negotiate financing in equitable propor

tIons In the event an overt operation, set up at Agency behest,

were not financially self-susteining.

8. Hackenhut impressed me as & clean-out, energetic, ambitlous

young business man to ts obviously proud of what appears to be

a superior organization of Its type. He 18 Interestlin profits,

but 1t 15 my Impression he 1s sincerely eager to do what he can to

assist the government and feels that CIA offers one possible oppor

_tunity. Incidentally, he appears somewhat younger in person then

1n the pictures appearing in the promotional material given the

writer.

9. Copies of this memorandum are being furnished those Agency

componerts which might have an Interest in utilizing subject com

pany. Inquiries may be directed to the vriter.
