Bill - Per Alice Bashaw through check of Mexi Desk

cards, ALVARADO is

Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte

201-740221

Our Nic Desk records indicate he was an informant for

ERYTHROID-3, official liaison contact in Nic at time

under review. E-3's name is not JEREZ, and we. have

no

info to indicate there has ex ever been a Nic asset

or

liaison contact named JEREZ.

Mr. R. B. HOIMES, CI/EXO,

has ALVARADO's 201 on temporary charge.

I talked to

him by phone and he said he has read A's file and would

agree he was not our asset. It would appear JEREZ

might have been a Nic security official or embassy

official, but this is sheer conjecture on my part.
