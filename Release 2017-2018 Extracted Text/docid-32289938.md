ever owning any Webcor-Dormeyer stock.

He said he is not

acquainted with MARIANNE RYAN and did not know she was a

former wife of ALEX. HAFFA stated that a check of the

current stockholders of Webcor Corporation disclosed that

ALEX had no stock in the corporation in his name.

VIII. MISCELLANEOUS

CG T-29 advised that he had received information

that ALEX plans again this year to travel and vacation in

Europe, as he has for the past two years.

Informant said

that ALEX may also buy a Mercedes Benz while in Germany,

and use this to travel in Europe.

Informant said that

ALEX may also attempt to bring this Mercedes Benz back to

the United States with him after he completes his vacation.

CG T-32 advised that he had received information during

the early part of October, 1962, that ALEX also complained

that he may possibly lose his auto license because of

improper registration. It is to be noted that during

early part of October, 1962, approximately ten Chicago

hoodlums had their auto licenses revoked because of improper

registrations, and for this reason ALEX was probably con-

cerned over the possible revocation of his license.

The West Germany Federal Criminal Police advised

that the Munich, Germany Criminal Police had attempted to

interview HELMUT MaIeR,

ex-husband of SUZANNE FUEGER, in

effort to obtain from him any information he may have

regarding the activities of ALEX.

The Munich, Germany

Police advised that MAIER's employer was contemplating on

establishing MAIER as his export agent in New York City

toward the latter part of 1962, or the early part of 1963,

and that MAIER could possibly be contacted regarding ALEX

at that time.

During a surveillance of ALEX by agents of this

office in the early part of September, 1962, ALEX indicated

to a passing motorist that they knew each other. It was

determined from the registration of the motorist to whom

ALEX waved to that this person was MILES FLEISHMAN. FLEISHMAN
