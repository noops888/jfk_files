regarding Outfit (LNC) matters in the Detroit area.

On 3/14/67, MI 623-C-TE, who is described as

Informant is not personally acquainted with any

members of the Detroit LCN family.

However, he stated

he, the informant, knew the boss there, name not recalled

at the present time.

Informant also advised that he has

heard of the surname TOCCO of the Detroit family. He

last in the New Orleans, Louisiana area before he was

MI 92-262

Informant does not know JOE ZERILLI (alleged

boss of the Detroit family).

From the above, and as indicated by the informant,

he is in no position to know if any new members have been

taken into the Detroit LCN family since 1946-1947.

Regarding the possibility of sons of LCN members

inheriting "the right to become members" of the LCN, in-

formant stated that to the best of his knowledge, this

nas not been done and is not done. Informant pointed out

that among many, and probably the

majority of present LCN

members known to him,

these members purposely avoid having

their sons become involved in the LCN and related illegitimate

or criminal activities.

In this regard, informant pointed

out that many long-time LCN members in view of developments

in recent years feel that they have been "stuck" with their

membership, and it is difficult and sometimes impossible

to break away from the organization and friends who are

members.

Such disilussioned members, in effect, fear the

stigma of their association with the LCN.

Informant said that as far as he knows, he feels

quite certain that sons of members would have to prove

themselves and go through the initial procedures. Informant

said that it would not be necessary for such prospective

members

to prove themselves by fulfilling a contract to

make a "hit" on anyone.

The statement among LCN members that "He was

made", means that the individual was initiated into the

LCN.

The statement, "He is his father's son", in LCN

Jargon possibly means that a son takes after his father.

However, this does not mean that the son is a member of

the LCN, because of his father's membership. â€¢

For the confidential information of Detroit,

MI 623-C-TE is a long-time member of the Milwaukee LCN

family.

Any reporting or utilizing of the above information

from this informant should be paraphrased and should not

indicate in any way

that this information came from the

Milwaukee area. To do so could compromise the informant

and jeopardize his personal well being.
