GABRIEL MANVARINO, aka.

AR

SAMUEL NANNARINO, aka.

on 6/15/61 PG 612-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

The area of Monroeville, Pa., along U. S. Route 22, 1s now

commonly referred to by

and from other sections of Western Pennsylvania as "The

gamblers from New Kensington, Pastrip."

The reason for this is that much of the highway commerce is made

up of nightclubs and cocktail lounges, usually operated in

connection with a motel. These places have become

hangouts and

ostensibly casual meeting places

for racket figures, large and

small, and the MANNARINO underlings and associates are frequenting

these

the Phoenix Motel.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
