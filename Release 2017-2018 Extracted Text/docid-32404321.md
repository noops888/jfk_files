This memorandum is in response to the request from

the staff of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) .

The

staff requested that the CIA issue an Agency-wide

employee bulletin for a new search for JFK Assassination

Records. OIM-98-0081 dated 30 July 1998 was issued.

2. DO/Information Management Staff ran a corporate

search of COMET, the DO's electronic message. repository.

That search generated some 128 hits. Michelle Combs of the

ARRB staff reviewed the search results and selected three

records for inclusion in the JEK assassination records

collection:

3. The three selected documents have been sanitized

with Ms. Combs'

concurrence. The sanitization is more

extensive than ÃœFK guidelines because of the documents'

proximity' to the present and to current sources and methods.

4. The documents are not herewith attached. They are

being provided separately by DO/IMS/ESG/HCS.
