was put in charge of the task force on Track II.

Senator Schweiker. Has he really resigned?

Mr. Schwarz.

He is doing that. I don't know.

A man called Wimpert who was in the Army and became in

effect one of the AGency's principal agents in Chile -- they

referred to him as Co-op 2.

Karamessines, who was either the head of the Deputy

Director for Plans or very high up in the operation section,

and who really was the principal Washington action officer on

it.

And then Mr. Kissinger, running in a schedule that would

get that whole group done by the fifth, and we can have Mr.

Kissinger in on the fifth.

Haig, a possibility, not as clear. And Haig and

General Bennett from DIA, and the head of the Joint Chiefs

of

Staff, people who may be involved, and in the case of

General Bennett and the case of the head of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff, they think we ought to depose them, and we may

get a small piece of information.

In the case of Cuba there is one Agency person that I

think we need for short testimony on the Cubella or AMLASH pe

period. He is a man named Nesto Anchest a Spanish-speaking

agent, a mani who met with AMLASH in Paris at the end of

October and on November 22, 1963.

We have Mr. Maheu down for Tuesday morning.
