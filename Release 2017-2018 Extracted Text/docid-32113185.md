SAC, DALLAS (134-)A-801A)

SA W. HARLAN BROWN

12/9/69

On 12/4/63, SA W. HARLAN BROWN reCeived, in person,

typewritten report,

dated 11/26/63, from DLob-S.

This report

has been serialized as 134-1A-801.

Infornant determined that JOE LANDIN and AUGUSTIN

ESTRADA had lunch together on 11/26/63.

LANDIN told him that

ALBERT GONZALEZ had called him.

GONZALEZ is an ambitious, hard.

driving opportunity.

Both ESTRADA and LANDIN are familiar with

his promotions.

CONZALEZ wanted to know what LANDIN thought of

the fact that JOE MOLINA, ex-GI Forun member chairman, had been

questioned in regards to LIE OSVALD on the President's death.

GONZALEZ recallod how conservative MOLINA is yet he was questioned.

II JOE MOLINA had been questioned, CONZALEZ said, what could he.

and LANDIN expect since they were really outspoken (when they

attended forum meetings). GONZALEZ thought that BILl LOWERY had

given MOLINA'S

name to the FBI together with all of the forum

members' names.

He said he was going to Washington to see 11 he

was on the subversive list. He was pretty sure that he could not

get that information there.

LANDIN recalled that GONZALEZ knew

RUBY and that sometine ago (4 years ago) he (ALBERT GONZALEZ)

had told LANDIN that RUSY was an ex-labor organizer and was

"no good."

GONZALEZ said he did know RUBY and had recentlyispoken

to Mrs. GRANT, his sister at the Vegas Club.

He is interested

in buying the club.

Informant determined that ESTRADA warned LANDIN not to

give too much of his time to hin for he is known to twist things

around and could be a dangerous character.

He could be working

for someone at that very moment, that 1s, as an informer.

all, he hadn't visited LANDIN in almost 3

years..
