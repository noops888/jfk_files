MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

TO: Chief, SR/CI/R

1. Among the exhibits of DBA-82198, dated 2 October 1964, Subject:

Lee Harvey, OSWALD, was a photograph of an individual purported to be

Anatol (1y) KHOLODOY.

KHOLODOV appears in the photograph together

with Eleonora ZIGER

A check of agency files on 18 December 1964 revealed no

Identifiable information on KHOLODOV. Howevet, the individual

appears to be identical to the Anatoliy (LNU), identified by

Marina OSWALD, in an interview with the FBI on 31 January 1964,

as a friend of OSWALD's unknown to her. (See Anatoliy (LNU) in

Personality Appendix in SR/CI/R OSWALD material.)
