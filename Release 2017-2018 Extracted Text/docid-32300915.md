CG 92-399

estate business due to the recent death of his partner-

brother.

In addition, it appears he has some reserva-

tions about testifying against ROSELLI, possibly due

to the information set out in mytel that former CG

6498-C-TE advised his family is close to the PETRONE

family. However, following his conversation with

NISSON, EVANGELISTA realizes his only option is

to

travel

to Los Angeles and testify and this he will do

reluctantly.

AUSA NISSON should be cautioned, however,

that EVANGELISTA may not be a strong witness.

The problem presented by WELSH to NISSON

involving

the physical hardship involved in carrying

two hundred pounds or so of records with him to Los

Angeles.

This was resolved by NISSON's approval of

WELSH'S

suggestion that these records be shipped

ahead which WELSH will do this date.

Both ANTHON and DEEVER suggested that they

telephonically contact NISSON to determine whether

they can submit certified copies of their records

rather than travel to Los Angeles. This was not

done in the presence of SA ROEMER

but will probably

be done this date. Both were advised that should

NISSON approve this method, they should contact the

Chicago Office which will

insure that the certified

copies or depositions, as

the case may be, are

forwarded to the Los

Angeles Office prior

April 2 next.
