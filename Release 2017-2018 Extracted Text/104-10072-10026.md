MEMORARDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: "American Defectors to the USSRI

I, The atlached material was part of a soft file entitled

"American Defectors to the USSK", which was set up by SR/6

(Support) around 1950 and maintained by various SR composents

until ca, 1903. Ino compulations were derived fror a varicty

of sourcos, and contain both classifica and overt data.

2, In the fall uf 1966, the files were turned over to CI

Staff.

in most lnstances, basic information was then abstracted

for the US Defoctor Machine Program.

In all instances in which

the materini was unique, or represented a valuable collation effort,

it has been incorporated into the appropriate 201 file, along with

a copy of this memorandum,

3. lt is suggested that any dissemination of this data should

be coordinated with SB Division and with CI Staff (CI/MRO), in

view of the frequently inadequate sourcing and of the fact that

dissemications have alroady been made through the US Defecior

Machine Program.
