NOTE:

Classified "Secret" because coverage of diplomatic establish-

ments by Bureau is so classified. CIA is engaging in speculation.

Reference letter apparently suggests a theorynthat because Nicolas

Damascus, who reportedly lived at one of the hotels visited by

Mitchell

and Martin in Mexico City, had an apparent client relation-

ship with the law

received a phone call from a representative of the 26th of July

movement, there

might be some answer here as to the defection of

Mitchell and Martin. The logic of all this is not too apparent
