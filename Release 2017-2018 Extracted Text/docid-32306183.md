By letter dated January 19, 1961, the Bureau

informed that CIA, by liaison, had informed the Bureau

on January 6, 1961 that subject was in no way connected

with CIA.

Reference is made to Bureau airtel dated

January 16, 1961 to Seattle and Miami, pointing out that

the Department was requested by letter dated December 16,

1960 to advise whether a thorough investigation were

warranted and desired by the Department. It is noted

that the Bureau pointed out, among other things, that

no additional investigation concerning this matter should

be conducted until an opinion is received from the Depart-

ment. Miami, therefore, is conducting no active investi-

gation concerning subject, but is reporting the information

which has come to its attention through established informants

and sources.

Complete information concerning the theft of the

tugboat "Gil Rokie," from Miami on February 4, 1961 by

some of subject's associates, was reported to the Bureau in

report of SA JAMES D. HAYES at Miami, dated February 20,

1961 in case captioned: "KENNETH JOSEPH PROCTOR, et al,

Neutrality Matter." Certain portions have been extracted

from that report and appear in details of this report.

Information copies of this report are being

forwarded the Norfolk Office and WFO, inasmuch as they

may be called upon at some future time to conduct

additional investigation relative to subject's activities.

Careful consideration has been given to each

source concealed in this report, and they were concealed

only in those instances where identities must be concealed.

ADMINISTRATIVE ADDENDUM

This report is being classified "CONFIDENTIAL,"

since data reported from MM I-1, who is MM 639-S, could

reasonably result in identification of a confidential

informant of continuing value and compromise future effective-

ness thereof
