On September 25, 1959, Jaife, who is a good friend of the

Bureau and who did two radio shows on the New York Office, came by and talked

with Kemper:

14)

Jaite has been on the Khrushchev trip, and he said it was the most

hectic thing he has ever had to do in his life. He said there was no question about

Khrushchev's anger in Los Angeles and that one of the aides told him, "Don't be

surprised if the old man doefn't suddenly get up and go home." He said the

I security of Khrushchev was badly handled and that Roswell Garst, Coon Rapids,

Ilowa, the millionaire farmer, is no more than a publicity seeker and is a real

"corn ball."

He said one amusing thing happened in San Francisco. At about

7:15 in the morning Khrushchev decided to take a walk and, apparently, caught his

bodyguards flatfooted. He headed down the street with the guards streaming out

the doors behind him, some of them buttoning their clothes as they ran.

Jaife is trying to get back to Russia (CBS lost their correspondents

after the televicion show that was critical of Stalin, et al.) and he has been working

with people at the embassy to try and get back. He said that he wanted to go back

and have a television interview with Khrushchev on his reaction to his trip and thai

he had been in touch with Viktor Osipov, who is a second secretary in the embassy

and attached to the Cultural Section. He said that at the reception at the embassy

on Thursday night, Osipov told him to submit his list of questions anc he would see

what they could de about getting him to Moscow to interview Khrushchev.

Jalfe said that he felt that the over-all trip by Khrushchev would be

beneficial, particularly in case of a hot war because Khrushchev, having seen the

country and the people, inay hesitate before "pushing the outton."

This morning Kemper took a call from Mr. Sam Jaffe,

CBS News--Television, New York, Plaza 1-2345, Extension 7801.

He wanted to know if it would be possible to interview the Director

in connection with the current juvenile delinquency problem in

New York City. Kemper told Jaffe that the Director had a firm

policy in not injecting himself into local matters; and accordingly,

the Director could not comply with this request:

lu!

Jaife then wanted to know if it would be possible to

interview SAC Foster on the problem of juvenile delinquency, but

that this interview would be general in nature and would not refer

to the specific New York problem, but wouid cover the broad

national picture.

Kemper advised Jaffe that again it would be injecting

the FBI into the local situation, and we did not deem this advisable.

Jaffe agreed. Kemper called SAC Foster and alerted him to Jaffe's

call and explained to him the reasons. Foster said that he would be

alert to keeping out of the situation as it developed in New York.

Informant's wife was briefly acquainted with the

Bureau's interest in the soviets as this interest stems

from the Bureau's jurisdiction in matters involving the

internal security of the US.

At the same time her attention

was called to recent publicity appearing in the "NY Herald.

She

was also told that the Bureau wanted to be sure that its

interest in the soviets in no way interfered with the United

the article concern'ng the FBI in the October 18, 1958

issue of "The Nation"

a mass of untrue information.

However, the informant said that he wasinot

have had for writing the article. The informant did

express the opinion that cook must have thought that

an

article suäh as this would benefit him financially

is indicative of the thinking of CAREY Ma WILLIAMS,

GAMBER on 2/12/59. (JAFFE's identity should be

protected. As usual, JAFFE was most pleasant and

' comperative.

During the interview, JAFFE was casually asked

If he had read the article about the FBI in the 10/18/58

issue of "The Nation."

The introduction of this topic

into the interview was very casual and the exact date of

the issue in which the article appeared was not actually

mentioned. JAFFE said that he did not read this article

nor had he heard about the article.

Interviewing Agents then

told JAFFE that the article was written in an apparent effort

to "smear" the Bureau.

The Agents commented that the Bureau

always welcomes constructive criticism and upon receipt of

same, has always taken expeditious stops to make any

warranted changes in its operations.

However,

the article

appearing in

"The Nation"

contained

no constructive criticism

and in fact, the criticism contained therein was based

untruths, erroneous conclusions, and biased innuendoes.

JAFFE said that he would like very much to read

this article and asked who the author was.

When the

name of FRED J. COOK was mentioned, it meant nothing to JAFFE,

but when JAFFE was told that CoOk wrote for the "New York

World Telegram and Sun," he expressed amazement.

Interviewing

Agents expressed idle. interest in knowing whatever provoked

the writing and publication of such an article and this

evoked from JAFFE the comment that CAREY MC WILLIAMS,

Inquiry concerning "The Nation" was made during an

interview with JAFFE which encompassed some casual

conversation, as well'as inquiry concerning his. association

with Soviet nationals.

JAFFE's reaction to the casual

inquiry about "The Nation" was such that no possible

embarrassment to the Bureau can result.

He is most

cooperative and anxious to assist the Bureau.

The Bureau will be kept

advised.

SUBJECT: SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aka.

ReNYLet, 11/4/587

JAFFE was initially interviewed on 9/12/50, and

subsequent to that time he was interviewed on 11/6, 12/12,4,

10,31/58 and 1/9/59. During these interviews he has

been most cooperative, and has furnished information

concerning numerous Soviet and Satellite nationals with

whom he is acquainted. His acquaintance with these people

stems from his employment as a news reporter with the

Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), in which capacity

he feels that he needs news sources in Soviet and Satellite

circles.

Included among his acquaintances are the

following Soviet rationals:

NIKOLAI S. KALININ, known Soviet intelligence

(c)

agent.

VIADIMIR P. SUSIOV, known Soviet intelligence

agent.

C

VLADIMIR B. BARKOVSKY, known Soviet intelligence

agent.

JAFFE is the recipient of invitations to

social functions at the homes of Soviet nationals and

at the Soviet UN Delegation. He in turn entertains

(c)

Soviet nationals at his home.

JAFFE's acquaintance with VLADIMIR B.

BARKOVSKY is of such a nature that it might possibly

result in a double agent operation.

BARKOVSKY has

made inquiry of JAFFE concerning individuals, groups

and business firms on the West Coast of the United

conceing and of the

States who were interested in seeing trade restrictions

placed on trade with Red China eased: JAFFE furnished

some information concerning this to BARKOVSKY, and the

extene to wich BARkOusky's inquartes alone this line wIll (C.)

go are not as yet known.

BARKOVSKY also asked JAFFE

to put in writing his impressions and/ahalysis of the

•political scene in the US, and told JAFFE that he

would pay him for doing this. JAFFE refused the offer.

On 11/14/58;

• advised that during

the week prior to 11/14/58, JAFFE was sitting at a

table in

the North Delegates lounge at the UN Secretariat

in the

company of ERNESTO DE LOSSA of the Panama Delegation

to the UN and

FRANK R. BEGLEY, a US staif member at the

UN Secretariat. After leaving. JAFFE and BEGLEY,

DE LOSSA told

source that BEGLEY warned him to be

carelu oi JAFFE, beçause heras suspected of being a

Communist. This is dAfy source from which any informatior

was obtained indicating that JAFFE was suspected of

being a Communist. Investigation did reveal that JAFFE

was at one time a correspondent for "The. Nation"

Bulet 11/21/58, in instant matter, states

that in any contacts which this office has with JAFFE,

agents should be alert to any information indicating

that he:has contacts presently on the staff of "The

Nation"

with.

This letter further states that pror to bringing

this subject up with JAFFE, recommendations regarding

contact with JAFFE on this

subject should be submitted

to the Bureau upon completion of the remaining lead in

the background investigation of subject.

Bulet 12/2/58,

sets: forth information with respect to JAFFE's former

association with "The Nation"

• and

states that the

letter is not intended to create infression that. this

office should bring up the question of "The Nation"

in its discussion with him.

The WFO has not as yet advised this office

of the results of its check of CIA files for

information concerning JAFFE. Accordingly, this office

ras not submitted any recommendation regarding contact

with JAFFE concerning "The Nation". However, in/course

of contacts with JARrE he has stated that in his

employment with the CBS, he is prohibited from writing

articles for any henspaper or magazine, or doing work

for any other organization

without the express

permission of CBS.

Therefore, it does not appear that

JAFFE is presently affiliated

with "The Nation" in any

respect.

It is obvious through conversations which

interviewing agents have had with JAFFE that he has the

utmost respect for the Bureau, and is extremely

with Bureau personnel on matters related to his

position as a news reporter with CBS, and he has

utmost respect for the personnel with whom he has lad

contact.

He shows a sincere appreciation for the

confidential nature of the Bureau's work, and speaks.

of the very professional manner in which he has found

Bureau agents conducting themselves as compared to

representatives of other law enforcement agencies with

whom he is in contact.

If the Bureau so desires, this office believes

that the subject of "The Nation" could be discreetly

and tactfully brought up in the course of a conversation

with JAFFE.

This may then be discussed in a

conversational vein serving the purpose of exploring

JAFFE's present knowledge of the staff of "The Nation"

This subject will not be brought up with JAFFE in

the absence of Bureau permission.

Every opportunity has been taken to acquaint.

JAFFE with the fact that his relationship with the

portat tas

Bureau must be held in strictest confidence at all

times. JAFFE has made known the fact on repeated

occasions that information which he furnishes to the

Bureau must be handled in strictest confidence, since if

it became known that he were furnishing information to

the Bureau, his position as a news reporter would be

jeopardized: JAFFE has been told to use the facilities

of a public pay station when telephonically contacing

this office, and that he should not have any personal

contact at the NYO. However, these latter instructions

were qualified to the extent that if in his position

as a news reporter it is necessary for him to contact

this office concerning matters other than those on

which he is furnishing information to this office, he

must of course feel free to do so. JAFFE has been

told

he is not to consider himself to be an employee of the

Bureau and that his cooperation with the Bureau is to

be on a voluntary basis at all times. The Bureau's

Labor policy was

explained to JAFFE inasmuch as he

is a member of a labor union.

JAFFE has been told that; under no circumstances

would the fact that he is cooperating with the Bureau

in furnishing information to the Bureau, place him

in the position of

receiving preferential treatment

NW 55312 DocId: 32989704 Page 43

---

## Page 44

• NY 134-3315

when news releases were made by the Bureau.

He was

advised that an inquiry which he might make through

this office in connection with his employment should

be made through normal channels, and not through

agents to whom he is furnishing information. JAFFE

fully understands that he is not to be the

recipient

of any personal consideration in matters of public

interest being investigated by the Bureau.

Further-

more, he fully understands the necessity for this,

at no time has indicated that he expected to

recipient of any personal favors.

Inasmuch as JAFFE is being contacted on a.

rather regular basis, and has been found to be most

cooperative, this office desires to take steps to

develop him as a Ps!, It is noted that some steps

along this line have already been taken in order to

capitalize on existing situations, as well as JAFFE's

very favorable attitude concerning these situations.

Bureau permission is requested for this

office to develop JAFFE aS

Francisco community, and he would suggest, if possible,

Mikoyan speak before this club, as well as the

San Francisco Press Club.

Informant also took the opportunity

to tell subject that in a recent conversation with his

Identity of business concerns on the west coast of the

The informant told subject that his father

furnished him the names of several individuals who have

spoken in favor of trade with Red China.

Most of the conversation at Informant's

home on the evening of December 31, 1958, was of a

social nature, however, subject showed a definite

Interest In the Information which informant gave to him

about business concerns interested In trade with Red

China, and accordingly, Informant arranged to have

lunch

with subject on January 5, 1.959.

On January 5, 1959, Informant did have

lunch with subject, and subject again brought up the

matter of Mikoyan's visit to San Frandsco, and

asked informant ior sone background Information

on the clubs which he mentioned. Informant told subject

that he conversed with his father on the telephone,

over the weekend, and his father agreed that Mikoyan

would do well to

speak before the Commonwealth Club

and the san Francisco Press Club.

Subject asked informant about the Union

League Club in San Francisco, and Informant told

him that this club merged with the San Francisco Press

club, although not all members of this club are members

of the Press.

C

He told subject that the Union League club

was one of the best clubs in San Francisco, and that it and

whe commonwealth clue have as members all of the influential (

people in San Francisco.

subject told informant that he

would pass this information to the soviet Embassy in

Washington, D.C., but that for the most part:, the

Sovlets were relying on Eric Johnston, President of the

Motion Picture Association of America, when arranging

Mikoyan's activities.

subject told Informant that the soviets

still owned property in San Francisco, which he belleved

-2÷

to include a building.

It was the subject's opinion

that somebody from Washington, D.C. would accompany

aakoyan for the purpose of inspecting this property,

Inasmuch as the soviets did not get an opportunity to visit

San Francisco too often. Subject mentioned to informant

that he traveled through San Francisco on his way

from Japan to russia during World War II.

During lunch, subject asked informant

about the information he had

obtained concerning

business

concerns on the WestCoast of the United States

desirous of doing business with Red China.

Informant verbally repeated what he had

told the subject on the evening of December 31, 1958,

men Joanne a tate were over too organisations in the C

San Francisco area who favored trade with China. At

subject's request, Informant wrote on a piece of paper, the

names of individuals who have spoken in favor of trade

with Red China.

The names which he wrote on the paper were

those of James P. Wilson, Manager of the World Trade Department

of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce; George E. Talmage,

Vice President of Pacific Transport Line

and States

U

Leines; John S. Bolles, Head of the Chamber of Commerce's

In addition, informant told subject

that "The Dispatcher", official organ of the International

Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union endorsed a

policy favorable do trade with Red China.

made no further request of iniormant for information

concerning business concerns desirous of doing business

During lunch, subject also asked informant

what the reaction in the United States has been to the

visit of Mikoyan. Informant told subject that It 1s too

early to tell, as we do not even know why Mikoyan is here.

He told subject that there was too much of a mystery

surrounding Mikoyan's visit and subject then asked informant

if there was not any reaction at all.

Informant told

Barkovsky that there was none of which he was aware.

The records of the United States Department

of State reflect that Vladimir Borisovich Barkovsky,

a Soviet National, 1s Counselor to the Soviet Mission to

as representätive of news-gathering media since 1951. He desired

üo travel to Red China and Soviet Russia as representative of

"Life" and "Time" magazines in 1954. He contacted representatives of lone

Soviet Embassy on this occasion and a representative of "Time"and "Life"

indicated Jaffe had thought that he had been surveilled by the FBI.

2923-55, Jaffe corresponded with the state Department on the letterhead

of "The Nation" concerning proposed travel. On 9a5-55 Jafje indicated

to a confidential source that he was permanent correspondent of "The

Nation" on the Hest Coast. On 1-3-56 Jaffe was interviewed by Bureou

Agents at his request and furnished information concerning his efforts

to travel to Chino and Russia. There is no indication that Jaffe madel

this trip as the result of his contacts with the soviets at that time.

On 10-30-57 Jaffe and a CBS camera crew made a feature film in

our New York Office which was telecast in two parts' over certain CBS

affiliate stations on 11-13 and 14-57.

Jaffe was in charge of making this

Jaffe was interviewed 9-12-58 and was extremely cooperative.

He talked at length concerning his association and knowledge of five

soviets, two of whom are knoun intelligence agents and one considered o

potential defector.

Jaffe advised that his uncle, an actor, samuel Charles

Jaffe, was active oo behalf if Russian war relief and sympathized with

Memorandum for Mr. Belmont

RE:

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE, aKO.

105-28333

Background investigation of Jafje was instituted as a result of

his interview on 9-12-58. No derogatory information has been developed

and it appears that all of his contacts with the soviets have been as the

result of his news gathering assignments. The New fork Office, "mere of

the additional significance of Jaffe's former association with

Nation," since publishing the article entitled he FBI," in the 10-18-58

issue of this publication, has requested Bureau authority to maintain

contact with Jaffe pending coverage of one remaining lead invoiving

review of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) records in order to receive

information concerning the soviets with whom he is in contact and as a

follow up of our ga12-58 interview.

(C)

OBSERVAT IONS :

It is believed that we should allow New York to continue

contacts with Jaffe and and it is possible that this contact, if properly

handled, may develop a source of information of significance concerning

Soviet officials in New York as well as providing a possible source of

information concerning the article and general policy of "The Nation"

through such contacts as Jaffe may still have on the staff of that

publication.

(a)

RECOMMENDATION:

If you approve, there is attached a letter to New York

authorizing continued contacts with Jafje concerning information of

interest to us concerning soviet officials and instructing New York io

be alert in their contacts with Jaffe to develop any opportunity that

might arise toward obtaining information concerning the general policy,

and personalities that Jaffe may have knowledge of who are presently

/C

connected with "The Nation."

JAFFE talked quite freely and at length about

his association with Soviet Nationals.

He said that in

his capacity as a news reporter for the Columbia Broadcasting

System, it was necessary for him to have as many contacts

as possible in order to keep abreast of newsworthy incidents

and information.

in cultivating the Soviets and other foreigners at the UN

as news sources. He first met VADIM A. BOGOSLOVSKI and

NIKOLAI KALININ at a press; party at the soviet Mission to

the UN.

He has gotten to know these soviets very well,

and in fact he has visited their homes and they have

visited his home.

He said that he sees these two Soviets

very frequently and is particularly close to BOGOSLOVSKI,

whom he describes as being very much unlike other soviets.

JAFFE said that BOGOSLOVSKI is very outspoken and in fact

JAFFE met KRESTYANOV on one occasion at a party

at KALININ's home.

During interview JAFFE said that he would be

willing to furnish information to the Bureau concerning

his contacts with the soviets.

However, he said that he

would have to be sure that his identity would be protected

at all times.

He said he did not want to become another

BORIS MORROS or HERBERT PHILBRICK as it would ruin his career

as a news reporter if he did so.

He was told, that the Bureau

would respect his confidence, but that he in turn would

have to respect the Bureau's confidence at all times.

JAFFE mentioned that at one time

Afro-American News Reporter, mentioned that the State

Department had asked him if

he possessed any information

'indicating that JAFFE was a Communist. JAFFE mentioned

this by way of inquiry of interviewing agents to ascertain

if they knew of any such allegation. Interviewing agents

then asked JAFFE if he had ever been a member of the CP,

and he said that he had not been a member of the CP or any

Communist inspired organization nor has he ever sympathized

with the CP.

He said that his uncle, with whom he has a

close association, is the actor SAMUEL CHARLES JAFFE WhO

was active on behalf of Russian War Relief and sympathized

with what proved to be Communist inspired organizations.

JAFFE said that he does not believe that his uncle was

a member of the CP however, and that his uncle did testify

before the House Committee

on Un-American Activities.

On 3/5/57, Special Agents of the FBI observed

the activities of a certain individual in the offices

of the Ceylon Delegation where the afore-mentioned code

was known to be kept, and subsequently observed this

individual with GRUSHA.

Approximately one hour later,

alter this individual had again been observed with

GRUSHA, he was observed returing a red covered book

to the offices of the Ceylon Delegation.

(e)

A review of the new York orfice indices

reflects numerous references to the name SAMUEL JAFFE;

however, based on the information from us,

would appear that the subject is identical with the

JarrE named by fath.

This identification is based

upon the following facts obtained from the previous

investigation of the subject.

According to

JAFFE, on numerous

occasions during 1955 and 1956, had been in contact

with individuals at the Soviet Embassy in Washington,

D.C. In regard to visa matters pertaining to his contemplated

travel to the USSR.

In April, 1954, according to

JAFFE was in contact with the Soviet United Nations

Delegation in New York City.

At this time, it was

determined that he was employed as a culture researcher

for "Lite" Magazine in New York City, and had contacted

the Soviet United Nations Delegation in connection

with some work he was doing on a story for this

magazine.

subsequently,

it was determined from

Inquiry at the offices of "Life" Magazine, that

JAFFE was born on 6/19/28.

Passport records of the Department of State,

reviewed on 1/21/55, (as set forth in WFO letter of 8/25/55)s

reflect that JAliE,

in a supplemental statement dated

6/22/55 in connection with his passport, indicated

that he wished to have his passport amended to allow

him to travel in Communist China as a professional

American journalist. It was indicated

furthes, that

he had excellent reason to believe that the Red Chinese

Government would allow him to enter their country as

a journalist in view of the fact that during the

Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he

obtained an interview with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAI.

on 4/30/57, Mr. sis

200 East End Avenue, New York City, advised SA JOHN

F. MABEY that the subject, who is presently an employee

of the Columbia Broadcasting System in New York City,

presently resides in an apartment at this address with

his wife and small child.-

In view of the information which is set. forth

in the subject's investigative file reflecting numerous

past contacts on his part with various Soviets attached

to both the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D.C., and

the Soviet United Nations Delegation, New York CIty,

and the fact that the subject has a history of employment

in the capacity of a news correspondent, the New York

Office feels that no contact should be initiated at

this time with the subject concerning his association

wich GRUSHA. In addition, it is to be noted that

following a contact by the subject with KONSTANTING.

FEDOSEEN, CounseLor Noviet Embassys

Magazines contacted the Bureau, alleging that he believed

JAFFE had been under surveillance by the FBI.

The New York Office feels that subject's

contact of GRUSHA possibly can be logically explained

as a normal contact in view of the subject's employment,

and it is felt that an interview with JAFFE would

• possibly result in embarrassment to the Bureau should

the subject take exception to the Bureau's interest

in his activities.

Copies of this letter are being disseminated

to the Washington Fleld Office and San Francisco Office

for information in view of their past interest in the

subject.

He was issued Passport Number 36093, San Francisco series,

on 2/25/55. This passport is not valid for travel to Albania, Bulgaria,

China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania, or the USSR unless

specifically endorsed by the Department of State as being valid for

such travel.

A letter dated 2/23/55 on the letterhead of the "Nation" 68

Post Street, San Francisco, California, signed by JAift as West Coast

Correspondent addressed to the Passport Agency, Dapartment of Süate,

San Francisco, Califomia, relates that his Far Eastern trip mill be

made as a working journalist; that the trip will last approximately

three months and he will visit such countries as Japan, Burme, Pakistan,

India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Thailand.

A letter dated 2/25/55 on the above letterhead, signed by

JAFFE, as West Coast Bureau Chief, addressed to Mr. HARRY H. BOLDS,

Passport Agency, San Francisco, California, relates that as the "Nation"

magazine's West Coast Bureau Chief he is classed as a member of the

Publications Board of Editors. Thus, he is in the position of an

editorial executive. He wrote further that as he explained to BOLDS

those in authority at their home office in Nen York are on vacation.

While in the employ of Time, Incorporated, "Life" magazine, he made a

trip to Asia in an editorial capacity; that BOLDS' New York office asked

him to write a letter on "Life"stationery stating the purpose of his

trip abroad though at the time he was making the journey for some other

publications. He explained this and the fact that he was only a reporter...

This, JAFFE wrote, seemed to make no difference as long as the New fore

agency had a letter on file.

An application for amendment of Passport Number 36093, San

Francisco series, as above, dated June 22, 1955, and signed by JAFFE,

Imperial Hotel, New Delhi, India, was forwarded by the American Consular

Service at New Delhi to the Department of State, Washington, D. C., for

JAFFE asks that his passport be amended allowing him to travel

in Communist China as a professional American journalist and he understands

that he will personally assume all the risks in such an undertaking.

If this request is not within the pover of the Department of state to

approve, he desires to know if the Department of State would have any

objection if he deposited his passport with the nearest Embassy and

entered Connunist China, assuming all risks, as a private citizen.

His purpose in visiting Communist China would be in the

capacity of a professional journalist for the "Nation" magazine of

America and other American publications to write on what is taking place

In Red China today. He would also seek an interview with Red China's

Leader MAO TSE-TUNG and other Communist officials.

He would try to

interview the eleven American fliers held by the Reds and the Americans

who have deflected to the side of the Reds. He would deport himself

In the best interests of the U.S. and would provide information to

his Goverment upon his return.

He has excellent reasons to believe that the Red Chinese

goverment would allow him to enter their country as a journalist. During

the Asian-African Conference at Bandung, Indonesia, he obtained an interview

with Red Chinese Premier CHOU-EN-LAT through the good offices of Prime

Minister U NU of Burma. He filed a full report of this interview with the

American Embassy at Rangoon, Burma on 5/20/55 and previously he had

'informed the American Consul at Singapore of certain statements CHOU-EN-LAI

made to him during the interview. The Red Chinese know that Prime Minister

U NU thinks well of him.

He was also told by one KANG MAO-CHAO, Counselor for Cultural.

Affairs at the Red Chinese Embassy in New Delhi that he stood an excellent

chance of being admitted to his country, as "lly Premier was impressed by

the way your story was handled." KANG MAO-CHAO added that also in his

favor was the fact that CHOU-EN-LAI knew him as well as do others in his

government. His request for admittance to Red China is presently being

considered by the authorities at Peling. .

JAFTE concluded his statement by relating that he hopes that

in making a decision the Department will realize that it would be in the

best interests of our Government and our people thai an American journalist

be permitted to visit Red China to report firsthand on the state of

affairs there.

contact JAFFE when anything is received from Moscow.

On 1/20/54 SAM JAFFE, "Life" magazine, asked SMIRNOVSKY

whether the Embassylad heard anything from Moscow about the thing he had

spoken to him and Ambassador ZARUBIN about.

SMIRNOVSKY said they had

not. JAFFE pointed out that they wanted to do a complotely fair job

going to China.

SMIRNOVSKY was very friendly and said he would try to

see that the people in Moscow were reminded again.

On 2/5/54, SAN JAFFEY (phonetic); asked SMIRNOVSKY if he

received the letters and was told he had.

JAFFEY asked if any action

would be taken. SMIRNOVSKY replied that the Ambassador was not here to

act upon it and as a result the matter will be decided upon in koscow.

JAFFE said he heard reports and has read in the newspapers that there

are Chinese advisors in Berlin at the present time. SMIRNOVSKY replied

! that he had read this also. JAFFE expressed considerable concern about

receiving action on his proposal and then asked if SMIRNOVSKY knew of

any place in the U. S. where one could buy Russian vodka and SWIRNOVSKY

said he did not.

On 2/18/54 SAM JAFFEY (phonetic), told SMIRNOVSKY that he

planned to be in Washington next Thursday

and wondered if SMIRNOVSKY

would have lunch with him.

SVIRNOVSKY said he would and suggested that

he call him when he gets in town. JAFFEY said he is working on a story

regarding the Indian caste system; that he already has the Hindu story

laid out covering about 40 pages; that at a conference yesterday it was

decided that photos would have to be taken in China, ie, pictures of

temples but still they have not received an answer from the Peking

government. JAFFEY wondered if Ambassador ZARUBIN could be of further

help in thismatter if a wire were sent to him in Gernany. SMERNOVSKY

said it would be all right to send the wire. They agreed to discuss

this further Thursday.

On 2/26/54 SAM JAFTE, "Life," tried to reach Ambassador ZARUBIN

finally spoke instead with FEDOSEEV, with whom he went over again "Life's"

project for photographir essays of religions of the world and their

desire to get into China. FEDOSEEV promised that he and the Ambassador

would do all they could, but that they just had not heard as yet. JAFTE

emphasized that all he wants is a definite answer even if it is no.

On 3/22/54, SAM JAFFE

at, asked whether re

FEDOSEEV had heard any word from the Peoples Republic of China regarding

his request. JAFFE pointed out that the Chinese will be holding a big

Confucius ceremony in April and he would like to cover it to get material

for his story. JAFFE went into great detail explaining the importance

for covering the ceremony in China proper since it is the birth place of

Confucius. He said they would probably cover it in Korea and on Formosa.

FEDOSEEV agreed to talk the request overagain with the Ambassador and

On 4/9/54, SAN JAFFE

FEDOSEE, was told that he was out to lunch now and to call back at

2 o'clock. JAFFE said that he wanted to know something about the "Red

Starl magazine (Red Army magazine), and was told FEDOSEEV would help on

this matter.

On 4/9/54 SAM JAFFE again attempted to reach FEDOSEYV and was

told by SMIRNOVSKY that he was not in the Embassy. JAFFE said this

call did not pertain to the Chinese proposal but to a drawing published

in the end of the March issue of the "Red Starl of the "H Bomb."

SMIRNOVSKY said he had not received that issue as yet but to contact Mr.

TARASOV in the New York office and see if he has that issue. JAFFE said

he had contacted TARASOV regarding this matter and that TARASOV was

checking on it. JAFFE said he would then recontact TARASOV.

On 6/28/54 SAV JAFFE (phonetic), told FEDOSEIV that he was

calling to say hello. He was in Washington up at the "Life" office for

two weeks and he wondered if FEDOSEEV would like to have dinner with him

and his wife one day during his stay here. FEDOSEEV asked JAIFE for his

telephone number - REpublic 7-6050 - and said he would call JAFFE in a

couple of days.

FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when it would be convenient for

him. JAFFE said he would be free any time.

On 7/2/54 SAM JAFFE asked FEDOSBEV if it would be all right

If they postponed their dinner because he was just notified that

EISENHOWER was making a trip this week and that he, JAIFE, was selected

to make the trip too.

He will probably be back on Monday. FEDOSHEV

said he would be working on Monday and will call JAFFE about noon. JAFFE

is living at the Mayflower Hotel, Room 877• He will be glad to have

dinner with FEDOSEEV Monday night if the latter can arrange it.

On 7/5/54 FEDOSEEV tried to reach Room 877 at the Mayflower but

no one answered at the room.

On 7/6/54 SAM JAFFE informed FEDOSEEV that he had expected

to call him yesterday but that the President had decided to stay

another day. JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV when they could meet and gave him a

choice of Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. JAFTE suggested that they

meet (did not say where) at 7 o'clock and FEDOSEEV said he would call

him back at his office either today or tomorrow to make it definite.

FEDOSEEV asked JAFFE when he would be leaving Washington and JAFFE said

he thought it would be on Saturday.

On 7/12/54 SAM JAFFE tOld FEDOSEEV that he had just talked to

Mr. HUNT about getting a picture of the ZARUBINs either today or tomorrow

in the big room of the Embassy. FEDOSIEV promised to check with the

Ambassador and call JAFFE back either today or tomorrow.

On 8/19/55 SAM JAFFE, Nation magazine, calling from New York,

told K. G. FIDOSEEV that he applied for a visa to enter Russia on June

6th, in New Delhi, India, where he was during an Asian Your for the

magazine. He checked on the visa in Rome and in Paris, but got no word.

He checked in London, where they had no information, but Mr. MOLCHANOV

there promised to check with Moscow on it. Also, while in London, JAFFE

said he contacted KINGSLEY MARTIN, Of the "New Statesman," who had just

returned from Russia. MARIIN said he had a friend in the Soviet Embassy

In London, a First Secretary, My. DENCHINSKY (ph), who also talked to JAFFE

about the visa and promised

. to help. Just before JAFFE lefi London for

the U. Se, he received word from DENCHINSKY that the matter was being

considered at the highest level, and word of the results would be given to

the Soviet Embassy in Washington, or directly to the magazine in New York.

JAFFE asked FEDOSEEV to help him. FEDOSEEV asked if JAFFE planned on

being in Washington, D. C.s SOON. JAFFE said he hoped to be here next week.

It was arranged that he will call FEDOSEEV the day before coming down to

arrange to get together and FEDOSEEV will try to find out about the visa

in the meantime. JAFFE and FEDOSEEV recalled that they had had dinner

together some time ago.

WFO indices also reflect the following:

WFO agents on physical surveillance observed the following:

On 7/9/54 at 8:37 pm TEDOSEV and his wife, NONVA Mo PEDOSEEVA,

in the company of JAFFE and his wife departed the FEDOSEEV residence,

Chastleton Hotel, 1701 16th Street, N. W., Washington, D. Cas and walked

to the Colony Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Street, N. W., which they entered

at 8:58 pm.

They departed the restaurant at 11:18 pm and walked to the

vicinity of the FEDOSEEV residence where the couples separated. JAFFE

and his wife then entered a taxicab and thereafter engagéd in strenuous

efforts to detect or lose the physical surveillance.

The Bureau advised NY and WFO by letter dated 7/19/5h that on

the following day, 7/10/54, a representative of "Time" and "Lifel

magazines contacted the Bureau alleging that he believed JAFFE had been

under surveillance by the FBI on the previous night. A representative

of "Time" and "Life" magazines stated that JAFFE has an assignment to

write astory on contemporary religions and plans to go to Red China for

the purpose of studying Buddhism.

JAFFE was in contact with FEDOSEEV

and other Soviets to obtain their co-operation in travel clearance.

With the above letter, the Bureau sent to WrO for its

information a copy of-a letter dated 6/11/54 from New York to the Bureau

thing and we are dealing with KONSTANTIN FEDOSEEV in Washington."

JAFFE mentioned to TARASOV he wanted to get hold of "Red Starl magazine,

he would look it up and call JAFFE:

The above New York letter concluded by setting forth that a

case has been opened under the caption "SAM A. JAFFE; IS - R'in the NEO

.,and will be investigated as directed in no number SAC letter AF Series,

1952 dated 10/22,52 captioned "Espionage and Foreign Interagenc

in this case will be carried under the single caption of the subject.

In addition to the information set forth above, the Bureau's

letter of 7/19/5k set forth that inasmuch as the reason for JAFFE's

contacts with the Soviets has been determined and in view of his allegations

in regard to a physical surveillance conducted on him on 7/9/54, it is not

believed desirable to continue inquiries in regard to him for the purpose

of considering his development as a source of information in regard to

Sovlet activities. The Bureau concluded that no further investigation

should be conducted regarding

JAFFE unless additional infomation cones

to WFO or NY's attention that JAFFE may be engaged in activities inimical

to the security of the U. S., at which time the Bureau should be

appropriately advised.

OBSERVATIONS:

Fedoseev is a Counselor at the sovier Embassy and his wife

is In charge of the fress department which has replaced the defunot

soulei Information Bulletin.

Both are important fiqures at the soubet

Embassy and are suspeted of soviet intelligence activities. The

importance of identifying uninown individuals who have personal contact

with officials of soviet establishments and in particular with persons.

like redoseev and his wife is an important and necessary part of our

coverage of soviet activities.

It becomes euen more important to

identify such persons when they act in a suspicious manner or attempt

to detect a

possible suruerllance.

RECORMENDATION

I. Asêt appears that the surveillance was conducted discreetly

under difficult circumstances and no specific faot has been deucloped

indicating that the surveillance was in fact compromised, the statement

of the

'Brime" and ilife" magazines representative would appear to rer

Plect only Jarge's suspicions that he was under surveillance. No

administrative action is recommended.

Re telephone call from MT. C. E. HENNRICH of the

Bureau today regarding this

matter.

Attached is a memorandum submitted by special Agents

ARTHUR J. ACHENBACH, KEVIN I. TLANAGAN, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL,

JOHN H. RENOYER, ROBERT G. MCGEARY and

JOSEPH E. SCULLY

describing the surveillonce maintained by them on FEDOSEVA,

her husband, sall JAffEE and his wife on the evening of July 9, le

1954.

I have talked to the Agents who handled this sur

veillance which was being conducted in accordance with in-

structions issued under the soviet intensification program.

purpose of these surveillances is to deternine whether the

subjects under surveillance are engaged in intelligence or

espionage activities and to identify any contacts which may be

obserued in the course of the surveillance.

As explained by the Agents,

and as will be noted from

the attachment, the surveillance was

iritiated at 8:38 P.M., at

which time this party were observed walking from the chastleton

Hotel to the colony Restaurant.

During this

period, which con-

stituted approximately twenty minutes,

no activities whatever

on the part of the subjects under surveillance indicated any

awareness'

or any consciousness of being surveilled.

As the

party left the restaurant at 11:18 P.ll., they were noted to

be

on the lookout for a surveillance, even going to the extent of

scrutinizing passing persons and

traffic.

The Agents noticed

this awareness immediately and proceeded with appropriate

discretion.

It would appear that something may have been

said

during the time the party were in the restaurant about being

followed by the FBI,

which may account for the

sudden awareness

of a surveillance on the part of this group.

It has been

they have been told by the hussions they probably would be

surveilled as a result of their contact with the Russians. ()

The remarks made to the taxi driver, as reported

by him, plus the activities of this group, reflect a definite

effort on their part to determine whether

they were actually

•under surveillance.

The admission by the taxi driver that he

did not detect any surveillance seemed to indicate, that it was

handled properly and with discretion. This would appear to be

borne out further by the fact that when Mr. JAFFEE and his wife

entered the Mayflower Hotel they looked out of the Mayflower

'Hotel onto the street and were obviously not aware of the fact

that Bureau Agents had them under surveillance in the lobby

the hotel.

The surveillance of Mr. and irs. JAFFEE was discon-

inued de ti:te Aomo, Wien it was learned jrom the cao ariver

that they possibly were "newspaper people"

, but thereafter in-

quiries were made in the hotel to determine the identity of the

JAFFEES.

In view of the difficult circumstances under which

this surveillance was conducted, it does not appear that it.

handled indiscreetly and, therefore, no administrative

action is recommended.

The following summarizes the physical surveillance conducted

on July 9, 1954, concerning the the

i, KONSTANTIN G.

FEDOSEEV, 1 SAM JAFFEE, and MrS. JAFFEE.

MRS. FEDOSEEV

At 8:37 P.M., SAS DONALD A, GRUNNTZEL and ROBERT G. MOGEARY

R Street, No Wo, Washington, D. C. They walked directly to the Colony

Restaurant, 1737 DeSales Place, N. Wo, by way of 1oth Street, N Street

and 17th Street, N. W. They were observed to enter this restaurant at

8358 P.M. No attemot was made to keep the party under observation within l

the restaurant, because it was felt that this could not be done discreetiy.

At 11:18 P.M., SAS JOSEPH E. SCULLY, DONALD A. GRUENTZEL

and ROBERT G. McGEARY observed the party leaving the Colony Restaurant.

These Agents, who were on foot, observed the group walk west on DeSales

Place, N. Wo, north on Connecticut Avenue to N Street, N. W. They

observed that FEDOSEEV and JAFFEE walked together very slowly and appeared

to be in deep conversation. It was also noted that FEDOSEEVA and Mrs.

JAFFEE were walking together about 10 feet behind their husbands and

were also conversing. The Agents noticed that the party on departing

the Colony Restaurant appeared to be scrutinizing passing traffic and

other pedestrians in the area. Consequently, the Agents maintained a

(c)

discreet distance from the group.

On reaching Connecticut Avenue, SA JOHN H. KENOYER took over

the surveillance on foot and observed the party continuing to walk north

on Conneuticut Avenue, around Dupont Circle, N. Wo, at which time SA

DONALD A. GRUENTZEL rejoined the surveillance on foot.

The two Agents

observed the party walk northeast on New Hampshire Avenue, N. Wo, to

I6th Street, N. W., and then south on the west side of loth Streets

No Ho, to R Street, N. W.

While walking from Dupont Circle to this

point, the Agents noticed that the party carefully observed other

pedestrians and passing automobiles.

At no time did a Bureau automobile (C/

pass the party or come within its sight. The cars were utilized solely

Agents GRUENTZEL and KENOYER observed the party standing

on the corner of loth and R Streets, N. We, conversing for about three

minutes. At 12:04 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEwere observed entering

Skyking Taxi Cab #60.

At this time, the Agents on foot brought up

a surveillance car occupied by SAs SCULIY and ACHENBACH. These Agents

observed the taxi proceeding south on l6th Street to M Street, N. Wo

At this point, SA MOGEARY, in another Bureau car, took over the

surveillance and observed the cab proceeding west on'M Street to 17th

Street, N. Wo, then south on 17th Street, N. Wo, to I Street, N. Wos

at which point SA KEVIN F. FLANAGAN, in another Bureau car, took over

the surveillance. SA FLANAGAN observed the taxi proceeding west on

I Street and south on 17th Street to E Street, N. H. At this point,

the first surveillance car took over the surveillance and observed

the taxi proceeding east on I Street, N. Wo, then circle through the

Ellipse back to 17üh Street, N. We At this point, SA McGEARY, in a

Bureau car, rejoined the surveillance, and the Agents in both cars

pbserved the taxi cab proceeding north on 17th Street, N. Wo, and

Connecticut Avenue to the Mayflower Hotel.

The Agents noticed that

from the time Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE enterad the taxi cab until they

alighted at the Mayflower Hotel, they frequently looked through the

(e)

rear window of the taxi cab. The cab varied its speed noticeably

throughout the ride.

At 12:26 A.M., Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by SAs

ACHENBACH, FLANAGAN and KENOYER leaving the taxi in front of the hotel.

iney looked up and down the street and then walked south on Connecticut

Avenue, almost to I Streets N. Mo, whereupon they turned around and

started back toward the hotel. At this time, SAs ACHENBACH and KENOYER

entered the hotel through the DeSales Street entrance and seated

themselves in the lobby. Agent FLANAGAN entered the hotel through

the Connecticut Street entrance and proceeded to the desk.

About three

minutes later, Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were observed by these Agents

entering the hotel through the Connecticut Avenue entrance. Immediately

alter entering the hotel, Mr. JAFFEE and his wife were observed

standing in the entrance-way and loolang up and down Connecticut Avenue.

They then proceeded to the center of the lobby where they separated.

Agents KENOYER and ACHENBACH observad Mi. JAFFFE walk toward the 17th

Street end of the lobby and out of sight.

All three Agents observed

Mrs. JAFFEE walk to the hotel desk, at which A FLANAGAN was filling

out a reservation form under an alias. After completing the form, SA

FLANAGAN walked out of the hotel. At this time, SAs ACHENBACH and

leave the hotel. During the time that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were in the

lobby, the Agents noticed that the JAFFEES were very observant of

persons in the lobby. In view of the late hour, few people were in

the lobby.

At 12:32 A.M., SA GRUENTZEL observed Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE

come out of the Connecticut Avenue exit of the hotel and, after looking

up and down Connecticut Avenue, walk south on Connecticut Avenue to

I Street, NoW. At this time, SA ACHENBACH joined the foot surveillance

of Agent GRUENTZEL..

They observed the JAFFEES crossing Connecticut

Avenue at I Stree and disappear from view going west on I Street.

Approximately two minutes later, SA ACHENBACH observed Mr. and Mrs.

JAFFEE in a doorway located on the I Street side of a business establish-

ment at the intersection of I Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W.

He observed that they were looking intently through the plate glass

windows of the store in the direction of the Mayilower Hotel. At this

point, Agent ACHENBACH, who was standing on a streetcar platform at the

corner of i Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. W., boarded a south-

bound streetcar. Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were next observed by SAs SCULLY

god GRUENIZEL running across I Street to the south side and walking

west on I Street to 18th Street.

After reaching l8th Streets they re-

crossed to the north side of I Street and returned to the Mayflower

Hotel via I Street and Connecticut Avenue, N. i.

They entered the

Mayilover Hotel at 12:42 A.M.

Surveillance was discontinued at this

time upon receipt of infornation from SA McCLARY to the effect that

Mr. and MrS. JAFFEE were possibly "newspaper people."

After Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE alighted from the taxi cab in

front of the Mayflower Hotel, SA MeGIARY located and interviewed the

cab drivers ROBERT S. DAVIS, at 17th and M Streets, N. W. DAVIS

informed SA MCGEARY that imnediately after picking up the couple at

16th & R Streets, N. I, they inforned him that they were "newspaper

people" and that they had spent the evening with a "couple of Russians"

and that they probably would be followed. The cab driver stated

further that he asked the couple if he

should try to "lose them."

Mrs. JAFFEE replied, "Ies, il you can." DAVIS also advised SA MCGARY

that Mr. and Mrs. JAFFEE were attempting to obtain license numbers,

but that he did not think they were successful. He stated that he

himself had not been able to detect any surveillance.

• After Mrs. JAFTEE had purchased the cigaretts in the hotel

and had departed with her husband, SA KENOYER asked the night manager

at the hotel desk whether he was acquainted with the couple and whether

they were registered at the hotel. The night manager replied that he

did not know.

Approximately 20 minutes after the couple had entered

the hotel for the second time, SA FLANAGAN, under suitable pretexts

interviewed the elevator operators who advised that a couple

answering the description of Mr. and Mrs. JAFICE had gotten off

the elevator at the eighth floor.

Upon receipt of the information from SA MeGARY, as

obtained from the cab driver, that the couple were possibly associated

with the Pressy SA KENOYER contacted the appropriate supervisor and

was instructed to discontinue the surveillance in view of the

possibility that the unknown couple were associated with the Press.

It was noted in the early stages of the surveillance that

the individuals involved were extremely surveillance conscious and

the Agents made every attempt to be very discreet. As set forth in

detail above,

the automobiles and Agents involved. were rotated as

much as possible to avoid detection by the persons under surveillance.

Even though it was apparent to the Agents that the parties under

surveillance were apparently looking for a tail, it was not telt

desirable to discontinue the surveillance until the couple were

identified. The importance of identifying unknown individuals who

have personal contact with officials of the Soviet establishments

has been impressed on the Field by the Bureau as a necessary part of (C

the Soviet Intensification Programo

On July 10, 1954s SA KENOYER ascertained that the files

of this office reflect that SAM JAFFEE of Life magazine on July 6,

2954, discussed with KONSTANTIN G. FIDOSEEV the prospect of having

dinner together. No definite plans were made for this dinner. The

files also reflected that JAFFEE was residing in Room 877 of the

Mayflower Hotel, which is the same floor to which the unknown couple

proceeded on the night of July 9, 1954. This information was not

Late on 9-12-74 Donahue advised Bowers he had learned from

"Canfield concerning this matter, that Canfield apparently has made a deal with

Stern Magazine, a German publication described as the Life Magazine of Germany,-

for its use of the photographs Canfield has collected and the information

concerning them.

This magazine allegedly has arranged for a Swiss photographic

expert to examine the pictures in an effort to determine if the three "bums" shown

in the photographs might be identical to E. Howard Hunt, Frank Sturgis, and

Thomas Arthur Vallee.

Supervisor John Ruhl of Washington Field Office advised Bowers

on the night of 9-12-74 that he had received a call from Jatfe who was seeking an

FBI evaluation of Canfield's reliability and the information Canfield had regarding

the Kennedy assassination. Jaffe told Ruhl he had given Cantield $300 as an

advance toward a possible story which he might write regarding the photographs

and information Canfield has developed. Ruhl furnished Jaffe no information. He

is submitting a communication to the Bureau on 9-13-74 furnishing full details of

Sam Jaffe

A confidential source, who has furnishea reliable

information in the past, advised a Special Agent (SA) Of

the Federal Bureau

or Investigation (FBI, that the July

the house organ of

reflected that "Sam Jaffe

visit China. He will arrive in early August and will

file for the news wires, news pictures, and audio"

The source advised the Jaffe is not on the

regular UPI stall, but has done free-lance work for the

UPI, such as covering the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA)

with a tape recorder. It was the source's opinion that

the visa from Mainland China was not arranged for Jaffe

by the UPI as they would have sent somebody of more

consequence, if theyhad been able to get a visa. The

source also noted that during the • UNGA, Jaffe

-

leaned to the Soviet Mission to the United Nations for

"behind the scene". type news

rather than trying to be

friendly with the new Chinese delegation.

The source described Jaffe as a former Moscow

correspondent for the Columbia Broadcasting System,

who

is, or has had, numerous close contacts with Soviet nationals.

Source statedthat Jaffe later worked as a correspondent

for the American Broadcasting Company in Southeast Asia

and also did

free-lance work for UPI in New York.

This document contains neither recommendations nor

conclusions of the FBI. It is the property of the

D. C. JAFFE stated that DANILOFF speaks Russian fluently and

has dedicated himself to becoming an authority on Soviet

Union affairs. JAFFE recalled that some time ago DANILOFF

attempted to interest JAFFE in their pooling expenses and

arranging social affairs for Soviet nationals here. Purpose

of this was to give them an entre to the Soviets for background

information which might serve their correspondent careers.

JAFFE was not interested.

JAFFE stated that on the night of 2/25/71, DANILOFE

telephoned him and stated that he had turned down an offer to

become the head of the UPI office in Moscow. DANILOFF stated

the conditions were not right. JAFFE took this to mean that

the salary offered for the position was not enough.

SAMURI. ADASON JAFFE

On February 25, 1971, Samuel Adason Jaffe,

free

lance correspondent was shown photographs of Boris.V.

Yarochevskiy, a correspondent for the lass News Agency, an

official Soviet news agency, and the latter's wife, Inna G.

Yarochevskaya. Jaffe recognized the Yarochevskiys and re-

called he had previously volunteered information concerning

them.

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe advised he met the

Yarochevskiys at a Hungarian Embassy reception in Washington,

D. C. (WDC) on April 17, 1969. Yarochevskaya had looked

familiar to Jaffe. Yarochevskaya recognized Jaffe as having

formerly been a correspondent in Moscow, Union of Soviet Social-

ist Republics (USSR), and indicated that she had been one of

the translators for the Reuters News Agency in Moscow working

for John Miller, and that later she had been a translator for

Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish newspaper correspondent and

a friend of Jaffe.)

(On April 29, 1969, Jaffe indicated that Yarochevskiy

was attending the Foreign Language Institute in Moscow while

Yarochevskaya was working for Reuters. Later, YAROCHEVSKIY

attended Mc Gill University in Canada, and his wife had flown

from Moscow to meet her husband in Canada and they then traveled

to the United States.

On April 17, 1969, Yarochevskaya indicated

that she and her husband had been in WDC for approximately

a month and a half.

SAMUAL ADASON JAFFE

(On May 14, 1969, Jaffe advised that recently he had

had the Yarochevskiys to his residence for lunch. Present

also were an American correspondent and the latter's wife.)

On February 25, 1971, Jaffe stated he has had no

further contacts with Yarochevskaya, and has seen Yarochevskiy

only once since he had them to his residence for lunch in May

of 1969. Jaffe said he had seen Yarochevskiy in attendance at

an anti-Vietnam war demonstration in Washington, D. C., In

j1969, date unrecalled. Yarochevskly was walking alone and

carrying a camera, "and it was not until he was right on top of

the Soviet did Jaffe realize his identity.

They exchanged only

'greetings.: Yarochevskiy told Jaffe that they must get together

sometime.

Jaffe stated he had

never known Yarochevskiy prior

to their meeting at the Hungarian Embassy reception on April 17,

1969.

He had known Yarochevskaya previously, but only as one

of a number of individuals whose services as translators,

chauffeurs or house maids were made available to foreign

COT-

respondents assigned to Moscow by a Soviet government agency

which Jaffe knew as "UPDK"'. It is Jaffe's impression now, that

Yarochevskaya had been assigned by 'UPDK!, as a translator, to

Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish national and a correspondent

for a. Swedish newspaper, probably in 1965.

Jaffe recalled that both he and Bruger (phonetic) left

Moscow in 1965. Jaffe now has the impression that Yarochevskaya

was not married when he knew her in 1965. Jaffe did not know

her socially. He did not know her by her maiden name.

He recog-

nized her at the Hungarian Imbassy reception in 1969 but only

after Yarochevskaya had

refreshed his menory by recalling Moscow.

Jaffe said he believes that the ""UPDK" was controlled

by the KGB (Ministry of State Security); however, all of the

persons employed by "U?DK" were not necessarily connected with

Soviet intelligence. Jaffe stated he has no information that

Yarochevskaya is, or was, connected with Soviet intelligence.

. Jaffe offered his opinion that Yarochevskaya may be

connected with Soviet intelligence. He stated his opinion is

influenced by the fact that in her 1965 employment as a trans-

lator in Moscow, Yarochevskaya had the opportunity of becoming

acquainted with foreign correspondents assigned to Moscow. His

opinion is influenced also by Yarochevskaya's subsequent

marriage to a personable and younger Soviet who received an

assignment to the United States as a Tass correspondent. Jaffe

stated Yarochevskaya is the only Soviet national whom he knows

who was employed by "UPDK' as a translator for foreign corres-

pondents, who later. came to the United States.

Jaffe stated that when he served in Moscow he and

other foreign correspondents often heard references to a "Black

Tass''

The runors were that the Tass News Agency abroad per-

formed two functions.

One was to gather news for dissemination

to the Soviet people through Soviet newspapers and periodicals.

The other, "Black Tass", was a form of intelligence gathering,

the results of which were never made known to the Soviet people

but were furnished directly to the KGB in Moscow for transmittal

to Kremlin officials. Jaffe stated that an example of the "Black

Tass" operation would be a Tass correspondent in Washington, D.C.

feeling out his contacts to ascertain what the thinking of gov-

ernment officials night be in regard to some phase of the United

States' foreign policy. Jaffe said that "Black Tass" would not

necessarily relate to espionage.

Jaffe stated the only contact he has had in recent

months with Soviet nationals occurred approximately in the end

of January, 1971, exact date unrecalled.

Jaffe had just stepped

away from making a telephone call in the lobby of the Statler

Hilton Hotel, 16th and K Streets, N. W., Washington, D. C.,

when Oleg M. Sokolov, a First Secretary, Soviet Embassy, walked

into view. Sokolov greeted him warmly and asked Jaffe where he

had been keeping himself and why no one had seen him. Jaffe

replied that he has been in the Washington, D. C. area but that

Sokolov stated that that was not his (Sokolov's) fault and

added tbat there "are two people who like you, Bubnow and

I".

Sokolov gave Jaffe his business card and said that they

must get together.

Jaffe stated Sokolov was referring to Igor D.

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

INTERNAL SECURITY - NORTH VIETNAM

On January 27, 1971, WE I-1, whose reliability is

unknown, however, who is in a position to furnish reliable

information, advised that he had received the following

area.

Samuel Adason Jaffe an acquaintance of one TRAN

VAN DINH, Former Acting Charge d'Affatres of the

Embassy of

Vietnam WDC, and currently employed as a free-lance researcher

and lecturer,

suggested to TRAN VAN DINH the possibility of

arranging for

a visit by an unidentified group of United

States .(U.S.) citizens to various camps in North Vietnam

holding U.S. prisoners of war.

TRAN VAN DINH advised Jaffe that he would correspond

with an acquaintance of his one LEXCHAN, Director of Press

Relations for the Embassy of North Vietnam in Paris, Irance,

and set Forth Jaffe's proposal.

In addition, TRAN VAN DINH

advised he would prepare a letter of introduction to LE CHAN

which Jaffe could hand carry. This letter would also set

forth the proposal of visiting the U.S. prisoners of war.

CONFIDEN

On January 12, 1971, Jaffe arrived in Paris,

France, and contacted LE CHAN at which time it was suggested

to Jaife that the proposal first be discussed with THICK

THIRT CHAU, President of the Association of Vietnamese

Buddhists in France.

Jaffe met with THICK THIEN CHAU for a two hour

luncheon

engagement on January 12, 1971, THICK THIEN CHAU

was generally receptive to the proposal, however, he

suggested that the proposal be handled through the National

Liberation Front (NLF) representative in Paxis, HA THANH

-IAM. Jaffe was not immediately receptive to this; however,

THICK THIEN CHAU indicated that the possibility of any

success with his proposal would depend on this course of

action.

On January 14, 1971, at 10:30 a.m. Jaffe met with

HA THATH LAM, Director of Information, NLF, Paris, france;

however, due to a language barrier further discussions were

arranged for 4:30 p.m. that day when each could obtain the

services of a translator.

"At 4:30 p.m. Jaffe returned to the offices of HA

CHANH LAM with Ann David an acquaintance of his from Sorbonne

University, Paris, Exance.

*HA THANH LAM had at his office

a Buddhist nun, THICK MAN DAYLA, who spoke excellent English

and who appeared to be very influential during the course of

discussion.

: France

• Jaffe emphasized to HA THANH LAM the great concern

of the people of the United States for the U.S. prisoners of

war in North Vietnamese prison camps and the necessity of

allowing an unbiased group, including himself, of U.S. citizens

to visit all the prisoners in all the camps and not just a

so-called "representative number who may have been brainwashed."

Jaffe told Brut he could' not believe Vinogradov could possibly

say anything like-that.

According to Jaffe, Bruk, who claims

he 1a dewish, is "always trying to convlace American vers

thore is no anti-Semitisu in Russia." During the party, Brul:

gave

& long-vinded speech and later Jaffe "sounded off"

Jaffe noted that the Soviets are quite obvious in

theis efforts to convince foreigners they are not anti-Senitic.

He was told by some of the "Young Fresidents of America" who

recently toured the Union of Sovie Saclalist Republics (USSR)

that the Soviets saw to It that Bruk escorted them and that

chciz daiver and their guides were Jewlah. The Sovlets did

not encourage the group, all of rhou were of Jevish origin,

to visis any synagogues

in the Soviet Union.

In an effort to convince Jaffe that the Soviets are

not anti - Senitic, Bruk asked Jeite if he was aware that the

wife of Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhner was Jewish, When

Jaffe answered in the negative, Bruk insisted that not only

Is she Jewish but that "she has a heavy Jewish sccent."*

Bruk indicated he is now head of the English Sec-

cion of APN and obtained this position through his friend,

Boris (Sergeyevich) Burkov, former head of APH. Bruk added

chat Fuckow subseruently vas denoted; horever, this has not

affected his own career in APN and he conveyed the impression

his job is very secure. Brule stated he has thirteen people

working under him, all of whom he had "handpicked." Brak

commented that Georgly Bolshakov is no longer working for Ad,

having been discharged because of heavy drinking.

GRU: (Sovlet Military Intelligence) tho in 1962-63 worked under

In Jaffats opinion, Brul has always been a "name-

dropper and during his conversation with Jaffe, Bruk mentioned

seeing or hearing fron several Anerican nillionaize friends

of Elea

Brule Indicated he had contacted, apparently tele-

phonically, Armand Banner, head of Occidental Petroleum

Corpozation, in los Angeles. He claimed to be in touch with

Charles Stevart Mott, philanthropist and forner Ceneral

Motors Corporation executive; with Industralisi Gyrus Paton,

an with a Vice President of Morgan Guareaty Trust Company,

name not recalled, who llves in a plush apartment on 5th

Avenue in New York City.

Folloving the party, Jaife Javited Brus and Shveytzer

to dinner and visited Bruk and Shveytser In the hotel soon

they shared at the Warwick Hotel on 6th Avenue in New York

City. While there, Shveytser said the girl fron whom Bruk

expected a telephone call had not phoned. Brus replied he

was very anxious to hear from the girl, mentioning to Jaffe

that he would like to have Intimate relations with her, but

he did not mention her nsme.

Jatte recalled that In Moscow Brule had the reputa-

tion of being a "girl chaser." During his eurrent trip to

the United States, Bruk showed Jaife a photograph of his wife,

helen, and their daughter; and did not mention he had divorced

Helen and remarried.

Jaffe indicated he previously heard

from menbers of the "Young Presidents of America" who visited

the Soviet Union that Brule had divorced his first wlie and

remerried, and had introduced nembers of the American group

to his new wife.

obvious to Jaffe that shveytser was very much upset by Aruk's

Jaffe told Bruc his statenent ras ridiculous per

se adding that Shveytser was a very scholazly individual who

rarely had contacts with foreigners. Brue replied facetiously

that this was the type of person KOl used; however, Jaffe got

the impression Brule was not sincere in his comments about

Saveytaer.

Jaffe said he inguired of Bruk concerning several

of hls Soviet contacts and the latter replied: "I don't see..

then any nore." Shvaytser asked Brub why he still was

Eriendly with hin (Shveytser) when be had failed to retain

many of his other friends.

inaraho replied: "Hell, you

don't goad me and don't side all over me."

Saveytser replied:

"I have let you have it on occasion when you are wrong."

Jasfe added that although Sruk is a shasp individual,

Shveytser is on & much higher intellectual plene, and expressed

the opinion that truk probably did not fully comprehend many

. of Shreytser's comments.

Jaffe stated he has always been convinced that acul

Jaffe learned from Bruk: that Lyudmile Alekseyevna

not depart the United States with the captloned group but

would remain in the United States to do research. Jaffe

understood she sas a historian. He added thai unlike some

but not related, Bruk asked Jeff Jaffe if he would mind

taking a letter or note to source.

Jeff Jaffe indicated he

would be glad to do so, however, they parted that day

and he did not see Bruk again for a couple of weeks. Just

prior to his departure from the USSh, Jefs Jaffe met Erul

again and reminded Bruk of the letter

to source: pointing

out that he would be leaving the USSK very shortly, however,

Jeft Jaffe got the impression he "was talking to a dummy."

Bruk gave absolutely no indication that he recalled ever

Source stated that when Jeff Jaffe called him

September 14, 1970, and extended him the invitation to

attend the party for Bruk at the Harmony Club, which

On April 29, 1969, a confidential source, who

he had been informed of the following information by

Samuel Jaffe, identified below: -S-

Samuel Adason Jaffe, American Broadcasting Company

correspondent, secently learned of Dr. Paul Lin, a professor

at McGill University, Montreal, Canada, Subsequently, Jaffe

obtained additional information concerning LIN from a long-

Dickinson University, New Jersey, and from VAN LUNG, one

of the owners of the Yenching Palace Restaurant, 3524

Connecticut Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C., with whom

Jaffe dined in April, 1969..-sr

On April 8, 1969, Jaffe telephonically contacted

LIN advising Lin that he had recently seen a New York Times

article dealing with the restoration of Canada-China

diplomatic relations and in which LIN's name appeared.

Jaffe inforned IIN that he had been in Hong Kong for about

four years and was desirous of interviewing IIN. Additionally,

Jaffe informed LIN that he had interviewed CHOU En-lai in

1955 and was one of about 18 journalists invited to visit

the China Mainland in 1956. Jaife also advised LIN that he

LIN advised Jaffe to contact him later at which

time he would have a definite answer as to a possible

interview.. -5-

On April 18, 1969, Jaffe recontacted LIN telephonically

at which time LIN indicated

a reluctance to grant an interview

with Jaffe, feeling that granting such an interview would

leave the door open to interviews by many other journalists.

IIN, however, indicated a'desire to talk with Jaffe and after

exchanging telephone numbers and addresses a luncheon

engagement was set for April 28, 1969, at the faculty lounge

at Mcfill University, Montreal, Canada. - 5-

On April 28, 1969, Jaffe flew to Montreal and met

LIN for lunch as previously arranged.. Jaffe expressed to LIN

his strong desire to visit the China

Mainland as a correspondent

and suggested that it might be possible that the Chinese

Government would permit foreign journalists to enter the

China Mainland in connection with the October celebrations.

LIN expressed the opinion that the October celebrations

would make no difference in the Government's policy concerning

the admittance of journalists. LIN suggested that Jaffe

write a letter by the first of June, 1969, to the Chinese

Government indicating that he desired to enter the China

Mainland as a private citizen, stating

, that he had interviewed

CHOU En-lai in 1955 as an American journalist and that if

he is permitted to enter China, he would like to continue •

to pursue his career as a journalist. -s?

LIN indicated that the best way to establish contact

would be through the Chinese imbassy in Paris; however, when

Jaffe indicated that he knew no one there and the possibility

existed that the letter would no be forwarded to the proper

channels LIN

stated he would "Be going East in early summer"'

and he would be willing to see to it that the letter would

be properly dispatched. LIN also suggested that Jaffe's

letter be sent to him for perusal prior to its dispatch as

he possibly could be of assistance in wording the letter

correctly.

LIN emphasized that Jaife should indicate in his

letter that he was writing as a private citizen; however, he

should not try to hide that faci "'It he is a joucnalist

and state in the letter that he hid previously been a journalist

for "The Nation" and that he would like to write and produce

films about China. - 5-

LIN also stated that Jaffe should include in his

letter the fact that he would be willing to leave his United

States Passport in Hong Kong and when Jaffe indicated to LIN

that he did not think that would be necessary, LIN stated

that maybe "they would not want you to come into China with

•a U:S. Passport."

+5=

According to Jaffe, LIN is a very brilliant

individual well-versed in Soviet-Chinese relations and in

United States relations with China and the Soviet Union.

LIN appeared to be more concerned with Sino-Soviet relations

than with the United States.

LIN commented that Cyrus Baton

is very much interested in bringing China and the United

States together and stated that Eaton had. sent him an article

from a Cleveland newspaper on anti-China hysteria whipping

up in the United States. -S~

In commenting on the recent newspaper accounts of

the speech of LIN Piao, Vice Primier, Communist China, LIN

stated that he thought it was premature to make any judgment

on the speech in its entirety; however, LIN ranked MAO Ise-tung,

CHOU En-lai, and LIN Piao almost equally: Ill stated that

he did not for a minute think that they believe the United

, States or the Soviet Union would launch an atomic attack.

They do believe the Soviet Union is a serious threat but

they dornot think either the United States or the Soviet

Union plan to launch a premature-attack on them. In talking

about moderates, LIN stated that CHOU In-lai is not a

moderate; he is a tactician. LIN stated that MAO probably

is the only man who really understands the Chinese people

and believed MAO felt he had to start the Cultural Revolution

because there were people in China who were doing things for

their own self interest and MAO had to take action, including

the unleashing of the Red fuard to prevent this.

LIN indicated

that he felt MA0 has been successful. LIN stated that the

Soviet Union is much like the United States but MAO knew

that if these people vere allowed to gain'

a foothold that

China would revert to the days of CHIANG Kai-shek when

there was unlimited corruption and he felt this had to be

settled once and for all.

LIN, stated that MAO, CHOU,. and

LIN Piao were unanimous and there was no disagreement among

them. -5-

LIN stated to Jaffe that he would not set; foot

in the United States until the Vietnam war was ended; however,

later when LIN asked Jaffe if he was aware of the fact that

he (LIN) had been in Hong Kong in January,: 1969, and Jaffe

replied in the affirmative, LIN stated "I am sorry, I am

not being completely honest. You know that I was in 'Seattle."

LIN then explained that en route from Hong Kong to Canada

he decided to return through Seattle to Canada against the

advice of his friends in Hong Kong who indicated that there

might be trouble. LIN stated that he was detained at the

airpost (Seattle) for two hours, was interrogated, and all

personal effects were gone through. LIN stated he was sure

everything was photographed and he was furious. LIN stated

that he subsequently contacted an attorney, "the number one

professor of law at Harvard University,!' who was also incensed

• over the incident. - S

LIN inquired of Jaffe if he knew other news

correspondents, such as Harrison Salisbury, Doak Barnett,

ox Frank Trader. LIN indicated that he knew Salisbusy well.

and stated that he was sure Salisbury would speak well of

him (LIN). LIN also discussed Mortin Schafer, Canadian

correspondent, tho entered China as a tourist and who

apparently concealed

a camera in a cigarette lighter to take

• photographs in China. Jaffe indicated. that that was

unfortunate as it has made it more difficult for foreign

journalists to obtain permission to enter China. In commenting

on correspondent Milton Nash, LIN stated that he thought

Nash was "bright and understanding." S:-.

LIN was shown a United States newspaper article

concerning China and LIN expressed a desice to have a copy

of that article. Jaffe promised to send him a copy of the

article.

SAMUEL. ADASON JAFFE

Reference is made to memorandum dated April 29, 1969

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Washington, D.G.

concerning captioned individual.

Interview, April 16, 1969

U

On April 16, 1969, Samuel Adason Jaffe telephonically

furnished the following information to an Agent of the Washington

Field Office (FBI).

Party Given by Jaffe, Attended by Hungarian and

Polish nationals

Jaffe stated he recently held a party at his residence

which was attended by a representative of the Hungarian News

Agency, the hungarian Press Attache, and the Polish Press Attach,

whom he identified as Andrej Konopacki and described as a "hard-

nosed" individual in his political outlook.

Attempts to Contact Boris Nikolayevich. Sedov

Jaffe said he had attempted on three of four occasions

to telephonically contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov at the Soviet

Embassy, but was unable "to catch him in." He left word with the

Soviet Embassy on one or two occasions for Sedov to contact him.

(Sedov has been reported to be a KGB officer. Jaffe

previously advised that sedov told him that while

thumbing through "our photograph files" he found

a photograph of Jaffe taken in Moscow interviewing

a Russian. Sedov indicated he thought Jaffe might

want the photograph and suggested that they get

together for lunch soon.)

Farewell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised that next week he will attend the going-

away party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev, Novosti Press Agency

(APN) correspondent.

(Bogachev has been reported as connected with

Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU). The Novosti C

Press Agency was newly established in Russia

in February, 1961.)

Contact with Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko

Jaffe stated he attended the Hungarian Independence

Day reception. He arrived late and spent considerable time

talking to Captain Vladimir Nikiforovich Vashchenko; Naval

Attache assigned to the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.

Vashchenko indicated he did not think the dispute between

Russia and China will mean anything. He does not see any real

trouble now between the two countries. According to Jaffe,

Vashchenko did not "spout" the "Soviet line." Jaffe said this

was the first time he was.able to get a Soviet military man

to talk to him for any length of time.

(Vashchenko has been reported as connected

with Gru.)

Interview. April 22, 1969

On April 22, 1969, Jaffe telephonically furnished

the following information to an Agent of the ErO, FBI.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy

Jaife said he recently visited New York City in connection

with his interest in interviewing a Chinese professor at McGill

Univetsity in Canada and had a long conversation with Vladimir

Fedorovich Petrovskiy and his wife, Mira Mikhailovna Petrovskaya.

He also had contact with a Soviet named Loginov who used to be

with the Press Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministzy in Moscow.

(Petrovskiy has been identified as connected

with KGB.)

Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedoy

Jaffe also stated he was invited up to the Hungarian

Embassy" and while there he asked a Soviet Press Officer, "There

is Sedov? He said, 'He doesn't work for me. He is in the

Information Department.'" Jaffe continued: "They (Soviets)

just say he isn't in. He has been in New York."

Contact with new. Tass News Agency Conespondent

Jaffe also indicated he recently met a newly arrived

"Tass" correspondent whom he described as "sort of Ivy League,"

and his wife, whom he described as a "very attractive blond

girl who remembered me from Moscow." Jaffe initially did not

remember her but later recalled she was a translator for Reuters

News Agency in Moscow and later worked for a Swedish correspondent

in Moscow who is a friend of Jaffe.. Jaffe remarked this couple

has only been in the United States about a month.

Interview. April 29, 1969

On April 29, 1969, Jaffe telephoned an agent of the

WFO, FBI and on the same date voluntarily appeared at the WrO

for

interview.

Farevell Party for Vladimir Ivanovich Bogachev

Jaffe advised he attended a farevell party for Bogachev

at the Aviation Club. According to Jaffe, Bogachev appeared to be

"very cold" and "a little stiff"' in his contact with Jaffe. Jaffel

asked him what he intended to do and he replied: "I might go back

to 'Tass.'" Jaffe indicated the Soviets gave Bogachev an

"atmosphere weather gauge" as a farewell gift.

Attempt to Contact Boris Nikolayevich Sedov

Jaffe said Sedov has not yet returned his calls. Jaffe

again indicated he met a Soviet Press Officer at a Hungarian

reception (later he said he met him at the Aviation Club party)

who told him Sedov was not in his department but was connected

with the Soviet Information Department at the Soviet Embassy. The

Press Officer indicated Sedov had been in New York but was now

back in Washington, D.C. The Press Officer told Jaile he would

tell sedov to get in touch with Jatte. According to Jaile, the

Press Officer, whose name he cannot recall, displayed great

interest in Jaffe and "practically begged"

Jaffe to invite him

to his home. The Soviet stated: "You haven't forgotten? You said

you would have me over. You are a great fellow. You will have me

over?" Jaffe said he replied in the affirmative. According to

ng th was

Jaffe, the Soviet "made very sure I knew he was Jewish, which was

very obvious." Jaffe associates the Soviet's name with the Russian

word for "potato."

Boris Valentinovich Yarochevskiy, "Tass" Correspondent,

and his wife, Inna Grigoryevna Yarochevskaya

Jaffe said he attended a Hungarian reception April 17,

1969 which also was attended by several Soviet journalists. The

Soviets spent considerable time during the reception, which was

held just after the United States "spy" plane was shot down by

the North Koreans, in conversation with Bob McCloskey of the

United States Department of State.

Jaffe continued: "I met this young guy - the nevest'

arrival from 'Tass' - Boris. (last name unknown) (LNU) and Inna

(his wife)." Jaffe described Boris as "very, very Ivy League"

and "quite bright." Inna, who looked familiar to Jaffe, came.

over-to Jaffe and stated: "Sam, how are you? You don't remember

me? No? You are still a legend in Moscow. There is still talk

about you." Inna then indicated that she

was one of the translators

for Reuters News Agency in Moscow, working for John Miller. Her

last job was translator for Lares Bruger (phonetic), a Swedish

newspaper correspondent in Moscow and a friend of Jaffe.

Jaffe stated Boris apparently studied at McGill University

in Canada and Inna apparently joined her husband in Canada just

prior to his assignment in Washington, D.C. Inna indicated she and

Boris have only been in Washington, D.C. about one or one and one-half

months.

Jaffe said Inna "is more outgoing than the others

(Soviets)." Both Boris and. Inna speak good English. Jaffe

indicated

that Boris was going to the Foreign Language Institute

in Moscow while Inna was

working for Reuters News Agency. He

said John Miller, Inna's boss, knew Boris. Jaffe stated

Boris

followed up his studies at the Foreign Language Institute by

attending McGill University. He said Inna flew from Moscow to

meet Boris in Canada and they then flew to the United States.

Jaffe said Boris, while studying at Mctill University,

Jaffe said he learned from Inna that Yuri Nikolaevich

is now divorced.

Contact with Vladimir Fedorovich Petrovskiy and

(first name unknown) (FNU) Loginov (Possibly

SAMUEL ADASON JAFTE

Jaffe said he mentioned to Petrovskiy that Inna had

told him Yuri Vinogradov is now divorced. Although Petrovsiiy

did not acknowledge that he was aware of this, he stated he

was not surprised since he knew he had separated from his wife.

Yuri Vinogradov is now in the "Wold Organization Department"

of the Soviet Foreign Ministry as "an assistant to an assistant."

Jaffe got the impression that Vinogradov's job is not important.:

Petrovskiy mentioned that Viktor Mikhailovich Sukhodrev

and his wife also are now divorced; Jaffe said she had been in

"show business." Jaffe continuéd: "Viktor decided he wanted a

diplomatic career. He is working in the Foreign Ministry, but

whenever they need a translator, they grab him." Petrovskiy

indicated Sukhodrev is not happy with his new job because he

likes to travel and "be a big shot." While working at the

Foreign Ministry, Sukhodrev occasionally is used as an

interpreter in important cases.

Petrovskiy indicated that Vladimir Pavlovich Suslov

is now "what you would call policy planner for United States

affairs. at the Foreign Ministry. He has the title of Ambassador.

He has

a very important job now."

(SusIov has been identified by WF T-2, a former

KGB officer whose bona fides has not been

established but who has furnished reliable

information in the past, as a Soviet diplomat

who is an operative contact of KGb.)

Jaffe said he learned from Petrovskiy that Yuri

Nikolaevich Chernyakov, Press Officer, Soviet Imbassy, Washington,

D.C., might be recalled. He also learned that Mikhail Nikolaevich

Smirnovskiy, who used to be Chief of the American Department of

the Soviet Foreign Ministry "is 11l" and has been replaced as

Ambassador to England. Jaffe got the impression it was a

"political illness."

Jaffe said Mira Petrovskaya is now working for the

Aeroflot Section of Intourist in New York because "she decided

she would keep herself busy."

SAMUEL ADASON JAFFE

Jaffe continued: "Petrovskiy was concerned because

'The Washington Post' is on a deliberate kick to defame him."

Jaffe indicated Petrovskiy has been accused of being responsible

for the Soviet Union using the United Nations (UN) for its own

advantage. Jaffe stated: "He (Petrovskiy) admits he made a

mistake. He thought because it was made public and was given to

a group, he was able to publish it, and

this has caused

embarrassment for the UN." Petrovskiy told Jaffe that "Robert

Esterbrook has had two articles sort of attacking me. I admit

I made a mistake. I was wrong. I told the Secretary General

(of the UN) this. I didn't know. you had a group through which

I dad to .

this should be cleared. Why should this man continue to attack

me? Iwo articles in "The Washington Post' and one in the 'Los

Angeles Times.'" Jaffe said Petrovskiy indicated the Secretary

General of the UN was upset over the incident and Petrovskiy

wonders if he should try to "pull the book back" (from publication),

if it is still possible to do so.

Jaffe advised that the next day he visited the UN and

talked to Petrovskiy and, (INU)"loginov,

who is (Soviet) Press

Officer here (Washington;D.Co).and used to be Press Officer in

Moscow. We had a conversation. He said he would be in Washington

this week and would look me up. Loginov started to discuss the

Chinese. I said I would like to go there. He said he had been in

China and speaks Mandarin. He said he was very skeptical about one

point in (United States President) Nixon's press conference, why

he brought up Czechoslovakia in the press conference. 'Do you

(Jaffe) think it was a slam at

us (Soviets)?' He seemed to read

a lot of stuff into it."

(Vadim Petrovich loginov was in the United States

October 27,1959-November 25,1959 as a group leader

and member

of a Soviet delegation of students. He

was again in the United States September 4, 1967-

November 29,1967 as a temporary trainee at the

Soviet Embassy. He returned to the United States

February 12,1968 as First Secretary, Political

Division, Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C.)

Identification of Soviet Nationals Employed in the

Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, Moscow

Jaffe was shown photographs of several Soviet nationals

and he identified Leonid Mitrofanovich Zamyatin, Boris Dmitrievich

Pyadyshev, and Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko as employees of the

Press Department, Soviet Foreign Ministry, with whom he had

contact while in Moscow. He was shown a photograph of Fedor

Yakovlevich Semenov, but he did not recognize this individual

and stated he was not identical with the Fedor Semenov he knew

in Moscow as the Number Three Man in the Press Department of

the Soviet Foreign Ministry.

Jaffe was asked if he observed any indication that

any of these individuals were connected with Soviet Intelligence.

Jaffe replied in the negative; however, he stated Boris Fyadyshev

"'is a very strange guy. A young man. Vladimir (Petrovskiy) told

me he had risen to Number Iwo man (in the Press Department)."

"affe recalled that on one occasion when he was accompanying-

N. K. Khrushchev on a trip, he invited Zamyatin to have a drink.

Although Zanyatin ordinarily did not drink with Jaffe, he

accepted his invitation on this occasion. Zamyatin indicated

he was very; tired of his position in the iress Department and

planned to

retire and write under a pseudonym. According to.

Jaffe, Mira Petrovskaya said she went to school with Pyadyshev.

Jaffe said he found Pyadyshev to be a very bright, but very cold

individual. Jaffe stated: "I have always felt that Mira

Petrovskaya was connected with KGB;" however, she has never made

any intelligence approach to Jaffe.

Jaffe then mentioned a Soviet national named Yuri

Bekov (phonetic) and stated: "There is no question that he was

KGB. (He was connected with) Press Department. He could do more

things. than the Press Department, but he was supposed: to be an

arm of the Press Department on trips. He knew all the overt

KGB men."

(Fedor Stepanovich Fedorenko has been reported

as connected with the Soviet Committee of

Information.)

Jaffe indicated he did not recognize the names of

any of these individuals except Vadim Biryukov, Yuriy Fedorov,

and Mikhail Sagatelyan. He remarked that many of these individuals

have rather common Russian names. He made the following additional

remarks concerning individuals depicted in these photographs.

He said he is sure he met Ivgeniy Gromakovskiy; hovever,

this name is

not familiar to him and he may have known him as

Granovskiy. He continued: "I think I knew him, possibly at 'Tass.

I don't think (I knew him) in Moscow." Jaffe stated he did not

have close contact with this individual.

In régard to Vadim Biryukov, Jaffe stated: "I alvays

thought that Vadim might have been with KGB. He got 'Life' into

fantastic places. Then he worked for'APN Novosti.' Now I under

stand he is no longer with 'APN.' He was really close to id

Stevens."

In regard to Vyacheslav Kevorkov aka Chitashvili,

Jaffe indicated he definitely knew this individual, but not

under the name Kevorkov. He may have known him as Chitashvili,

and recalled he was using the "cover of the secretary of the

Union of Journalists."

In commenting on Yuriy Fedorov, Jaffe described him

as "an evil S.O.B. Apparently an expert on. China. 'Slava'

(Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich Kuskov aka Mislyuk, Kiselov, Kislov)

said Fedorov is very upset with you (Jaffe), feels you don't

•like him. You never have him up to your home. You have othei

journalists (there).' I said I didn't like him. He said 'you

should see him.' I just didn't. He just dropped out of sight."

Jaffe indicated he recognized the individual depicted

in the photograph of Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev as an individual

with whom he had contact; however, this name is not familiar to

him. He then stated he recalled an individual named Timofeyev

(phonetic) who accompanied Khrushchev on a trip to the United

States. Jaffe referred to this individual as a "mystery man"

who was very close to Khrushchev. Jaffe indicated that this.

Timofeyev was not the individual depicted in the photograph of

Viktor Dmitriyevich Timofeyev.

of Timur Timofeevich Timofeev as a correspondent

who "at one time stood very high in Soviet hierarchy'

and "came here on Khrushchev trip." Jaffe was told

"he stood very high with Khrushchev. and then some-

thing happened.")

Jaffe was questioned specifically about Yevgeniy

Nikolayevich Aleshin. He stated the name is not familiar to

him but he recognizes the face and possibly he met him in the

United States rather than in Moscow. He said he cannot recall

that Aleshin gave any indication he was connected with KGB.

Jaife again identified Vyacheslav Aleksandrovich

Kuskov as the Soviet national connected with KGB known to him

first as "Slava" and later as Vyacheslav Kiselov. He did not

associate the name Kuskov with "Slava"

Jaffe was questioned concerning previous comments he

made that photographs of Nikolay Aleksandrovich Gavrilenko

resemble "Slava's" KGB superior. Jaffe stated: "I can't say it

(photographs of Gavrilenko) was 'Slava!s' boss. He was less Russian

looking. I definitely have seen this guy (Gavrilenko) but the

name doesn't ring a bell."

When shown a photograph of Viktor Nikolaevich Titov,

Jaffe comnented: "This could be 'Slava's' boss." Jaffe said

"Slava's" boss was a "fellow like this. (Titov), younger than

!Slava.'

. (I was) never introduced by name. All he ('Slava') said

was, 'this is my boss.' He ('Slava's' boss) said he can speak a

little English. 'Slava' said, 'Better let me translate.' All we

did was go over the accident report. At the end he said, 'I an

avare of the case.' Then they spoke in Russian. (Slava'

asked)

'What do you think now that you have met Sam?' (The other Soviet

replied) 'I would think there isn't anything to worry about.'"

"Slava" then indicated to Jaffe that if his boss said there was

nothing to worry about, Jaffe could forget about the incident.

Later "Slava" tore the

accident report up in Jaffe's presence.

United States Correspondents Currently in Moscow

Jaffe stated he recently received a letter requesting

his advice from Irving Chapman ho has been the American Broad-

casting Company (ABC) correspondent in Moscow for only about

three months. Jaffe said Ken Bernstein, who has been the National

Broadcasting Company (NBC) correspondent in Moscow for three

years, got an exclusive concerning the Chinese-Soviet border

clash. Jaffe stated: "The pressure is on 'Irv' (Irving Chapman),"

who has been told, "if you can't do the job, you might as well"

get out. "

In his letter, Chapman said, "I don't know how he

got the film. I guess he got it through APN Novosti." Chapman

reached the conclusion NBC apparently obtained the exclusive

through Viktor louis. Chapman stated: "I don't know how much

NBC gives him, but he is riding

around in a Porsche (automobile)."

Jaffe then stated: "'Slava' was interesting, a Stalinist. Louis

is a capitalist. I had very little to do with him. I was at his

apartment once and I heard about his house." Jaffe indicated that

because of his wife's curiosity, he and his wife visited the

house

of Viktor louis, which he described as very "plush."

Jaffe said Chapman "asked me for my contacts and

how he can defeat NBC." Chapman's letter stated: "I met many

of your friends. They send best regards and inquire about you."

Chapman mentioned three individuals, Vetler Prog (phonetic),

who is connected with the State Committee on Radio and Television

of the Soviet Foreign Ministry; Mikhail Bruk, and Viktor Louis.

The letter stated: "They all indicate there has been no corres

pondent with ABC (in Russia) since Sam Jaffe left. They don't

think much of Watkins. (Jaffe's successor as ABC correspondent

in Russia." According to Jaffe, Chapman's letter indicated that

Jaffe's Soviet contacts suggested that "if Jaffe was there he

would have such an exclusive." Chapman asked: "Can you help me

out and tell me what you can do with Louis?" Chapman's letter

concluded: "If a KGB agent like Viktor Louis is good enough for

S. Jaife, he certainly is good enough for I. Chapman."

Jaffe said his advice to Chapman was: "Play one against

the other, as well as with Viktor louis, through the Imbassy."

Jaffe explained that he advised Chapman to clear all his contacts

through the American Embassy, Moscow.

Jaffe indicated he was surprised when he learned

recently that Viktor Louis had travelled to Taiwan and had

written an article praising the Taiwan government.

Jaffe concluded: "Ken Bernstein should get out of

there (Russia). He is a bachelor. I know he is shacking with

Russian girls.

I saw him in Hong Kong and asked, 'Are you going

back. ' He said he doesn't know exactly what he will do. (He

said) 'I am going back for a while.'"

Moscow Journalists Suspected by Jaffe of Being

Connected With KGB

Jaffe was asked if he considered Edmund Stevens to

be connected with KGB. He replied: "How can you stay in that

country that long and get the things that he got without having

some connection with KGB? How can he have this beautiful house?

Then, when it is torn down (because of a roadbuilding project),

he winds up in an ex-embassy!" In commenting on the Soviet wife

of Stevens, Jaffe stated, "She is wetrd. How does she get soviet

art out of the country?"

Jaffe stated Stevens appears to have

dropped out of the newspaper field. Jaffe said he was once a

syndicated wiiter, but "not any more. He had a deal in caviar

and vodka, selling vodka and caviar to the Kremlin." Jaffe

described his daughter, Anastasia, as a "nut" and said he understands

she is now married.

Jaffe emphatically expressed the opinion that Stevens,

Viktor Louis and Henry Shapiro are connected with KGB. He described

Shapiro as "an evil little man," "more Russian than the Russians."

Jaffe stated: "He should get out and teach. He is no writer."

In discussing Viktor Louis, Jaffe stated he "never

had any doubts that he (Louis) was with KGB." In discussing

Louis, Jaffe indicated that all important "exclusives" in Moscow

pertained to security matters and not to "leaks" from the Soviet

Pose it one to testers herefore, icated

that Louis was the recipient of many such "exclusives." Jaffe

also indicated that louis appears to live far better than other

correspondents from foreign countries and is permitted to

travel extensively abroad, including countries such as the

United States and Taiwan. Jaffe indicated that these factors

convince him that Louis is connected with KGB.

Jaffe concluded: "That is what they (KGB) do. They set

this man up. If you want information," then contact a man such

as Viktor Louis.

Jaffe's Future Plans

Jaffe stated: "I like to keep contact with these people

(Soviet and Chinese nationals) because it will pay off in the

long run." Jaffe indicated he expects to attend the May Day

celebration at the Soviet Embassy, Washington, D.C. He also indicated

he was still actively trying to obtain an assignment as a newspaper

correspondent in Mainland China but has done nothing more concerning

his desire to obtain a similar assignment in Cuba.

In discussing his desire to go to Mainland China, Jaffe

indicated that he had interviewed Chou En Lai in 1955 and was one

of 18 foreign correspondents selected to visit China in 1956. In

the Fall of 1965 he went from Moscow to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Fol-

newsmen in Belgrade his desire to obtain a nevspapet assignment li

Mainland China. While in Hong Kong he made the same desire known

to Szeto Kung of the Chinese News Agency. Finally, on April 28,

1969 he indicated to a Chinese professor at McGill University in

Canada his desire to obtain a newspaper assignment in China and the

professor agreed to forward a letter from Jaffe indicating

his desire to visit Mainland China,. The Chinese professor has

suggested that Jaffe mention in the letter that he desires to

visit China as a private citizen rather than as a newspaper

correspondent; however, Jaffe should be completely honest in

the letter, mentioning the facts that he has been a journalist

that he interviewed Chou In Lai in 1955, and that when

visiting China as a private citizen, he would like to continue

his writing career.

As indicated in sewrOlet 2/28/69 requesting Bureau

authority fos interview of subject, approved by Bulet 3/12/69,

JAFFE was invited to ITO and showed no reluctance to do so.

Since he was on general assignment, he called his office at :

the beginning of

each of the first two interviews to give the.

telephone number at which he could be located.. He was contacted

by his office during the first interview. On the third interview,

he had what he called a "Bellboy" signalling device which he

said would receive a signal from his office after which he

would call. He indicated he used this device to avoid the

office giving out the FBI telephone numbes to anyone, including

Russians, who might call him.

JArik save the appearance of being a very aggressive, l

fast-talking, smooth operatos. Prior to each interview, he had

been drinking, but was not intoxicated.

The first two interviews were handled as planned, by

asking him to recount his experiences and contacts with Russians

in the USS? and Hong Kong, including his experiences with "slava".

He expressed no hesitancy in talking about his contrats but

constantly spoke in generalities, tending to "playdon" his

relations with "Slava"

'. He furnished more detail after specific

or leading

piestions were out to him. For example, the disclosures

he made to

were confirmed in interview only after leading

questions.

During the interview on 3/27/69, JAFFE was advised

that intervieving agents were concerned regarding a number of

aspects of his relationship with the soviets and the fBl. Yor

example, it was noted he had now disclosed considerable additional

information about his relationship vith "Slava", more than

previously; that because of his past relationship with Agents

of the NYO, the I'BI had a right to expect that he would make

imnediate full disclosures of such relationship and his failure

to do so raised questions about the relationship, whether he

has been recontacted by KGB since he left Russia, etc. It also

was pointed out that his expulsion from Russia after he had

been ordered to Ilong Kong and his replacement named, seemed -

somewhat suspicious, particularly since he had been warned that

a defector knew of his relationship with "Slava"; that this

defector had in fact reported this relationship and alleged

that he had

been an agent of and furnished information to "Slava".

He was urged to now furnish complete information regarding his

relationship with the KGB and to "square the record" with the

FBI.

JAFFE did not lose his composure at any time during

the interviews, but, as indicated in the IM, when pressed on

3/27/69 on his relationship with KGB and his failure to make

complete disclosure to FBI, he offered the lame excuse, his

fear of "Slava"

, but conceded this was a poor excuse for not

reporting the relationship after his return to the United States.

JAFFE was emphatically told that the

FBI had not had

any contact with the

American Broadcast Company (ABC) with

regard to him and had-not in any way labelled him as a security.

risk to any other person oragency. He replied that someone

C

had done so and indicated he was aware that some ABC officials

are very close to CIA.'

JAFFE seemed very concerned that. ABC did not give

him the diplomatic "beat" or the State Department "beat" which

he seemed to consider his right. It appears he will continue

contacts with the Soviet Bloc people as a means of trying to

get such assignments. To preclude his use of cooperation with

the FBI as a means to this end, he vas very emphatically tola

that the decision for such continued contacis was strictly his

decision and the FBl would not ast him to do so.

It also is apparent that JAIFE is intensely interested

in getting an assignment to China or Cuba. He denied that he

had any KCB instructions to do so, but this, of course, is a

definite possibility."It is not possible to accurately

assess

this possibility at this time, and it also is not possible to

conclude whether he is or is not still in contact with KGB

and acting as an agent. He emphatically denied any intelligence

contact since he left Moscow; however, the call which he said

he received: from BORIS SEDOV desiring to show him a photograph

seems unusual and is possibly contrived.

II. Jaffe's Contacts with FBI While Assigned to Moscow

Jaffe furnished the following information to

agents of the New York Office of the FBI on january 1, 1963.

-Jaffe stated he was acquainted with ruri

Vladimirovich Fedorov while in Moscow.

Jaffe said Fedoroy

was with the Novosti Press Agency in Moscow.

While

Jaffe was in Moscow, in 1962, he became

acquainted with a number of Soviet citizens both male and

female.

He said that he was dating one Soviet female by the

name of Galina in the Fall of 1962. He became acquainted

with her through other Soviet females with whom he was ac

quainted; however, he was unable to furnish her last name.

Galina told Jafie that she had been dating foreigners in the

past and, because of this, had been called into KGB Headquarters

and

warned against continuing her association with foreigners.

During the Cuban crisis, in the Fall of 1962,

Fedorov told Jaffe confidentially that there was a 'bitter

dispute among the Soviet hierarchy in the kremiin concerning

the

manner in which the soviets should deal with the Cuban

crisis.

Fedorov told Jaffe that Soviet Premier Nikita

Khrushchev was able to muster enough support for his position

and

eventually won out over those in the Soviet hierarchy who

proposed a tough uncompromising attitude.

H1111

Jaffe advised that he used the information furnished

to him by Yuri V.XFedoroy concerning the dispute in the Kremlin

over the Cuban crisis in a broadcast over the ABC network.

Jaffe recalled that the aforementioned information

came to him from Fedorov on a Friday late in October, 1952.

the following day, a Saturday, Jaffe attended a social function

at the home of Stanley -Weyman, Life

Magazine correspondent in

Moscow. He brought his friend, Galina, with him and remained

at Weyman's house until some time after midnight.

When he de

parted from Heyman's house, he took Galina and a

Soviet male

with him.

The soviet male, whose name he could not remenber,

was

also a guest at Weyman's house and Jaffe offered to drive

him home.

This Soviet male was associated with the Ministry

of Foreign Affairs, according to Jaffe.

After Jaffe dropped the Soviet male at his

home, he proceeded to drive toward Galina's home. At

Galina's instruction, he made a turn in, an area of Moscow

which was unfamiliar to him.

After making this turn he

hit & deep bole and blew out several tires on the Chevrolet

automobile which he was driving.

Jaffe said that he sent

Galina to obtain police assistance and, after she leit, he

noticed four male individuals driving by in an old Pobeda

automobile.

Shortly thereafter several truck drivers came

by and assisted Jaife. Fortunately, he had several spare

tires in his automobile. At about 3:15 a.m., the police came

by but showed no interest in Jaffe and apparently made no

report of his situation.

Jaffe then returned to his apart

nent.

Some time aiter Jaife returned to his apartment,

he received a telephone call from Galina.

Galina told Jaffe

that she nad to see him immediately.

She said that she was

near the American Embassy in Moscow

and Jaffe arranged to

meet her in the vicinity of the Ukraine Hotel in Moscow. -:

When Jaffe met Galina he found that she had

\apparently been physically abused as she bore scars and

marks on her arms and face.

Galina told Jaffe that after

she left him she went to telephone for assistance. As she

was leaving the telephone from which she made the call to

, the

police, she was accosted by two men.

She immediately resisted

efforts of these men to detain her and as she ran from them

she was accosted by another man who knocked her to the ground.

where she was questioned at length about her association with

Jaffe..

The individuals questioning her wanted to know how long

she had been seeing Jaffe, where she bad been with Jaffe and

they were particularly interested in her travels with Jaffe

during the last several days. They wanted to knor if Jaffe

was in love with her.

Galina told Jaffe that they wanted her to sigr

a statement to the effect that she would not see Jaffe again.

These individuals also wanted to know what, if anything, Jaffe

had given her by way of gifts.

Galina told Jaffe that at approximately 6:00 a.Mi.

another individual came in and questioned her about: the same

matters but did so in a very polite and refined manner. This

was in contrast to the manner in which she had been questioned

Immediately subsequent to her arrival at the police station.

Galina told Jaffe that she as quite upset and a doctor was also

called to administer a sedative to her.

Before being released by the police, Galina

tola by the police not to see Jaffe again.

She said that

they told her that Jaffe's name and her name would appear

in "Izvestia".

Aîter hearing Galina's story, Jaffe called

Fedorov and relayed the story of Galina's experiences to

Fedorov.

Fedorov told Jaife that he would be right over to

see him.

•According to Jaffe, Fedorov immediately came

to see him at his apartment. Upon his arrival redorov acted

as though he were shocked by the whole story which Jaffe

told to him.

Fedorov told Jaffe that this was a very serious

matter and that an article was then being written concerning

Jaffe's association with Galina.. He said that Jaife would be

depicted as an American who had led a Soviet female astray.

This would serve as a isson to Soviet citizens, particularly

females, to refrain fron associating with American citizens.

Fedorov also told Jaffe that this article would appear in

"Komsomolskaya Pravda", Fedorov

said that he did not know

what he could possibly do for valie but suggested that a irieno

of his, who is a Deputy Editor with

"Komsomolskaya

•Pravda",

might be able to help.

Fedorov suggested that there might

still

be time to stop the story. In

Jaffe's presence Fedorov made a

telephone call allegealy to his

friend the Deputy Editor: After

the call was made Fedorov toid

Jaffe that it would be okay for

them to see his friend at 6:00 p.m. that night.

Jaffe met Fedoroy at a restaurant in Moscow at

6:00

pol. that evening in accordance with arrangements previously

made. Fedorov's friend, the Deputy Editor, was to meet them

there but prior to Fedorov's friend's arrival, Fedorov told

6

Jaffe that his friend was not actually Daputy Editor of "Komsomol~

skaya Pravda". He told Jaffe that his friend was an old war

buddy who just happened to be in the KGB.

Kerra

When Fedorov's-friend arrived he was introduced

to Jafie as Vyacheslav Kislov Jaffe came

to know this individual

as "Slava". "Kislov said to Jaffe "I guess you know who

I am"

He then went on to tell Jaffe that he was with the KGB.

He said

that he and his colleagues were not too pleased with Jaffe's coi-

duct. He asked Jaife who his source in the Kremlin was and then

a dispute in the Kremlin came from someone in the American

Embassy in hoscow. Jaiie denied that his source was in

the Anerican Embassy in Moscow but refused to tell Kislov

the identity of his source.

Kislúv then proceeded to give Jaffe a

He then

that he would see what he could do, expressing the opinion that

he could probably kill the story.

Before Jaffe left Kislov's

company, Kislov said that he would. Tike to see Jaife again and

Jaffe agreed to see him although no definite arrangements vere

made.

. On the following morning Kislov called Jaife and

told Jaffe that he had succeeded in killing the story. He

asked Jaffe to have lunch with him and a date was made.

lunch Kislov told Jaife that he had been in the United

At

States.

He then told Jaffe that it was necessary to watch Western corr

respondents in Moscow as the Soviets know that American citizens

pay a great deal of attention to material written in newspapers.

He said it was necessary for the soviets to be careful what they

permit Western correspondents to write and say.

He said the

Soviets would like to know Western reaction to Soviet moves par-

•ticularly Soviet moves in situations like the Cuban crisis.

Kislov then went on to tell Jaffe that he was lucky

to be in Moscow and itwas only because of his superiors that he

was granted a visa.

He told Jaffe that Jaffe killed his chances

for obtaining a Soviet visa of his own accord because.of.his

conduct during the trial of Francis Gary Powers on

espionage

charges in Moscow in 1960.

At this time Kislor said that the •

Soviets concluded that Jaife was employed by the Central Intel-

ligence Agency (CIA) and had been assigned to keep track of

Powers' wife, Barbara, since he spent so much time in ber company.

late in 1961, he was kept under surveillance for four solid

weeks.

Kistov called this to jaife's attention and told Jaffe

that he had aggravated some Soviets who were surveilling him

because of his activities. Kislov then went on to discuss

the fact that the Soviets

had exposed seveil United States

Embassy officials as intelligence agents recently. Kislov

told Jaffe that these were strictly retaliatory measures taken

by the Soviets because of Soviet nationals associated with

the United Nations who had been exposed in the United States.

Kislov also asked Jaffe to bring him a miniphone

recording machine from the United states.

Jaile said that during hisstay in Moscow he has

never experienced anything which would indicate that the

Soviets were attempting to compromise him with the exception

of the one incident related herein.

Jaife made one observation stemming from his visit

In Moscow to the effect that the younger generation Soviet_

Soviet people in the past.

Jaffe said

he is not favorably impressed with

"This man spotted me" and he was

required to take a sobriety test. Jaffe stated he passed

the test although there was a trace of alcohol in his system.

to the police station and "they said it as decided to press

charges."

Jaffe said he reported the matter to the

American Embassy and

received

a conflicting advice.

"Some

serious trouble.

"Others said scream like hell

because they

have never convicied an American correspondent." Jaîfe

decided "to take the dovish" position.

Jaife continued: "At this point 'Slava! found

out about it.

He came to see me and

said it was very, very

serious." A little later, Jaffe and his wife had prepared to

leave on vacation bus at the last minute he was told ha could

not obtain an exit visa until the automobile accident had been

cleared up.

Jaife then got a call from "Slava" who "Said he

"Slava's" boss, who spoke very good English, asking Jafie his

thoughts about

the Soviot

Toward the end of the meetings

"Slava" mentioned Jaffe's

autonobile accident problem, and asked

"what do you think we can do about it?"

Then the two

Soviets

conversed in Russian, alter which Jaife was told "don't worry."

Lateis at the advice of Kameney, Jaffe's translator,

Jaffe visited the injured Soviet at a hospital, and "brought

him some booze,"

Jaife continued:

"They found

out about this

and the police were furious," insinuating that Jaffe was trying

to influence the victim. A

month passed, and still Jaffe did

not receive an exit visa,

"Slava" called and requested a

meeting.

"Slava" showed Jaffe

& piece of paper concerning the police charges,

and tore it up

in Jaffe's presence.

Jaffe asked "Slava" what

"Slava" wanted

from him and "Slava" replied:

"Forget about it.

The case is

make a financial

settlement." Thereafter,

Jaffe met the victim's wife, paid her 100 or 200 rubles, and

she signed a statement releasing Jaffe from all other claims.

Expulsion of Jaffe from Soviet Union

"exclusive" from "Slava" concerning the khrushcher ouster,

he continued to meet with "Slava" "on and off" until

Jaile was expelled from the Soviet Union in October,

1965.

In explaining the expulsion, jaffe said thai without

advising him, John Scali of the American Broadcasting

Company (ABC) wrote a story which Jaffe thinks was a "trial

baloon", intimating that Leonid Brezhnev and Aleksei Kosygin

were about to be ousted. Jaffe got a call from ABC in New

York asking what he thought about Scali's story.

Jaffe stated

he did not believe the story was true and he asked "Slava" for

his opinion.

"Slava" indicated that although he would like

to see it happen,

he did not believe it would occur "because

they were too new" as Soviet Heads of State.

Jaffe continued:

"The next morning,. Henry"Shapiro called me, asking why I had

written such a story."

had been written by John Scali.

"Did you ever think

It could be John Scali's story?"

Later Jafe was called into the Soviet Foreign

Office and told he had to leave the Soviet Union in ten days

and that the ABC office in Moscow was being closed.

Jaffe

said he inquired:

"Are you holding this (story) against me?"

Jaffe was told that

the Soviets were not, and

that "we know

exactly what you said about us for four years." Jaffe indicated

this was the first indication he had that the Soviets had tech

nical coverage on him.

Jaffe said he did not

want to leave the

Soviet Union under these conditions. He said the Soviets told

him,

"We are not holding this against you but it has to be."

Jaffe was told not to worry about the deadline for his departure

and that he could get additional time. Jaffe also was told he

would be

let me use your John. The next thing I knew she had the

bathroom door locked. When I got the door open, she was

undressed. I got her dressed and sat up with her all night."

SAMUEL ADASON JAIFE

Jaite later indicated that "Slava" warned

him of the defector shortly after Jaife read the story

in the press that a Soviet national disappeared in Switzer

land. Jaffe continued:

"He (Slava') was actually concerned

because the man had a

lot of valuable information. He said

he worked with

'Slava' for a while and then he was in another

department- higher position. He knew him ('Slava') personal-

And he said he couldn't understand why the man would do

anything like defecting.

He said, 'Don't say anything about

knowing me to anyone.'

He was very, very worried." Jaffe

said he learned at about the time he was leaving Russia that

"Slava" was "being demoted and was going into another area.

He wasn't happy.

I think he felt he had more to offer."

When again requested to relate the circumstances

of his introduction

to "Slava", Jalfe stated he was dating a

Soviet girl. He said he did not believe the Soviets have any

compromising photographs of their activities; however, the

girl told him she had been called up before the review board

of the factory where she worked and embarrassed because of her

association with an American.

She told Jaffe, that the whole

story would appear in "Izvestia" or some other Soviet news.

Jaffe indicated

Fedorov got "very melodramatic."

He continued:

"I was scared of the automobile accident (in which he hit a

Pedestrian). But I wasn't scared about this."

Jaffe then

related again that Fedorov introduced "Slava"

to him as an

individual who could keep his name out of the newspapers.

It was pointed out to Jaffe that he first men-

tioned "Slava" to the FBI in January, 1963, and he was asked

if he could recall the information he furnished

at that time

regarding attendance at a party and flat tires. He then re

lated that he had attended a party with a girl friend and had

a few drinks. At about 1:00 a.m., he wasdriving

"The next time I saw her, she said she would be called up by

In ansver to a specific question, jaffe stated:

"I think my expulsion (fron Russia) came as much as a surprise

to him ('Slava') as to me. I didn't see him after the expulsion

_order came in. "

Jaffe again stated:

"' Slava' knew I was

to leave Noscow for Hong Kong when the expulsion order came

Activities on Behalf of Naval Intelligence

Jaffe stated that on one occasion he attemptes

to perform a task for Naval Iniclligence.

Fle received per

mission to travel in the North Sea aboard a Soviet Ice

Breaker "Lenin" and prior to starting this assignment, he

was brieted by Naval Attaches at the American Embassy,

Moscow,

on their interests including any observations he might make

of Soviet atomic submarines. Accompanying Jaife on the trip

was Dieter. Steiner, another foreign correspondent in Moscow.

Jaffe did not observe any atonic submarines and every tine the

ship neared a Soviet naval base, the guests were lold the

Captain desired to brief them below deck in his cabin.

the time the briefings were over, the ship had passed the

6

naval bases.

On one occasion, Jaffe, while en route to the

Captain's cabin, realized he had left his photographic equip

ment on deck. He returned to get it and was approached by

Soviet

Naval Officers who reminded hin he was expected to be

receiving a briefing in the Captain's cabin; however, he vas

not reprimanded and was treated well throughout the

cruise.

While in Riga, Jaffe and Steiner observed a

group of buoys in a large channel which were spaced uniform

distances apart.

Jaffe and Dieter finally relized that by

photographing these buoys, the size of various Soviet ships

passing through the channel could be ascertained, and they

attempted to take photographs, but wae told this was not

permitied.. They protested and the next morning

the Cultural

Commitice agreed to let them photograph the area.

When they

arrived at the channel they discovered that all the buoys had

been removed. Jaffe said he is convinced the Soviets worked

throughout the night removing the buoys.

Jalfe's Difficulties with AAC and CIA

Jaife indicated he believed his recall by ABC

Iron Hong Kong was caused by or influenced by an agency or

agencies of the United States Government.

He indicated he

was told by a British Intelligence contaci in hong Kong that

he was recalled because he refused to cooperate with CIA in

Hong Kong. Jaife said he recontly nentionod this to a CIA

contact in Washington, D.C, and

Ligence representative " had no right to toll you this."

Jaffe stated he also was told by other contacts that British

Intelligence was investigating him an desired to know as

much as possible about him; however, British Intelligence

had not

initiated the inquiry, but was obtaining the informa

tion for another organization.

Jafie also indicated he was concerned that a

recent publication

had

falsely reported that he was a member

of a left wing organization.

Jaffe then stated:. "I would

like to get this thing cleaned up. I feel that I have been

pulled back hese."

Jatte was advised that the FBi had absolutely

nothing to do with his return to the.

United States fron Hong

Kong and did not have any contact with ABC with regard to him.

He was also told that it is?

difficult to understand way he had

not previously advised

FBI of some of the information con

cerning his activities

in Russia which he has now related.

Jaffe said he felt that he had told the FBi enough but admit

• ted he had

activities in Bussia, icluding the warning by "Slava" concerning

the KGB defector. Re admitted

the FBI had a right to expect

him to do so.

He continued:

"I was afsaid of this guy.

was damn interested and curious - he was an intense man • some.

one who gave me more information than I gave him. I vas afraid

I might meet with an automobile accident."

Jaffe said he did

not tell the FBI "everything because with that

guy - I was

scared. I am not

on their side in any way. There are a lot of

things vrong with it, but I love it (the United States) • I

try to be middle of the road - I have been in Vietnam I am

not a Soviet spy and not a Communist. I was frightened. This

man was a very threatening man.

This man could have killed.

He felt that strong about the old country - Stalin - I think

he was as vicious as Semichastnyy and Shelepin (former Chair~

men of the KGB) - I went up (and talked) to them.

Semichastnyy

said, 'Yes, I know you.

What do you want?'" Jaffe explained

this occured at a reception.

Jaffe stated that "Slava" might have thought

that he (raffe) was

"Slava's" agent.

He continued: "Little

things came out of 'slava', but I never knew exacily what he

did.

I do know I would tell him what i would think,

which is

not a secret." Jaffe, indicated he never told "Slava" or any

other Soviet connected with Soviet Intelligence anything other

than his own observations and opinions and denied furnishing

any intormation trom any Government documents.

He also

emphatically denied that KGb hao made any arrangements for

meeting him after he left Moscow or that thee had been any

such meetings since he left Moscow.

lle said nobody had fol

lowed up "Siava's! contacts with him.

In response to a specific question, Jaite stated

he did not think "Slava" had anything toi do

with his expulsion

from Russia. He continued:

"My guess is John Scali, who is

very close to

continued:

CIA" was responsible for the expulsion.

Jaffe

"John wanted to set me up with CIA.. They (Cla)

would do things in indirect ways."

Jaife then

reiated

an in-

cident in which Scali invited several ABC employees to a

party, including an individual introduced to jaffe as an employee

of. the

Departnent of Commerce, who expressed very much interest

in Jate's assignment to Russia. Jaite later verified that this

individual was connected with

CIA and he feels it would have

been better if the individual had been completely open with him.

• Jaffe then stated:

"I still believe CIA sent me

-to Moscow on the (rrancis Gary) Powers trial.

Prior to the

trial, he was approached by a CIA representative in California

who indicated he was aware Jaffe would be sent to Moscow by

Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS).

Jaffe stated he (Jaffe)

was not aware of it at that time. Jaffe said he subsequently

was told by another CIA representative whom he met while attending

meetings of the Council on Foreign Relations that he had been

picked to go to Moscow with Barbara Powers and help Marvin Kalb,

CBS correspondent,

cover the trial. On the eve oi his departure,

a CIA representative who claimed he was a psychiatrist gave Jaffe

background material on spy trials and said

"they were very much

interested in determining if Powers is brainwashed."

Jaffe

related that Barbara Powers developed a friendship with him

and constantly sought his company and advice and expressed a

strong dislike for CIA personnel accompanying them.

Jaffe, at

the insistance of Mrs. Powers, wrote a letter to the President

of the Soviet Union appealing

for clemency for Powers. Jaffe

continued:

"There was nothing physical between us.

We went

down town (in Moscow) and went to the KGB building (at the

request of irs. Powes, who insisted on seeing the building).

in response to a specific question, Jaile

stated: "'Slava' never said anything about the

trial

except to say they (KGS) thought I was with CIA. Later

he said they knew i was pot."

Jaffe again indicated that he felt some United

States Government agency was responsible for his recall from

Hong Kong and that it had some connection with an "intelligence"

allegation.

He also indicated dislike for his present assign

ment with ABC in

Washington, D.C., Stating that although he

had hoped to cover the "diplomatic beat" or the State Depart

ment, he is merely on general assignment, sitting around

waiting for miscellancous stories to break.

Jaile also stated: "I vas a bit afraid of

'Slava': I was waiting for them (KGB) to contaci me in

Hong Kong. I thought it would have come there."

Jaffe

stated:

also

"You (FRI) have a right, after our relationship" to

inquire about Jaffe's

activities and "I have a right to an

answer in all honesty" concerning the reason for the recall

from Hong Kong.

Jalfe stated that when he returned from Hong

Kong he asked

the head of ABC for an explanation of his re

call and was told he had not produced and had refused to

return to Vietnam. Jafie denied both accusations.

Jaffe then

went to his immediate superior and was told he was recalled

• because of a cable he sent from saigon.

jaffe asked to be

shown the cable, but his request was refused. The discussion

betveen Jaile and his immediate superior became very heated,

with the superior loudly accusing Jaffe of being a liar and

Jaffe suggesting that the superior was mentally ill for

shouting at him and refusing to show him the cable.

Jaffe

stated he had seriously considered leaving ABC; however, during

the last week of March, 1969, he signed another contract with

Jaffe said he is quite

satisfied with the

salary involved,

but dislikes very much being on general assignment.

He again

indicated he is trying to obtain an assignment to

Red China

and also is attempting io obtain an assignment to Cuba.

In explaining his difficulties with ABC in Viet

nam, Jaffe stated thatABC correspondents in Hong Kong are

rotated on assignments to Vietnan and Korea and it was under-

stood that the assignments in Vietnam would never exceed one

month's duration.. While Jaffe was in Vietnam on an assignment,

his

sound man, a Chinese boy, was wounded, and

a brother-in-law of the sound man, "said we had to gei out

Jaffe received a cable from headquarters stating "Tell Jaffe

assignments in Vietnam, and he ultimately received a cable

stating: "Tell Jaîle il he can't do job, quit." jaiie said

Jafie's Attitude Concerning Subsequent

Jaile indicated he was concerned about what

effect subsequent.contacts with Boris Sedov might have on

his career with ABC, particularly if Sedov's contacts might

lead to another KGB approach.

Jaffe was told that he alone

could made a decision concerning his future contacts with

Soviet nationals; that the FBI would not request that he

continue these contacts; but the FBi would be interested in

any information concerning contacts with anyone which Ja!fe

feels represents an attempt by foregu intelligence to cu

ALEKSANDROVICH KUSKOV was working with JAFFE, but &

did not know if JAFFE was considered as an agent or just

an operative contact. He did know that KUSKOY was meeting

JAFFE and obtained information from him.

called also that JAFFE was used by KGB in connection with

trips of two groups of Americans to the USSR, where they

met with Premier KHRUSHCHEV. The Seventh Department of

SCD, which was

working against tourists (of which din

, the Tenth Department, and the First

Department were all planning work against these groups.

KGB desired to operate agents against them to find out

what was said by them after meeting with KHRUSHCHEV. He

recalled that KUSKOV had been requested to utilize JAFFE

in this connection and furnished information which he had

received from JAFFE.

said one group was a group

of businessmen which met with KHRUSHCHEV on 11/6/62 or

possibly 1963, and another group contained some Congress-

men who came to the USSR in connection with the signing of

some treaty pertaining to atomic energy. ~S-

From

comments, it is clear that KGB

considered JAFFE as at least a cooperative source and

it is clear that JAFFE was furnishing some type of infor-

mation to KGB officer KUSKOV. -5 -

3) Since JAFFE's arrival in Washington, D.C.

in the Fall of 1965, he has been observed in contact with

Soviet officials assigned to Washington, D.C. In addition,

/ on 11/14/68, he approached some WFO Agents who were con-

ducting a surveillance on satellite personnel and indicated

that he would like to have contact with the FBI in Washing-

ton, D.C.. in the same manner as he had previously had con-

tact in New York.

He indicated that he was in contact with

Soviets in Washington, D.C. and would report on them. WEO

did not initiate contact with him at that time because it

was desired to obtain from New York the complete details

of New York's relations with him, and it was also desired

to interview

* concerning him. As indicated above,

the New York material has now been reviewed and wis

was interviewed concerning JAFFE

by WFO Agents on 2/11/69.-5-

It is considered entirely possible that JAFFE,

while in Moscow, furnished only innocuous information to

his KGB contact and did not consider that he was a re-

cruited agent or source of KGB.

He should be given an

opportunity to describe his activities in Moscow. Based

upon review of information pertaining to him, it appears

that he could be a good

source against Soviets in Washing-

ton, D.C., provided he is candid concerning his activities

in Moscow and is not, in fact, a recruited agent continuing

to report to KGB. It is believed that an interview with

him is necessary to assess this potential. -C

4) As indicated in NYairtel, JAFFE appears to

be concerned regarding derogatory information which has

appeared in a book written by PHOEBE GREENE COURTNEY. He

has related these allegations to his recall from Hong Kong

by his employer and is concerned regarding the allegation

of disloyalty. It would appear that this may be a

propitious time to interview JAFFE in an effort to com-

pletely debrief him concerning his contacts with Soviets

during his tour in Moscow and

in Hong Kong, as well as

concerning his recent contacts with Soviets in Washington,

D.С. -C-

If the Bureau approves interview with JAFFE,

it is contemplated that he will be advised that WFO Agents

desire to renew contacts with him previously initiated by

New York Agents. He will be invited to the Washington

Field Office to discuss in some detail his tour of duty

in Moscow and his contacts with Soviets since his return

to this country. It will be pointed out that WFO desires

to display to him a large number of photographs of Soviets

in this country and in Russia to obtain his comments. If

JAFFE agrees, he will first be requested to describe in

detail his activities in Moscow and in particular, his

contacts with the KGB subsequent to those reported in

January; 1963. He will also be asked if he had any con-

tacts with Soviets while in Hong Kong and if so, to de-.

scribe them. Thereafter, he will be requested to describe

'in detail his contacts with Soviets since his return to

this country. During the course of the interview, he will

be shown photographs of KGB officers assigned to the Second

Chief Directorate in Moscow, as well as photographs of

Soviets currently assigned to Washington, D.C. Also during

the course of the interview, it is contemplated that he will

be informed that a Soviet defector has advised that he

furnished information to KGB officer KUSKOV, and he will be

requested to specify, what information he furnished. In

particular, he will be questioned concerning the two. groups

of Americans who visited with KHRUSHCHEV, concerning which

he made reports to KGB. Every effort will be made to

obtain accurate information from JAFFE as a means of

assessing his potential. If it appears that he is not

candid, it is believed that no further consideration should

be given to utilizing him as an active source, but infor-

mation volunteered by him should be accepted. Also if he

additional investigation is necessary to determine if,

In the event JAFFE does not agree to come to the

Washington Field Office, Bureau permission is requested to

interview him at his residence.

Infermant advised that he has never been a

member of the American League for Peace and Democracy

although he has been a member for many years of the Council

on Foreign Redations.

Informant went on to state that he

wanted to be certain

that this would be a matter of record

In Bureau Headquarters as well as the fact that there is not

one word of truth concerning him in the book. Informant

stated that he understands that COURTNEY and her husband

reside in New Orleans, La, and are considered to be erratic

individuals in the area of anti-Communist activity. -N-

NYO indices contain no information concerning

COURINEY. U

Enformant was told to handle any matters of

Interest which he wished to call to the attention of the

Bureau through the WFO and to refrain from calling the

NYO in the future unless he was present in NYC.

then said that he has

Informant

been in contact with BORIS G. SIRELNIKOV,

ravaa correspondent, in wDos

and he could not understand

why he has not been contacted by Bureau agents as he would

Ilke to be of assistance to the Bureau at the present time

as he has been in the past. -C

It is the opinion of the NYO that the American

Broadcasting Company has not been entirely satisfied with

informant's work and he was probably recalled from Hong Kong

for this reason. The informant, in turn, has concluded

that his recall was'due to some allegation of disloyalty

in view of a comment made to him in Hong Kong by a British

official. The aforementioned book and its contents have

served to confirm in informant's mind that the reason

for his recall from Hong Kong, in fact, stemmed from an

allegation of disloyalty. -v-

The above information is being furnished to the

Bureau and FO for information and the NO does not contemplate

taking any further action in this matter. -f

As the Bureau has been advised,

this Informant intended to travel to the West Coast of

the U.s. and return to NYC on 12/20/65.

He apparently

did return to NyC but was Involved in participation on

the American Broadcasting Corp.'s year end news show,

which involved travel on the part of informant in a group

Of ABC correspondents throughout the U,S.

Several phone

calls have been made to the American Broadcasting Corp.

in an effort to contact this former informant, but on

each occasion he was found not to be in NYC.

It is known

that he was In Washington, D.C. over the weekend of

1/15-16/66 and presumably he is now enroute to his new

assignment in Hong Kong. When last contacted, he advised

that he would have to proceed to Hong Kong during the

latter part of January 1966 and presumably would not be

back in the NYC area for approximately one jear.

In view of

* assignment overseas

and his past association with soviet nation votice l

as wed

as his assignment in Moscow, Security Flash

currently placed in the Identification Division will be

continued for one more year.

After thepassage of another

year, the wisdom of continuing

this Security Flash Notice

will

be evaluated.c

Russia's Changing,

Says ABC Newsman

File

- By Rick Friedman

A short while back, Sam Jafte,

American

Broadcastig

pany

correspondent, was ex-

pelled from Moscow.

A short while from now, he'll

be reporting for ABC out jof

Hong Kong with hopes of getting

into Red China.

But for the moment, he's in

the United States between as-

signments, looking back on his

past four years in the Soviet

Union.

Newsman Jaffe made news

this past Fall when he was asked

to leave Russia because John

Scali,

ABC diplomatic corre

spondent in Washington, had

reported an imminent shake-up

m the Russian hierarchy, Jus-

sia responded by

Home and by cancelling

a visa

for George Watson, who wag to

• replace him.

Sam had already been sched-

uled to leave Moscow on Dec.

1

for a vacation

in

the United

States before his Hong Kong

assignment.

ABC had both a Russian

translator and a Russian cam-

eraman working in the Moscow

bureau. The network was told it

could keep both of them on the

payroll and keep their rented

apartment in the city.

"They didn't kick out the net-

Sam explained.

"They

Waked me to leave; they vouldnt

let George Watson in. But they

gave ABC the impression we

might be allowed to put a news

correspondent back in

Moscow

in anywhere from three to

six

months."

Changes for Beuer

Looking back over the past

four year's, Sam Jaffe said Mos-

cow charged in that time.

• "May-

be not as quickly as wed like

ie to, hi added.

"But for the

better.

"Today, the people know mole

about the outside world than'

they dia four years

ago.

The

Soviets are no longer jamming

the Voice of America

or the

Russian-language

beamings of

the British Broadcasting

Com-

pany. But Radio Liberty is still

being jammed.

"There was nothing in

the

newspaper about my expulsion.

But the customs officer at the

airport knew: all about it. He

heard the news on the Voice of

• Americal

"More

and more, the Soviet

citizens, particularly the stu

dents you make friends wilh

'tell you what's gong on.

"You see more criticism of tile

Soviet

Union.

Young

people

write in to the newspaper com-

plaining about the lack of con-

sumer goods and their letter's

'are printed. The press itself gets

critical of aspects of the govern-

ment."

Sam said that there was no

'direct censorship of printed ma-

terial written by foreign corre-

spondents, But permission teles

still needed for shooting

vision

film. And undeveloped

photographs couldn't leave the

country. "They make you de-

velop

them

there

and

they

screen them," Sam said.

He added that Russia was let-

ting more

and more

foreign

cameramen in to work for the

networks.

Aiso, that the Soviet news-

men are befriending American

newsmen.

"Many

of our tips

come from them" Sam went on.

• "In some cases,

of course, the

tips are deliberately planted by

• the government itself.

"We didn't feel any tightening

of restrictions

because

of the

Viet Nam crisis even though

we got the official propaganda

line about the United States

deing the aggressor in Asia."

Sam said the Soviets were

retty good about letting for-

eign newsmen travel around the

country. But the new leaders

I didn't travel as much as the

ousted

premier,

Nikita Khu-

shchev, and generated less copy.

Knew Nikita

Sam spoke wistfully of the

davs when he covered Khru-

shcher,

whom the ABC corfe

spondent got to know well.

On one occasion,

Khrushchev

singled him out at an Austrian

Embassy reception

in Moscow.

* The Russian leader called Jaffe

rout of a crowd of diplomats and

raised his glass in a toast to the

newsman. Noticing that Jaffe's

glass was empty,

Khrushchev

filled it from his own, raised

his glass again and said: "My

best wishes to you."

It was Jaffe who later scored

a world newsbeat on the ouster

NW 55312 DocId: 32989704 Page 385

"Khrushsher was good copy.

He talked off the top of his

head. But Brezhnov and Kosygin

are more sophisticated and they

don't talk much. So it takes more

time to get stories on what the

government is up to."

: Knows Far East

The 36-vear-old Jaffe is lock-

ing forward to his new assign-

ment in the Far East, an area

he knows well.

As

15-year-old Merchant

. seaman during World War II,

he

sailed

the

South Pacific.

After the wai,

he spent four

* months roaming Japan.

Back in the United States,

Sam studied Far Eastern Af-

fairs at the University of Cali-

fornia in Berkeley, then worked

a year in San

Francisco

as

reporter-rewrite man for Inter-

national News Service.

While

• there,

he was dramatized

on

television's "The Big Story" for

solving a murder.

When the Korean War broke

out, Sam went into the Marings

as

• combat

correspondent.

Following Korea, he became &

staffer for Life magazine and

researched the religions of Asia

for a series called "The World's

Great Religions."

Sam made

another swing

through Asia in 1955 for the

Nation magazine, covering the

Asian-African Conference ir

Indonesia. It was there he got

an exclusive interview with Chou

En-Lai, the first given a western

correspondent since the Chinese

Revolution.

Later, Jaffe was one of 18

newsmen invited to visit Com

munist China. The trip

called oft because of oppositio

to it from the U.S. government.

"I'd still like to get into Red

Sam said.

"When I

interviewed Chou, the Chinese

were worried I would editorial-

ize. I used a question-and-an-

swer format and they were sur-

prised and pleased that I didn't

editorialize..

An

This former informant did talk at some length

concerning his expulsion from the soviet Union.

He pointed

out that he advised officials of ABC in NYC on a number of

occasions that ABC's Washington Diplomatic Correspondent

JOHN SCALI was in error when he predicted a shake-up of

the Soviet leadership as a result of a

power struggle in the

Kremlin.

The August, 1965,

"Diplomatic List" lists Turi I.

Bobrakov as a Second

Secretary,

D. C.

Soviet Embassy,

Washington,

A Confidential Source advised on September 22,

1965, that on the preceding day, he had met with Bobrakov

and engaged in conversation with him.

Source stated. that

Bobrakov seemed mainly to be interested in getting across

the idea that the proposed Multilateral Force, (MLF) is a

• bad idea and is a stumbling block which is holding up agree-

ment at Geneva on disarmament.

He said further that Bobrakov

expressed considerable concern over the danger of Germany's

obtaining nuclear weapons.

The Source said he pointed out

to Bobrakov the unusual situation in which the United States

and the Soviet Union currently found themselves on the same

side at the United Nations Security Council, endeavoring to

keep the peace.

Bobrakov, however, had no comment on this point.

Bobrakov told the Source that his wife is an

artist, who now has about twenty of her own paintings, most

or which she has done while in the United States.

In the opinion of the Source., Bobrakov is not very

suave or adept at conversation and may be somewhat uncomfort

able in, dealing with Americans. Source also gained the in

pression that Bobrakov's sense of humor is almost nonexistent.

Source stated that Bobrakov attended a reception at

the Embassy of Czechoslovakia en

the evening of September 21,

1965.
