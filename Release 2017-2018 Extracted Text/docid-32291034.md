Re Milwaukee tel 1/29/62 and Milwaukee airtel to Bureau

3/23/62 captioned

"CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE PROGRAM,

MILWAUKEE DIVISION, Weekly Summary, Bufile 62-9-30.""

The following Information was obtained from PCI L

3/22 and 23/62:

D

Approximately a year ago

in a conversation with

one JIM/DONCHUE,

whom he described as a Washington

lobbyist who has represented among others the, Dominican

Republic and who is well acquainted with both

the President

and the Attorney General since they initially came to

washington, D.C., were discussing the possibility of

making some money since DONOHUE had heard that "someone

high in Government circles" would be available to assist

in arranging for making it impossible to deport CARLOS

MARCELLO.

PCI contacted MARCELLO by long distance telephone from

Milwaukee to New Orleans and introduced himself and

arranged a subsequent telephone conversation whereby

he could be identified to MARCELLO by FRANK BALISTRIERI,

top hoodlum in Milwaukee Division.

Thereafter, another

call was made to MARCELLO.

BALISTRIERI was put on the line

and obviously highly recommended PCI to MARCELLO, though

Comin

he talked in' Italian and the details of the introduction

were unknown to PCI.

Following this introduction, MARCELLO

and they met in a Washington

PCI explained that the Government had for years been

endeavoring to deport

MARCELLO,

who was born in

Tunisia, but because of MARCELLO's payoffs in Government

circles

in Tunisia, Italy and France, none of those

countries would receive him.

The current attempt was

to have a phony birth certificate prepared in the

Dominican Republic for MARCELLO and leak back information

whereby the Government of the U.S. could discover the

existence of this birth certificate and deport MARCELLO.

to the Dominican Republic rather than to a European or

an African country. TRUJILLO was to get $200,000 1f

this plan went through, and PCI was to hold the money

in escrow for this purpose.

Before the plans could be completed for this, MARCELLO

was "grabbed and hustled to Guadamala by Army airplane"

and what his

attorney described as a kidnaping by the

Government of the U.S. while his deportation case was

still under appeal.

PCI thereafter furnished through MARCELLO's brother,

SAM, two names of Guadamalan officials--one being the

head of the Guadamalan Air Force and the other being

an individual who at the present time is Guadamalan

representative to the United Nations, name unrecalled.

Within a very short time after this, PCI heard that

MARCELLO was back in the U.S., and as recently as six

months ago in talking to MARCELLO's brother, SAM, by

telephone, PCI learned that the MARCELLO family was

willing to spend a million dollars, if necessary, to

keep MARCELLO in the country so he could spend the

rest of his life with his family.

PCI had further discussions with DONOHUE relative to

this matter and learned that MARCELLO was Number 1 on

the list to be deported and that although the Attorney

General was personally very interested in getting

MARCELLO deported, this interest was second to his

interest in getting JAMES R. HOFFA in jail, which he has

been unable to accomplish for lack of witnesses whoi will

stand up in Court.

PCI and DONOHUE believed that through LAVERNE/ DUFFY,

U.S. y

whom PCI described as an Assistant Attorney General,

they could make arrangements to have MARCELLO furnish

to the Department of Justice witnesses against HOFFA

who would stand up in Court in return for which the

Government would give MARCELLO a clean bill on his

deportation proceedings.

Informant and DONOHUE be-

lieved that they could

make a sizable amount of money

"legally" by setting up such arrangements with DONOHUE

making the Government contacts and

PCI making the

MARCELLO contacts.

on 3/20/62, PCI telephonically contacted SAM MARCELLO

from Milwaukee to the Jefferson Music Company, Gretna,

La., in order to determine whether or not SAM and his

family were still willing to pay for arrangements to

get the deportation

proceedings killed. At this time

SAM told informant,

"Don't spend a

buck on it.

Every-

thing is taken care of."

Informant then contacted

DONOHUE by long distance telephone on 3/22/62 and.

advised him of this information, whereupon DONOHUE said

that it was still his best information that MARCELLO was

number 1 to be deported.

of the two, informant is more inclined to believe

that MARCELLO knows what the actual facts are, and

informant further believes that because of his current

attitude as contrasted with his attitude of six months

ago, that the MARCELLOs have "spread the million

dollars around in high Government circles" whereby

MARCELLO need no longer worry about deportation.

PCT has advised that he has discussed MARCELLO's status

further, after these conversations, with FRANK PETER

BALISTRIERI, and the latter has said that he will try

to find out MARCELLO's status.

DONOHUE likewise will

keep PCI informed, and PCI has

promised to keep this

office informed.

As indicated, Milwaukee is unable to evaluate the above

information for lack of knowledge as to MARCELLO's

current status.
