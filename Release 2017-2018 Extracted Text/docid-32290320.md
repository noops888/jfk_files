DETAILS:

I. WHEREABOUTS OF SAMUEL M. GIANCANA

As has been previously reported, GIANCANA

has not been observed in the Chicago area or in his

residence in Oak Park, Illinois, at 1147 South

Wenonah,

since he was

Jail on May 31, 1966. eleased from the cook County

CG T-l, who is in position to observe

activities at the residence of GIANCANA in Oak Park,

Illinois on an hourly basis during the daytime and

nighttime hours, advised in July, and September,

1968, that she has not obeerved GIANCANA at his

residence since he was incarcerated in June, 1965.

She advised that the residence is now being main-.

tained by JAMES PERNO, a

relative of GIANCANA,

and PERNO's family.

She also advised that ANTHONY

P. TISCI and his wife, the oldest daughter of

GIANCANA, are spending the summer at the GIANCANA

residence in Oak Park, V

As has previously been reported, informa-

tion was developed that several months after

GIANCANA was released from the Cook County Jail

on May 31, 1966 he was residing in a luxurious

mansion at. Nubes Number 2, Rancho Tetela,

Cernavaca, Morelos, Mexico. However, information

was also developed

that approximately a year ago,

after GIANCANA became aware that his residence

was known to authorities, he left this residence

and was not seen for several months.U

CG T-2 advised that on the afternoon of

August 6,

Rancho Tetela, Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico,

at

about 4:30 p.m.

CG T-2 advised that an investi-

gative technique was thereafter utilized and

a verification was made that a person identical

to photographs of GIANCANA was in the residence

on the afternoon of that date. CG T-2 advised

a photograph of GIANCANA and immediately advised

that the face was familiar to him as a frequent

customer.

He identified the person represented

by the photograph as a Mr. SCALZETTI, who in the

past had frequented the restaurant on an almost

daily basis.

CG T-3 advised that an even more

frequent customer at one time was an individual

introduced as a nephew of

- SCALZETTI, also known

as SCALZETTI.

CG T-3 identified a photograph

Of RICHARD CAIN as being identical with the

person known to him as the man named SCALZETTI

who is a nephew of GIANCANA

CG T-3 advised that

GIANCANA at one

time was very insistent that he accept funds

from GIANCANA as an investment to expand his

operation. At that time he was not interested

in expansion and refused the opportunity which

seemed to annoy GIANCANA. The informant advised

that shortly thereafter, GIANCANA stopped fre-

quenting

his establishment, possibly for this

reason.

CG T-3 advised that shortly thereafter

he received information which indicated to him

the possibility that GIANCANA may have financed

the owner of another luxury restarant in Cuernavaca.

II. MISCELLANEOUS

As reported above, the son-in-law of

GIANCANA, ANTHONY PHILLIP TISCI and GIANCANA 'S

daughter, TISCI's wife, are presently spending

the summer at the residence of GIANCANA at

1147 South Wehonah, in Oak Park.

It is noted

that TISCI, a former resident of Chicago,

left the Chicago area due to a heart condition

approximately a year and a half ago, and are

now residing in the Tucson, Arizona

area. U

On July 4, 1968, two blasts from

a shotgun were fired at the residence of TISCI

in Tucson.

One of the blasts went through the
