MEMORANDUM

SUBJECTS Layrenco J LA BORDE, 201-291688

On 4 Nay 1967 the headquarters office of the Domestic

Contacts Service Telephoned the G/CI/R&A and said that Subject had

teleplioned the New Orteans office of the DCS that day. Subject said that

he was an ex-CLA employce, that he feared that D.A. Jim GARRiSON

would subpocna him, that he was willing to leave the U.S. to avoid' a

subpocha, and that he wanted the office to tell him what to do.

A review ot Subject's file has led to the hypothesis that this

visit may have boon a provocation, probably engincered by GARRISON

In an attempt to trap CIA Into advising Subject to leave Louisiana.

Had such advice been given, GARRISON would have been able to buttress

his charge that CIA is attempting to obstruct the course of justice in

New Orleans.

3.

The Miami Station requested a provisional covert security

approval for Subject on 14 March 1961, The request was granted on

24 March 1961: (4 PCSA approves contact fog spotting and assessing

only.) However, a 31 March 1961 cable from Miami requested per-

mission to incrcase Subjcct's salary to $700 a month and to pay him

bonuscs.

4

A Hicadquarters dispatch of 23 March 1962 warned Miami

that Subject was indiscret, drank too much, and had an unsavoury

reputation, On 20 April 1962 Miami cancelled the reguest for an

approval, on the grounds that Subject was a poor security risk.

Subject had no later relationship with the Agency. Subject was bitter

about his CIA contacts when terminated and made reckless threats.

An FBI report of 23 May 1962 said Subject had contacted

representatives of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC, Agency-created

and supported) in New Orleans, his home town; had offered his services;

and had said he was running a boat out of Key West, smuggling Cubans

and guns with the knowledge of CIA.

A Miam report of June 1962 saig that Subjcet was employed

1937-1939 In Alestico by the U.S. Deparunces of Agriculture but vas

fired for excessive drinking, discharging authorized firearmo, and

non-support of spendent children.

The New Oricans States-Itera of 28 July 1962 named Subject

as this source of bitterly anti-CIA remarks as story which praises.

LA BORDE as a good family man, complete reliablet, and guotes a

Cuban refugec leader as saying that CIA and FEI agents termed Subject

a man of integrity. An anti-CIA article in the Denver Pest of 3 June 1962

also appears to be based on statements (ror LABORDE.

Fot reporting of August 1962 staced that LABORDE had duped

certain persons into buying a schoonct, the Sisic Reichart, by saying

that he and a crow would operate it for Cobar operations which the

V.S. Government could not openly acknowlege but for which it would

pay handsomely.
