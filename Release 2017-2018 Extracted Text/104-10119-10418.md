MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Analysis Group

FROM

Jerry G. Brown

SUBJECT

*

HENMING,

Gerald Patrick

OSH429 229

APPROVED FOR REUBASE 1993

CIA HISTORICAL REVIEW PROGRAM

• 1.

Reference is made to the attachment which is a

copy of a memorandum contained in Subject file dated

7 November 1960 from Chief/Contact Division/00 to Chief/

Personnel Security Division/Office of Security captioned

"Jerry'P. HENNING, JI., Ex-US Marine who served in Cuban

Army and Air Force 00-A-3170536!'

, a copy of which was

sent to WH Division and CI Staff.

It is apparent that

the HENNING referred to therein is identical with Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

• 2.

• Of pertinence for the purposes of instant memo-

randum is that information contained in paragraphs four

and tive of the reference and related by HEMMING voluntarily

to the Contact

Division/Los Angeles Office between I1 and

21 October 1960, to wit:

"Henning returned to California in October

1958... He left for Cuba by air via Miami on

...or about 18. February 1959 arriving in Havana

on

19 February 1959."

"He claimed to have contacted officials

'in the Cuban Consul's office in Los Angeles

prior to his departure."

3.

In substance relative to the

above, the HEMMING

file reflects that he served in the U. S. Marine Corps from

19 April 1954 to 17 October 1958. (The 201 file concerning

HEMMING reflects that he served in Japan with a U. S. Marine

Air Wing.) He then returned to the Los Angeles arca for

discharge and then left for Cuba circa 18 February 1959 and

joined Castro's forces.

oswAlD served with a te of the foregoing is that lee Harvey

S. Marine Air Wing in Japan, and

when OSWALD Teturned to the United States, he was assigned

to Santa Anna, California (LOS Angeles area).

Extensive

testimony contained in the Warren Commission hearings by

OSWALD's fellow Marines at Santa Anna contain the theme

that OSWALD was interested in going to Cuba to join Castro

(upon his discharge) in early 1959 and that

in early 1959

OSWALD

allegedly made

some contact. with the Cuban Consul's

Office in Los Angeles.

5.

The

• above

well as the Office of Security file

concerning HEMMING which is replete with information

brought linking HEMMING and his cohorts to OSWALD was

"to the attention of Mr. John Leader. (and Mr. Scott

Breckinridge), Inspector General, on 6

• April 1977:

Mr: Leader

advised he would pursue the matter.
