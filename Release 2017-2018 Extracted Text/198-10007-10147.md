THE MOVEMENT OF SUBVERSIVES AND SUBVERSIVE TRAINEES

I. Introduction

The actions proposed herein are designed to impede

the flow of subversives between Cuba and other Latin

American countries.

Execution of any one or more of

in one on an odo

the enumerated actions will ameliorate the situation;

execution of them all will not completely solve it.

The practical problems involved are too numerous and

complex.

With respect to diminishing legal travel to Cuba,

we face multiple problems in the policies and attitudes

of those Latin American countries through which the

subversive traveller must pass.

From the viewpoint of

these nations the direct actions required have strong

political and sometimes legal implications - 1mp11-

cations which

cannot be overcome easily, even when

the leaders of these countries choose to do so.

In the matter of clandestine travel, we are

confronted not only with the great depth of communist

gulle, born of two generations of experience in the

International movement of subversives, but with the

Inexperience, ineptitude and lack of awareness in

these same matters on the part of the Latin American

community.

In spite of this, the advantages do not all reside

with the communists, Cuba's insular character imposes

certain sharp limitations upon personal movement.

Cuba has no frontiers with other states; everyone

who enters the country must do so either by water.

or air.

There can be no slipping through the

barbed wire.

On the other hand, this

same geographic situation

makes clandestine entry and exit reasonably simple.

There are 3,825 linear miles of essentially unpa-

trolled Central American coastline, within 175 to

850 miles from Cuba.

There are at

least 93 airfields;

other than ours, within 700 miles of the island, and

the ships and craft indigenous to the Caribbean, and

capable of supporting the subversive ebb and flow,

number well into the thousands.

Even in the face of these unfavorable factors, a

program of direct restraints, selected from among

the actions enumerated herein, can have favorable

effects.

Under the proposed

steps some travel would

be stopped completely.

More - probably much more -

would be rendered difficult. Some hitherto legal

movement would be driven underground. Previous

clandestine movement would be impeded, complicated

and harassed to the point where it becomes more

costLy, more uncertain, more hazardous and thus,

hopefully, less extensive.

II. Nature and Scope of the Problem

We do not know enough about the movement of

subversive trainees, into Cuba and - more important -

out of Cuba.

We do

not know enough about the volume

of travel; or the media employed

This is par-

ticularly true in the area of illicit traffic, where

our knowledge is extremely limited.

Regarding legal travel to Cuba, CIA presents the

following estimate:

* In transit, including about 300 Mexicans

While some of these travellers proceeded to Cuba by

other routes, the great majority passed through Mexico.

+ these

On the most conservative basis; then, it will be seen:

that there cannot have been fewer than 4,912 travellers

to Cuba during 1962, while

the average monthly number

passing through Mexico for the first two months of

1963 is even higher than the 1962 monthly average.

Of the total number visiting Cuba, the Central

Intelligence Agency estimates

that at least 1,500, and

perhaps as many as 2,000, have received ideological

indoctrination or guerrilla warfare training.

of these are still in Cuba.

Others have returned to

their homelands; some by legal means; some probably

by illicit means.

There is no reason to presume,

moreover, that the travel to Cuba of the remaining

3, 000-3,500 was entirely consistent with

the best

interests of the hemisphere

Prior to the October crisis, Latin Americans

travelling to Cuba usually moved by regular commercial

airlines or, on occasion, by specially chartered

Cubana flights.

Some travelled to Trinidad or

Curacao and thence by regularly scheduled Cubana or

KIM flights to Havana. Others travelled to Mexico,

and from there by Mexicana or Cubana commercial

flights to Havana. With the cessation of service

to Cuba by Pan American, KIM, Mexicana, and Iberia

airlines in October, the regular Cubana service

between Mexico City and Havana remained the sole

direct and regular airline connection between Cuba

and the remainder of Latin America.

The Cubana service between Havana and Mexico is

scheduled to operate twice weekly, but sometimes only

a single flight is completed per week. Aircraft now

employed are British Britannias - an obsolescent model.

Cubana has requested, but has not yet received,

Mexican approval to

substitute Soviet IL-18 transports

'for the old Britannias.

Delay by the Mexicans in

granting this approval can have the favorable effect

of impeding travel, as the Britannias are now in

poor condition.

If, in addition, the British and

Canadians can be induced to suspend delivery of

spare parts, the planes will soon become inoperative.

Iberia airlines resumed its regular twice-monthly

flights from Madrid to Havana on 11 February. This

flight makes one stop, in the Azores, before reaching

Havana.

KIM has not yet resumed its regular flights to Cuba

from the Netherlands Antilles.

However, it is now con

sidering doing so.

resumption of scheduled flights by a United States

carrier could serve as an encouragement to KIM and

others to do the same.

Soviet and Czech airlines serving Cuba do not stop

regularly at any other Latin American country, though

the Soviet Aeroflot line has occasionally sought and

received permission from Brazil to land at Recife,

enroute to cuba.

Some Latin Americans may have

travelled to Cuba on

these infrequent flights and,

should Brazil permit this arrangement to become

regularized, the movement of subversives could

achieve a new order of magnitude.

A Canadian non-scheduled line has operated a few

flights from Canada to Havana and return, carrying

both material and personnel. The Canadians have been

unresponsive to our efforts to obtain identification

of the passengers.

There are no regularly scheduled sea carriers

operating between Latin America and Cuba. However,

a number of trainees from British Guiana have

travelled to Cuba aboard unscheduled Cuban merchant

vessels engaged in transporting rice from Guiana to

Cuba.

Clandestine sources report that transit of Latin

Americans through Mexico to Cuba often involves illicit

procedures.

The Cuban embassy in Mexico City provides

the travellers, whom they identify as tourists, with

special Cuban

entry papers; no entry is made in their

passports, and they are given pseudonyms for travel

out of and into Mexico.

This procedure 1s obviously

designed to impede any effort by the other Latin

American governments subsequently to identify the

travellers and to exercise surveillance over their

activities upon their return

Evidence at hand portrays a substantial flow of

travel by legal means. This must be countered

directly. Beyond this, and perhaps of greater

importance, is the problem of illicit movement both

Into and out of Cuba, which will undoubtedly assume

growing proportions

as legal travel is curtailed,

and about which our intelligence is at present most

limited,

Elimination of this intelligence void must

be accorded nigh priority.

III. The Attitudes of the Latin American Nations

Success of many of the overt actions proposed in

the sections to follow will turn upon the attitudes

of the Latin American nations within whose borders

the restraining actions must take place,

Presented

briefly below is an estimate of what can be expected

from the various

sectors of Latin America in terms

of participation in a coordinated program of travel

control.

As a general matter, the imposition of controls

on travel is not popular with the public in any Latin

American country

This, coupled with their current

lack of full awareness of the danger represented by

Cuba's training of subversives, will diminish the

willingness of some

governments to impose controls

unilaterally.

This is especially true since they

recognize that unilateral restraints will have little

effect on curbing the travel of their nationals to

Cuba, if supporting multilateral action 1s not also

taken. It is likely, however, that most of the

American countries would respond favorably -

albeit in varying degrees -- to US. leadership in

seeking to reduce the flow of persons to Cuba for

ideological or subversive training.

The Central American countries are more acutely

aware of the danger posed by Cuban-inspired sub-

version than is Latin America at large, and can be

expected to react favorably to proposals for re-

ducing travel to Cuba which President Kennedy might

present at the San Jose Presidential meeting.

However, their ability to carry out commitments which

they may make will be limited by domestic legal

and political considerations, as well as by their

countries' technical incompetence in such matters.

Since Mexico is currently the principal

hemisphere transit point for legal travel of

sub-

versives to and from Cuba, its attitude is of great

importance. Mexico, to date, has taken several

significant steps with respect to travel between

Mexican cities and Cuba. It has instituted close

SECRET

SECRET

surveillance over travellers, to include stamping

passports to evidence travel

to Cuba. In additIon,

the Mexicans now photograph, covertly, all persons

arriving from or departing for Cuba, and have given

tacit approval to suspension of Cuban service by

Compania Mexicana de Aviacion (CMA).

These actions

all suggest that Mexico might be induced to take even

further cooperative steps, particularly on an un-

publicized, bi-lateral basis, wherein the political

hazards of taking a public OAS position are not

involved. In this regard, the Central American

Presidents would probably agree individually to seek

the participation of President Lopez Mateos of Mexico

in specific cooperative moves to restrict the flow

of persons to Cuba through that country.

Peru now has regulations which actually prohibit

travel

to Cuba, but the regulations have engendered

public resistance, and are not enforced. The

Dominican Republic prohibits such travel. Haiti

has no established policy, but passports and exit

permits are reportedly issued only on the personal

approval of President Duvalier. Colombia could

legally impose restrictions by executive decree,

but has shown no inclination to do so:

countries, such as Venezuela, Chile, and the Central

nations, plead the existence of legal or

constitutional barriers which preclude the pro-

hibition of travel to cuba, but thus far, they

have made little effort to remove these barriers

Five Latin American countries (Brazil, Chile,

Uruguay, Mexico, and Bolivia) now maintain diplomatic

relations with Cuba. Brazil continues its drift to

the: left and gives little evidence of modifying its

tolerant attitude toward the Castro government.

Chile, with a legal Communist Party, exercises

restraints on travel to Cuba, either direct or

via third country.

The elimination of all legitimate passenger

service to Cuba from Latin America could be

SECRET

achieved through invocation of the Rio Treaty,

but it

is unlikely that the hemisphere countries would agree

to do so in the absence of some major crisis similar

to that involving the Soviet missiles or a case of

direct Cuban intervention in another Latin American

country.

Nevertheless, a campaign on our part to

develop a full awareness of the danger represented

by the flow of Castro-trained subversives would

probably create a growing willingness to take action

oriented in this direction.

In this connection,

however, it is concluded that resumption of regular

passenger service to Cuba by United States companies

would render more difficult our efforts to persuade

Latin American and other free world countries to

take a grave view of the situation, and to partici-

pate in dynamic action.

Virtually, all the Latin American countries would

be willing to move against Cuban-trained subversives

upon their return to home countries, once they put

their new training to use.

The efforts of these

nations will not be dramatically effective, however,

since, in the area of internal security, all of them

suffer from deficiencies in technical skill, training,

equipment and

sometimes from a lack of a sense of

urgency

The United States can provide essential

leadership in eliminating all of these deficiencies.

IV. Actions Concerning Legitimate Travel

Listed below are specific actions contemplated to

impede legitimately executed travel, to and from Cuba.

Legitimate travel is characterized,

for this purpose,

as travel on recognized public carriers, openly

arranged and involving travel documents which are

presumed

to be in proper order.

Certain of the

actions, it will be noted, are partially in effect.

Others have been proposed to the OAS - wholly or in

part - by

its Special Consultative Committee on

Security.

to expose the scope and purpose of Cuban training

of the nationals of other countries for sub-

versive purposes, in order to discourage pro-

spective trainees and impress the governments

and the peoples concerned with the urgent

need to

halt the travel of Latin American

nationals to Cuba.

2. Longer Range Actions

The following actions should also be undertaken

without delay. Their ultimate results may be of far-

with inadequate legal restrictions on travel to

Cuba to adopt laws enabling the prohibition of such AR

travel and providing severe penalties for evasion.

Recommend that rewards be offered for identification

of evaders.

(3) In separate diplomatic approaches to each

country, reiterate the need for full and effective

cooperation with appropriate OAS bodies, and bi-

laterally among the several states, in the inter-

change of information concerning travel of persons

to Cuba and other Castro-Communist subversive

activities.

(4) Propose periodic regional or sub-regional

meetings of ministers of Government of the

American Republics to review the implementation

of steps taken by them to combat movement of

subversives in the Caribbean.

negotiate separately and/or collectively with Mexico

list cooperation in adopting specific measures to

prevent the movement through their countries of

third country personnel to and from Cuba.

c. Administrative Actions

(1) Encourage Latin American governments to inst1-

tute administrative procedures, such as

exhaustive

examination of manifests, air-worthiness checks of

sirene soner nape don and depended at healts pul

and other documents, all designed

deliberately to

delay and otherwise make aifficult the carrying of

passengers to Cuba.

(2) Request governments of Latin American countries

which persist in maintaining diplomatic relations

with Cuba to expose the falsification of travel docu-

ments by Cuban embassies or consulates, and take

punitive measures, such as the expulsion of Cuban

out

diplomatic personnel, to bring such 1llegal activity

to a halt. Provide U.S. technical assistance as re-

quested.

(3) Intensify technical assistance to Latin:

cR

American countries in improving immigration and

customs controls.

d. Actions Related to Common Carriers

(1) Persuade Mexico to halt Cubana Airlines

service. If unable to do so, seek to persuade

Mexico

to refuse the introduction of Soviet-made air-l

craft in the Havana-Mexico City route on technical

grounds.

This will create an obstacle to Cubana,

since the Britannia aircraft now used are falling

into disrepair.

(2) Request again of Great Britain, Canada,

supply of spare parts for Cuba's

• Britannia aircraft.

(3) Conduct negotiations with the Netherlands,

Mexico, Canada and Spain to persuade those countries

to stop, or refrain from reestablishing, commercial

air flights to Cuba. Enlist the cooperation of

other Western Hemisphere countries normally pro-

viding terminal service for any of the airlines 1n-

volved, such as Venezuela and Trinidad, in applying.

3. Organization of American States (OAS) Actions

In view of the important political, psychological,

and, hopefully,

material benefits to be derived from

any

success achieved through the OAS in combatting

Cuban subversive activity, the following measures

should be undertaken by the United States in that body,

V. Actions Concerning Illegal Travel

As the actions outlined in the preceding sections

become effective, one of the results will be to force

the hitherto legal travel into clandestine channels.

It may,

therefore,

be expected that measures to

impede

illegal movement will acquire steadily in-

creasing importance.

The steps proposed herein are listed, as in the

preceding section, in terms of immediate impact pro-

jects which promise early and visible results, and

longer range projects which, while of great importance,

cannot be expected to mature as

rapidly.
