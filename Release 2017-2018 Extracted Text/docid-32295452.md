Doctor MANOPULO stated that if the information

received from the Bureau is sufficiently broad and detailed,

consideration will be given to Introducing the intormation

for study by the italian Parliamentary Anti-Maf 1a Commissione

which is presently making a study of the Mafia in Italy.

and is proposing to the Italian Legislature urgent provisions

of a legislative and administrative character for the control

of the Mafia.

Since the information which will be furnished by

the Bureau may be suitable for presentation to the Commission,

it is requested that the Bureau furnish specific instructions

as to which part of the information may be furnished by the

Italian police to the Commission and which part of it is for

withe sole use of the police in connection with official investi-

gations.....5
