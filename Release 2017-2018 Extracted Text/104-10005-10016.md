Perconversation this AM with Martin, he has no information

on Soviet hunting clubs.

He never belonged to one, and had been

hunting ondy once in his life. His opinion was that it was not worth

my trouble to come see him in person and that anything else he might

say on the subject would be a "poor guess."

2. Bob Steele called about :1445 to say that

had been

hit on the subject of hunting clubs, and could contribute nothing.

At the age of ll he had known a hunter, but that was the extent of his

knowledge of the sport. According to Bob, he added nothing further

a the bone.

except to express the opinion that a hunting club would not be connected

directly to a factory.

The manual of library acquisitions was reviewed and the only Nores

periodical relating to hunting observed was "Okhota i Okhotnich'ye

Khozyaystvo" which is published monthly.

The July 1964 copy was acquired

from the Library Periodicals section.

A Soviet book listing all (3)

periodicals was checked and no publications were observed under the

sections which included "sport" and "hunting."
