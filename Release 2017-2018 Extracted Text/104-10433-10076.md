AMENDED COMMENT

This document was denied. The document is principally concerned

with repeating information received from the FBl which in turn received the

information from a

under an agreement of

confidentiality. Because of the potential damage to

diplomatic relations should this information be released, the FBI has requested

that all of the information be withheld under the authority of exemption (b) (1).

Other portions of the document which contain information primarily of interest

to CIA are also withheld including comments on the substance of the FBI

information which if reieased would lead to the disclosure of the information the

in a specific city abroad, Agency internal filing instructions, Agency components,

Agency staff employees and Agency cryptonyms. The document is therefore

withheld under the authority of exemptions (b) (1), (b) (2) and (b) (3).
