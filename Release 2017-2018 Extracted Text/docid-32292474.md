ADMINISTRATIVE

The following information was obtained from

sources whose identity might be disclosed should this

information be set forth openly in a report:

On September 8, 1964, and September 14, 1964,

CG 6756-C furnished information to SA JAMES D. DEWHIRST

concerning his contact with GUS ALEX wherein he stated

that ALEX visited his place of business in Lisle, Illinois,

on September 4, 1964, at approximately 11:00 a.m.

was driven to Lisle by two other individuals who remained

in the car which was a 1964 black four-door El Dorado

Cadillac.

ALEX remained in his store and they conversed

for approximately three quarters to one hour.

This was

his second meeting with ALEX, having first met him at

FRANK FERRARO'S wake.

According to informant, ALEX reiterated his

previous statement that informant was well recommended

and could prove an asset to their operation.

ALEX stated

"they" intended to commence activities in Du Page County

in the near future and want informant to handle part of

their operation.

Informant stated he would be glad to

do so; however, he did not want to jeopardize his business

and he had never been a bookie before thinking that that

would be the proposition made to him. ALEX told him he

would be a roving representative and not to worry about

jeopardizing his business because it represented nothing

in comparison to the financial expectancy he should get

from working with them.

ALEX stated that just because

WILLIAM BAUER, the State's Attorney in Du Page County,

would be elevated to a judgeship, they were not moving

into the county but that the main reason was that "they"

that are hala ,

had determined that there was enough action in that county

which would justify their moving into same.

king of the Greeks.

Informant learned from FRANK FRATTO that ALEX

was being reduced in stature in the outfit primarily

because he is not of Italian extraction.

ALEX has held

a high position in outfit activities and has been capable.

Two years ago the outfit considered reducing ALEX'S

position; however, FRANK FERRARA, who has always been

close to ALEX, prevented his being lowered in position.

In conversation with HELENE AMATO, Wife Of JOE AMATO,

informant remarked that ALEX was a big man in the outfit

and HELENE stated he was, but he is not any longer.

FRATTO told informant that concerning their moving into

activities in Du Page County, that ALEX will not be in

charge of same but that someone else will be taking his

FRATTO indicated that informant will be placed

in a good position in connection with their interest in

that county.

On October 1, 1964, informant stated he had

learned from HELENE AMATO that TONY ACCARDO has expressed

a concern for what GUS ALEX might know regarding the

activities of the Italian element in the outfit. ACCARDO

and associates feel that ALEX has been extremely loyal

and

capable performer for him, however, he is not of

Italian extraction and cannot

be considered close to

them.

They are aware that ALEX was extremely close to

FRANK FERRARA and do not know what FERRARA might have

told him regarding their activities. ALEX is being
