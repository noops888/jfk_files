to determine pertinent details of accounts which Callahan

may maintain at such banks.

Particular attention should be

directed

toward ascertaining whether any withdrawals in

the amount of $3,200 were made around the date of 3-29-56,

when that amount was deposited in the Esco account as noted

in rerep.

It would be pertinent to determine whether there

are indications that funds Cellahan claims he borrowed from

Cozzi were possibly obtained from personal accounts of

sizeable withdrawals, as well as deposits should be secured.
