to UNSNAFU/19, but has not re-

colved an answer to date. It la not known at this time

whother the lack of further jewelry packets ia just poor

administrative procedures on the part of the Cubans, or

rifle such as

Acquisition of Cuban Pesos.

A/1 stated that he had

called RIcardo BORDO's son In PhlIndolphia several tines

(confirmed by telocons earlier between underaigned and A/1

In New York) but that in each ease, the son had atated that

ho had received no packages fron his father from Mexico

during the latter's last tise in that city.

All thought

this indeed strange.

The undersigned opined that perhaps

1t was difficult to obtain pesos today due to the stringent

currency controls now in force in Cuba, We surgested to

AIWHIP/1 that he not pursue this problem with BORDO further,

as any over zealous efforts on his part to obtain the

currency might come to the attention of the Cuban authoritles.

0f course,

11 BORDO does produce the pesos at a later date

(with no additional prompting fron A/1), they will be readily

accepted.

A/1

stated that he believed vERNAy's bualness was protected

from Intervention up to thi. time through the inter-

cession of KENTUNA (AMiIP Commented that his business

along with those of most of his friends suffered their

fate quito sono tine ago.)

Hornes 74, Apt 304, Mexico, Def.

A/1 stated that TORRES

us all right and apparently was trusted enough by Att

to deliver an inocuous message and letter, the latter being

not so harmless.

A/1 stated that TORRES Was Jiven to

drinking and took dope upon occasion. (No identifiable

traces on TORRES).

ANLASH/1, LASH sent A/l the accompanying letter

malled by TORRES. from lexico.

The text 18 self explanatory.

It bas been decided that there would be too much room for

suspicion i1 KUBARK tried to have LASH invited to the cited

National assembly of Surgeons. A/l has an acquaintance

wIth one Manuel RODRIGUEZ, who was in 1959 a medical student

and President of the lezican F.E.U.

He suggested that 11

he could locate RODRIGUEZ, he might be able to have ha

formally invite AMLASH to the Assembly, as the latter desires.

A/1 has not seen RODRIGUEZ (on whom there are no identi

flable traces) for about three years, but believes tiat

there to no risk in attempting to locate his and asking this

favor.

It l8 perhaps worth the effort, although admittedly

1t 18 & long shot.

It should be noted

that RODRIGUEZ'g

father is believed to be a communist, but that, according

to A/1, RODRIGUEZ 1s not.

(This would adually not be a

problen, providing RODRIGUEZ belleved that he wes just doing

• favor for A/l who desires to soe his old friend LASH.)

The note added to LASH's letter from "Harzo" 18 from

Marcelino ARTIME Vega, who was used as a cut out for mall
