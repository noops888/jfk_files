as to subject's activities.

3.

Will maintain contact with and work

with Assistant Chief of Police ED MC CRARY and Sergeant

BOB MOORHEAD, Garland PD, who are also covering subject's

ADMINISTRATIVE

For information of New York, subject along with

JOSEPH SOFIE GEBRON, on whom separate

IGA case is also

pending, started a bookmaking operation at 200. Jupiter Road,

Garland, Texas, around 3/1/67.

GEBRON had just prior to

that time been

arrested at another location in University

Park (Dallas suburb), Texas, and was told to leave that

city or cease his operation. He moved his operation to

the above location in Garland and GEBRON and subject are

both involved in running

that operation. GEBRON has

clained to Dallas police that he is not getting his line

from out of state, but appears from information furnished

by New York City PD,

this may not be correct.

Subjects

are

both well-known gamblers and bookies in Dallas area and

MATTHEWS has long been known as general all-around hoodlum

and strong-arm-man.

Records of Southwestern States Telephone Company,

were checked by WAYNE WEAVER, Commercial Representative,

for SA HAROLD J. EDGERTON.

On 4/19/67, DL 275-C-TE advised that MATTHEWS had

been in his place of business several times recently during

past weeks and was decent and sober and not threatening as

usual. Informant said MATTHEWS was still booking with GEBRON

but was unable to provide any specifics on the operation.

On 4/26/67, DL 146-C advised SA JAMES W. BOOKHOUT

that MATTHEWS has a Federal gambling stamp and he and GEBRON

are presently engaged in booking operation in Garland.

CI

will attempt to determine futher details concerning this operation.
