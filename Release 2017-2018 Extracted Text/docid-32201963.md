DETAILS:

On August 28, 1962, MM T-I, another government

agency which corducts intelligence-type investigations,

furnished information as followg:

Sometine in June of 1952, (ENU) JIMENEZ, Cuban

Ambassador to Panama during the -dministration, of GRAU

SAN MARTIN, said he was plarning to assassinate Presiden*

ROBERIO F. CHIARI of Panama. JIMENEZ had been trying, for

the last six nonths, to reeruit Cubans in the Miami area

for work in Panana.

About fifteea days before (in July of 1962),

JIMENEZ spent some three days each ia Mani, Puerto Rico

and New York. In Mani, juENEZ was in touch with SERGIO

CASTRO and Captais (INU)

RODRIGUEZ DIAZ, both well kaowe

gurmen, and gave them $500.00 as an initial payment for

the assassination of the President of Panana.

The assassination

was to take place during an uprising in Panama, JIMENEZ said,

and one of the important figures in the uprising would

be ROBERTO ARIAS GUARDIA.

MM I-l advised further shat ROBERTO ARIAS waS

reportedly ready to assist in the insurrectionary atteupe

Of MajOr MANUEL HURTADO SEDA of the National Guard, and a

small group of guardamen who supported him in Panama 1n

August of 1962.

On September 13, 1952, MM I-2, 8 Penananian:

businessman with contess anong latta- nestean diplonele

pessonnel and secidents of the man! ases," furnished tke

following:

A former Cuban Ambassador to Panama named JIMENEZ

18 not known. JUAN E. JIMENEZ is a Panamanian who formerly

MM 105-6555

was Ambassador to Cuca ficn Parama. He served as Ambasgador

to Cuba or two different ocearions, at which time ARNULEO

ARIAS was President of Panama.

JIMENEZ is a very wealthy and selfish individual

who lives a very fast and expeagive social life asd visies

Miami every few months or 30, at which time he stays at

the McAllister Hotel. Ee is a friendiof ROBERTO "TITO"

ARIAS, sno has baen relievad fron his post as Panamanian

Ambaggador su Great-Britain, and has returned to Panama.

ROBERTO ARIAS has been reportedly involved in revolutionary

activities in the past.

According to his own statements, JIENEZ is

presently frying to

set up a number of ganbling casinos

in Panana. Thig is being done wish the cooperation of ice

present Paratanian Government. JIMENEZ owns several race

horses, and soretive in the past was pronibited from raciag

his horses in the state of Florida, because an examiration

of one of his horses after racing disclosed it had been

given some kind of a stimulant.

JIMENEZ was in Miami approximately one and a half

months ago, at which time he stayed at the McAllister

Hotel. He rerained in Miani for several days, and then

went to San Juan, Puerto Rico for several days before

returning to Miani and subsequently to Panama.

JIMENEZ wag In Miami on his most recent visit

for the purpose of visiting a Cuban girl friend nared

VILVA MATILIA, who formerly resided in Miami, Florida,

and recently has moved to san Juan, Puerto Rico. MATILIA

had some difficulties taking an aucomobile to Puerto Rico

which had been purchased for her by JIMENEZ. JIMENEZ went

to Puerto Rico in order to pay the necessary import

• taxes required by the Puerto Rican Governuent on this

automobile.

JIMENEZ has not been known to have made any

statements indiessiug he was involved in a plot to

assassinate the President of Panana. Inasmuch as JIMENEZ

is currently attempting to set up a series of gambling

casinos in that country, it would appear foolhardy to be

involved in sich a plot, inasnuch as the gambling operation

requires the sanction of the Panananian Governnent. It 18

LUIS FERNANDEZ CASTRO, 844 Milaga Avenue,

Coral Gables, Florida, advised on October 9, 1962,

• be had been formerly employed on the bellboy staff at

the McAllister Hotel. He stated he had become acquainted

with JUAN E. JIMENEZ, Who was a guest at the Mealister

Hotel from time to time, and who had stayed there briefly

in June and July of 1962. He characterized JiMariL as a

wealtby Panamanian who spent money liberally, and boastfully

considered himself to be an important individual and a

"tough guy". FERNANDEZ CASTRO recalled on one occasion

in the Summer of 1962, that JIMENEZ had been loudly

bragging in the lobby of the MAllister Hotel that he

was involved in a plot agajnst the President of Panama.

JIMENEZ, who was always criticizing the bad situation

in Parama, stated that the current President of Panama

was too soft, and should be replaced.

He indicated that.

if the situation continued, he would have to take action..

Inasmuch as JIMENEZ made these statements in the

crowded lobby of the McAllister Hotel where he could be

easily overheard, it was FERNANDEZ CASTRO's opinion

he was only bragging, and trying to make himself look

important.

FERNANDEZ stated JIMENEZ was acquainted with

various Cubans in the Mami area, but he had no information

Indicating JIMENEZ had ever taken any action in connection

with the above plot against the President of Panama or

had contacted any local Cubans in this regard. FERNANDEZ

CASTRO reiterated he had never taken the boasting of

JIMENEZ seriously, and had considered the matter closed.

On 10/10/62, MM I-4 advised no further infor-

nation had come to that source's attention indicating any
