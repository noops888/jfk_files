oporations in this area.

Much of the time when they raise lasues

like this they are simply guessing and "fishing." Frequently their

can be countered by saying we agree that the propaganda "Ines"

should be discussed or they should tell us what they think the "line"

which should be in a normal situation clandestine. Accordingly,

I would suggest that you encourage the CRC toward diverting some

of the million dollars the White House promised them into forming

what they are doing and plan to do, so that ll we have assets and

approvals from our people we will

be in a position to coordinate

CLARK and HANLEY. He was unable then to say oxactly how or even .

If he could develop a commo line to Ramirez much less how he would

get arms to RAMIREZ, or anybody else by air, and in elther boat or

air operations there would have to be some assurance that he had the

capability to arrango a reception party. In Cuba for the arms, assuming

10. With regard to your item i, we too would liko to soo him exert

ome leadorahip and Induce these groupe to unite with him in one way

or another, but do not agren with him that In the long run much can bo

accompliahed by just saying "I control the money, and I am THE channel

to the U.S. Government." He must keep in mind that there are in

existence lote of channels to the U.S. Government and by that we do

not mean ColA.

Regarding your Item i1, you probably should omphasize to him

again that he has taken over the FRD budget and personnel and it Is

up to him to got them organized and doing something other than drawing

rolief checka.

12. Regarding your item 14, 1 suggest you continue your "coordination"

line with MIRO, pointing out these groupe are not under complete

control of C.l.A., that they do many things on their own, that we

merely support them from time to time, usually indirectly. Accordingly,

we are not in a position to "turn them over" to him, even if we wanted

to, which we at thla point, are not sure they would agree to in any case.

Ho will simply have to get into some working relationship with them,

using his million dollare or leadership, preferably the latter.
