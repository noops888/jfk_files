SUBJECT:

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE REQUESTS:

FOR ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCE

CHECKS (62-318)

As you are aware, Department is submitting by letter to

Bureau names of individuals presently being prosecuted or being

considered for prosecution in all types of cases with request they

be advised if any of these individuals have been involved in any

electronic surveillances. Indications are that there will be

thousands of such requests received. These names are checked

through special indices maintained

in Special Investigative Division

(SID) and Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), and Department is'

advised by letter of results.

SID is co-ordinating program, but

some correspondence will be prepared by DID and General Investigative!

Division if substantive cases supervised by them involved. If any

record is located, Field Office where surveillance occurred is

requested to furnish pertinent logs which are subsequently trans-

mitted to Department.

With representatives of SID; where majority of correspond-

ence will be handled, we have worked out mechanics of processing

and filing record material. Purpose of this memorandum is to set

forth these details.

A control file has been opened entitled, "Department of

Justice Requests for Electronic Surveillance Checks" (62-318). All

requests from Department will be filed in this file. Outgoing

answers to Department will also be filed in this file unless subject

of communication is subject of a Bureau investigation in which case

original will be filed in substantive file and copy in control file.

On any communications from Field relating to substantive file,, copy

will also be placed in control file. Supervisors preparing corre-

spondence should prepare extra copy specifically designed for

control file when correspondence relates to substantive case.

As set forth above, if subject of communication is subject

• of a Bureau investigation communication will be filed in case file

with copy in control file, and no indexing will be necessary. If

subject of communication is not subject of Bureau case, but voice was

recorded incidental to electronic-surveillance in one of our cases

and we are furnishing Department positive information, communication

•Will ve filed in control file and name of subjert will he indexed.

We will not index names of individuals on which no record is located

similar to procedure followed in handling Bureau's name check program.

Communications relating to these negative checks will be filed in

control file.

In order to appropriately cover necessary files, uniformity

of caption of communications is most desirable. On outgoing commu-

. nications to Field and Department, "Electronic Surveillance Check"

should be in caption to facilitate classifying material. If Bureau

case is involved, subject of case should also be part of caption

with sufficient copies to cover both case file and control file.

When Bureau has record on name check, Field is requested

to send in logs and copies are hand-delivered to Department.

Departmental official receiving logs is required to sign receipt

which should be attached to related outgoing yellow for filing

purposes by Supervisor preparing outgoing communication. Supervisor

should prepare sufficient copies of receipt appropriately designated

for substantive files in which electronic surveillances were conducted.

SUBJECT/SPECIAL/ INDICES OF ELECTRONIC

SURVEILLANCES

DATE:

January 11, 1967

PURPOSE:

The Special Investigative Division and the Domestic

Intelligence Division are maintaining separate special indices

Of

individuals monitored or mentioned through microphone or telephone

surveillances.

Those of the Special Investigative Division contair

names obtained through coverage of criminal matters.

Those of the

Domestic Intelligence Division contain names obtained

through

coverage of internal security matters. The purpose of this memo-

randum is to recommend that these two special indices be consolidate

and operated by ine Fiies anú Cummunicaiiuns Division.

BACKGROUND:

In accordance with the Director's instructions, special

indices were established in October, 1966, because of the

Department's insistence that the Bureau provide a rapid

determin-

ation as to whether any given person subject to prosecution was

overheard, present, or referred to in the course of a conversation

covered by electronic devices.

Based on available information at

• that time from the Department

that there would be selective cases

to be reviewed, it was determined to be most logical that two

separate indices be established, one to cover criminal matters

2nd

the other security matters..

Subsequently, the Solicitor General

publicly disclosed that an extensive review would be made on past

and pendin; cases to determine if evidence had been used from

electronic devices and the Department requests that all names

nanos as

searched rough both the criminal and security files. This

aspects of the operation of these indices

and the amount of work involved, particularly when the Depariment

began submitting not. only names of persons subject to prosecution

but names of attorneys involved and associates of the subjects.

CURRENT STATUS:

There are approximately 60,000 cards of the special

indices in the Special Investigative Division and approximately

Memorandum to Mr.

D. De Loach

RE:

SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

66-5815

200, 000 cards of the special indices in the Domestic Intelligence

DiVision. Furthermore, because of the telephone surveillances

currently in operation

in the security field, approximately 300

new cards are being received weekly in the Domestic Intelligence

Division.

CURRENT OPERATION OF SPECIAL INDICES:

Since the special indices were established in

October,

1966, the Department has subnitted approximately 1,000

names for searching.

Each name is searched through both of these

special indices. There is attached a sample of the form being

used requesting searches and a copy of three cards from the

special indices.

The Department has indicated that in the immediate

future it contemplates asking the Bureau to check as many as

25,000 names through the special indices. Minvut à doubt, all

future cases involving prosecution will require search of these

indices.

OBSERVATIONS:

The position adopted by the Department in these matters

makes it impossible for us to maintain these indices separately

'as originally established. The checking of these indices would

have imposed no great burden on either the Domestic Intelligence

• Division or the Special Investigative Division had the Department

followed a logical and reasonable course in the submission of

names of persons to be checked in connection with a particular

criminal or security prosecution.

But as matters now stand,

these separate indices should be consolidated to avoid duplicatio=

of effort in checking the same names through each as we now musi

do to comply with the Department's requests. Both Divisions are

in agreement on this point.

Consolidation of the indices into one raises

the

question of where it should be maintained. We believe the

consolidated indices should be maintained by the Files

and

Communications Division. There is no reason for it to. be main-

tained either by the Domestic Intelligence Division or the Special

The maintenance of this indices and the search functiors

involved fall logically within the normal operations and

responsibilities of the Files and Communications Division and

can be carried out in the most efficient manner by that Division.

memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

66-5815

The index cards are like other index cards in that

they show only where data is located. While there is limited

descriptive data on the cards, such data is sufficient to

immediately determine which of the possible idents should be

brought to the attention of the supervisor making the search

request.

Thereafter, he will handle the correspondence with

the field and the reviey of files to determine if in fact the

information in the surveillance logs referred to by the index

card relates to the subject of the inquiry.

Thus, the nature

of the responsibility of maintaining and searching the special

indices fits in with that of the Files and Communications Division.

•hile there is a degree of confidential information

on the cards in question, it is no more confidential than that

appearing on thousands of

cards in the general indices and other

records being maintained and searched by the Files and

Communications Division.

The information on the cards merely

discloses that there is infurmation identifiablo with subject

of the card but the card does not disclose any of the infor

mation which may have been received concerning the subject.

• The search for information of pertinence concerning

persons who are included in this indices is basically the same

as any other search for an outside agency for information

Bureau files. If the Civil Service Commission asks for infor-

mation from Bureau files, the Records Branch searches the

general indices and refers to the Name Check Section of the

General Investigative Division for possible identical references

in order that the General Investigative Division can review

pertinent files and give to the Conmission information found

to be applicable.

Checking the indices in question, as is true

of other name checks, is a broad

Bureau responsibility, not

chargeable exclusively to any one investigative division.

The searches of the cards are based on the requests

from the Department and involve cases of other Governmental

agencies as well as those of the Bureau having prosecutive

interests.

The extent to which this imposes a burden of

record keeping and index search functions unrelated to the

work of a Division is shown in the Domestic Intelligence

Division. Of the approximately 1,000 names searched there

to date, only 22 have been in connection with cases handled

in that

Division.

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the special indices under

ADDENDUM: W. S. TAVEL

FILES & COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION 1-16-67

I am opposed to the maintenance of this index being shifted to the Files

and Communications Division. It would not save personnel, since this division

is expending every effort to keep up with the greatly increased volume of other

types of name checks and could not absorb an additional 25, 000 or more with

existing personnel. This index has no relation to the Bureau's master index;

and must be maintained separately since the cards contain little or no identifying

Addendum to memo C. D.

DeLoach

Re: Special Indices of Electronic Surveillances

ADDENDUM: Continued

data. For this reason, each check where possible identity is established

necessitates correspondence with the field, which must be handled by the

substantive supervisor. Since the cards disclose names of all persons

mentioned in technical surveillance logs, it would appear essential to limit

the number of employees having access, to keep to a minimum those who

might be subpoenaed to testify concerning these matters. We do not have

since this room is in the Identification Building, moving it there would only

serve to further remove it from the supervisors handling it, who now have

immediate access. It is similar to other specialized indices now maintained

by substantive divisions, such as the Fugitive Index, Security Index, index of

library cards on communist material, etc., which serve a specific purpose

and arc most efficiently operated by the divisions using them.

they show only where data

The index cards are like other index cards in that

• is located.

While there is limited

descriptive data on the cards, such data is sufficient to

immediately determine which of the

possible idents should be

brought to the attention of the supervisor making the

search

request.

Thereafter, he will handle the correspondence with

the field and the review of files to determine if in fact the

information in the surveillance logs referred to by the index

card relates to the subject of the inquiry.

Thus, the nature

of the responsibility of maintaining and searching the special

indices fits in with that of the Files and Communications Division.

•While there is a degree of confidential information

on the cards in question, it is

; no more confidential than that

appearing on thousands of cards in the general indices and other

records being maintzined and searched by the files and

Communications Division. The information on the cards merely

discloses that there is infurmation iuenticinble with subject

of the card but the card does not disclose any of the infor

mation which may have been received concerning the subject.

The search for information of pertinence concerning

persons who are included in this indices is basically the same

as any other search for an cutside agency for information

Bureau files. If the Civil Service Commission asks for infor-

mation from Bureau files, the Records Branch searches the

general indices and refers to the Name Check Section of the

General Investigative Division for possible identical references

in order that the General Investigative

Division can review

pertinent files and give to the Commission information found

to be applicable.

Checking the indices in question, as is true

of other name checks, is a broad Bureau responsibility, not

chargeable exclusively to any one investigative division.

The searches of the cards are based on the requests

from the Department and involve cases of other Governmental

agencies as well as those of the Bureau having prosecutive

interests.

The extent to which this imposes a burden of

record keeping and index search functions unrelated to the

work of a Division is shown in the Domestic Intelligence

Division. Of the approximately 1,000 names searched there

to date, only 22 have been in connection with cases handled

in that

Division.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE:

SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

66-5815

RECOMMENDATION:

It is recommended that the special indices under

discussion of the Domestic Intelligence Division and

the

Special Investigative Division be turned over to the Files

and Conmunications Division and be maintained and searched

by that Division.

ADDENDUM: W.S. TAVEL FILES & COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION 1-16-67

I am opposed to the maintenance of this index being shifted to the Files

and Communications Division. It would not save personnel, since this division

is expending every effort to keep up with the greatly increased volume of other

types of name checks and could not absorb an additional 25, 000 or more with

existing personnel. This index has no relation to the Bureau's master index;

and must be maintained separately since the cards contain little or no identifying
