SAS DOUCE and FORSYTH

that he considers

FONTANA a hardened criminal and loyal

bodyguard of GABRIEL MANNARINO who would stop at nothing,

including murder, to maintain the power and influence of

the MANNARINO organization in New Kensington.

pointed out that in his judgment, FONTANA would never be

foolish enough to merely assault any member of law

enforcement because the person assaulted would probably

be in a position to testify after recovery and possibly

identify his attackers.

ADRIAN DAVIS, Apartment 820 Morrowfield Apartments, Pittsburgh, Pa.

T-3, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, stated that ADRIAN DAVIS, an admitted prostitute, has

indicated to him that she is well acquainted with the members

of the MANNARINO organization in New Kensington, including

SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO.

T-3 pointed out that DAVIS claims

to have received telephone calls at odd hours from the MANNARINO

brothers in the past and has been known to leave her apartment

for several hours at a time.

T-3 stated that DAVIS told him

that SAMUEL and GABRIEL MANNARINO have done favors for her in

the past but she declined to elaborate on the nature of such

favors.

T-3 said that DAVIS is extremely loyal

to persons

who have helped her in the past and since she obviously feels

some unexplained obligation to the MANNARINO brothers, he serously

doubted whether she would furnish any information in her

possession concerning their activities.

T-3 stated that not long ago DAVIS commented after

reading an article in the paper regarding GABRIEL MANNARINO'S

pro-longed disappearance; that she coud get in touch with

him if she had to. In conclusion, I-3 said that DAVIS had

nothing more to say on the subject and he did not consider

on she subjecti

it advisable to ask any questions.

as

He said that these

individuals had been

dealing with VALENTI but tried to hold up VALENTI for more

efforts to pressure him in this regard by having them murdered

in a garage.

T-12 stated that he was involved inasmuch as he

deceased, who had handled cases involving VALENII and his

associates. and that this individual also handled a coin machine

manufacturing concern in Chicago which was named the Filben.:

Corporation.

T-12 said he believed that this attorney might

have been even higher up in the mob than VALENTI and LA ROCCA.

that he and RED POLLOCK are now partners in the operation

of the Garden of Allah Motel, but denied that the MANNARINO

brothers have any interest in the motel. He refused to state,

however, whether the MANNARINO brothers may have put up money

in connection with his interests in the motel.

JOE MEROLA on August 25, 1958, advised SA EMRICH

at the Garden of Allah Motel that

SAMUEL MANNARINO does not

have any interest in that motel and if MANNARINO loaned any

money to anyone interested. in the motel, he is not aware of

Route 56, New Kensington, Pa.

T-14, who has furnished reliable information in the

past, on September. 9, 1958, stated that in conversation with

SAMUEL MANNARINO at the Ken Iron and Steel Company, on

September 3, 1958, MANNARINO authorized him to locate a group of

in forming. anprivate. club to take over: the management of the

I-14 explained that apparently MANNARINO does

not feel that the state of his health is such that he can

bear up under the responsibilities of managing the establishment

and that by leasing the business he could assure himself of a

substantial financial return without being saddled with the

responsibilities of the business.

T-14 stated that he gathered from their conversation

that MANNARINO has

cancelled the liquor license in the Lakeview

Recreation Area restaurant and has made arrangements with the

Liquor Control Board whereby the same license will be transferred

to a new location approximately 300 or 400 yards from the

Lakeview Recreation Area where MANNARINO is having the Murin

and Fiorina Construction Company build a new cocktail lounge.

T-14 said that according to MANNARINO, the decor

used in the new cocktail lounge will be along the western

style used in the Las Vegas gambling casinos.

T-14 staed that MANNARINO also told him that he

discovered large quantities of silica sand on his property

near the Wynel's Crossroads Section of New. Kensington (same

property on which Recreation Area is located) andhas been

selling the sand for $ 35 a ton to various

construction

companies in the New Kensington area.

T-14 said that MaNNARINO

told him that silica sand is a very salable product and

considered quite valuable especially in connection with the

building of new highways.

MANNARINO left I-14 with the

impression that he is reœiving considerable money from the

sale of silica sand located on his property.

Proposed $250,000 Motel,

Route 56, New Kensington

T-14,

on september 9,1958, stated that in his

conversation with SAMUEL MANNARINO on September 3,1958, he made

every effort to find out whether MANNARINO plans to go ahead

with the construction of the $250,000 motel on his property

near wynel's Crossroad, as previously reported.

T-14. said that MANNARINO told him that he does not

plan to actually go ahead with the construction of the motel

until the construction on : Route 56 is completed.

T-14 pointed

out that in this

way MANNARINO told him he would have an

opportunity to judge the extent. of traffic which would use the

highway and could determine: whether the motel would be profitable.

In this connection, T-14 ported out that Route 56

is currently being re-surfaced into a new four lane highway

which will run from New Kensington to Wynel's Crossroads..

September 18, 1958, SAMS was complaining

about a terrible hangover and mentioned that he got drunk

with GABRIEL MANNARINO during the evening of September 15

of the morning of.

September 16, 1958.. I-9 said that SAMS

also told him that MANNARINO has been back in New Kensington

since early September and is very unhappy about the lack of

business in the gambling casino and the general pressure being

brought

to bear on New Kensington by Federal investigative

agencies.

I-9 said that SAMS did not go into any further.

detail regarding his drinking bout with MANNARINO and T-9

considered it inadvisable to press him at the risk of

appearing to be too inquisitive.

T-9 pointed out that in

all probability, SAMS and MANNARINO did their drinking on

September 15 or 16, 1958, at the Laetus Club on Fifth Avenue,

New. Kensington, next door to the Triangle Billiards gambling

casino.

T-g noted that SAMS follows a strict daily routine

which includes being at the Laetus club.to supervise.the

MANNARINO sport betting operation usually until one or two

in the morning every day except Sunday and he seriously doubted

whether MANNARINO would risk drinking at any other establishment

providing, of course, they did not go to one of their homes.

T-9 assumed

that MANNARINO probably, entered the Laetus. Club

through the rear door on BariesStreet and spent the evening

with SAMS drinking in the Laetus. Club since the management

of that club would not betray MANNARINO nor would the local

police.

I-9, on September 19, 1958, said that JIMMY BUFFONE, Westmoreland

County Detective and Constable of the First Ward, New Kensington,
