Will ascertain through suitable pretext the current

residence of the subject. Note the address 6703 Polk Street,

West New York, New Jersey, furnished by MM T-1.

Will attempt to establish whether or not the subject.

intends to establish permanent residence in New Jersey.

NEW YORK. (INFORMATION)

An information copy of this report is being furnished

to New York as the subject is believed to be employed there

and investigation will undoubtedly be required of that office.

- ADMINISTRATIVE -

It is noted that the period of this report i8

lengthy; however, the investigation was maintained in current

status through the submission of referenced communications to

the Bureau. A penetrating investigation of the subject's

activities in Miami was not deemed advisable until recently

in view of the apparent eminent departure of IRVING RICHARD

POYLE frOm Cuba. * Since information received from CIA

indicates POili may be in Cuba for some

tim

more thorough

Investigation appears to be warranted.

CARLOS GONZALEZ DE TORRES was a Miami PCI until

March 26, 1962, when he was discontinued as it was believed

he furnished the same information to the Bureau and other

persons. On June 22, 1964, PEDRO NORIEGA, Source of Infor-

nation of the Miami Office, described DE TORRES as extremely

unreliable and an opportunist who would do anything for money.

in the political situation in Cuba. He advised that ALMUINA

decided to move from the seventh Street address when his girl-

friend arrived from Cuba and the four of them were unable to

live comfortably in the small apartment.

On August 13, 1963, SAM SACHS, 901 Southwest 1lth

Street, Apartment 6, advised

that ENRIQUE ALMUINA AGRA and his

wife moved into Apartment 5 on July 28, 1963. He advised that

the apartment was an efficiency and the rent was $90 a month,

furnished. He stated ALMUINA speaks excellent English and ap-

pears to be employed while his wife speaks no English and remains

in the apartment most of the time.

MM I-I, previously mentioned, advised on November 12,

1963, that sometime around the first of October, 1963, ALMUINA

and his girlfriend moved to a one-bedroom apartment costing

$70 a month, furnished, located at 329 Northwest 17th Avenue,

Apartment 2. ALMUINA told MM I-l that he was planning to

place his jewelry in a safety deposit box at the Pan American

Bank on the morning of November 13, 1963. According to MM I-1,

JOSE GARCIA (who resided with ALMUINA at 226 Southwest 7th

Street) was told by ALMUINA that he brought a suitcase filled

with his jewelry with him on the boat from Cuba. Also, ALMUINA

told GARCIA that he received the rest of his jewelry through

the Holland Embassy. According to GARCIA, the sister of

ALMUINA is married to a highly-placed communist in Cuba, who

has something to do with spreading communism in Latin America.

The subject and his brother-in-law are not supposed to be

friends; however, ALMUINA told GARCIA he left his car with

his brother-in-law when he left Cuba.

MM T-5, a person in a position to obtain such

information, advised as follows:

ENRIQUE ALMUINA AGRA has maintained an active

checking account, Number P11-55-264, with the Pan American

Bank of Miami, 250 Southeast Ist Street, Miami, Florida, since

February of 1963. This account has varied from a high of

$200 to a low of $5 with an average balance of under $100.
