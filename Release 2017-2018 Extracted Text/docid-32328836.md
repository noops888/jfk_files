one being mailed from New York City. In TROTSKY circles it was

considered that KLEMENT had been kidnapped by the G.P.U. (Soviet

Intelligence) and forced to write the letters.

noted that WELL is mentioned in KrEMENT's letter and the KLEMENT'S

stated that the difficulty he encountered in France in the late

1940's in legalizing his

stay was due to the police record of a

SOBOLEVICIUS who visited France in 1938. JACK SOBLE claimed that

this trench police record pertained to ROBERT SOBLE. It will also

be recalled that records furnished to the Legat,

noon on Wa. (Wednesday ?), July 13... He picked up his mail at the
