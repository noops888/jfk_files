negligible.

Through further inquiry at the bank, it was

ascertained that SNFE officials were bypassing the account

by sending through any sizable checks "for collection"

and

apparently maintaining their cash in a safety deposit

box at the bank.

In monitoring the account, it had

previously indicated that various delegations had been

transmitting funds to the national headquarters and 1t 1s

logical to presume that the Cleveland delegation has done so.

Since the SNFE in Miami appears to be handling all financial

transactions on a cash basis, further monitoring of their

account 1s not considered warranted. @ u

Referenced Birmingham airtel requested Miami furnish

any information to be found in the files of the Miami Office

regarding MARIO SALVADoR.

A review of the indices of the Miami Office regarding

MARIO SALVADOR reflects no

additional information.

Referenced Detroit letter set out lead for Miami

to check files and advise Detroit of the documentations concerning

"Cuba"

and "Correo" and whether copies were desired by Miami.

Adequate documentation of these publications is contained in this

report and all copies

of these publications are furnished to

Miami by MM 847-S. (@

â€¢ Bureau airtel May 11, 1964, Instructed that appropriate

informants and sources be alerted to furnish any information

indicating the SNFE 1s planning to leave for invasion or

infiltration of Cuba. MM 847-S has been instructed frequently

and at regular intervals to immediately furnish any information

indicating imminent action of this type on the part of the SNFE.

He is fully aware of the importance of doing this and of the

Bureau's interest.

Other Cuban sources have been alerted to

appropriately furnish such information. (44
