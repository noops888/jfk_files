Office of General Counsel

SUBJECT

BLUEBIRD/ARTICHOKE Soft File Review - "Kelly" -

Dimitrov, D.A.

1. I have been reviewing summary sheets prepared by the Office of

Security concerning several hundred soft files on individuals associated,.

or considered for association, in some way with the Agency's BLUEBIRD/

ARTICHOKE activities. In the course of that review I came upon the follow-

ing case which I discussed with Dick Lansdale and which we agreed should

be brought to your attention for your information and whatever action you

may deem appropriate.

2. As is indicated in the attached copy of the soft file summary and

the 27 January 1952 memorandum upon which it is based, D. A. Dimitrov,

designated "Kelly, " is a Bulgarian expatriate who appears to have been

imprisoned in Greece some time in 1950 and 1951 on false pretenses because

the Agency feared he would accept an offer from French Intelligence. After

six months in custody, he was flown to Panama where he was misrepresented

as a psychopath and confined in a U.S. Military Hospital for several months.

The official security file shows he was then removed from the hospital and

held by the Agency at Fort Clayton in Panama for three years. He was then

returned to Greece and ultimately allowed to enter the U.S. as a refugee.

It appears from the attached copy of a 7 February 1952 memorandum that

the "Artichoke approach," i.e., the use of drugs to reverse his hostility

toward the U.S. and U.S. intelligence agencies, was never consummated.

3. This man has had several contacts with the Agency since coming

to the U.S. In 1961 an Assistant to the DCI was contacted by a representative

of Parade magazine who had been informed by Dimitrov of his confinement

by the Agency. The Office of Security responded to the effect that this man

was disreputable, unreliable, and full of wild stories about CIA. As you

will note from the attached transcript of an 8 September interview on Good

Morning America, Mr. Dimitrov (now General Dimitrov and known as General

Donald A. Donaldson) apparently is alive and alleging that he knows who

ordered the assassination of President Kennedy •

4. Based solely upon the soft file summary, and prior to reviewing

the official security file from which I extracted the additional details, it

appeared to me that the nature of the Agency's treatment of Dimitrov might

be something which should be brought to the attention of appropriate

officials both within and outside the Agency. The fact that he is still

active and is making allegations connected with the Kennedy assassination

may add yet another dimension to this story •

I. Soft File Summary

1. Title of File: Kelly

2. :

Brief Biographic Data: Kelly's true name is

DIMITROV, a 29-year-old Bulgarian who was head of

a small political party based in Greece and

ostensibly working for Bulgarian independence.

3.

Nature of Relationship/Interest: It was learned

that French Intelligence Service was attempting

to bribe KELLY and make him a double agent and

Kelly appeared to be interested in the French offers.

Accordingly, a plan was made to have KELLY believe

that he was going to be assassinated and for protec-

tion he was placed in custody of the Greek police

who then put him in prison.

KELLY was held in the

prison for six months until the Greek authorities

decided that KELLY was was a nuisance and they told

our people to take him back. He was then flown to

Panama where; through arrangement, he was placed in

a U. S. military hospital as a psychopathic patient.

According to the 25 January 1952 memorandum, KELLY

had been in the hospital for several months

and the

hospital authorities want him out since he is causing

problems. He is not a psychopathic personality.

Because

of his confinement in a Greek prison and his

stay in a military hospital, KELLY became very hostile

toward the United States and our intelligence opera-

tions in particular.

OPC was considering an "ARTICHOKE" approach to KELLY

to see if it would be possible to reorient KELLY

favorably toward us. However, OPC advised on

Z February 195% that some opposition had arisen in

the top level of OPC to the handling of the KELLY

On Friday, 25 Janary 1952, the writer was called to tha office

of MI. Bannernan for the purpose of a conference with one H.

EE/OPC, cozceming the instant case.

explained in substance the Kelly case as follows:

KellJ, (whose real nane is Dinitroy), is a 29-year-old Bulgarlan and

was the head of a snall political party based in Greace and ostensively

wordg for bulgarlan Independence. Kelly was described byl

as being joung, ambitious, bright (elamentary collega edneation), a

sort ol a "man-on-a horsal typs bit a typical Balkan politician.

explained that they can dispose of Kelly by. the simple

process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuala, and

as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly ok.

However, because of his confinement in a Greek prison and his stay in

a military hospital, Kelly has becone very hostile toward the United

States and our intelligence operations In particular. Hence, O7C is

-considering an "Artichoke" approach to Kelly to see if it would ba

possible to re-orient Kelly favorably toward us. This operation, which

with a possibllity that Dr. Ecke and like Gladych will carry out the

Mr. Bannerman poistad out to

and reorienting an Individual in such a matter, in tha opirdon of-the

writer, cannot be accomplished easily and will require a great deal al

time and the & fact that an interpreter is necessary in the case com

plicates it considerably more. It is also believed that with ow present i

knowledge, we would have no absolute guarantee that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitude toward us even though

there is apparantly & successful response to the treatment. The writer

did not suggest tol

that perhaps a total amnesia could ba created
