(3) Maheu involvement in CIA domestic activities

In 1954 Maheu was recruited by the CIA for use

by the CIA's Office of Security for "extremely sensitive

cases."

He was paid $500 per month on the condition that

he move into his own private office (he had previously

shared office space with Carmine Bellino -- associated in

the past with illegal wiretapping) and be "on call" by the

Office of Security for sensitive assignments. The CIA doc-

uments do not indicate how long a period Maheu was on the

$500 per month retainer, but it would appear that this re-

tainer was only for the first year or two, i.e. 1954-55.

It was at this time that Maheu was first starting out in

the investigative area and in fact it was in the year 1954

that Maheu first formed his private investigations company

of Robert A. Maheu Associates. Through the previous testi-

mony of CIA official O'Connell we know that Maheu was used

for wiretapping and surreptitious entries. O'Connell re-

calls one specific incident of Maheu entering la studemtes,

apartment) in Washington, D. C. for the CIA. Maheu can pro-

vide detailed testimony on exactly what he did for the CIA,

how often and where.

(a) Wiretapping/Surveillance of Aristotle Onassis

In July of 1954 Maheu was hired by British

shipping interests sponsored by Stavros Niarchos.

During his

employment for Niarchos Maheu conducted a surveillance of

Aristotle Onassis in New York City. CIA documents indicate

that Maheu stated that he had technical coverage (wiretap)

of Onassis' New York apartment and that he used one of his

employees, John Frank, to perform electronic surveillance.

The CIA documents also indicate that Maheu hired a technician

by the name of "Leon" to perform this surveillance and that

the CIA "may have" been given some of the information.

received by Maheu from this technical coverage. Maheu can

provide an explanation for exactly what he did and what con-

nection he had with the Agency in this venture against

Aristotle Onassis.

(b) Procuring Females and Producing Films

of Foreign Leaders for the CIA

Maheu was used by the CIA in 1957, 1958, and

1959 on three different projects involving loaders of foreign

countries, Mine. heads of State

The first such project was

entitled.@Project-Happy-DaySland occurred in 1957. "In this

The CIA then, through its Technical Division, provided a

backdrop for the film, which would make the completed film

appear to, be a film of the foreign leader having an affair

in Russia.- The Agency was then to distribute the film in

the leader's country to embarrass him and to make him angry

at the Soviets.

'CIA documents indicate that while the

film was completed and sent to the office of Security of

CIA, it was never distrubuted abroad. The second project

which the Agency asked Maheu to complete was entitled

"Project HARPSTAR." In

this

1958 project, Maheu was requested

to and did obtain a woman

send overseas to try and "culti-

vate" the same foreign leader about which the film was made.

The woman was

apparently sent overseas but it is unclear

exactly what she

did with regard to

the.

foreign leader.

Maheu should be able to provide the details. Maheu was in-

volved with

the CIA in still a third project which was en-

titled

"Project NORFOLK." In this project, Maheu was asked

to and

provide "female companionship" in June!of 1959

actress and she was, instructed that the clA

wanted here

to go to bed" with the foreign leader.

The ClA rented a

house in Long Island for the female and the leader to stay

at, and they did stay there during the month of June 1959.

The CIA documents also reveal that mail sent between the

female and the leader was opened and that they were otl

wise surveilled. Maheu may explain upon whose authority

this was done and to what extent the CIA was involved.

Maheu will be able to testify about the exact instruc-

tions he received and the persons he dealt with at the CIA

in these three projects which were mounted aga inserteadens

off torei

coun

Sa Maheu may also be able to provide

any hearsay knowledge that he might have about the use of

the CIA's Technical Services Division for other such pro-

jects or programs. Note: TSD also produced the poison

pills for Castro and, allegedly, poison virus for Lumumba.

(c) Maheu's Provision of

Cover

Facilities for CIA Agents

Maheu provided the CIA with (1) use of Maheu's

office as a live address for cover, (2) assistance in ob-

taining safehouses, (3) use of Maheu to provide cover employ-

ment for CIA personnel both in the United States and abroad.

In this regard, CIA documents establish that Maheu provided

cover for a CIA employee fun Washing tons DinGo. who, was

It is unknown exactly what

this employee did in the United States. Additionally, CIA

documents establish that Maheu provided cover for a CIA

employee

from August 1968 to December 1970.

Again, it is unknown exactly what this Agency employee did

in that country. Maheu should know details.

(d) Miscellaneous Activities of Maheu for CIA

CIA documents seem to

indicate that Maheu was requested to provide the CIA with an

entree into the

field. The documents

reference Maheu's involvement with David. J, MacDonald

The details and import of this are unknown at the

present time, and, of course, Maheu should be able to elab-

orate on what, if anything, was involved in this.

between Maheu and the CIA occurred when Maheu was either

attempting to line up Hughes as a major client or actually
