In response to Mr. Fenn's letter of 14 November 1975 to

Mr. Frank Foster which posed a number of questions on matters

related to President Kennedy's assassination, the following

information is provided:

NSA has identified some four foreign communications which

mention Lee Harvey Oswald, but has not identified any messages

to or from him.

and contain official Cuban comments regarding press items which

discuss Oswald's activity in late September 1963 to obtain a:

Cuban visa to travel to Moscow and also comments on the assina-

tion itself.

The messages are dated in the last week of

November 1963.

mentioning Marina Oswald, Jack Ruby or Earl Ruby.

The specific questions asked and responses follow:
