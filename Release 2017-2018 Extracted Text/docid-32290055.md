Report of SA T. M. HENDRICKS, JR., 11/22/61 ::

Investigation reflected that none of the above

individuals possess federal wagering stamps. The baseball

inning tickets are alleged to be drawn from a device

similar to a punchboard on an imaginary game between teams

of the American and National Leagues.

These tickets are

sold throughout the day in Meridian, mostly to Negroes and

then sometime each day there is a machine from which

colored balls are dropped into a trough representing nine

innings of a baseball game. Winners are determined from

use of this machine.

The operation of this baseball inning

ticket game may constitute a lottery which will bring 1t

in the jurisdiction of the U. S. Treasury Department and

the operators might be required

to possess federal wagering

stamps.

By separate letter Mr. JAMES J. ENOCH, District

Director, Internal Revenue Service, Jackson, Miss., Is

being advised of the above.
