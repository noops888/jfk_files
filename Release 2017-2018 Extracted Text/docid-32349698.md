BETH MUAVE CONCLUSION THAT PRESS PLAY DE MILLION DOLLAR RASOM CASE,

WILL NOT WORSEN AMCOG-2 AND 3 SITUATION. IN DISCUSSING PSYCH PLAY

WITH AMCOG-I IN GENERAL TERMS WE TEND HONOR CERTAIN MIS SUGGESIIONS

WHICH ARE:

A. HE SHOULD HOLD PERSONAL PRESS CONFERENCE RATHER IHAN

SIMPLY HAVE RANSOM STORY HANDED OUT TO PRESS.

B. EXILE ORGS AND/OR PRESS CHANNELS SUSPECIED OF ODYOKE

SPONSORSHIP SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR INITIAL RELEASES

C. IN PRESS CONFERENCE AMCOG-I SHOULD EMPHASIZE PATHETIC

ROLE OF EX-PRESIDENT UNCLE, ADDRESSING APPEAL LATIN AMERICAN AND

EUROPEAN STATESMEN CONTEMPORARIES OF UNCLE FOR MELP. SHOULD DE-

EMPHASIZE ROLE BROTHER AND SISTER, CITING THEM AS ANTI-CASTRO

WHICH TO RESPOND TO DEI, SO THAI ALL DETAILS PITCH TO AMPOON-I ÄND

ALTERNATIVE PRESS PLAY CAN BE WORKED OUT. OUR MAIN SUGGESTED THEMES

FOR PRESS PLAY WOULD BES

A. HAVING BEEN DRIVEN TO EXPORT STOLEN ART OBJECTS AND

JEVELS TO SAVE HIS COLLAPSING ECONOMY, CASTRO NOW TURNING TO SALE

HUMAN LIVES IN LAST DITCH ATTENPT RAISE FUNDS.

BO FAILING OBTAIN MONEY CASTRO SEEKING USE THREAT OF DEATH

AND TORTURE TO GET EXILED RELATIVES OF PRISONERS IN CUBA

TO CARRY

OUT ESPIONAGE AND SUBVERSION AGAINST LATIN AMERICA AND AMERICA.

".C. MEXICO USED AS NEUTRAL BASE FOR RANSOM AND RECRUITMENT

DEALS AND AMCOG-I SPECIFICALLY ASKED BY DEI SPY AGAINST MEXIÇAR COURS

AS ALTERNATIVE TO PAYING RANSOM. D

14. DOUBT TAPES CAN BE USED PRESS PLAY, BUT FEEL USEFUL

WORSEN AMCOG-2 AND S SITUATION BECAUSE

A. MOST UNLIKELY GOC WILL EXECUTE EITHER A-2 OR A-3, SINCE

FAME AND FOLLOWING OF UNCLE WOULD RESÜLT. HIGILY ADVERSE OPINION

RE CASTRO REGIME BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CUBA.

B. VARIOUS LATIN AMERICAN STATESMEN AND ORGANIZATIONS HAVE

SOUGHT INFLUENCE CASTRO RELEASE AMCOGS TO NO AVAIL AND WE DO NOT

BELIEVE FREEDOM AMCOGS CAN BE OBTAINED BY ANY FURTHER LOW-KEYED

DIPLOMATIC NOTES.

C. RECENT LETTERS FROM AMCOG-2 FEMALE FRISED

IDEN-S SHOw

SHE HAS MOVED INTO AMCOG-S HOUSE AND TAKEN OVER AS WARDER OF AMCOG I

UNCLE BEMALF DSE. HE NOW VIRTUALLY CUT OFF FROM FORMER FRIENDS

EXCEPT FOR VISITS IDEN-2 AND EX-KUBARK AGENT AMGAEL IC-I WHO HIS

PERSONAL DOCTOR. AMCOG-I STATES IDEN-2 LETTER INDICATES IDEN-2

ALSO MOST PROBABLY UNDER DSE CONTROL. WE CONVINCED UPCRY BY

LATIN AMERICAN, VATICAN AND SPANISH STATEMEN COULD FORCE CASTRO

REGIME SEND UNCLE OUT TO FREE WORLD TO PROVE PRESS CHARGES RE

CAPTIVE PRESIDENT FALSE.

D. SHOULD AMPOON-I REPORT RECRUITMENT PITCH BY ARCOG-I OR
