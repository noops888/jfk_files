Memorandum Branigan to Sullivan

Re: ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT KENNEDY

62-109060

SECRET

DETAILS:

Merriman Smith, senior White House correspondent,

reported Garrison alleges David William Ferrie was associated

with a group of anti-Castro Cubans which trained at Lake

Pontchartrain,

Louisiana, during the period 1961-1962. LOn

February 23, 1961, CIA confidentially informed this Bureau

that in connection with a sensitive CIA project directed

against Cuba, one phase of which involved the training of

Cuban exiles, CIA would initiate a training operation at

Camp Belle Chase, located a short distance south of New Orleans

said Lake Pontchartrain. CIA advised that this camp had been

a deactivated Naval base but would be reopened by CIA under a

Department of Army cover.

CIA further advised it would be

training from 15 to 40 Cubans at a time for a period of about

five weeks.

We, of course, did not investigate CIA's activities

at Camp Belle Chase, Louisiana, and our files contain no

information that David William FerFlebad any connection with

this CIA operation.

In July, 1963,

we received information from several

sources that a number of Cuban refugees had come to New Orleans

from Miami, Florida, through the efforts of Rudolph Davis,

Fla

reportedly to attend a training camp after which they would be

sent to a training camp in Guatemala.

Sources reported this

group became disenchanted and returned to Miami shortly after

their arrival.

We interviewed Rudolph Davis in this matter and he

indicated he acted

as a coordinator_ between the Movimiento

Democratica_Cristiano (MDC), an anti-Castro organization, and

the New York City Police Department in 1961 and that he was the

delegate for this anti-Castro organization in New Orleans. He

stated he came to New Orleans in August, 1961, and in early

1963 made friends with persons in the lumber business in

Guatemala with whom he formed the Guatemalan Lumber and Mineral

Corporation. Davis said he brought approximately 19 men to

New Orleans

to train for lumber cutting work in Guatemala. He

added that when the men learned they were to work in a lumber

industry and were not recruited for military operations against

Cuba, they became disenchanted and returned to Miami.

Our

files contain no information indicating that David William

Ferrie or Lee Harvey Oswald had any contact or connection with

Davis or the anti-Castro organization which Davis represented.
