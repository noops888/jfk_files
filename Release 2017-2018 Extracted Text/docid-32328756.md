SAVARESE :

He knows.

It should mean that everything is

all right. But he talked to some other

fellow there.

About a month ago.

And

I know we don't like this guy so I spoke to

VITO and told him I might have to make a

trip.

He said whenever

you're ready. I didn't

want to make it too soon. Because then a

lot of time lapses.. I'd rather make it

as close as possible. So that's about

it.

FERRARO:

OK GEORGIE.

It is noted that FERRARO referred to SAVARESE as

GEORGIE, however, GEORGIE is in all probability a common

nickname

used by FERRARO in his relationship with SAVARESE.

SAVARESE's reference to VITO is unknown; however, the possibility

exists that this may be VITO GENOVESE, New York top hoodlum.

DOMINIC "HUNK" GALIANO

Information pertaining to GALIANO is furnished else

where in this report under Las Vegas Gambling Interests section.

GALIANO who, until recently, was relatively unknown in crime

syndicate circles is, according to CG 6272C, a rising hoodlun

on Chicago's north side who may possibly be replacing in stature

JIMMY ALLEGRETTI and JOSEPH DI VARCO.

FRANK "SKID" CARUSO

CARUSO is an old-time, well-known Syndicate gambling

representative of Chicago's south side.

CG 6343-C* advised

on April 5, 1960, that FRANK FERRARO and CARUSO had a short

meeting during which the following was discussed:

CARUSO:

Hello FRANKIE. I just come in to drop

something.

The first District. They beat

the (obscene) out of him.

FERRARO:

CARUSO:

For what.

Nothing. He was at the Brass Rail:
