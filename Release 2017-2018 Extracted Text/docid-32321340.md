(JFKTF) with written clarification regarding the file numbers of

the enclosed documents.

Enclosures:

Copies of 3 documents, with file covers and ELSUR

sheets corresponding to each document.

Details:

New York has previously forwarded to JFKTF the

identified on the New York ELSUR sheets attached to each file.

On these ELSUR sheets, the original file number is crossed out

not reflect the new file number.

JFKIF requests that New York reply by EC no later than

c.o.B. 9/17/98, setting forth specific details regarding the

change of file number for each of the attached ELSUR references.

The information currently provided by the ELSUR sheets is not,

sheets.
