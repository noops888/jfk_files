COUNTERINTELLICENCE PROGRAM,

INTERNAL SECURITY,

DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

Re Bureau letter to Atlanta dated 9-2-64.

To implement a counterintelligence program as

outlined in referenced lettes,

this office has been and will

continue to penetrate klan and hate organizations with

continued informant coverage. This is the first step to learn

the complete organizational structure, members, their activities,

sympathizers and followers, action they pian, including actions

of violence and distruction of property.

Once their activities, etc., are determined through

inormant coverage proper action can be taken to disrupt and

neutralize their activities and efforts can be directed to

frustrate their plans. In addition, those specifically

responsible for unlawful actions are determined through informant

coverage.

Informant coverage will be specifically concentrated

on the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan since this is the

largest and most important of the klan groups in Mississippi.

Othes pertinent organizations considered

for counterintelligence

action are:

Mississippi Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

United Klans of Amesica, Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.

Americans for the Preservation of the White Race.

HH 55120

DocId: 32989629

## Page 6

The pertinent individuals to first consider are the

state officers of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. They

are:

SANUES BOWERS, Laurel, Mississiopi, Imperial Wizard

JULIUS

_MARPER, Crystal Springs, Mississippi," Grand

"Dragon

BILLY BUCKLES, Roxie, Mississippi, Grand Giant

A: -C. HARRINCION, Ruth, Mississippi, State Ozganizar

the Klans

-Bureau of Investigation (KBI)

PAUE FOSTER, Natchez, Mississippi, State Chaplain

AGE WEATHERS, Hattiesburg; MiSSisSIppI,. Contact

Leader for the County and Secretary

Informant coverage will be supplemented by technical

installations where practical. Specifically, it has been

learned through an informant

that a klan group holds meetings

in a building especially built for this purpose in Gopiah

Counsy. These meetings are held on a weekly basis. The

building is in a rural area several miles from the nearest town

and has access by only one road, During meetings guards are

placed at strategic points outside the building to insure

complete privacy. An appropriate survey is being made to

determine the feasibility of a technical installation in this

building. The Bureau will be advised by separate communication

regarding this. Other logical points are being determined for

this type of coverage.

COUNTERINTELLICENCE ACTION

1. Liaison is established with the governor's office

to bring pressure to bear on local officials, such as mayors,

chiefs of police, sheriffs, etc., to solve recent bombings,.

church bumings, and other acts of violence.

EXZ2I0:

Jackson teletype to the Bureau duted i0-12-1

captioned UNSUBS; EXPLOSION ON LAWN OF RESIDENCE OF I0R

JOMY NOSSER-NATCHEZ-MESSISSIPPI, 9-25-64, stated that an

Investigator of the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol (MS?)

advised he was instructed by Cevanor pAy JOHNSON to

inform Adams County Sheriff ODELL ANDERS that the governor

was seriously considering sending the National Guard into

Asans County to close down all gambling and liquor activity

in the county: Sheriff ANDERS advised he is in the process

of contacting all gambling

and liquor establishments in Adams

County to inform operators that if pertinent information zegarding

Natchez bombings are not in his possession by October 15 he

will close all such establishments on October 15..

The Jackson Office will, in each instant, that presents

itself in other localities and counties, arrange for similar

action and follow through on each.

2. Repeated contacts and constant interviews of

known and

suspected klan members are being conducted each

Saturday •

This has been done since July, 1964, and is being

continued. This has a three fold purpose. It lets the klansmen

know the FBI is intacested and will be around. It also enables

FBI to know their whereabouts on that day, become better

acquainted with their habits and gain more background information

regarding the person being interviewed. In sevecal instances

during such interviews it has been possible to convert certain

klansmen into informants. During interviews of klansmen who

are completely unco operative and who want to know how we got

their name and why they ase being interviewed we can flip

through the caids and pick out a name of another klansman

who

is completely. unco-operative. This is a disruptive tactic

which can breed suspicion among themselves.

3. Consideration is being gien to invite the £=c=e

Police to make raids at Inown klan meetingo, the juana dicin

of course, will not be invited to partico une sece cant i

most likely in on the klan reetings. MUS? Investigators at

McConb have indicated they seemed interested in this sort of

thing and it is believed this will have the backing of the

governor since he has indicated such to them.

This type of

thing, of course, will be used at places where technical

installations are not

feasible or productive.

4. Will pasticipate with the governor in press

releases on the arrests of klansmen when appropriate.

This

has been done in the recent arrests in McComb, Mississippi,.

in connection with recent bombings in that area.

5. Information has been developed through an informant

that a faction of the klan is interested in putting another

man in office rather than the present person.

More information

is being obtained on this so as to exploit all possibilities.

and create dissention among the leaders, and by doing so the

opportunity may present itself to have the informant put in a

high office.

The above is some of the potential counterintelligence

action contemplated by this office.

It is being studied on a

day to day basis. The Bureau will be furnished with complete

details on all the above plans as the opportunities are made •

and present themselves, prior to any specific action being

taken by this office.

SOTION GROUPS

Recent actions of violenca in loconb, hississiplation

were for the most past believed to be carried out by an

group". As a result of an intensive investigation and informant

coverage, 1l men were arrested. One had a membership card in

the Ku Klux Kian and another a card for membership in tha

SUBJECT:

-COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

INTERNAL SECURITI

DISRUPTION OF HATE GROUPS

DATE: 10/72/54

ReBulet 9/2/64 to Atlanta and other offices.

It is noted this letter lists as one of the target organizations,

as No. I on page 2, the Independent Klavern, Fountain Inn, S. C.-

Since this organization is no longer active or in existence,

it

is suggested it be deleted from this list.

-..

Since the major organization in Charlotte Division

is the United Klans of America, Inc., of wich Birmingham is

origin, a copy of this letter is being designated to Bimingham

fo= infosmation.

Ine following represents the consensus of Charlotte

Agents

faniliar with Klan activity:

1. Disruptive activity should not be undertaken at

= particular Klavern; as a general rule, unless there is

•sufficient well established informant coverage to be able so

tell the effect of the action when instituted. Such action

would probably serve to "tighten ug" the organization ana maxe

it more difficult to get an informant in thereaftes,

2. It is considered douotful that newspaper publicity,

Of only a generally unfavorable nature against the klan organi-

zation, is effective in seducing new applicants or causing any

lasge number of present menbers to drop out. The "Charlotte

Observer," which has wide distribution throughout Nosth and

south Carolina, published in August and Septembar, 1954, a series

of articles, copies of which were sent the Bureau by Charlotte

letter of 9/15/64.

These adtfiles ridiculed the united Klans

of America, Inc., in North Carolina, and published both photos

and names of a number of members. So far as has been learned

fom informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the

organization.

It was alleged that two to five members weze

discharged from theis jobs, of warned about continuing member-

ship, but the identities of these alleged persons is not known,

Worth Carolina Grand Dragon JaMas Ro/EONaS has stated, both

publlcly and privately to informants, that this publicity was

very valuable to the growth of the organization.

One informant

reported that the day after the articles published his name as

a Local leader, three persons contacted him and applied for

membership, stating they had not previouslv known whom to contact.

It is considered that pubItcity"of this type generally

deters from joining only those persons who would not be

interested in joining in the first place. It is believed that

a large proportion of those persons who are potential members

are seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent

to them; it makes them

feel important and members of an impostant

gzoup.

The major apparent eifect of the series of newspapei

articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, ană

refusal of leaders to allow newspaper photos of individual

Klansmen to be taken at public rallies.

3. Distuptive activity, wherever possible, should be or

nature which does not expose

the fact that the Bureau, of the

"Federal Government", is behind the activity. It is balieved

thai open action, to a large extent, can backfire and create

resentment and sympathy.

It must be remembered that Klan

membership, in many sections, does not by any means carry the

odium that alleged Communist membership

or sympathy does in

almost any section of society.

4. Along this same line, there is probably no point in

trying disruptive activity, at least not at this stage, on a

local klan group which is small, inactive, and peaceful. Any

such activity which is not completely discreat and concealed

would likaly have the effect of stirring it up.

-..

By letter of 9/26/54, Charlotte furnished the Bureau

a sample of a lapel pin which was adopted at the toarial

there is apparently considerable demand for it. Since it is

not apparent to the unitiated that it has anything to do

with "the klan," it is expacted that memoers will wear it.

openly as a seczet recognition signal. If it does become

widely adopted and worn, consideration should then be given to

giving widespread publicity to tha fact of what it represents.

This should have the result of aiscouraging some persons who

do not want their Klan membership publicly known.

6. It is considered that possibly the most effective

way of discouraging membership, of causing existing members

to withdraw, is to establish that someone in the organization

is getting rich off it, or embezzling the proceads.. Charlotte

is endeavoring to develop information along thesa lines, but

nothing specific has yet been develoged.

7. The following are suggested tactics that appear

useful on a selected basis against individual Klansmen,

pasticularly those whose employers might doject to their xlan

membership:

a. Anonymous letter or phone call to the employer

telling of the Klan membership.

b. Enter on behalf of the memoes a subscription to

the

• "Fiazy Cross," United Klans of America publication, and have

it mailed

1 to his employment.

c. Then a particular member is away from home at a

Klavern meeting, have a female phone his home and indicate he

was to meet her and is late. This might have the effect of

making it difficult for him to get away from home at night

thereafter. This should be limited to particular individuals

who are considered potential ones to stir up trouble in a Klavern.

It is suggested consideration be given to asking the

No particular such groups, given

to violence, are known within Klan organizations in Charlotte

territosy.

As the Bureau is aware, United Klans of America has

instituted what it calls

"Security Guards," who waar military

type uniforms and have military ranks.

These function at

public tallies for the purpose of keeping order, watching for

"spies," etc.

It is expected that it violence is undertaken,

these will probably be the ones to do it, but no such under-

takings have been learned.

Spacific individual recommendations for counter

a islavern member is leader of this chapter.

Approxinately

eight to ten people attend the monthly meetings of the

John Birch Society Chapter; and of the men who attend,

all are klavern members with the exception of one man.

Menbers of the klavern completely control and dominate

the John Birch Society Chapter in Pine Bluff.

They,

however, only conduct john Birch Society business.

Like-

wise, the members of the klavesn further the john

Birch

Society program through the klavern.

Members of the klavern are working individually

in politics for the re-election of Goveznoz-ORVAlE.

The klavern has not advocated any violence but

on occasion has cautioned its members against violence.

As an example, klavern members were cautioned to stay.

attempting to integzate, in

the spring of 1964 so that

no violence would occur.

Members of the klavern recently distributed a

Ku Klux Klan (KKK) leaflet seeking new zenbers and

## Page 25

stating requests for applications be directed top. O.

30X 1182, Pine Blull.

In this leaflet it was pointed

out that

the KKK was

striving for a laviul settlement

of the difficulties brought on by the National Associa-

cion for the Advancement of Colored People (NAAC) and

that it is opposed to violence.

This leaflet further set

forth

that this was a chartered, legalized movement and

it is no more, illegal. to be a member of it than to be a

member of other

organizations.

At various times in

the past the klavern has

attempted to organize "action" groups within the klavern,.

but on each occasion the project has died from lack of

interest.

In line with Bureau policy of dissemination of

infornation,

the nain activities regarding the Pine Bluff

Klavern have been disseminated confidentially to Chief

_Of-POlICE NORHAN.D. YOUNG, Pine: BluII, (NA) On a regular

basis.

Chief. YOuNG has exerted every

effort to keep down

the possibility of violence.

Through his confidential

sources he is also well aware of the identities of the

klavern members and their activities. He personally

has warned particula klavern members against any violence

and has sited they will be met with inmediate arrest

if any violence occurs.

As an example, Chie:- YOUNG was

advised through his own confidential source of the tine

and location of the klavern neeting on the night of

October 5, 195%.

Chief-young sent a lieutenant of his

department in uniform to check the location; record

license numbers, and to be seen checking the meeting

SO

that the klavern members would know that he was checking

on then.

This has had a strong influence on making the

Klavern follow a line of legal activity. It has also

resulted in the more responsible leading citizens of the

community being made aware of certain klavern members,

causing these klavern members to be discredited in the

eyes of the public.

This was borne out in the recent

school board election on 9/29/64 when two klavern members,

one of whon is JaF. BUTRAM, were miserably defeated.

The klavern has during the past few months

urged its members to solicit and obtai: new members.

Bureau's consideration:

I. Proposal = To increase Financial Burden

of the American Nazi Party

Brief Resume of Current

Economic Problems

The principal reainess in the Chicago unit of the

American Nazi Party exists in their inci of sunds to operate.

This lact aiona nas forestalled all the participation of the

Chicago organization in public demonstratiors and other

activities in that sufficient zonies are not available to

provide necessary bonds and/or fines should menbers be

arrested during the course of such activity.

Further, the Chicago American Nazi Party bas

recently purchased

a building which they utilize as a

headquarters.

The building is old and in dire need of

repair..

dozigage payments and maintenance alone absorb

the bull of 21l funds which the Chicago uni collects.

Proposed Plan of Approach

In that it is the desire of the local Anerican

Nazi Party to "hold onto" their headquarters buz-cing at

aid cosis, lt is apparent that the trot line of approach

to increase the organization's financial burden is to

dizect our efforts

at the headquarters building itself.

Discreet inquizy and observation has shown the

building has numerous building code violations, some oi

In that the American Nazi Party has in the past

information which can serve to initiate an atiack by these

organizations againsi the American lazi Party. Prominent

among such crganizations are the Jerish la= Veterans and

The Chicago Division, either by direct approach

to established sources in these orgarizations, or through

use of suitable pretexi, can rake availaole to appropriate

officials infornation establishing the fact that such building

code violations do exist.

There is to doubt that should

such inforzation becone available to proper individuals within

these organizations, great pressure will be brought to bear

• i0 insist that these building code violations sio corrected

As an alternative, a direct approach can be made

to increase the organization's financial burden is to

direct our efforts at the heacquarters building itseli.

Discreet inquiry and observation has shown the

which make the building nainly uninhabitable until such

violations are rectifiac such as electrical vizing and

It is recognized that building code authorities

will allow such deficiencies io exisi for a reasonabla

Doziod of time and during such time habitation on the

premises is permitted.

Violations such as those mentioned

are known to be costly to elininate and are of the type

that cannot or should not be

authorities.

In that the American Nazi Party has in the past

Chicago Jewish organizations are most desirable of accumulating

infoination which

can serve to initiate an attack by these

organizations againsi the American Nazi Party. Prominent

among such organizations are the Jewish War Veterans and

League B'nai B'rith.

The Chicago Division, either by direct approach

to established sources in these organizations, or through

use ca suitable preten, can make available to appropriate

officials information' establishing the lact thai such building

code violations do exist.

There is no doubt that should

such incornation become available to proper individuals within

these organizations, great

pressure will be brought to bear

to insist thai these building code violations are corrected

and the possibility strongly exists thai court action may

follow and fines may be levied.

As an alternative, a direct approach can be made

possible recruitment of new members.

:.

The UNA,

KiKK often holds public meetings on private

property leased for that burpose.

At these meetings, officials

make speeches and invite spectatoss to make application for

nembership.

Informants report that the actual purpose of such

a meetins is to publicize the klan and secure new members.

In a few instances, informants have reported that

some members

arriving at the meetings have intentionally covered their

license plate with a confederate flag metal insignia or with

a facsimile.

On occasions, both the rear and front license

plates have

been obscured or usually only the front license

obscured. It is believed through the cooperation of the High-

way Patrol on a command level, that patrolmen might be assigned

to the area where the meeting is held so that if the klan

mombers leaving the meeting continue to have their license plate

obscured,

they may be arrested fos violation of the state law

prohibiting such.

In connection with the informant program of the Knoxville

Office, certain persons are interviewed to ascertain their

cooperation and their potentials as a possible informant.

It is believed that in

such cases where antagonism is shown

to the Agents' contact, that a later anonymous call might be

made to other menbers accusing the person contacted by the

fluence anong the sank and file and would arouse suspicion and

distrust,

This same plan could be pursued further and caris

be made to members even though they had not actually been con

tacted by an Agent in connection with the informani program.

Additional ideas and tactics were discussed but were

not considered

feasible.

Many of the ideas were discarded

because it was believed

that other actions proposed would

greatly jeopardize our present informant coverage.

As the

Bureau is aware, this office has informant coverage in these

organizations on a very high level and we have been able to

secuce detailed information on membership rolls and appli-

cations, as well as detailed information on personal activities

• of members, as well as detailed activity of the membership as

a group.

The Bureau has previously been advised that the program

interviewing klan members at the time of the assassination

of President KENNEDY and later in connection with the bombings

in Birmingham tended to jeopardize our informant coverage,

due to their high-level positions and the fact that some of

the klan members felt that the information in the possession

of the IBI could only have been obtained from some high official

source in the Islan

Agent personnel responsible for the klan investigations

are continuing to give this program thought and attention, and

arriving at the meetings have intentionally covered their

license plate with a confederate flag metal insignia or with

a facsimile.

On occasions, both the rear and front license

plates have

been obscured or usually only the iront license

obscured. It is beliaved through the cooperation of the High-

Patrol on a command level, that patrolmen might be assigned

to the area where the meeting is held so that if the klan

meners leaving the meeting continue to have their license plate

they may be arrested for violation of the state law

prohibiting such.

in connection with the informant program of the knoxville

Office, certain persons are interviewed to ascertain their

cooperation and

their potentials as a possible informant..

It is believed that in

made to other membei's

This would cause a disruptive in-

fluence among the sank and file and would arouse suspicion and

distrust.

This same plan could be pursued lucinei doù

be made to members even though they had not actually been con

tacted by an Agent in connection with the informant progcan.

Additional ideas and tactics were discussed but were

not considered feasible.

Jany of the ideas were discarded

because it was believed

that other actions proposed would

greatly jeopardize our present informant coverage.

As the

Bureau is aware, this office has informant coverage in these

organizations on a very high level and we have been able to

secure detailed information on membership rolls and appli

cations, as well as detailed information on personal activities

of members, as well as detailed activity of the membership as

a group.

The Bureau has previously been advised that the program

interviewing klan members at the time of the assassination

of Presideni KINODY and later in connection with the bombings

in Birmingham tended to jeopardize our informant coverage,

cue to their high-level positions and the fact that some of

the klan members felt that the information in the possession

of the IBI could only haye been obtained from some high official

source in the klan.

howavor, the married

is not inown to have

been any further development of thai

Pertinent to this analysis is the following

osservation: Within the past 70 days, Montgomery, Ala.,

wore activity of UKA and 'ASRI are centralized, has

experienced desegregation of restaurants, hotels, motels,

and public senools, pursuant to the 1964 Civil Rights

¡ou and pursuant to orders of the United States District

court at honegomery Initially, particularly on 7/4 anc

7/0/c÷, following ühe passage of the 1964 Civil Rights

thure was an atteupt by Klansmen to gather and con-

spire for she purpose of interioring with the desegregation

of ovie theaters and restaurants in downtown Montgomery.

Footer, Robile inforaants furnished information well in

aurance of the actual proposed action, enabling Mobile to

notify the Honügomery Police Department.

The Police Depart-

want acted very promptly and efcectively, disbursing Klansmen

'o nad jachered in the danger area, and

making it quive

clear that no unlamiul activity or interference with the

oncorcement of the 1954 Civil Rights Act would be tolerated.

sorn the fact that the information was leaked to authorities

and the fact thei the authorities took effective action

were highly demoralizing to the klan personnel (who are

a100 the only significant personnel of the ASP).

demoralization was so complete that when Montgomery public

scrools were desegsegated, Klansen did not even appear in

one vicinitias of

the schools and took no action of any

inds either at the schools or in any other place, in any

encont to interiere with the desegregation.

It is therefore fully evident that the purposes

cougit by the CI program, that is the demoralization and

the rendering ineffective of such organizations, was

accomplished by direci investigation and Police

action.

and such infornation will be diligently

sougat by Agenis conducting investigation concerning

these

organizations and individuals. Mobile will also continue

to be alert for any opportunity to utilize the system which

courages unlauful action on the part of the klan groups.

Recommendation

The Mobile Office has no recommendation for any

logical immediate CI action at this time.

Action Groups

Mobile racial informants have furnished the

irontises of most individuals within the UKA and ASRP who

ana considered the most, likely to commit acus of violence

or intimacasion.

Most of these persons have been under

sarestigation for some

time, and in many instances Summary

reports have been furnished

to the Bureau pertaining to

them.

In sace of the instances of bombings in the vicinity of

•onigonents manching the doming in assis ma

recons weeks, Agents have interviewed neighbors and employers

s2 these individuals and have made visual checks, particularly

zaba au

night, in efforts to ascertain nether or not the

persons

thensalves were home or whethes or not their auto-

mobiles were pired at their residences. In many cases,

and probably in most cases,

these Kian personnel become

enora of these inquiries and on several situations it is

nowa that they observed Agents checking their cars and

ouserving their residences at night. Ines persons are

therefore under the impression that

• Bureau. Agents have them

under virtually constant surveillance.

They remarked to

aacle other in the presence of informants on occasion that

sney feel that their telephones are tapped and they have

also empreosed the fear that their meeting places are

subjected to microphone devices.

It is balieved that this:

lone on their part constitutes a very affective deterrent,

and nay vory woll be a principel reason for their failure

to case any untanceld measures in connection with the racial

SUBJECT:

INVESTIGATION OF KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER HATE

GROUPS

Mir. Sullivan has proposed that the development of informants in the fu khr

Klan (KKK) and other hate groups as weil as ine investigation and penetration oi inese

organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General

Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his

recommendations on the premise that organizations like the KKK and supporting

groups are essentially subversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses

of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communist

Party. He does not maintain that the actions of the hate groups constitute the same

menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreign

power. CuTerintelligene, Program- Disruption OF HaTe Grasp,-Ei

He feels that the DI over the years has developed wide experience in the

penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources,

sophisticated microphone and technical surveillances, interview programs of

a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience

to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

Mr. Sullivan feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a

disruptive counter-intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups

with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party

Vis concerned. He also proposes an immediate series of regional conferences to

{ instruct pertinent field personnel and to devise imaginative, aggressive and highly

specialized programs to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the

Communist Party is increasing its activities in the field of racial natters and

civil rights, directing more and more of its fire against the KKK and similar

organizations to confuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up

activities of the Communist Party in this area it would help prevent marised confusion

from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the General Investigative

and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities.

The functions in question were formerly handled by the DID up until 1958

when they were transferred to the General Investigative Division. This matter was =

considered by the Executives Conference 10/1/58 and the transfer recommended.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

One of the prime factors in the decision to transfer these responsibilities from the

DID in 1958 was the almost complete absence of Communist Party activity in the

racial area although at that time the Communist Party sought to capitalize on such

incidents after their occurrence.

Mr. Rosen was opposed to the transfer of the functions in question to the

General Investigative Division in 1958 and his present position is consistent in that

he maintains that the development of informants and the penetration of the Klan

and other hate groups are primarily intelligence functions which should be handled

by the DID as suggested he Dir. Sulliven, Dir. Reson feals fuet the Cursea con

best keep abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united

in one division as suggested by Mr. Sullivan. Mr. Rosen points out that the

development, supervision and administrative handling of racial and security

informants are analogous.

Mr. Rosen feels that there is a tendency toward oversimplification

in blaming all racial murders on Klansmen and hate groups. He points out that the

murders of Medgar Evers, Postman Moore and even the assassination of President

Kennedy were initially and generally attributed to Klan and hate gio up members

whereas instigation showed that the individuals charged with the murders of

Evers and Moore were without organization affiliation and the Presi dent was

slain by an avowed Marxist who was active in the Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

Mr. Rosen and Mr. Sullivan both agree that the investigation of individual

cases, i.e. bombings, murders, police brutality, etc., should be handled by the

General Investigative Division. Mr. Rosen feels that whether subject or victims

are Klan members, Communist Party members or completely without organizational

affiliation has no more bearing on our supervision of the substantive civil rights

violation than it would have if the violation involved were Theft from Interstate Shipment,

Bank Robbery or White Slave Traffic Act.

Mr. Belmont disagrees with Messrs. Rosen and Sullivan and feels

that while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative

to the Domestic Intelligence Division is theoretically appealing, it is not a

practical answer to our problem.. He states that at the time of the 1958 transfer

of functions in question the basis was the close inter-relationship between the

activities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.

He feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over-

whelmingly, our interest in Klan and hate groups today is their relationship with

integration and civil rights. Mr. Belmont believes the transfer of functions would

create an undesirable division of authority and responsibility; that our best chance

to break major civil rights cases such as bombings, murders, etc., is through

I information developed from the inside as a result of coverage established in the

community where the crime occurred; i.e. informants and sources in the Klan, hate

groups, subversive organizations, but also sources not connected with any group,

who will report potential violence and individuals prone to violence. We are following

the policy of aggressively seeking out persons addicted to violence even though they

have not violated a Federal law as yet.

He feels that the Division that is going to

investigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.

Mr. Belmont does not feel that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the

Bureau from an investigative standpoint nor in meeting the heavy responsibilities we no

have in this area.

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

Inspector feels there is certainly some merit and logic in Vir. Belmont's

reasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely black or white.

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of

information between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions

in that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information

are brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which

each Division is primarily responsible. However, it seems the real issue loudy

just as in 1958, is where does the weight of the interest lie in the racial question.

In 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to

information available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had

racial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Party elements although

the Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents after they occurred. Also,

lin 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic

Intelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest

in the racial problem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be

exploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights

and other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is definite

need for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as

to keep abreast of and ahead of their plans and activities. This seems more

properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by Inspector relative to coverage of the Klan and other

hate groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great deal of

pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed

the field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key

Klan figures, la ve interviewed at least once all known Klan members, all Klan .

leaders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommendations

have been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A

weekly progress airtel is being obtained from field concerning informant development.

However, undoubtedly additional coverage is needed particularly in the Klaverns

that have been formed since the civil rights bill passed. There is no question about

organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in intiltrating the ‹ ommunist

experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan

/ Under the proposed transfer of phases of the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence

Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions, Mr. Rosen

to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and

This dual responsibility, however, should pose no

problem because there are numerous examples of it successfully being handled

in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the administrative handling

of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Special Investigative

Division which includes the informants being utilized on General Investigative

Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles

the informant and intelligence aspects of organized crime. However, the General

Investigative Division handles key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy,

Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment

violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing

Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in-

soluble problems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble

problems in the coordination of racial intelligence and informant information

(between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.

supervision on the field if the se functions are transferred. The same Agents

in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,

it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their

broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration

tactics can possibly increase our penetration of these hate groups. It is felt

that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the Klan certainly

merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series of fieid con-

I ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

merits further consideration. It is also felt that the proposed series of field con-

I ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the responsibility for development of informants and

gathering of intelligence on the KKK and other hate groups be transferred from

the General Investigative Division to the DID. (I approved, appropriate memorandum

will be submitted by Inspection Division concerning realignment and distribution

of personnel from the General Investigative Division to the DID.)

для.

2. That a series of regional field conferences be held by appropriate

Bureau official to instruct personnel and attempt to develop further imaginative and

aggressive highly specialized programs to carry out desired penetration. (If

approved, to be coordinated by Mr. Belmont.)

3. That counter-intelligence and disruption tactics be given further

study by DID and appropriate recommendations made.

He is presently not a member

This situation appears to offer an opportunity to

capitalize upon the personal conflict of two Klan leaders.

We propose the following action:

Instruct Racial Informant ROBERT LEE DAVIDSON,

Géorgia and instruct DAVIDSON to actively work with BING

to achieve CRAIG's ouster.

BING has considerable following, particulariy

in the rural area south of Atlanta. DAVIDSON has contacts

in the Klan throughout Georgia.

We believe that with

DAVIDSON's assistance, BING could disrupt much of the

Ine following represents the consensus of Charlotte

Agents fanilias with klan activity:

1. Disraptive activity should not be undertaken at

= particular Kavern, as a general rule, unless there is

suficient vell established informant coverage to be able to

tell the effect of the action when instituted. Such action

would probably serve to "tighten up" the organization and make

it more difficult to get an infomant in thereafter.

2. It is considered dovoiful that newspaper publicity,

of only a generally unfavorable nature against the klan organi-

zation, is esfective in seducing new applicants of causing any

large numbar of present members to drop out. the "Charlotte

Observer," which has wide distribution throughout Nosth and

Of America, Inc., in North Carolina, and published both photos

and names of a number of members, So far as has been learned

from informants, this had very little adverse effect upon the

organization.

It was alleged that two to five members were

discharged from their jobs, or warned about continuing member-

ship, but the identities of thesa alleged persons is not known,

woetn carolina Grand Dragen JaMas Ro/JoNas has stated, both

publicly and privately to informants, that this publicity was

very valuable to the growth of the organization.

One informant

reported that the day after the articles polished his name as

a local leader, three persons contacted him and applied for

membership, stating they had not previouslv known whom to contaci.

It is considered that pubrtcity of this type generally

deters from joining only those persons who would not be

interested in joining in the first place. It is believed that

a lasge proportion of those parsons who are potential members

are seeking status and recognition, and publicity is no deterrent

to them; it makes them feel important and members of an important

gIoup.

The major apparent effect of the series of newspapez

articles referred to has been a tightening up of security, and

refusal of laadars to allow newspapér photos of individual

Klansmen to be taken at public rallies.

3. Disruptive

activity, wherever possible, should be of

a nature which does not expose the fact that the Bureau, or the

"Federal Government", is behind the activity. It is believed

that open action, to

a large extent, can backfire and create

resentment and sympathy.

It must be remembered that Klan

membership, in many sections, does not by any means carzy the

odium that alleged Communist membership of sympathy does in

almost any section of society.

1. Along this same line, there is probably no point in

trying disruptive activity, at least not at this stage, on a

local

Klan group which is small, inactive, and peaceful. Any

such activity nich is not completaly discreet and concealed

would likaly have the effect of stirring it up,

Klonvocation of United Klans of America at Birmingham on

7/5-5/64. This is to be sold to members for $2 each and

there is apparently considerable demand for it.

Since it is

not apparent to the unitiated that it has anything to do

with "the Klan," it is expected that memoers will wear it

openly as a secret recognition signal. If it does become

widely adopted and worn, consideration should then be given to

giving widespread publicity to the fact of what it represents.

Ihis should have the result of discouraging some persons who

do not want their Klan nemoership publicly known.

6, It is considered that possibly the most effective

way of discouraging membership, of causing existing members

to withdraw, is to establish that someone in the organization

is gatting rich off it, or embezzling the proceeds, Charlotte

is endeavoring to develop information along these

lInes, but

nothing specific has yet been developed.

7. The following are suggested tactics that appear

useful on a selected basis against individual Klansmen,

particulaily those whose employers might object to their Klan

membership:

Anonymous letter or phone call to the employer

selling of the Klan membership.

b. Enter on behalf of the memoer a subscription to

the "Fiezy Cross," United Klans of America publication, and have

it mailed to his employment.

c. When a particular member is away from home at a

Klavern meeting, have a female phone his home and indicate he

was to meet her and is late.

This might have the effect of

making it difficult for cim

to get away fom home

at night

thereafter. This should be limited to particular individuals

who are considered potential ones to stir up trouble in a Klavern.

out that

of the difficulties brought on by the National issocia

that it is orposed to violence.

This leaflet further

set

forth

that this was a chartered, legalized novenent and

it is no nora illegal to ba a member of it than to bea

iember of other organizations.

At various tines in the past the klavern has

attempted to organize "action" groups within the klavera,.

but of

each occasion the project has died from lack of

InterESt.

In line with Bureau policy of dissemination of

intonation,

the nain activities regarding the Pine Bluff

Klavern have been disseninated confidentially to Chief

_OÊ POLiCE MORGEM D. YOUNG, Pine BluER, (NA) On a regular

basis.

Chief. YOunG has exerted every effort to keep down

the possiblity of violence.

Through his confidential

sources he is also well aware of the identities of the

Flavorn nonbers and their activities. He personally

has warned particu klavern members

against any violence

and has stated they wiil be net with immediate arrest

1l any violence occurs. As an example, Care oUNG was

aävised through his orn confidential source of the time

and location of the klavera neeting on the night of

Cotober 5: 195%.

Chie veiNE sent a lieutenant of his

deparinent in uniform to check the location, record

license nuzbers, and to be seen checking the meeting so

that the klavern members would know that he was checking

on then.

This has had a strong influence on making the

K127022

follow a line of legal activity. It has also

resulted in the more responsible leading citizens of the

community being made arare of certain klavern nembers,

causing

these klavern nenbers

to be discredited in the

eyes of the public.

This was borne out in the recent

school board

election on 9/29/64 when two klavern members,

one of thou is JF.-BUTRAN, were miserably defeated.

The klaverr has during the past few nonths

ungod its menbei's to solicit and obtain new members.

• Dear Mr. Hoover:

Thank you very much for your letter of July 17, 1964...

certain aspects of the Civil Rights-Facla]

problem.

Hr. Gale is very much in favor

of this

inquiry and is moving promptly in

this matter.

I think the sesults of his

inquiry will be most helpful in evaluating

the situation.

*(2)

What I have in mind basically is this:

You may want to, in light of

his inquiry,

consider transterring the responsibility

for the development of informants in the

Blu Klux Klan White Citizens Council aud

related "hate" organizations io the Division

while leaving the responsibility for

My idea is:

This

skills, and procedures which it has used?'

the co bat cantat this bri eri

to successfully penetrate the Communist Party -

and espionage organizations to now penetrate

these hate organizations causing us so much

trouble.

(In talking to Mr. Tolson this

I mentioned this briefly to him.)

This is simply a

hard, stubborn fact we cannot theorize away.

SUBJECT: RACIAL MATTERS

1 - Mr. Malley

1 - Mr. McGowan

Certainly, the items mentioned by Mr. Sullivanare

such as to be handled by the Bureau on an intelligence basis. The

racial field is a most fertile field for Communist Party and other

subversive groups. There are indications of this such as in the

cases of Martin Luther King and Michael Schwerner, one of the

missing civil rights workers from Philadelphia, Mississippi, and

other situations.

Also there are reports of foreign funds being used

to support the current actions of Malcolm X. The racial strife and

disorder are of such major significance as to have international

aspects and this is tailor-made for the disruptive tactics of subversive

elements both right and left.

We cannot afford to divorce the national racial program from

its possible international aspects. The devices and tactics presently

in use in the security field should be utilized to the fullest in

developing intelligence information regarding national as well as

international developments in the racial strife. The tense racial

potential in major cities is a fertile field for subversive activities

both right and left.

We have seen from the killings in the South, for example,

the killing of Medgar Evers, that such appear to be isolated incidents

usually carried out by one man or a small unattached group occurring

on the spur-of-the-moment, such as the killing of the Lieutenant Colonel

near Colbert, Georgia, and the assaulting of a minister in the streets

in Hattiesburg, Mississippi.

FEELINEN

The investigation of the Klan and hate groups as well as the

development of informants in such organizations must, out ofnecessity,

be handled as a whole. The following of the informants cannot be isolated

from the over-all investigation of the organizations just as the Informants

in the Communist Party cannot be isolated from the organizations they are

connected with.

RE: RACIAL MATTERS

Of course, any specific offenses such as, for example,

the case of the three missing civil rights workers in Philadelphia,

Mississippi, "or cases involving brutality, bombings or any other

violations these individual investigations should be handled by the

appropriate substantive desks such as the Civil Rights Desk.

The over-all racial field is specifically an intelligence operation

for the Bureau. It can best be organized when all facets are followed

and directed by one Division. The communist potential for activities

in this field would seem to be a major factor as evidenced by the doings

of Martin Luther King and his associates. The Bureau can best keep

abreast of the whole field by having all angles of the racial field united

in one Division utilizing the tactics which Mr. Sullivan has suggested

as being effective.

Re: Personnel Transfers to Effèct Proposed

Reassignment of Supervisory Responsibilities

in Racial Matters and Racial Informants

SA F. H. Freund has responsibility for Klan organizations for all

field divisions and supervises other classifications for ll western and

midwestern offices. •

SA L. A. Giovanetti has alternate responsibility for Klan organizations

for all field divisions and supervises other classifications for Atlanta,

Little Rock, Savannah and 4 other midwestern offices.

SA C. A. Parkis has responsibility for other hate organizations (8

currently active) for all field divisions and supervises other classifications

for Birmingham, Mobile, Cleveland and the 4 Texas offices.

SA F. P. Smith supervises classifications (other than racial informants

and organizations) for New Orleans, Memphis, Knoxville and 7 western

offices, and special cases.

SA H. E. Trent supervises classifications (other than racial informants

and organizations) for Charlotte, Savannah, Baltimore, Washington Field

office, Louisville and 2 midwestern offices.

Based on the distribution of work, Inspector's analysis reflects that it would

take 5 of the 7 men assigned to the Organizations Unit to handle racial matters and

racial informants under the approved change of responsibilities. There are 7 clerical

employees assigned to the Organizations Unit of the Civil Rights Section and it is

felt that 5 of these clerical employees who generally handie the work being transferred

from the General Investigative Division to the Done stic Intelligence Division be

transferred along with the supervisors. Assistant Directors Rosen and Sullivan are

in accord that the proposed personnel changes are equitable, consistent and correspond

with the transfer of responsibilities.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That Supervisor in Charge Joseph C. Trainor and Agent Supervisors

Deegan, Freund, Giovanetti and Parkis be transferred to Division 5 (Domestic Intelligence

Division) concomitant to the transfer to that Division of spervisory responsibility over

racial matters and racial informants (if approved to be handled by Mir. Mohr's Office).

programs against such organizations.

IV. The Domestic Intelligence Division, in addition, is willing to go

beyond the recommendations approved by the Director related to

the above and will, with Bureau approval, develop highly placed,

quality informants in certain legitimate organizations whose

activities generally relate to racial matters, such as

National Association for the Advancement of Colored

People (NAACP)

Congress of Racial Equality (CORE)

Student Nonviolence Coordinating Committee (SNCC)

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) - headed

by Martin Luther King

White Citizens Council

(Each one, of course, will be handled on a carefully selected

basis and the action approved individually by the Bureau.)

V. Similarly, the Domestic Intelligence Division is willing to go beyond

what was originally approved and will, with Bureau authorization,

proceed to establish informants and sources in Negro communities

throughout the Nation for the purpose of developing intelligence

information relating to the degree of racial tension; the possibility

of violence erupting in the form of riots, etc.; and will disseminate

this material to all interested persons inside and outside the Bureau.

The organizations and objectives as set forth in paragraphs IV and V

above are being made the subject of a separate memorandum inasmueh

as this involves a matter of policy and will have to be acted on

separately subject to approval by the Director.

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The purpose of this study is to define

a new role for the Bureau in the field of clandestine

collection of Loroign Intolligonce in the U.s.

This action is necessary and most timely because

of our Government's vital need for increased foreign

intolligence and because of CIA's expanding intorests

There is a decided need for

a new Bureau concept, the implementation of which

could greatly increase our electiveness and coula decei

CIA from becoming a threat to our operational interests.

The study encompasses a review of history

as it relates to loreign intelligence collection in

the U.S.

Analysis is made of the need and the

potential for such intelligence; the capabilities of

the Bureau and CIA in this field; and the responsibilities

of over-all (overt and covert) collection of foreiga

intelligence in the U. S.

Lindings, and we recommend We have submitted our general

a plan of action for a new

Bureau role.

This study was not designed to eliminate once

and for all the many problems relating to collection

of loreign intelligence in the U.s.

It would have baen

a Utopian objective to recommend

a plan which would

produce maximum intelligence collection, remove existing

defects within the U.S. intelligence community, and

establish complete harmony among interested agencies.

We did not go

that far.

dictated that we endeavor to reach a reasonable goal

consistent with prudent planning and sound operational

implementation.

We feel

that the recommended plan

meets such guidelines, that it is a decidedly major step

forward for the Bureau, and it strongly conforms with

the national security needs.

It should be noted that this document does

nr.not. deal with our law enforcement or internal security

functions, although it is fully recognized that

Internal security and clandestine collection of foreign.

intelligence are closely linked.

Any plan on our part

to produce foreign intelligence will affect our

capabilities in the field of counterintelligence.

INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY

People who do not speak and understand à common

language have difficulty in communicating their ideas.

Even

in a country such as ours where English is the common language,

words take on different meanings in different geographical

zocalos and in difforont

environments. Likewise, in professional fields, varying

backgrounds and experiences have conveyed different meanings

to terms in the professional vocabulary.

In the field of security, intelligence, and counter-

intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has

developed ostensibly to

assist in the exchange of ideas by

persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a

field or a special segment of the field, new horizons develop

which require additional terminology or cause an evolution in

idevelop

existing terminology.

This development or evolution in security

and intelligence terminology, coupled with individualistic usage,

brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the

broader aspects of the English language. We have all noted

that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning

and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are not

misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.

we face d similai problem in the use of professional forminol

ogy in security and intelligence matters as this terminology

takes on new meaning with additional experience and takes on

varying meanings to different persons.

An additional factor to consider in understanding

the

meaning of terminology is the context in which a term is

used.

For example, the term "intelligence" may be vague and

confusing without the knowledge of the context in which it is

used.

It can, as a generic term, pertain to the whole field

of activities undertaken by a governmentin the collection of

information;

the protection of its institutions, and the con-

duct of nonattributable activities to facilitate the formation

and implementation of government policy. Also, it can relate

to the

organization devoted to the collection and production

of information necessary to the government. In addition,

it may pertain to the whole body of theory and practice on

the basis of which an intelligence organization operates.

Finally, the word "intelligence" may be utilized to mean

any part or all of the above.

The following definitions do not include all possible

meanings that have been utilized but,

instead, are designed

to assist the reader in digesting this study.

There appears to be much confusion in professional

circles regarding the use of the term "positive intelligence."

Some professionals use the term "positive intelligence" synonymously

with tho torm

the tott roo

In still 2n0th0s

usage,

"poSitive Intelligence"

"forcirn intolland intelligence" are used

interchangeably.

In another useage, which is closely related

to the definition utilized in this study, "positive intelli

gence" Is described as what is left of the

entire field alter

"security intelligence" has been subtracted. This source

continues that both "positive intelligence" and "security

inteïligence" can be against domestic targets, as well as

against foreign targets.

For example, the Department of state,

in connection with its formulation of

foreign policy, encounters

• a large number of organizations of Americans whose parents came

from foreign countries.

Many of these organizations the Poles

for example-have strong views on what United States policy

The views of these organizations

regarding our foreign policy is likely to be a matter of some

importance to the Department of State in its policy formula

The knowledge of what these organizations think and

do can be a very significant phase of what might be called

"domestic positive intelligence."

In addition, the connections

which these organizations may have with the foreign country

such as Poland sometimes provide a source of "foreign positive

intelligence."

SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE pertains to the progress of scientific

research and development and usually this intelligence is

within the framework of how it affects military or economic

potential of a nation.

SECURITY INTELLIGENCE is basically the intelligence behind the

police function to protect the nation and its members from

those working to our national and individual detriment. For

example, this would include intelligence regarding clandestine

agents sent to the United States by à foreign power.

SOCIOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE pertains to the social, cultural,

psychological, or ethnic structure and characteristics of a

people.

STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE is the intelligence required for broad

and usually long range planning; especially with regard to

military operations.

THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN THE

UNITED STATES

•I.. Prior to Horld War II

A study of the history and progress of foreign

intelligence collection in the United States reveals that

and in direct proportion to the intensity of the coverage

United States prior to World War II is primarily a history of

counterintelligence and internal security coverage, of which

foreign intelligence was a by-product. Historical

highlights

of the developments in this field are as follows:

(a) In August, 1914, when German espionage agents

Count Johann Von Bernstorff and Di. Heinrich Albert of the

German Embassy, Washington, D. C., arrived in the

Tuit States with $150, 000, on In German treasury notes to

finance the first foreign espionage and sabotage apparatus

to be organized in this country,

United States Government

intelligence work was handled for the most part by tive

small organizations (Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, Secret Service, Army, State and Navy),

all operating on their own with small

staffs and without

coordination and sufficient delineation of responsibilities.

(b) On April 6, 1917, Congress declared war against

Germany and President Woodrow Wilson gave the Bureau oi

Investigation the task of enforcing his proclamation

governing the conduct of enemy aliens. The Bureau at the time

had 300 Agents but shortly after the outbreak of the war

the staff was increased to 400.

(c) As result of a rash of bombings believed

executed by Bolsheviks, Attorney General Palmer appoinied

Francis: I. Garvan of New York as Assistant: Attorney. Generat

to deal with the problem.

He created a General Intelligence

Division under command of J. Edgar Hoover and Mr. Hoover was

instructed to make a study of subversive activities in the

United States to determine their scope and

the potential

or prosecution.

1N 33120 D0010:32989629 Page 180

## Page 181

(d) On May 9, 1934, President Roosevelt called

& White House conference

the problem of growth of fascist organizations in the

United States.

The conference agreed that there should be

an Invostigation of these groups and their activities or

intelligence purposes.

Since the only Federal law believed

applicable at the time was the Immigration Law,

the President

decided that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization

Service would confer with the Chief of Secret Service and the

Director of the FBI to work out details of the investigation:

MI. Hoover immediately issued orders to EBI

personnel

to conduct an intensive and confidential investi

gation of the Nazi movement.

This was the first general

intelligence investigation made by the Government into

fascist activities in this country.

(e) As a result of President Franklin Roosevelt's

concern over activities of the communists and other subversive

gruuys, a surios of conferonoes ne hoid in the latter part

of lugust and carly September, 1936, participated in by the

President, the Socretary of State and the Director of the FBI.

As a rosult of his concern over the international character

of communism and fascism, the President stated the FBI should

conduct necessary investigations and coordinate information

upon those miters in the possession of the Military

Erus agence Division, the Naval Intelligence Division and

the State Department.

It is noteworthy that it was specified the

investigation was to be for intelligence purposes only.

The Presidential Order was implemented by the

Director in a letter to all Special Agents in Charge,

September 5, 1936.

(1)

As a result of opposition primarily by the

State Department against accepting the FBI as the coordinating

agency in the investigations of all subversive activities in

the United States, President Roosevelt, on June 26, 1939, issued

a confidential directive to Cabinet members which established an

Interdepartmental Intelligence Coordinating Committee composed

of the FBI and the Intelligence Divisions of the War Department

and the Navy.

He named the FBI as the coordinating agency to

receive all reports on subversive activities.

(g)

President Roosevelt publicly designated the FBI

to investigate matters relating to espionage, sabotage and

violations of the neutrality regulations by Presidential

Directive datod September 6, 1939.

(h) On May 21, 1940, President Roosevelt in a

nemorandum to the then Attorney General, Robert M.

Jackson,

authorized and directed the Attorney General in

such cases

as

he might approve to authorize the use of listening devices

directed to the conversations or other communications of

persons suspected of subversive activity against the Government

of the United States, including suspected spies.

Pursuant to

such authorization, commencing on dune t,

1940, technical surveillances were installed on diplomatic

establishments throughout the United States of such countries

as Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and France.

installations in

addition to providing counterintelligence

information of value produced

a substantial quantity of foreign

intelligence information.

(1)

Although lines of responsibility were established

for domestic intelligence work in connection with the September 6,

1939, Presidential Directive, there were no cleaxly defined areas

of responsibility of overseas intelligence operations and as

time passed the need for decisions in that field grew more evident.

As a result, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS)

came into being.

By

Presidential Directive June 24, 1940,

President Franklin D. Roosevelt set forth lines of responsibility

in the operations of United States intelligence agencies in the

foreign field.

This Directive grew out of a series of meetings

involving representatives of State Department, Army and Navy

intelligence and the FBI wherein it was agreed that the SIs would

act as a service agency, furnishing the state Department, the

military, the FBI and other governmental agencies with intormatron

having to do with financial, economic, political and subversive

activities detrimental to the security of the United States.

The

June 24th Directive placed the responsibility for nonmilitary

intelligence coverage in the Western Hemisphere on the FBI.

LeSS

than thirty days therealter the FBI had organized an SIS operation.

Through World War II and until approximately March 31,

1947, the FBI continued its SIS operations. The culmination of

our activities in this field came about as a result of the

January 22, 1946, Presidential DireCtive

establishing the

Central Intelligence Group and giving it the responsibility of

collecting foreign intelligence abroad.

2. During World Var II (1941 - 1945)

& The FBI's Role

During World War II, as prior to the war, foreign

intelligence collection in this country was goared

to and

principally a product of our intensive efforts in the counter-

intelligence field.

steady stream of foreign intelligence continued to be developed

from our technical coverage of diplomatic establishments of

enemy-bloc countries, as well as other sensitive countries

such as Russia, Argentina, Poriugal and Spain.

In line with the Presidential Directive of

September 6, 1939, the FBI continued to be in charge of all

investigative work in matters pertaining to espionage, sabotage,

counterespionage, subversive activities and violations of the

" neutrality laws.

On January 8, 1943, the President issued another

Directive in which he reiterated the previous Direvlive of

September 6, 1939.

In ordering the FBI to take charge in the loregoing

areas,

President Roosevelt did not define the various types of

intelligence involved but placed the entire intelligence and

internal security responsibilities involved under the

jurisdiction of

the FBI. As a matter of faet, in carrying out

these responsibilities we did produce foreign intelligence in

substantial quantity especially through our technical coverage

of foreign diplomatic establishments.

b. Office of Strategic Services

The position of Colonel William J. Donovan as

Coordinator of Information (COI) was created by Presidential

Directive dated July 11, 1941.

On July 14, 1941, President

Rooseven estatetter the tore deeral that pontin

position was created,

the Government for the analysis of information and data which

bears upon national security...."

The President described

"assist me and

the various Departments and

agencies öf the Government in assembling and correlating

information which may be useful in the formulation of basic

plans for the defense of the nation. "

## Page 184

In the letter President Roosevelt clearly limited

Donovan's jurisdiction with the following statement:

"I

should like to emphasize that Colonel Donovan's work 1s not

intendod to supersode or duplicate or Involve any direction

of the activities of established agencies already obtaining

and interpreting defense information."

The Presidential order dated September 11, 1941,

established the position of col with clear cut authority to

collect and analyze information bearing on national security;

correlate and make such information available to the President

and other Government officials as the President may determine.

CoI was linally authorized to carry out, when requested by

the President, supplementary activities as might tacilitate

the securing of information not then available to the

Government.

Donovan, in a memorandum captioned "MEMORANDUM OF

-ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION," expanded

on the President's directive in general terms. Under his

plan for procedure there was a Coordinator of strate te

Information responsible directly io the President.

this same organizational set up was later adopted by the

Director of Central Intelligence. Donovan noted, however,

in his memorandum, "The proposed centralized unit will

neither displace nor encroach upon the FBI, Army and Navy

Intelligence, or any other Department of the Government."

(62-64427, serials 23 and X3.)

Our file on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)

reveals that that organization continued its organizational,

training, and operational activities in this country based

on Donovan's premise that he was the central clearing point

for anti-Axis espionage and counterespionage.

JEK Act 6 (1) (C)

Our file on the OSS is replete with incidents

By memorandum dated May 22, 1945, Stanley J. Tracey,

advised of a conversation overheard between two high-ranking

State Department officials. The conversation dealt with OSS

attempts to take over Bureau SIS operations in Latin America

with one of the State Depariment officials, Aura Warren,

stating that officials oi OSs felt that organization was

"better equipped

to handle work than fBl personnel attached

to various American Embassies in South America.

In response

to this attempt of OSS to take over our duties, the Director

commented: "I would like lo now vheie Warren goto this.

According to. Ladd our contacts in State Department have no

knowledge of such OSS efforts.

Also Tracey should point

out it is State Department duty to initiate it as we would

'service it' and the State Department in fact started

the

SIS project. H" (62-64427-1059.)

An interesting evaluation of OSS operations is

provided in a report prepared by Colonel Richard Park of

the War Department as a result of a survey of OSS operations

made as a special and confidential mission for the President

in 1944 and 1945. Colonel Park commented: "Without going

into details I was everywhere left with the same impression

of utter incompetency on the part of OSS leadership....

"Everywhere that the subject of OSS. Came up,

unsolicited remarks clearly brought out the very well

known

anateurish nature of

the organization.

"The OSS has been restricted from active operations

in South America by Presidential directive.

Despite the absence of any jurisdiction in or..

responsibility for counterintelligence operations in the

western hemisphere, an pilicer oi oss was reported to have

attempted to obtain cover.for an OSS agent in South America

under guise of employment by an organization doing business

in South America.

A closing paragraph of Colonel Park's report

commented on observations made by an olficial

of OSS as

folloWs:

"This official of OSS added that it was the policy

of his agency not to give any more information than necessary

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

He pointed out that

Oss instructors in their school in the United States had

discussed the FBi in an unfavorable light and had painted

the picture of OSS replacing the Federal Bureau of

Investigation not only outside the United states but in

the domestic Lield.

The publicity campaign referred to

to be one of the means adopted to accomplish this

purpose."

3. National Intelligence Authority (NIA)

On January 22, 1946, President Maxry S. I'ruman

sadressed a birective to the secretary oi state, the secretary

of War, and the secretary of the Navy stating, in part, "I

hereby designate you, together with another person to be named

by me as my personal

representative, as the National Intelli

gence Authority.

. "

The Directive provided that each of these

three Secretaries would from time to time assign personnel and

facilities from their respective departments "which persons

shall collectively form a Central Intelligence GrOUD" (CIG)

under a Director of Central Intelligence.

it was provided that

the latter would be responsible to the NIA.

President Truman then stated that subject to the

existing law the Director of Central Intelligence should

(a) accomplish the corre.ation and evaluation of intelltgence

and the appropriate dissemination within the Government of the

results; (b) plan for the coordination of such activities of

the intelligence agencies of the three departments involved as

raleted to the national security: (c) perform such services of

common concern as the NIA determined could be more eifectively

accomplished centrally; and (d) perform such other functions

and duties related to intelligence as the President and the

NIA might irom time to time direct.

The Presidential Directive said that no police, law

enforcement or internal security functions should be exercised

under the Directive; that certain intelligence should be freely

available to the Director of Central Intelligence "for correlation,

evaluation or dissemination"; and

I that "the existing intelligence

agencies of your departments shall continue to collect, evaluate,

correlate and disseminate departmental intelligence."

The ninth

provision of the Directive stated, "Nothing herein shall be

• construed to authorize the making of investigations inside the

continental limits of the United States and its possessions,

except as provided by law and Presidential directives."

A series of communications between the Bureau and

Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg; who was designated as

Director of the Central Intelligence

Group, then followed. On

June 21, 1946, a memorandum analyzed a communication from

Vandenberg which submitted a proposed memorandum to the NIA and

a proposed directive to be issued by NIA extending the powers

and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence.

The Directive

provided, in essence, the following additional functions and

powers for the Director of Central Intelligence:

= 15 .

: (%

n75120

DocId:32989629. Page-187

## Page 188

(1) Undertake such basic research and analysis of

intelligence and counterintelligence as may in his opinion be

required.

(2) Act as the executivo agont of this authority

NIA) In coordinating and in suporvising all rederal foreign

intelligence activities.

(3) Perform the following services of common concern:

(a) conduct all Federal espionage and counterespionage operations

fox the collection of foreign intelligence; (b) conduct all

Federal monitoring of press

and propaganda

broadcasts of foreign

powers for the collection of intelligence information.

In discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired

issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform

with the original plan proposed by the President or which was

envisioned by the discussions occurring prior to the time the

President issued his Directive.

The original plan, insofar as

the Bureau was advised, contemplated the setting up of solely

a coordinating agency which was given the power to perform certain

functions which it would be determined could more adequately and

economically be performed centrally for the benefit of all

Government agencies.

The memorandum noted that "undoubtedly if

this Directive is approved and the Central Intelligence Group

is successiul in setting up complete foreign coverage,

the

Bureau would undoubtedly be pushed into a 'second rate' position

insofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the

domestic field. ..

It is inevitable that the Central Intelli

gence Group must enter into the domestic field picture insofar

as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign

intelligence existing in that field.

Also, it is impossible to

separate entirely foreign intelligence and

the domestic functions

performed by the Bureau."*

In reply to the Directive proposed by General Vandenberg,

a letter was sent to him June 25, 1946, which stated that the

Directive was approved with certain changes suggested "for

clarification purposes only." The Director suggested that to

the item relating to the Director of Central Intelligence acting

as the executive agent of National Intelligence Authority

in coordinating and supervising all foreign intelligence

activitios there should bo addod "performod outsido the

United States and its possessions relating to the national

security in accordance with the overall policies and objectives

established by this Authority." With respect to the proposal

that the Director of Central Intelligence direct all espionage

and counterespionage operations for the collection of foreign

intelligence, it was proposed that the phrase "outside the

United States and its possessions" also be inserted in this

prOViSiOn.

•Г.

On July 29, 1946, General Vandenberg sent over

a memorandum on the subject "Exploitation of American

Business.Concerns With Connections Abroad as Sources oi

Foreign Intelligence Information."

He added & proposed

Directive.

The Director replied by letter August 6, 1946,

"I should like to comment that there appears to have been

an addition to the field encompassed by CIG Directive 411

calling for a survey of the exploitation of American business

concerns.

I note that in your report and in the proposed

NIA Directive, you refer not only to American business con-

cerns but to other private groups with connections abroad.

This latter phrase, in my opinion, is extremely broad ano

could be taken to include all types oi organizations,

including Foreign Nationality Groups.

In fact, i feel that

the report and proposed Directive should confine themselves to

the discussion of American business concerns and that no

references at all should be made to 'private groups'..

•I feel that at a later date the question of exploitation of

these private groups by CIG representatives might be worked

out by discussing them individually with the FBI when their

identities are deternined." This matter remained unresolved.

On August 22, 1946, General Vandenberg submitted

another proposed Directive concerning exploitation of American

business concerns, nongovernmental groups, and individuals (in

the United States) with connections abroad as sources of

foreign

intelligence information. A memorandum analyzing this on

August 22, 1946, pointed out the new Directive was even more

∞ 17 .

+H755+20 BocId: 329896

## Page 190

obnoxious than the one originally proposed. The Directive

noted, in part, "CIG field representatives will establish

and maintain Iiaison with the intelligence officers of local

•Army and Navy headquarters and Air Foxco headquarters, it

present, through the medium of local interagency offices."

The analyzing memorandum "ointed out, "If this means the

CIG is going to maintain field representatives in the Unitod

statos or establish offices, it cortainly is soothing new and

a provision that ve did not understand was intended in the

Attached to the proposed Directive

is a discussion which is more or less the same as was attached

to the original proposed Directive. It, howeves, makes the

rollowing statement which the Bureau cannot subscribe to and

It would seem must oppose, that is, 'Foreign Intelligence

Information related to the national security, although it may

be collected from sources whose headquarters are within the

limits of the United States and its possessions, is delinitely

a pari of the national intelligence mission, the coordination

-Of which is specifically a function of the National Intelli

gence Authority under the provisions of the President's letter

of 22 January 1946.'"

In pointing out the Bureau's objections, the

analyzing memorandum of August 22, 1946, stated, "There

is now involved in this Directive

the fundamental question

of just what rights the Central Intelligence Group has with

reference to operations within the United States. Carrying

to a logical conclusion the statements set forth above contained

in the discussion, they could cover all foreign embassies in

the United States, take charge of double agents we are operating

or radio stations we are operating as

double agent set-ups, etc.,

because essentially these operations engaged in by the Bureau

do not directly involve enforcement of the laws but rather are

concerned with obtaining Information in the nature of foreign

intelligence which, of course, is related to internal security

as is all foreign intelligence.

Essentially, the Bureau's

domestic operations in intelligence involve the determining

of the aims, intentions, and activities of foreign countries

: or their ropresentatives.

abroad.

On August 23, 1946, the Director sent a letter to

Gonoral Vandenborg stating

a part, "I must advise that the

proposed Directive does not Incorporate the changes suggested

is my Letter o1 August o, 1y46, and L theretore, cannot

approve it.

This new directive also includes provision.

and statements In which I cannot concur and, In fact, must

oppose.".

The strong stand of the Director obviously led to

a conference between

General Vandenberg and the Director

which was reported in a memorandum of September 13, 1946,

which the Director prepared.

As stated in the Director's

memorandum the conference concerned CIG's desire to gather

contacts

among "nongovernmental groups and individuals with

connections abroad."

The entire conference was on this subject

matter and did not enter into collection of foreign intelli-

gence from foreign embassies or from foreign officials or,

in fact, from any other source. The Director wrote, "I told

the General that I could well appreciate that there would be

cases in which his organicaiion would be desirnus of making

contacts in the United States for the purpose of obtaining

information from abroad nd that the Bureau was not interested

in such contacts except in those situations wherein the individual

of the group might be engaged in activities within the United

States that were either under investigation by the Bureau or

might possibly be the medium of obtaining information con

• cerning the activities of a subversive character being carried

on within the United States.

I told the General that I would

be perfectly agreeable to his suggestion, with the added

provision that if CIG was desirous of contacting any

individuals of the character that he had indicated, before

doing so it would check with the FBI."

The foregoing has been set forth rather extensively

since it shows the strong stand the Bureau took against CIG's

operating in the United States.

Actually, as will be reported

hereinaiter, Directives were adopted permitting CIG to collect

positive intelligence in this country by contacting United:"

States citizens, American businessmen, allens (with prior

FBI approval) through the foreign language press and in later

years through contacts with United States governmental personnel.

Responsibilities of CIA

The National Security Act of 1947

This Act, which is reported In 50 USC 401 et sed.,

established the National Security Council (NSC) and under it

tho Contral Intolligence Agency.

It providod that whon the

Director of Central Intelligence was appointed the NIA should

cease to exist.

There was much discussion concerning the powers and

authorities to be vested in the Director of Central Intelli

gence. Many individuals, especially in Congress, expressed

Lears that CIA could develop into a gestapo in permitted to

become operational in the United States.

The following two

excerpts, Of interest in this connection, are irom a

Congressional publication related to hearings prior to passage

of the National Security Act of 1947. The publication is

entitled "Hearings Belore the Committee on Expenditures in the

Executive Departments, House of Representatives, 80th Congress,

2319 (National Security Act of 1947)":

Page 127 - During testimony concerning authority for

and scope of CIA, James Forrestal, then secretary of the Navy,

stated:

"The purposesof the Central Intelligence Authority

are limited definitely to purposes outside oi this

country, except the collation of information gathered

by other government agencies.

"Regarding domestic operations, the Federal Bureau

of Investigation is working at all times in collaboration

with General Vandenberg. He relles upon them for domestic

activities."

speaking about the National Security Act of 1947, which was

National Security Council Intelligence Directives

To implement the authority granted to it unuer iue

National Security Act of 1947, the National Security Council

has issued a series of "National Security Council Intelligence

Directives," usually referred to as NSCID's and commonly called

"Nonscids." The first of these was issued December 12, 1947, and

provided for the establishing of the Intelligence Advisory

Committee to maintain the relationship necessary for a fully

effective integration of the national intelligence effort. By

Directive dated September 15, 1958, the U.S. Intelligence Board

(USIB) was Lormally created

as successor to the Intelligence Advisory

Committee and a counterpart known as the U.S. Communications

Intelligence Board.

NSCID No. I provided that the Director of Central

Intelligence should coordinate the foreign intelligence activities

of the United States, such coordination to include both special

and other forms of intelligence.

The USIB under this Directive

shall "advise and assist the Director of Central Intelligence as

he may require in the discharge of his statutory responsi-

bilities."

It is the Board which is empowered to establish

policies, deline intelligence objectives, make recommendations

to appropriate U.s. officials, develop standards for protection

of intelligence, and formulate

policies with respect to arrange-

ments with foreign governments.

National Security Council Intelligence DIrectivo

No. I, originally issued 12/12/47, delines the various types

of intelligence in Section 4.

(a) National Intelligence is that intelligence

policy, concerns more than one deparcment or agency,

and transcends the exclusive competence of a single

department or agency. The Director of Central Intelli-

gence shall produce; national intelligence with the

(b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence

which any department or agency requires to execute its own

and agencies of the Government for the execution of their

missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence

agency prior to dissemination."

Departments, and Provided, that any such overt collection

intelligence information, in accordance with policies,

procedures and practices established as provided in

paragraph 3a of NSCID No. I, by the Director of Central

Intelligence with the concurrences of the U. S. Intelli

gence Borxd."

Section 9 of the same Directive provides that CIA

"shall conduct the exploitation of foreign languago publications

Ior intelligence purposes, as appropriate, as a service of

common concern.

When this luaction Is carriod out in the U. S.,

this also constitutes overt collection of loreign intelligenco

by that Agency in this country.

It may bo worthy to note at this point that NSCID

No. 's I and 2 were discussed, approved, and issued in their

215c 551149

original forms prior to 7/7/49 when the FBI was designated a.

member

of the Intelligence Advisory Committee.

NSCID No. 3 on Coordination of Intelligence Production

contains definitions of various types of intelligence (including

those defined in NSCID No. I) and then delineates primary

responsibilities for "producing" intelligence among various

agencies, stating with respeci io CIA:

"The Central Intelligence Agency shall produce

economic intelligence on the Sino-soviet Bloc and /

scientific and technical intelligence as a service of

Agency may produce such other intelligence as may be

necessary to discharge the statutory responsibilities

of the Director of Central Intelligence."

Since, as noted hereinbefore, "collection" activities

are defined in NSCID No. 2; it would seem to follow that the

word "produce" as used in NSCID No. 3 has the same definition

the cano dosiniono

as set out in a footnote to NSCID No. 1, paragraph 4, 1.e., "10

correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national

security."

Thus, NSCID No. 3 would not appear to extend CIA's

jurisdiction to collect intelligence or be operational in any way.

The remaining NSCID's appear to havo no bearing on

the subject matter of foreign intelligence collection in the

United States.

c. Director of Central Intelligence Directives

To implement the National Security Act of 1947 as

amendod and the various National Socurity Council Intelligonce

Directives issued pursuant thereto, the Director of Centrai

Intellicence has issued uumerous Directives (DCID'S), The

first of these having a direct bearing on jurisdictional matters

is DCID No. 2/3, captioned "Domestic Exploitation of

Nongovernmental Organizations and Individuals."

NSCID No. 2,

paragraph 7, states that CIA shall be responsible for the

selective exploitation within the U.S. of such organizations

and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence information.

We, therefore, have avoided, and should avoid, any operations

among nongovernmental organizations and individuals designed

solely to produce foreign intelligence without CIA prior

DCID No. 2/3 provides for exploitation of nongovernmental

Case were the der mustan etices a stead tea

operational interest in a U.S. citizen, Central Intelligence

Agency will coordinate with that agency prior to further contaci."

This DCID also provides for exploitation by CIA

domestic field offices of aliens, following a prior name check

with FBI so our statutory obligations may be properly met without

CIA interference.

It is of possible interest to note that in dealing with

these two matters, DCID No. 2/3 refers to nongovernmental U. S.

citizens but only

to aliens (without the restrictive adjéctive).

The NSCID on which it is based refers to nongrovernmental

individuals without distinguishing between citizens and aliens.

Inus, there appears to have been an intention to confine CIA's

intelligence exploitation functions within the U.s. A review

of our file on CIA (62-80750) indicates this might well have

0 07A. t22-80 Functio

been a concession to the Bureau since we went on record opposing

delegation of any intelligence collection functions within the

U.S. to CIA in letters to Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg

(then Director of Central Intelligence Group) on June 25, 1946,

(Serial 96), August 6, 1946, (Serial 158), and August 23, 1946,

(Serial 222), which have been discussed more juily under the

heading "National Intelligence Authority."

DCID No. 2/8 is captioned "Domestic Exploitation of

U. S. Government Organizations and Officials." It begins in

very general terms, "Pursuant to the provisions of NSCID No. I

and NSCID No. 2.

Agency shall

coordinate and have the

It provides, "Tho Contral Intolligonce

primary responsibility for

exploitation of the foreign intelligence potential of non-USIB

organizations and officials

to moet community needs as a

sexvice of common concern."

As set forth above, there seems to be no basis for

such CIA jurisdiction in NSCID No. 1 and No. 2.

Paragraph Y

Of NSCID No. 2 specifically restricts CIA in this area of

operations to nongovernmental organizations and individuals.

A review of our U. S. Intelligence Board (USIB) file,

62-90718, shows following apropos this matter:

The Draft Minutes of the 3/21/61 USIB

meeting report that the Board approved the

draft of a DCID on "Domestic Exploitation of

U. S. Government Organizations and Officials,"

which would be issued as DCID No. 2j8, tifective

3/21/61. Mr. Belmont was present at this USIB

meeting as the FBI representative.

(unnumbered

serial between serials 1131'& 1132, USIB file)

Tracing this subject matter back through

the USIB file it was learned that it apparently

was first considered at the meeting held 2/23/60

at which the Bureau was represented by Fred A.

Frohbose. The minutes for that meeting reported

the Board agreed in principle that a directive on

Intelligence Exploitation of U. S. Governmental

officials would be desirable. However, the

matter was referred to the Committee on Domestic

Exploitation for further study and the submission

of a revised draft for Board consideration.

(unnumbered serial between serials 1040 & 1041,

USIB file)

From the foregoing it would appear that the Bureau

concurred in the issuance of

this particular Directive and thus

to an extension of CIA's overt collection activities in the

U:S. it: this should, in fact, be interpreted as an extension.

DCID 4/1 provides

for the establishment of the

Interagency Defector Committee.

DCID's 4/2 and 4/3 relate to the Defector Program

abroad and domestically, respectively.

The latter one dwells on

division of responsibilities between FBI and CIA in the handling

of defectors within the continental limits of the United Statos.

It providos that exploitation of such delectors shall be conducted:

1.

To obtain internal security information or other

data required by FBI in view of its statutory responsibilities

in the internal security field.

2. To obtain foreign intelligence information required

in the interests of national

security by the member agencies of

the USIB.

3. For such other purposes as are deemed to be in the

interests of national security.

• The very next sentence then gives the implication that

exploitation of the defector for foreign intelligence purposes is

• the principal responsibility of CIA, for it reads, "Decision as

to the relative importance of internal security exploitation by

FBI and foreign intelligence exploitation by the Central

Intelligence

Agency (CIA) shall be made jointly by representatives of

CIA and FBI."

There then follows a listing of nine specific FBI

responsibilities, one of which

is to make available to CIA foreign

intelligence information resulting from the initial exploitation

of defectors.

There is no subsequent specific delineation of CIA

responsibility over foreign intelligence exploitation until there

is a transfer of

respons-bility for handling a defector from FBI

to CIA alter FBI interests have been fully satisfied.

There is a

general assignment of such responsibility to CIA in the terms,

"CIA shall be responsible fox:

Coordinating the activities of.

other departments and agencies concerned with defector matters,

except those responsibilities assigned exclusively to FBI . ..."

As a matter of practice, if it is determined there is

little or no importance from an internal security standpoint in

connection with a particular defection, we do not take over but in

effect give clearance to CIA to proceed from a foreign intelli

gence standpoint.

DCID's in the 5/ series (numbers one through five) were

issued principally to implement NSCID Number 5 which deals with

U. S. espionage and clandestine counterintelligence activities

abroad.

There appears to be no conflict with FBI jurisdiction in

this series.

All other DOID's relate to Flint Critical Intelligence

and other matters. which appear to have no bearing on possible

conflicts between CIA and FBI responsibilities.

a. Dulles Committee

1942

the bulles committee was appanted february 3, 1948,

by the National Security Council (NSC) to make a "comprehensivo,

Impartial and objective survey of the organization, activities

and personnel of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)." The

Committee was instructed to report its Lindings and recommendations

on the following matters:

(a) The adequacy and effectiveness of the

organization structure of CIA.

(b) The value and efficiency ai existing CIA activities.

(c) The relationship of

these activities to those of

other departments and agencies.

(a). The utilization and qualifications of CIA personnel.

The Committee's scope was extended on March 17, 1948,

to include the following provisions:

"This survey will comprise

primarily à through und comprchensive examination of the

structure, administration, activities and inter agency relations

ships of the CIA

at as out in a thi

as outlined in the resolution of the National

Security Council. It will also include an examination oi such

intelligence activities of other Government depastments und

agencies as relate to the national security, in order to make

recommendations for their effective operation and overall

coordination..."

This report, which is dated January 1, 1949, for the

most part concerned itself with administrative natters alfecting

CIA and the necessity for reorganization within that Agency.

notes, however, that the National Security Act, as implemented

by directives of the NSC, imposed upon CIA responsibility for

carrying out three essential functions:

(1) The coordination of intelligence activities.

• (2) The correlation and evaluation of intelligence

relating to the national security, which has been interpreted

by directive as meaning the production of national intelligence.

(3) The performance centrally, subject to NSC

direction, of certain intelligence and related functions of

common concern to various departments of the Government.

The report noted that Section 102 of the National

Security Act of 1947 established a Iramework for a sound

intelligence system and no amendment to that section of the

Act was deemed necessary.

Although the coordination of intelligence activitles

of the several departments and agencies concerned with national

security was a primary reason for establishing Cla, the report

noted the National Security Act does not give CIA independent

authority to coordinate intelligence activities, as final

responsibility to establish policies was vested

In the NSC.

The statutory limitations upon the authority of CIA

to coordinate intelligene activities without the approval of

the NSC were, according to the report, obviously designed to

protect the

autonomy and internal arrangements of the various

departments

and agencies performing intelligence functions.

In spite of these calculated iimitaiions un the authority of

CIA, the report noted, it was clear the Agency was expected to

provide the initiative and leadership in developing a coordinated

intelligence system. In practice, the NSC has almost without

exception approved the recommendations submitted to it by CIA

for the coordination of intelligence activities.

The National Security Act does not deline the

"intelligence activities" which were to be coordinated by CIA

under the direction of the NSC or specify the departments

whose activities were covered.

Presumably; according to the

report, all intelligence activities relating to the national

intelligence reports and estimates.. "The criterion," which the

report noted was a very broad one, was "such intelligence

activities.

..as relate to the national security and not

the identity of the departments concerned or the nature or

locale of the intelligence activity."

Thus, the report noted,

practically no limitations are set upon the

scope of the intelli-

gonce activities with which the Central Intelligence Agency is

to concern itsell.

-. 30

## Page 203

→ ..

The report noted another broad field requiring

coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived icom

domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter-

intelligence.

This includes tho oxploitation of intolligonce

from United

states business firms, travellers,

etc., exploitation

of the intelligence possibilities of groups and individuals of

foreign nationality in the United States, the rolating oi

domostic counterintelligenco to foreign intelligence and the

coordination of domestic counterespionage

with counterespionage

abroad.

Except lor the exploitation of private sources of

Ioreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized

in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for other

activities is scattered among the State Department, the armed

services, the FBI and CIA.

The FBI, which has primary security and law enforce-

ment responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important

area of intelligence.

This includes domestic counterespionage

sand countersabotage,

control of communist and other subversive

activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups.

All of these functions, according to the report, are closely

relaieù to the comparable activities abroad of the CIA.

The report noted the FBi was not part of the then

l existing machinery for courdination of intelligence through

¡the Intelligence Advisory Committee and there was no continuing

manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence

were related to overall national intelligence in order to serve

the general purpose set forth in the National security ACt,

which was set forth as "of coordinating the intelligence activities

of the several Government departments and agencies in the interest

of national security."

It was the opinion of the authors of the Dulles Report

that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the

problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence

and counterintelligence which relate to the national security.

and CIA should submit recommendations on this subject to the

•NSC.

The report noted this was not inconsistent with the

stipulation o1 the National Security Act that CIA "shall have no

police, subpoena,

law enforcement powers or internal security

functions. "

The Dulles Commission recommended that the FBI

should be made a member of the Intelligence Advisory

Committee

to improve coordination of domostic intelligence and countor

Intelligence Insolar as these matters related to the national

security.

While discussing the production of National

intelligence listimates by clA, the report noted,

"There is

no systematic way of tapping

that domestic intelligence

having a bearing on broader intelligence issues and there

is no regular and agreed arrangement for participation by the

a national estimate."

National Security Council Intelligence Directive

Number Y provided that CIA shall be responsible for

• the

exploitation, on a highly selective basis, within the United

states of business concerns, other non-Governmental organizations

and individuals as sources of foreign intelligence intormation.

The report concluded the amount of foreign intelligence which

can be obtained through the exploitation of non-guvernmental

sources in the United States is considerable and its quality

could be very high it appropriate arrangements were made and

discrimination was employed.

It was felt the vast number oi

organizations, institutions

and

individuals having foreign

interests and knowledge represented a potential source oi.

intelligence that in many ways was

superior to any other,

as it was felt that they were in a

position to provide

information obtained from their foreign contacts and from the

findings on their own people abroad...

A further important source of information, the

exploitation for intelligence purposes of foreign individuals

and groups in the United States was also being developed.

The

report noted that these individuals and groups as well as

political refugees and former foreign government officials

were often engaged in political activity with significant

international implications.

CiA and other intelligence agencies had not developed

coordinated and effective policies and procedures for the

exploitation of intelli ence in this important field.

The FBi,

because of

possible security implications.

The report indicated the

FBI possessed considerable incormation concerning many

individuals and groups but this information had been obtained

primarily with security mther than intelligence considerations

curity ente

in mind and was not normally given the kind of Interpretation

or dissemination that intelligenco requirod if it was to be

properly used. It was also noted the fBi was, in cases where

it had a security interest, reluctant on security grounds to

have intelligence exploitation by outside agencies. The general

result of this situation, according to the report, was that an

important souice of intelligence was not being fully exploited:

The report noted that the question of the

exploitation for intelligence purposes of loreign groups and

individuals in the United States was a clear exanple where

the Intelligence Advisor Committee, with the FBI being added

-as a member, should establish principles and rules for

cooraination..

In discussing the soministrative handling of

espionage and counterespionage matters within the CIA, the

report noted the FBI was charged with all counterespionage

responsibilities in the United States except those affecting

personnel of the armed services.

The Dulles Commission

recommended the counterespionage activities of CIA should be

increased in scope and emphasis and that closer liaison in

this field should be established with the FBI.

The only effect the Dulles Report had on the FBI

was its inclusion as a member of the Intelligence Advisory

Committee by amendment to HSCID Number 1 dated July. 7, 1949.

e. Hoover Commission, 1948 and 1955

Task forces of the Commission on Organization of the

Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission)

conducted surveys of CIA operations from 1947 to 1949 (under E.

Eberstadt) and from 1953 to 1955 (under General Mark Clark).

agencies and departments.

The Commission examined agency

activity in light of the CIA primary mission of advising

NSC and performing.

services and duties rolatod to

intelligence and

national security as the NSC directed.

(la) Eberstadt Task Force Report

The results of the first examination of CIA by the

Hoover Commission were more or less apologetic in tone,

emphasizing the soundness of directives setting up NSC and its

direction of the Agency.

the report pointed out, however,

that CIA and its parent, NSC, had had little time to actually

implement the coordination necessary for leadership in the

field.

The Task Force clearly defined its understanding of

•the CIA mission as:

....., coordinate intelligence activities

of Federal agencies concerned with national security."

The duties of CIA were listed as:

1.

Advise National Security Council on national

security intelligence activities of Federal departments and

agencies:

2.

Recommend necessary coordination of such

activities to National Security Council.

3. Correlate, evaluate and disseminate national

security intelligence.

4. Render intelligence services for other Federal

'departments and agencies." (62-88575-3 enclosure behina file.)

In discussing the duties of the CIA the Task Force

noted, "Under the statute CIA is entrusted with the performance

of such services of common concern as the National Security

Council shall determine.

Scientific Intelligence, which is discussed separately:

maintenance of central indexes of report, recoras, and documents

having intelligence value;

(b examination of foreign documents

broadcasts; and (e)

collection of the information by

clandestine means and counterespionage abroad."

## Page 207

In evaluating the operations and location of CIA •

counterespionage the Task force commented as follows:

"The counterespionage activities of CIA abroad appear

properly integrated with CIA's other clandestine operations.

Although arguments have been made in favor of extending CIA's

authority to include responsibility for counterespionage in this

country, such ar

extension of jurisdiciion does not a present

appear justilled.

For one thing, concentration of power over

counterespionage activities at

home in the hands of a Director

of Central Intelligence responsible for espionage abroad might

justifiably arouse public suspicion and opposition.

Conceivably

it could form the basis for a charge that a gestapo is in

process of creating even though the pover to arrest were

specifically withheld. To transier responsibility for domestic

counterespionage from the FBI, which has an established

organization and long tradItIon,

to CiA, which is not equippec

lox the assignment, would probably create more problems than It

would solve. It is doubtful whether the logical benefit of

having one agency responsible for counterespionage throughout

the world would justify the dislocation and confusion that such

¿ transfer would inevitably occasion."

"CIA representatives have indicated that their present

working liaison with FBI is satisiactory, but the Committee

doubts that FBI-CIA relationships

are completely adequate.

The

Director of FBI declined the Committee's invitation to appear

before it to discuss the CIA with the committee or its

representatives on the ground that he knew too little of its

activities."

The groundwork for CIA acceptance was laid by the

Committee recommendation and finding:

"CIA is not now properly

organized.

Co-equal improvement in G-2, FBI, ONI,

State

Department, and other Government intelligence services is also

essential. Spirit of teamwork must govern interagency

intelligence relationships.

CIA deserves and must have greater

degree of acceptance aud support from old-line intelligence

services than it has had in the past."

A pitch was made for a single agency controlling

internal security in the Committee's finding: "The committee

believes that

responsibility for internal security policies

should be immediately focused in one agency.. A more thorough

study of the subject than any: yet made nust be, prosecuted, and

interagency Irictions must be

(1b) Clark Task Force Report

The Task Force headed by General Mark Clark

submitted a Top Secret report dated in May, 1955, setting

forth resulis of the second Hoover Commission survey of the

organization of CIA.

The report pointed out the survey

was of departments and agencies with entire or prime

responsibility in the fiold of positive foreign intelligence

as it pertains to national defense and security. It

qualified this surver when speaking of the FBI, noting

survey was limited to survey of Bureau only to the extent

that it dealt in security intelligence.

Again the Hoover Commission through its Task

Force pinned CIA jurisdiction down to the areas defined by statute,

and emphasized the Agency was subordinate only to the National

Security Council in its coordination, correlation, dissemination

and collection of intelligence data.

In commenting on the role of the FBI the Committee

further noted, "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,

With regard to the use and surfacing of sources,

as internal security within the U.S. is concerned.

commented, "It is the duty of the fbi to conduct investigations

A review of the Commission report lends one important

fact to our study of this subject matter. This was pointed

up by the membership of the various groups at the disposal

of the National Security Council within the field of national

intelligence.

Ten subcommittees or working groups with member

ship from separate departments or interested agencies acted

in advisory capacities to the IAC parent committee.

In each

of these subcommittees the chairman was a representative oi

the Director of CIA and the working groups were individually

serviced by a secretariat lurnished by CIA.

From the top-

heavy alignment of CIA personnel in IAC and its working groups

it was obvious in which direction advisory opinions would be

slanted when dissenting matters were presented by the IAC and

CIA tO the NSC.

1. The Doolittle Committoe, 1954

In July, 1954, we received Intormation Irom the

White House that

the President had appointed Lieutenant

General James H. Doolittle to study in collaboration with

the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certain aspects of

the national intelligence effort.

By letter dated

July 28, 1954, Sherman Adams, the Assistant to the President,

requested that the Bureau briel General Doolittle's group

concerning the relationship that existed between the Bureau

and CIA. We subsequently learned that at approximately che

same time a survey would be conducied by the hoover

Commission under the chairmanship of General Mark Clark.

We Learned from Allen H. Dulles, Director of ClA, that the

. President strongly believed that General Clark should noc

permit the survey to get into CIA covert operations,

particularly in the field of political and psycholagical

warfare.

The President had told Dulles that he was selecting

Generat

Doolittle to study CIA's covert operations.

• General Doolitile's group was briefed on

August 25, 1954, at which time the Bureau's position in

the intelligence field was described and the manner in

which che Bureau transacted business with CIA was explained.

In addition, certain constructive criticism concerning

problems and conflicts experienced in dealing with CIA was

furnished General Doolittle's group. The following salient

features of the criticism appear to bear on the current study:

We were critical of a policy of the office of

Operations, CIA, which precluded that Division from

identifying any of its sources in the United States when

such sources possessed information bearing on the internal

security of the United States.

The Office of Operations as

01. 1954 collected foreign intelligence information in the

United States from aliens, businessmen, and others, and

periodically would receive information

of interest to the

Bureau. •Instances arose where the Bureau desired to interview

the original source but was prevented from getting to the

Our opinion was that

If we had been appropriately notilled of CIA's interest

considerable investigative tine and manpower could have

been saved and in addition we would have been in a position

to notily CIA when anything of interest came to our

attention.

Concerning CIA investigations in the United

States, we readily acknowledged CIA's right to investi-

gate its own applicants or consultants. We did object

to CIA's undertaking any investigation in this country

Bureau's collection of intelligonce information ior the

Our

discharge of our intelligence operation concerning the

Communist Party and Soviet and Satellite diplomats was

explained in detail to the satisfaction of all personnel

attending the briefing.

General Doolittle asked for recommendations as to

what could be done to improve CIA so the Bureau would get

better service.

It was suggested that corrective action be

taken on the matters which had been criticized constructively;

CIA should establish adequate coverage (although not

specifically noted, this obviously regarded advance notice

of foreign intelligence personnel coming to the United States);

and linally CIA should transmit information developed

in an

Prior to submitting the report to the President,

General Doolittle expressed

a desire to see Mr. Hoover, whom

he regarded

as the outstanding intelligence authority in the

world.

The General visited the Director on October 5, 1954,

during which visit CIA's operations were discussed and

generally the points of the previous meeting were reiterated.

General Doolittle felt the ideal solution would be to wipe out

•CIA entirely and start all over again, but since this was

impractical his committee would point out certain neaknesses

and make certain recommendations and suggestions to the

President for the correction of these weaknesses.

It should be noted in considering the proposed

change of USIB membership that the Bureau was a member of

six of the twenty-six subcommittees which formed the committee

make-up of the UsIs.

Memorandum January 10, 1961, Mr: Belmont to

Mr. Parsons outlined the proposed USIB membership change

for the Director.

It recommended that Bureau make no issue

The Director underlined

a passage of the memorandum which stated "In one sense of

the word it could be arbied the FBI would lose prestige

by changing from a regular member to an ad hoc member.

The Director approved the recommendation of the memorandum

"O.K. but I am not enthusiastic

about the change of our status. H."

Our status,

however, was

not changed and the Bureau has continued to hold Lull member

ship on the Board.

In brief, the Joint Study Group Report noted that

the majority of the recommendations of the Study Group bad

boon favorably received by the intelligence community in

that positive action had been taken to place most of them

in effect. Many of the recommendations of the Group were

felt to have been met by the creation of the Defense

Intelligence Agency (DIA) which acted as a coordinator and

overseer of the intelligence effort of the Joint Chiefs

of Staff.

There is no comment made in this report which

would bear on our present survey of CIA jurisdiction or

activities within the United States in conflict with our own

jurisdictional and investigative interests.

The only

reference to the Bureau in this latter report was as

previously mentioned in the comment relative to reorganization

of the membership of the USIB.

Intelligence is distinguished from the Director of Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) in that the Director of Central

Intelligence as Chairman of the United States Intelligence

Board is considered the President's principal advisor on

torolgn intolligence.

Momborship on tho Unitod Statos

Intelligence Board consists of the Director of Intelligence

and Research, Department of State; the Deputy Director of CIA;

the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; the Directox

of the National Security Agency; the Assistant General Manager

Ior Administration, Atomic Energy Conmission, and the Assistant

Director of the FBI. The primary responsibility of the USIB

is the coordination of intelligence activities.

In this

regard, USIB's major effort is concerned with the preparation

and approval ot National Intelligence Estimates (NIE) for use

by policy makers.

As a rule, the Bureau does not participate in the

preparation of NIE's inasmuch as the subject matter is usually

outside the jurisdiction of this Bureau.

We have in the past.

participated in some selective NIE's such as certain estimates

on Cuba, world communtsm, the clandestine introduction of

22010277

weapons into the

Taited States and on the Dominican

Republic.

As part of its staffing procedure, USIB has

created numerous committees in some of which the Bureau

maintains membership.

The USIB committees on which the

Bureau has representation are the Technical Surveillance

Countermeasures Committee, the signal Intelligence Committee,

the Interagency Defector

Committee, the Watch Committee,

the

Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee, the Guided Missile

Astronautics Intelligence Committee, the Security Committee,

and the Comnittee on Documentation.

As a general rule,

attendance at Committee sessions is handled by the Liaison

Section.

Attendance at meetings is in the main restricted to

the Interagency Detector Committee, the Waten Committee, the

Security Committee, the technical Surveillance Countermeasures

Committee and the Committee on Documentation:

The Bureau has

a primary interest in the business of these five committees.

Over the years, consideration has been given to

the Bureau's withdrawing its membership from USIB. On each

occasion the Director has chosen to have the Bureau retain

its membership on the Board.

The last such occasion occurred

In 1964 during the period when John McCone was Chairman of

the United states Intelligence Board. At that time, the military

services were removed from membershin on the Board and replaced

by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

. At the time, Mr. Belmont,

then Assistant to the Director, orally discussed with the

Director the possibility of the Bureau's withdrawing from the

USIB. The Director's comments were that we would not request

removal from membership on the Board but would withdraw our

membership only il so requested by the Director of Central

Intelligence in his role as Chairman of the USIB. The Bureau's

witharawal would, of course, require action on the part of

the National Security Council.

• d. The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB)

This group was oxiginally organized in January, 1956,

as the Presideni's Buard oi Consultants on Forcion Intelligenes

Activity.

Its primary function at that time was to review

periodically the Government's foreign intelligence efforts

With specific emphasis on the operations of the Central

Intelligence Agency.

It was established as a result of

recommendations by the Hoover Commission.

In the later years

of the Eisenhower Administration the activity of the group

fell off and it was re-organized in its present form with the

advent of the Kennedy Administration.

Our relationship with this Board has historically

been one of informal liaison in view of the fact that the

primary function of the Board is concerned with loreign

intelligence.

There have been occasions where representatives

of the Bureau briefed individual members and/or panels of

the Board concerning our jurisdiction, techniques and

accomplishments in the intelligence field. These briefings

i have been received with a receptive and sympathetic attitude.

Our main concern in following the

activities of this Board

has been

to assure that the Central Intelligence Agency: does

not encroach upon our j'risdiction and upon the functions of

the various intelligence communities in which we hold membership.

The Director's Stand Over the Years

The Director's stand over the years

with respect

to jurisdiction concerning foreign intelligence matters

within the United States is reflected in numerous comments

he has made dating back to the days when the Central

InteLlIgenCe GrOUP. (CIG) was being formed.

In June, 1946, General Vandenberg, then head of

CIG, sent a memorandum to the Director proposing that the

National Intelligence Authority issue a directive extending

the powers and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence,

which position General Vandenberg occupied.

The memorandum

was analyzed on June 21, 1946, in a memorandum from C. H.

Carson to D. M. Ladd in

Tand 17 296h it was

which it was pointed out that it

was inevitable that CIG must enter into the domestic

picture because of sources of foreign intelligence in that

field.

An addendum was placed on the memorandum by Mr. Edward &.

Tamm and Mr. C. A. Tolson which was followed by comments by

the Director which is most pertinent to the subject matter

ünues siscussion. The undondum read:

"Mr. Tolson and Mr.

Tamm do not concur with

the conclusion expressed in this memorandum that

•'It is inevitable that the Central Intelligence

Group must enter into the domestic field picture

insofar as intelligence is concerned because of

the sources of foreign intelligence existing in

that field.'

They feel that a coordinated

gram for the exchange of information between the

Central Intelligence Authority and the FBI,

• ;

permitting a free and comprehensive exchange of

information in matters of mutual interest, will

enable the Bureau to work in the domestic field

without interference from the Central Intelligence

Authority in the same manner that the Bureau works,

for example, with local police departments or other

governmental agencies within defined jurisdictional

lines. We believe that the attached letter to

General Vandenberg is satisfactory."

The Director commented as follows:

"I am not as optimistic as are Tolson & Tamm.

I think it is inevitable that there will be a

collision with CIG over our domestic jurisdiction

It means we must zealously guard our

domestic jurisdiction & not yield an inch& be

ever aleft to resist any encroachment."

On March 27, 1953, the Director testilled before the

Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations.

In response to a

• question

from Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA,

the Director stated:

"There is close liaison. CIA has

exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have

exclusive jurisdiction within the United States. We maintain

continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters in Washington through

& liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate

the transnission of material from them to us and from our

service to them."

In October, 1958, CIA approached us requesting

ur concurrence in CIA's establishing physical and technical

•surveillance in the United States on the

CIA had an operational interest in

this individual. By memorandum it was recommended that the

Bureau not become involved in this CIA operation and that CIA

be informed that this would not establish a precedent for

approval of Luture CIA activities in the United States.

Responsive to continuing to present problems, the Director

noted:

"This, is an understatement particularly if we are

going to adopt a macaroni backbone attitude instead of standing

up forthrightly for our rights and jurisdiction."

CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that one of its

sources would be visiting the United States, and

requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage

including technical surveillance.

It was recommended we stay

out of this matter and inform CIA that this was not to be

construed as a precedent for approval of future CIA counter

intelligence activity in the United States. The Director

commented on the memorandum:

"The trend has gone so far we

have become nothing but & rubber stamp for CIA yet they won't

even allow us to perform liaison functions abroad much less

operational ones."

In January, 1960, CIA agreed to comply with

conditions imposed by the Bureau with rogard to developing

positivo intelligence information through contacts between

U.S. residents and visitors from Iron Curtain countrios.

CiA agrood to contact

first before promoting such

associations. In March, 1900, CIA inquired i1 it might obtain

Bureau clearance at the

ficla lovel for such contacts in the

intarest of expodioncy.

Mx. Tolson notod: "Moro and moro we

are agreeing to CIA operations in the U.S. I am opposed

to this relaxation.

We can exercise better control here than

through

our field offices."

The Director added: "I share

Tolson's views." CIA was advised clearance was to be obtained

through Bureau headquarters.

A source.

furnished information alleging

penetration of American intelligence.

One Serge Karlow, a

CIA Officer, was developed as a suspect.

On 2/9/62, we took

over the investigation.

On 2/26/62, Sheffield Edwards, then

CIA Director of Security, admitted CIA had had technical

coverage on Karlow from February, 1961 to 2/9/62. Edwards'

sinimed his reluctance to tell us of this situation earlier

because of obvious possible jeopardy to prosecution, plus

embarrassment to his Agency

should the Bureau raise an

objection to CIA's maintaining such coverage.

The Director

noted: "I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can

•never

be depended upon to deal forthrightly with us.

Certainly

my skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion but on

specific instances all too many in number. Yet there exists

wistlul belief

that 'the leopard has changed his spots'

In April, 1962, we received information on a

strictly confidential basis from Jay Sourwine of the Senate

Internal Security Subcommittee to the effect that an

unidentified CIA representative had talked to Senator Eastland

concerning an alleged move to place CIA in charge of all

intelligence-gathering operations for the Government -- to

include Soviet espionage in the U. S.

The Director noted:

"I am not surprised at

the above alleged effort. There is no

doubt in many quarters a desire to eliminate the FBI in

dealing with espionage and subversion for we are a thorn not

only in the side of communists but also the ADA and Fabian

Socialists. CIA which Lailed again and again to know what

is actually going on abroad could be counted upon to blunder

the same way in the USA."

In April, 1963, we received information indicating

that CIA Director John McCone was considering expansion of

CIA operations in the United States - specifically intelligence

coverage and the developmont of sources in this country ""McCone

Director made a note on the memorandun recording this:

is trying to do another 'Donovan.? It he injects himself into

the U. S., the FBI gets out. Too many cooks spoil the broth."

In December, 1963, the Director inquired as to the

nature and extent of intelligence operations wherein CIA had

established contact with a diplomat, operated him in the U.s.

with our coordination, and continued to operate him upon his

having departed this country.

Four such cases were cited. On

the memorandum, the Director noted: "I have little confidence

in CIA abiding

by agreements if it serves its purpose better

not to do so."

In January, 1964, CIA advised us It had reorganized

its activities in the U. S. The Domestic Operations Division,

CIA, had established field offices in this country under

appropriate cover.

A memorandum was prepared describing the

history of CiA operatiuis in the t. f. and recommanding estion

designed to protect our interests.

A letter went to CIA with

ground rules which the Bureau expected CIA to follow in all

matters requiring coordination.

The Director aoted:

"OK, but

I hope you are not being taken in.

I can't forget CIA

withholding the French espionage

activities in the U. S. nor

the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only

to mention two of their instances of double dealing."

The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64, set forth

its observations concerning a briefing given that office on the

matter of CIA operations in the U. S.

The Director commented:

"I think this domestic operations expansion of CIA is very

dangerous and will inevitably "muddy' the waters."

In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsidered its stand

with respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreign

to permitting c

establishments in the United states. for intelligence purposes.

The following policy was proposed and subsequently approved:

(i) Where there was no indication a source would

be leaving the United States, we would deny CIA clearance

for contact until we had fully explored the person's

potential for our own purposes'"."

If we decided we had no

investigations, we would grant CIA approval to proceed

with its contact with proviso we be kept informed of

(2) Where i't appeared source would be returning

to a foreign country shortly we would normally grant

CIA clearance for preliminary contact with proviso we

We reserved the right to

take direct access to the source as our needs required.

(3) Where there was an overlapping of interests

and source expected to continue in United States LOr

CIA had entree and no Bureau investigation would be

jeopardized we would permit CIA to explore matter and

make preliminary contact keeping us advised of progress

and getting our specific clearance before a direct

recruitment approach; however, where factors indicated

it would be to best Bureau interests to operate source,

we would undertake the recruitment and keep CIA advised

of information of interest to that Agency.

When these matters were submitted for approval

Mr. Tolson commented, "Looks okay, but we will bave to watch

this very closely."

THE NEED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

FOREIGN INTELLIGINCE IN THE U. S.

In 1941, the U. S. allegodly had in its

possession practically all of the torotgn intelligence

It needed regarding military and strategic targets in

Japan.

The informa ion was scattered among various

individuals who had porsonal knowledge or was located

In libraries, various Government agoncies, private

business firms, institutions, et cetera.

Tragically,

the U. S. Government did not

have any mechanism to

collect, record and evaluate such information.

Intelligence was badly needed in 1941, and we paid

dearly in lives and financial resources to accomplish

certain missions because the information was not

readily available.

Today, the need for foreign intelligence is

greater than ever. The stakes of foreign policy have

never been higher. The U. S., being a dominating world

power, has assumed vast responsibilities enmeshed in

delicate poiitical situations throughout the world.

The ever-existing threat of an atomic war with communist

countries demanás a continuing acquirement al inowlerga

so thatpolicies and courses of action can be designed

in the most effective manner possible. The information

area being scientific research and development. In this

connection, the revolutionary break-throughs in the :

scientific category are occurring with unusually high

Irequency, and il the U. S. is to remain in the

We have been fortunate to collect high￾

collection methods, i.e high altitude photography and

research in this area is proceeding at an accelerated

pace. Nevertheless, electronic gadgets and machines

For the purpose of this paper, we are

thinking about the search for knowledge

considered

vital for national survival. One could suggest

that clandestine collection of intelligence. 1s

ovoromphasizod and that our Govornmant could x0ad11}

protect its interests through overt collection and

the employment of our best analysts and evaluators.

If we take this approach, ve may as well discount

tho importance of the Bureau's activities ln the

counterintelligence field, which essentially are

of a clandestine nature and which have produced time

and again vital intelligence. We, therefore, must

move on the assumption that the clandestine

collection of foreign intelligence is very detinitely

a most necessary element of our over all intelligence

capabilities.

In addition to the overt sources, there

exists a rich potential in the U.s. among

the foreign

diplomatic establishments including the U. N., the

officials ol foreign governments, and visitors such

as students, professors, and scientists.

A certain

amount of infvimation from such sources

san. ha

obtained in an overt fashion, but the high quality

data is normally acquired through clandestine neans.

This can be done through technical monitoring,

development of live sources, access to records,

files, et cetera.

There are approximately 10,000

foreign officials in the U.s. assigned to embassies,

consulates, trade missions, U. N., and other

international organizations.

This excludes

dependents.

During the fiscal year ending June 30,

1965, 38,544 foreign governent officials visited

the U. S.; about 1500 of these came from communist-bloc

countrIes.

During the fiscai year ending June 30, 1965,

approximately 50,000 foreign students came to the U.S.;

733 of these came from the communist bloc.

During the

sane fiscal year, there were 2,075,967 visitors from

30: 3200

all countries.

Everyone of the foregoing is a potential

source of Loreign intelligence. As can be readily

accepted, the U. S. Government does not have a capa...

bility. of assessing each and every one of these sources

for foreign intelligence. We can say at this point

that the FBI and CIA are just scratching the surface.

E: CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF CIA IN

THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION

FIELD IN THE UNITED STATES

In order that there may not be any

misunderstanding regarding CIA's capabilities to

collect foreign intelligence in the United States,

we should first clarily that one of the components

of the Agency which has offices in the United states

does not engage in this particular activity.

The Office of Security, which is responsible for

personnel and physical

security, maintains severa.

offices in the United Statos under authorized

Treasury Department cover. Personnel of this

oifice conduct investigations of applicants, firms

or individuals who may be utilized by CIA on

a contract basis to support intelligence operations

overseas.

The overt collection of intelligence by

CIA is handled by the Domestic Contact Service (DCS)

(Iormerly called Contact Division).'' CIA estimates .

that DOS has a capability of tapping approximately

15 per cent of the total potential of intelligence in

the U.s.

I6 resident agencies in the United States, and each

go toe 10n

office is openly identilied as being connected with

CIA.

Personnel totaling approximately 140 carry CIA

credentials.

The Division regularly has a number of

Officers from the various military services who are

assigned to this Division on a temporary basis.

These military officers concentrate on the collection

of that foreign intelligence which relates to the

immediate United States military needs.

The personne

information collected covers a very broad

spectrum in

the positive intelligence category. DOS. claims to have

contact with about 7200 organizations, institutions, or

businesses and has approximately 60,000 contacts or

sources of intormation.

The information is reported in

the form of "Information Reports," wich is disseminated

throughout the intelligence community. During 1965,

59

NN 55120 DocId:32989629 Page 231

## Page 232

DOs asseminatea 20,000 such reports.

DCS does not

have any responsibilities in the clandestine colLection

of intelligence, and in that sense it is very.

specifically not operational. DOS delinitely cannot

engage in any activity oi an internal security nature,

and within CIA it is clearly understood that DOS is

not to be operational under any circumstances.

that Des should be an appendago of the Deputy Directox

of Plans, who is responsible for all clandestine

The other school which has prevailed

holds to the line that DOS should be separate and.

continue under the supervision of the Deputy Director..

of Intelligence (DDI).

This situation not only has

caused headaches for CIA but also for the Bureau because

of situations which arise where the "leit hand does not

know what the right hand is doing.".

DCs is essentially carrying out CIA's

responsibilities emanating from National Security Council

Intelligence Directive (NSCID) No. 2 which has its roots

in a similar airective issued under tro Nationa

Intelligence Authority in 1946.

It has been in business

for approximately twenty years.

Per agreement, DOS

cannot interview an alien without lixst clearing with

the Bureau.. This is done on a daily basis.

With regard

to American citizens, Bureau approval is not required

unless

the Bureau has indicated a prior interest in the

individual; however, DCS nevertheless submits name

It should be noteo

that although DOS is engaged primarily in positive

intolligonce collection, it is required to be on the

than wait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which 1s

often prolonged and, when transmitted, is sometimes

stripped of pieces or incormatIon. This occurs

because of the involved and sometimes complicated

maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA:

In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its

Domestic Operations Division (DOD), which was to be

responsible for any clandestine development of sources

in the United States.

Prior to the establishment of

this Division,

CIA activity in this field was managed

Irom each individual area division at Washington

headquarters.

The pressing need for more clandestine

sources,

coupled with the recognition of the vast

potential in the United States, prompted CIA to create

a new division which would be responsible for all of

the area division interests. DOD has headquarters

at lashingion, D. C., and currently has field offices

at New York City, Boston, Chicago, an ITanCIsCo,

Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington, D. C., proper:

Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assigned

So to and Not tong n

to

the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment

of positivo intelligence sources, primarily in the

diplonatic field.

Some of the personnel are assigned

to the handling of firns or organizations which may

be supporting certain CIA operations abroad. DOD personnel

in the field operati under authorized Department of Defense

cover..

The heads of these field offices are known to us,

and we have established a satisfactory liaison area at

the field level.

DOD is also responsible for the handling of

CIA agents (informants) who have been recruited abroad

and who come to the United States for assignments either

on a temporary basis or for the duration of & normal

diplomatic assignment.

The creation of DOD within CIA was and st11l

is a somewhat controversial Agency subject. DOS saw

DOD as an interfering element. The area desks were

reluctant to havo a new division to take ovor thoir

aronts.

Some oi tha DOD pOrsOnnol are vory capablo

and seasoned intelligence officers. Many of them are

considered of mediocre capability, and there is

a frequent rumor that other ClA divisions send their

misiits to DOD.

From CiA's standpoint there appoars

to be a definite need for a much stronger team withis DOD.

Theoretically, DOD 1s required to be on the

alert for all potential

sources who can be used by CIA

in its intelligence operations, and the approach is

basically one of

a long-range

nature. DOD is required

to make use of all leads emanating Irom fellow employees

who may have developod social contacts or associations

with foreigners abroad or who might meet potential.

sources in the United States.

Since CIA personnel

operate under diplomatic cover when abroad, they do get

the opportunity to move in diplomatic circles.

undercover agents of CIA traveling throughout

also make contacts which offer potential exploitation i

and when the target stops in the United

sInCe January, 196%, When DOD actuaLly began

moving, it has recruited

approximately ten individuals

in the diplomatic field. Most of these were in the

noncommunist-bloc area.

All of those recruited appear

to have been in a fairly low-level category. All of them

were career diplomats, and there was no evidence that

the individuals were connected with any intelligence

service.

In addition to the activities of DOS and DOD,

there is a certain amount of CIA operational movements

which do not fall under either of the foregoing divisions.

One example is the liA base in Miami which was set up

for CIA's operations directed against the Cuban Government.

This base is used for the training and dispatching of

agents into Cuba and to some extent into other countries

in che Caribbean, particularly the Dominican Republic.

This base is directly responsible to the Western

Henisphere Division of CIA, which could be called the

Latin American Division.

This

activity talls unacr the Interuational OrganizatiOns

IOD does uso people in the

United States to hele implement the overseas programs.

Quite often the Agency uses cutouts or covers for such

an operation.

Althcigh IOD does not engage in intelligence

collection, it is a CIA division which should be kept in

mind, since its activities quite often will be tangent to

matters of interest to the Bureau.

For example, IOD

becomes involved in the World Youth Festival, where its

objective is to neutralize communist influence. We, of

course, have had an interest in the Festival because of the

participation oi Americans, including members oi the cPusa.

Theoretically, IOD is required to coordinate closely with

other appropriate components of CIA.

We do not believe

that this coordination has been elective enough.

There is no doubt that there are individuals

in CIA who aspire to broaden the Agency's operational

activities in the United States.

such individuals would

like to see an arrangement similar to one currently in

force in England where MI-6 has a free hand to assess and

recruit all loreigners, including diplomats, where there

is no evidence that they are engaged in intelligence

•activity.

If such evidence is obtained, MI-6 is required

to coordinate with MI-5.

There are people in CIA who

would like to see similar machinery and in addition would

want the freedom to conduct certain investigations and

maybe even institute technical surveillances.

-.

Is summary, CIA SO jaI has a very Limited

capability to recruit loreign diplomatic sources in the

United States, but the Agency appears to have done fairly

well with a relatively small stafi; however, 1t can be

anticipated that this capability will increase. CIA's

effectiveness will probably be adversely affected for

some time to come because of the Agency's well-known

deficiencies, such as lack of discipline, loose admin-.

istration, and lack of skilled and

talented personnel.

CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF THE FBI

I. Nanpower Being Devoted

•It is most dillicult to five any specific ligures as to

how much manpower the IBI is currently dovoting strictly to

forcign intelligence collection, separate and apart from the

Bureau's internal security ind counterintelligence functions.

Much of the foreign intelligence developed by the Buroau is an

outgrowth of our inteinal socurity investigations and cannot be

neatly separaied, in terns oi manpower or time:

A substantial amount of our foreign intelligence activity

is concentrated in two offices where most of the diplomatic

• establishments in the United States are located; namely, New York

and Washington Field. Both ortices were requested to furnish

estimates as to how much manpower is being allocated to foreign

intelligence

matters, including both live sources developed and

technical coverage.

In both cases, the estimates provided were

highly tentative and both cifices stress that manpower commitments

in this area fluctuate widely from week to week depending on

international

politics and other unpredictable factors. For

instance, during the Cuban missile crisis of 190z, both oftices

greatly increased their normal manpower commitment to the develop

•ment oI current foreign intelligence.

The present vomInIcan crisis

which involves production of

foreign

intelligence to a large extent

represents another "abnormal" situation.

However,

for what it is worth, WrO and New York have

estimated that

at the present time they are allocating approxi-

mately 35 Agents and 20 clerical employees to the full time task

of foreign intelligence collection.

Virtually all of the clerical

time and about 40,per cent of the Agent time is related to

technical coverage and the balance is aimed at the development of

Live sources.

In addition, of course, all of the other offices, including

our Legal Attaches abroad, have devoted manpower to foreign

intelligence collection in varying degrees.

operations

conducted in diiferent field offices have involved the assignment

of as many as 10 or 12 Agents for temporary periods.

In connection

with its responsibilities in the Cuban and Latin-American fields,

the Miami and San Juan offices have devoted considerable manpower

to the development of foreign intelligence in recent years. The

Chicago Office in connection with its handling of our

informant has devoted manpower to the development of foreign

intelligence. These represent only a few examples.

On an overall basis and bearing in mind the difficulty.in

citing any precise ligures, it is estimated that the bureau probabLy

averages approximately 50 to 15 Agents and 25 to 30 clerks assigned

primarily to foreign intelligence work.

exception of one on the

In addition, during recent years, we have maintained

approximately 50 so-called "telez" surveillances on the teletype

facilities of various

foreign establishments.

This has been done

at

the specific request of the National Security Agency, in

connection with its eiforts to break foreign codes and to read

foreign government communications.

We have had excellent sesults from these technical

installations. Any compilation oi items of value to the U'S.

inieiiigence comnunits and policy-making officials developed

through this coverage would run many hundreds.of

pages.

The results

have ranged from information regarding plans and activities of

key foreign countries

in the diplomatic field to information

regarding intelligence, political, economic and military develop-

ments in the countries

concerned.

In many instances, we have been

able to forewarn the White House, the State Department and other

interested agencies of impending developments and to furnish data

giving an insight, into the thinking and strategy of key foreign

officials and governments.

This coverage has proved specially

valuable during crisis periods such as the Cuban missile crisis of

• 1962 and during the tense negotiations involving the Panama Canal

in 1964. On many occasions,

top-ranking United States officials

have commented on the effectiveness of this data.

The particular

importance of this information has been its timeliness to current

events as well as the lact that it represents a penetiion of

foreign diplomatic circles which is only infrequently available

through live sources.:

In some instances; of course, this type coverage on a

particular foreign establishment or official has not paid 01I.

We have had cases where this technique has been unproductive for

sustained periods of time on a particular country. This is to be

expected and we have sought to overcome this by rotating our

nave sourne to

installations, correlating our technical aporations with

shifting

international

developments and

putting coverage on those countries

which appear to offer the most promise for worthwhile intelligence.

Live Sources With Evaluation

At present we are making active efforts to develop live :.

informant coverage in the diplomatic establishments of 37 non-

Soviet bloc countries. This list of so-called "target countries"

varies from timo to time but essentially we are secking informant

coverago in countrios considorod critical from an intolligenco

standpoint such as those leaning towards the soviet bloc or

current list includes

virtually all Latin- American countries, a

number of Middle last countries, and scattered countries throughout

Africa and the Far East.

Our program was initiated in the early 1950s, and we

are now using some 50 sources (This number fluctuates due to

transiers, resignations, etc.?..

In each case, ve clear with

State Department prior to designating any country as a "target"

and we also clear

with State prior to conducting interviews with

employees at the "target" establishment.

In a number of.

instances,

Including mosi Latin-American countries, State has asled us to

restrict our eiforts to Anerican citizens. This, of course, is

a highly limiting factor.

Over the years this live informant coverage has on many

occasions produced foreign intelligence of rei value.

Our sources

have frequently provided data regarding proposed political,

diplomatic or economic action by the countries concerned, on

occasion in advance of other lorewarning to U.S. intelligence.

They have also been able to furnish a considerable amount oi

information regarding the whereabouts, background and general

activities of individual foreign officials of security interest,

thereby

saving investigative time.

These sources have been

especially valuable in connection with the

Program and

other sophisticated

attacks on foreign establishments, providing

us with data regarding the physical security, location of code

rooms, etc., of the various foreign establishments.

In addition to so-called "target" countries which are

in the non-Soviet bloc area, the Bureau has developed a number of

• informants and defectors-in-place in Soviet-bloc establishments

who have been able to furnish a substantial amount of foreign

intelligence.

In the soviet-bloc field, we have also developed

a number of sources in quasi-official establishments, such as

trade missions, who have produced valuable foreign intelligence.

In the Soviet-bloc field, of course, our live informant development

has been ained essentially at internal security and counterintelli-

gence needs of the Bureau.

Double Agents and Informants

In a number of instances,

Bureau double agents and informants,

developed to assist us in connection with our internal security and

counterintelligence responsibilities, have been able to provide

significant high-level information of foreign intelligence value.

For example, in the soviet field, we have developed a

number of top-level sources such as

personnel, and operations of the KGB and GRU, both in the Soviet

abroad; a description of various technical equipment used

by Soviet intelligence; data regarding current selations botween

AREAS OF CONTLICT, FBI - CIA

Any difierences betworn FBI and CIA are first

rolated to a basic problem exisling in any country amoas

the major powers,

namely. "How does a law enforcement

agency coordinate

Lis internal security functions with an

intelligence organization which must operate as a clandestine

sorvico?"

The very nature of thn functions of the two

organizations immediately introducos potential areas af

conflici. One essentially opointes overtly and the other

covertly. This alone is enough lo create an atmosphere.

Iraught with controversies and confusion.

Because each

agency was molded differently aud because responsibilities

aliter, there naturally will ba conflicting approaches to

national security objectives. for example, in the lield

of intelligence the Bureau 1s basically a counterintelligence

body, CIA, to the contrary, had a much broader responsibility

in intelligence, which includes collection of foreign

intelligence, political and psychological warfare, inter-

agency coordinating, evaluation, research, etc. Counter-

intelligence within CIA is actually a relatively small

component of the agency.

Personnel in the two organizations

the experienced iBl Agent and the seasoned CIA intelligence

officer are not of the same mold but certainly are tailored

could be aavocated irom a Utopill point of view, but it

•also could be argued that there are distinci advantages to

maintaining sound compartmentation.

separate from the above basic and fundamental

situation, the diiierences between FBI and CIA also relate

to other lactors such as:

1)

FBI was first on the scene and was well

established long belore CIA callo to life. This led to a

conception in the early years that CIA was an intruder.

2) The seed oi CIA lan the Office of Strategic

Services (OSS), an OrganizatIon Whose personnel, activitles

and iree-wheeling were the sources of numerous

wIth the Bureau during World War II. It was during

these years that an atnosphere of mistrust and lack of

confidence was created.

3) CA was ostablished as our first avor-all,

worldwide intelligence agency. The events and the

maneuvering which led to this certainly. did not bring

with thom a harmonious relationship.

4)

Unfortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast,

particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and

developments such as the Korean Var. The Agency did not

joll eirectively as an organization, and with this came

numexous dilliculties, masy of which exist to this day.

5) Each organization has lacked adequate

knowledge of the other's operational machinery; objectives,

and "ways and means of doing things."

6) An element of rivalry actually developed over

the years, and this, when not tempered with prudence and

sound judgment, creates unbealthy situations.

7) A growing tendency on the part of CIA to

expand its operational activities not originally contemplated

in the cormation of that agency.

It can be recognized that with this background it

has not been an easy matter to establish a good working

relationship with CIA vithout requent conflicts, and

It could be suggested

that the ideal situation rould be to remove CIA from the •

U.S. with the understanding that we would assume respon-

sibility for any and all activity in the intelligence field.

As described in another section of this report, such a

move vould be highly infeasible for the Bureau.

It is to our credii that despite the problems of

the past there have been some highly constructive develop-

ments' in FBI-CIA relations, particularly as they allect

•activities in the U. S. Several years ago arrangements

were made whereby CIA's Office of Security could conduct

diction.

All of this is commendable progress and certainly

benexicial to national security.

All of the foregoing was set lorth in the way of

background in order to better understand the current source

of dilterences with CIA, namely the Agency's desire to assess

and recruit foreign intelligence sources in tho U.S. in the

foreign diplomatic establishments, including United Nations

and to some extent among foxeign visitors.

CIA fully

acknowledges our internal security and counterintelligence

responsibilities. This is clear-cut and iree of any

debatable question; however, Cha feels that we have no

legally-established responsibility in loreign intelligence

collection and that somebody (in this case, CIA) should

be fully exploiting the foreign intelligence potential in

the United States,

bearing in mind that there are approxi-

mately 10,000 foreign officials and employees in this country

Cia argues that a foreign diplomat can be recruited anywhere

in the world but maintains that there is no better place

than the United States for assessment, recruitment, training

and orientation of an informant.

lurther maintains that

if the Agency moves on a target, such as an Argentine

diplomat who may be a career officer not connected with a

foreign intelligence service, there should not be any con-

flict because the activity is in no way related to the

internal security junctions of the Bureau.

CIA has also

expressed the attitude that in the communist-bloc field

CIA should be permitted to assess and recruit those

individuals not connected with an intelligence or internal

security service.

... . . . ..:

There are some people in CIA who are of the .

opinion that in the field of foreign intelligence the Bureau

should be exerting more efiort to actually assist CIA in

spotting sources and, when needed, give ciA support in

developing an individual through such means as surveillances,

neighborhood investigations, etc.. When CIA

recruit a source in the U.S., the Agency takes the

position that il the source can be or help to the Bureau

we should levy requirements on CIA and not ask for access

to the source unless it clearly appears that only through

access no can properly dischairo our cosponsibilitios.

CIA takes a very strong vier thai once a source is

developed it is basically unsound to introduce another

agency into the relationship.

The developing agoncy

may havo used techniques peculiar to its own organization

and may have developed a relationship under varied cir-

cumstances, and when a new agency is introduced this

relationship with the source could be unlavorably disturbed.

CiA does not dispute the fact that informant and Agent

turnovers sometimes are absolutely necessary.

CIA maintains that if the Bureau is given access

to & CIA source we would be responsible for the counter-

intelligence aspects, but if the source produces foreign

intelligence CIA should be responsible for handling this

information, including the dissemination. CIA's position

is that it is better qualified to evaluate the information

and correlate it with the foreign intelligence being

developed abroad. for example, il a Nigarian source oi cia:

also available to the Bureau,

furnishes infornation regarding

the Nigerian Foreign Office,

CIA clains that it can better

handle the report and dissemination.

Discussions and agreements with CIA, including

the actions stemming from meetings with the representatives

of that agency in November 1965, have resulted in a greatly

improved coordinating nachinery.

There still are areas of

potential conflict which will necessitate improvement.

They are:

1) DOD personnel receives leads or tips pertaining

position that such individuals contacted by CIA are their

"CIA-controlled sources."

If we permitted this to go on

over a period of time, CiA would have a vast network of

sources not directly available to the Bureau.

This is

immediately give us the lead or tip or exploitation.

We can recognize that, depending upon circumstances, it

might be lavorable to us and CIA ior the Agency to handle

a particular individual, and 11 so, it would be clearly

coordinated. This would be most important it the

individual in any way was connected with or associated

with an intelligence service.

2) DOD is anxious to have freedom to assess

and recruit Bloc diplomats no kaown to be engaged in

intelligence activity.

On the suriace, this does not

appour to present a problem, but realistically speaking

it is impossible for us to know that a soviet diplomat,

not known to be engaged in intelligence activity one

day, appears on the scene the following week as an agent

or coopted agent.

To give CiA wide latitude in this field

could create a truly undesirable mess.

We believe that

11 CIA is permitted to move on such targets it should be

done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination.

3) CIA's organizational and operational

deficiencies, such as lack of discipline, poor internal

coordination, unsatisfactory records, all introduce head

aches which undoubtedly will continue to exist for many

years.

4)

There continues to be an element of mistrust

and misunderstanding between the two organizations because

of the nistorical reasons described above..

5) Continuing lack of one agency's appreciation

for the other's objectives, responsibilities and operational

philosophy.

6) The absence of a clearly defined Bureau policy

and objectives in the lield of foreign intelligence collec-

tiOn.

CIA really does not know the nature and the extent

of our interests, and consequently this lends to confusion

and misunderstanding.

This

cloaranco would consist of a review of Bureau liles concerning

According to same SAC Letter, agreemont had been reached

by the FBI and CIA whereby CIA vas allowed to contact American

businessmen without obtaining clearance from FBI in order to

obtain positive loreign intelligence information and arrange covers

• IoI CIA personnel abroad.

This agreement was based strictly on

collection of loreign intelligence and positively did not allow for

the formulation of a network oi confidential informants for CIA

in the U.S.

Regarding FBI-CIA agreement that CIA would clear with us

prior to interviewing aliens in U.S., following documentation has

been located. By letter 2/19/48 Director Of CIA Hillenkoetter

wrote Director and reierred to National Security Council Intelli

gence Directive No. 7, 2/12/48.

This Directive states in part that

disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules clearly provide

Ior CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training,

In addition,

they make it clear that the rBI should

In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have

reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; namely, our recent

agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the U.S.

By way of background, there

are a number of Soviet exchange

students

currently attending various U.S. universities. Each student, of

course,

is not only a possible Soviet intelligence agent but also

a potential source for the U.S: aiter he returns to his homeland.

Accordingly, both IBI and CIA have an interest in chese students. .

Per memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64

that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to Soviet

students here. FBI will take responsibility for collecting material

regarding each student on expedite basis, furnishing results to

as developed. At logical point FBI will confer with CIA to

decide on case-by-case basis re possible recruitment. Il Bureau

recruits soviet student, wi will resolve whether we should turn

him over to CIA before he leaves U.S. Under this procedure, CIA

will not make any. inquiries (through its sources in U.S.) unless

it has some unusual sourcé in a university not available to FBI

who could furnish data on the student.

I:

EFFECT ON THE FBI OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION

OF FOREIGN INTELLICENCE IN THE UNITED STATES

1. Overt Collection Activities

It is evident from the National Security Act of

1947 and the succeeding National Security Council Intelligonce

Directives as well as the directives of the Director of

Central Intelligence thai Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection

of foreign intelligence in the United States.

In pursuit of

this, CIA exploits non-governmental organizations and

individuals, foreign language publications and aliens.

Although

CIA claims to have contacts with about 7, 200 organizations

and businesses as well as about 60,000 sources of information

•as a result of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA

estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign

intelligence information available in this country.

The question we must consider here is whether the

FBI should take over the overt collection of loreign intelligence

in the United states, ineredy maing CiA operational only in

areas outside the limits of FBI's jurisdiction.

In this

connection, the following would have to be considered:

(a) Reporting:

The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has

, traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings

without bias or conclusions.

This would not change.

Intelligence developed by the IBI would be evaluated by the

users in the intelligence community.

Our report writing

format might have to be geared to the needs and established

procedures of the United States intelligence community.

•(b) Coordination With Other Government Agencies:

Foreign intelligence is a commodity produced

fOr

the benefit of many. separate agencies.of the United: States: p

Government.

Because of this, if the Bureau were to have

full responsibility for

purposes but to assure that ve are kept fully informed

## Page 250

Our role in preparation o1 National Intelligence Estimates

would be more active

as a result of our increased contribution

under this program.

It might be necessary to utilize the

assistance of highly trained

personnel of other agoncios to

assist us poriodically on iniciviews dealing with complicatod

milliary or scientific matiers.

(c) Manpower:

While no manpower requirements can be presently

estimated should we assume iull responsibility for overt

foreign intelligence collection, ClA is currently using

approximately

employees throughout the United States to

interview individuals in connection with its overt intelligence

gathering activities, and is reaching what it estimates to be

only 15 per. cent of

available foreign intelligence infornation.

These

CIA employees do not include personnel required at

CIA Headquarters to correlate, evaluate and disseninate the

data gathered in the field.

We would want to more eifectively

exploit this intelligence

potential.

To merely handle the necessary review of the vast

• nunber of toreign language publications

would require many

additional employees proficient in foreign languages an

with

backgrounds in scientific or technical fields.

(d) Selection and Training of Personnel:

To assume iull responsibility for che overt

collection of foreign intelligence in this country, vould

require that we vasily broaden our selection and training

procedures.

We would require applicants wich degrees in

the sciences, languages, history, government and economics.

Our basic training and In-Service agenda would have to be

geared to meet our new responsibilities. We would undoubtedly

desire to utilize the services of outstanding lecturers irom

the agencies constituting our intelligence community, and in

turn, we would wish to afford our personnel training at the

War Colleges operated by the Department of Defense,

and from

time to time

urnish them the opportunity of specialized

training and brielings provided by the members of the U. S.

Intelligence Board.

(1) Organizational. Changes:

To carry out a progran committing the Bureau to

the full responsibility for the overt collecting of foreign

intelligence in

this country would necessitate a substantial

increase to the headquarters staifs of the Domestic Intelli

gence Division and

the Laboratory Divison, as well to the

personnel assigned to the New York and Washingion Field Offices

where diplomatic establishmenis and international organizations

are mainly located:

In all probability the creation or a new

division at the Seat oi Goverument devoted entiroly to overt

collection responsibilities, would be required.

(g) Observations: -

The many responsibilities that would be ours under

a program making the Bureau ¿countable jor the overt collection

of all foreign intelligence in this country would (1) require

an enormous increase in our own personnel, trained in many

specialized fields, or (2) the delegation of varied intelligence

functions to other

governmental agencies and close supervision

of such agencies to insure efficient execution of the tasks

levied upon them. These overt collection responsibilities

would undoubtedly be subject to the scrutiny of many sources,

sone of them hostile, and we would have to face the charges,

had developed into

a gigantic bureaucratic octopus.

GENERAL FINDINGS

The study conducted by the Committee has

produced the following significant findings:

(1) There dofinitely is a vast

potentia

JOI COLleCtIOn of lOreign Intelligence in the u.s.

available through overt and clandestine chaanols.

Even with the available capabilities of existing

agencies, there is a large reservoir of untapped

sources.

(2) CIA has been authorized by statute

and implementing directives to collect loreign

intelligence in the U.S. through overt nethods and

has been invoived in such collection since the

establishment of the Agency.

This includes review

of foreign language press and interviews with

selected individuals such as American businessmen,

aliens, and students.

In addition, CIA has established

an elaborate system of processing,

storing, evaluating,

and disseminating this information.

(3)

such overt collection by CIA does not

present any

•threat or infringenent on FBi jurisdiction

or operations.

The present Bureau controls for such

CIA activity are satisfactory.

(1) We concluded thai it would be highly

undesirable for the Bureau to become responsible for

overt collection of loreign intelligence in the U.S.

The necessary reorganization, expansion of facilities

and manpower, and heavy task

of information collection

and processing could place a damaging burden on the

Bureau.

(5) There has never been any statutory of

similar provision lor the clandestine development by

CIA of foreign intelligence in the United States.

There are instances where the FBI has received specific.

assigaments which encompassed foreign intelligence

collection in the united states (SIS operations covering

entire Western Henisphere in World War II; present

operations concerning Dominican Republic). There is

so statute or directive which assigns or confirms

As a

result of our internal security and counterintelligence

responsibilities, we have produced a volume of foreign

intelligence covercly.

In addition, either at tho

specilic request of other U.s. agencios or on our

own initiative in response to national intelligence

needs, we have produced such intelligence.

We have

dono this on a soicctivo basis and have not assumcd

full responsibility in this area.

As indicative o1

this, certain

such sources il internal security lactors are paramount.

In the absence oi such faciors, Cis is permitted to

There have been expressions of concern

and certain limited action taken by IBI and CIA, but there

has not been a well-organized or united effort and most

important of all, there has been a decided lack of leader-

RECOMMENDED PLAN OF ACTION

A penetrative and objective study of the

Bureau's position has led us to cónclude that the Bureau

should play a much moro active and influontial tole in

the clandestine collection oi positive, intelligence in the

United States.

We are recommending the implementation of

a plan which will lead to a valuablo contribution to our

national security efiori and concurrently will improve our

internal security capabilities.

substantially expanded capability in the clandestine collec-

tion of positive intelligence. We believe that we have the

capability or developing this new look knowing that at the

eliminate a gap in the acquirement of high-quality intelli

gence in the United States. The main leatures of this plan

are:

1) Establishment of a list oi loreign diplonatic

targets consistent with the needs of the Government.

2) Expansion of our technical surveillance

capabilities with emphasis on nisurs.

3) Expansion of live sources characterized with

selectivity and high-quality value.

4) The IBI assuming a role of leadership in the

clandestire exploita' ion of positive intelligence in the

U.sS.,

and in so doing making naximun use of the talent and

capabilities of other appropriate U. S. Agencies.

Authorization

The plan would be implemented under proper executive

authorization (Presidential) and furthermore would be coordi-

nated with the United States Intelligence Board (USIB). A

letter from the President authorizing the Bureau to expand

its capabilities in clandestine positive intelligence collec

tion, consistent with the needs of the government, would

suffice.

in order to avoid any misunderstanding or confusion

within the intelligence community; USIB would be apprised o1

the Presidential authorization.

The letter from the President

would not require any details regarding the nature and the

scope of the action to be taken by the Bureau but could be

Once we have established reasonable priority listing,

is believed we should systematically expand our operations.

In this connection, the following should be borne in mind:

1) Heavy emphasis should be placed on microphone

surveillances.

2) Today we are placing greater stress on

coverage of oilicial establishments.

The new program asks

Ior an expansion o1 coverage on individuals and/or residences

Here again selectivity vill be a dominating

characteristic.

3) The program should be so flexible that we

would be able to deactivate any installation lor security

reasons or for non-productivity and whenever possible employ

techniques which would permit easy reactivation.

4) Except for current intelligence requiring

immediate dissemination, the product should be handled as

communications intelligence and dissenination would be

subjected to well-established Comini controls of the

National Security Agency (NSA) plus any additional restric-

tions the Bureau ielt should be imposed.

5) The product would be transmitted to NSA by us

for dissemination within the intelligence community. NSA

would be responsible for handling any needed translation.

We must recognize that the program will produce voluminous

information and the responsibility ior processing the data

should be fixed with an agency which is organized and

equipped to handle the job.

He recognize that a

source can turn "sour" and, thereiore, there is the danger

or potential embarrassmen. However,

it should be noted

that our record in this regard has been outstanding over

the years.

Any eificient investigative agency needs sources

Therefore, ve

In diplomatic establishments the reception

However, the primary emphasis of this new program

would be directed toward high quality sources, such as:

1)

Code clerks

2)

Officials vho have access to files, records,

of communications

3)

Officials or employees who are in a position

to penetrate communist-bloc circles or establishments

Our program very derinitely should have this philosophy

In mind, and it is an elchort which must bo inpressed

upon our personnel in our training programs.

In this

regard, we must recognize that at some point it may become

necessary to turn over recruited sources to another agency

such as CIA or one of the military services.

Will, of course, depend on the circumstances. The guidiag

principle should be the preservation of the source under

the best security.

In the non-communist bloc field we would con-

centrate on development of high-quality sources to meet the

priority needs of the Government.

Iraining Of Personnel

At the present time, our personnel are not properly.

oriented to electively engage in a program as recommended.

To accommodate to a new approach, it will be necessary to:

1) Include in our training classes lectures which

will cover a more decailed picture of U.S. intelligence, its

history, deiinition of terms, functions of intelligence

agencies.

2) Include lectures regarding the loreign intel

ligence needs of the U.S. Government.

3, Use outstanding officials of other agencies to

lecture on special intelligence matters. This would include

the critical areas throughout the world. .

they relate to our capabilities.

the clandestine collection of all foreign intelligence in

the United States, but we were taking a constructive step

in an effori to increase the production oi foreign intel-

point out that the IBI was not taking this approach as a

solution to all of the problems relating to foreign intel-

We would emphasize

that ve would move against targeis

priorities and that we would do so on a selective basis.

We would have it understood that operational activities

would be properly coordinated therever it was obviously

DECESSarY.

With regard to the handling of the product of

technical surveillances, it rould be necessary to effect a

working agreement with NSA.

To do this we might be obliged

to discuss this at the USiß level so that NsA could obtain

the required authority to suppori the hiring of additional

Since any announcement that we were in the foreign

likely queries, we should brief CIA regarding the objectives

This would permit CIA to levy requirements on

us,

For example, It We recruited the Third secretary

of questions dealing with the french political situation.

Is we tolt that the request was roasonable, we could

handle this through our source.

It will be noted that tho program doos not

sources in the U.S. for fulliliment of CIA responsibilities.

CIA will continue to operate under existing ground rules

which are designed to protect Bureau interests.

We belleve that if the program is implemented

and jells we will be in a position to "spot" sources

required by CIA and other agencies to discharge their

responsibilities.

This would apply to cases where the

target was

in the u.S. for a visit or if he had some

specialized knowledge not related to our internal security

responsibilities.

These would be targets which other

agencies could handle without interfering with our operations

and withoui making us carry a load for another agency.

This particular concept should include a Bureau attitude

that any and every source handled by another agency in the

U.S. potentially ca. be useful to us.

We should have an

outlook that all sources should be exploited to the lullesi

extent and under secure conditions. If another agency has

a capability to open a door we should take advantage of the

situation.

In those instances where CIA has a source in the

United States, we should prod that agency to seek information

of interest to the Bureau, and where obviously necessary we•

should arrange access to the CIA source. The important

leature of this new concept is that we assume the role of

use their resources even to the point of

healthy irritation.

We have looked at CIA as the "other agency" in

this picture, but we should not neglect. the potential of

agencies such as ACsI, Air Force, ONI and state. All Oi

The day-to-day

contacts which officials of these agencies have with

these agencies regarding vays and means of secruiting

It is believed that if we moved along the lines

described above, the Bureau, over a poriod of time, would

have collected valuable information regarding numerous

In connection with any planning for reorganization,

it would be unwise to proceed vithout first obtaining a

reliable inventory of our curcent rescurces.

Such an

inventory would encompass the following: (1) The number

of Agents currently assigned to strictly positive intel-

ligence collection; (2)

(3) Our current sources and informants with an objective

assessment of capabilities; (4) Number of supervisors at

the Seat of Government cursently handling positive intel-

ALTERNATIVES

In addition to the recommended plan set lorth

in

preceeding sections, there are several

alternative courses

of action we might take:

1. We could take the position, and seek ways to implement

it, that the entire field of foreign intelligence collection

the U.S, both overt and covert, should be handled by

tho IBI.

Such an across-tho-board approach would exclude

CIA and other U. S. agencies from foreign intelligence

collection in this country and would place exclusive

responsibility and jurisdiction in this field on the FBI.

As indicated in Section I, this would require a revanping

of existing legislation and directives and would necessitate

arastic changes in the Bureau's operations, including major

increases: in personnel and costs and a substantial expansion

in our recruitment

and training programs, and other reorganiza-

tion. We do not leel this approach is varranted nor do we

believe it would be a practical and sound one.

We could recommend that CiA continue to be

responsible for overt collection oi foreign intelligence in

this country but that the FBI exclusively handle coveri

foreign iniciligonce collection.

This has several obvious

drawbacks.

First, we would

be assuming a wide range of

heavy and lixed respons-bilities which

in many cases would

be completely divorced from the Bureau's internal security

and counterintelligence interests.

Second, we would become

to a large extent a service group

fos other U. S. agencies

and depariments (including CiA, state, the milliary ana ochess)

in the handling of a host of foreign intelligence requirements

levied by other agencies.

This vould involve a considerable

commitment of manpower,

communication costs, etc. on the part

of the Bureau.

In addition, such an approach would necessitate

significant changes in our recruitment and training procedures

and vould also place on our shoulders a definite accountability

•in connection with any failures in U.S. intelligence foreign

collection. It is not? elieved that this approach is as sound

a selective basis and without our assuming full responsibility.

In this regaza, the Bureau is better equipped than

With regard to the second category (live sources)

ve could propose that CIA conduci no operations involving

PURPOSE AND SCOPE

The purpose of this study is to define

COIIOCTION Of LOISLEn IntOLIIEOnGO in the U. S.

This action is nocessary and most timely because

Of our Government's vital need for increased foreign

intolligence and becauso of CIA's expanding Intorests

in the United statos.

There is a decided nood for

a new Bureau concept, the implementation of which

could greatly Increase our effectiveness and could deter

CIA from becoming a threat to our operational interests.

The study encompasses a review of history

as it relates to loreign intelligence collection in

the U.S.

Analysis is made of the need and the

potential for such intelligence; the capabilities of

the Bureau and CIA in this field; and the responsibilitlos

Of over-all (overt and covert) collection of foreign

intelligence in the U. S.

We have submitted our general

Lindings, and we recommend

a plan of action for a new

Bureau role.

This study was not designed to eliminate once

and for all the many problems relating to collection

of foreign intelligence in the U.s.

It would have been

a Utopian objective to recommend a plan which would

produce maximum intelligence collection, remove existing

defects within the U.S. intelligence community, and

establish complete harmony among interested agencies.

We did not go

that far.

Careful and exhaustive analysis

dictated that we endeavor to reach a reasonable goal

consistent with prudent planning and sound operational

implementation.

We feel that the recommended plan

meets such guidelines, that it is a decidedly major step

forward for the Bureau, and it strongly conforms with

the national security needs.

It should be noted that this document does

not deal with our law enforcement or internal security

functions, although it is fully recognized that

Internal security and clandestine collection of foreign.

Intelligence are closely linked. Any plan on our part

to produce foreign intelligence will affect our

capabilities in

the field of counterintelligence.

INTELLIGENCE TERMINOLOGY

People who do not speak and understand a common

language have difficulty in communicating their ideas.

Even

in a country such as ours where English is the common language,

words take on different meanings in different geographical

lochlos and in diflorent social, political, and economic

environments. Likewise, in professional fields, varying

backgrounds

and experiences have conveyed different meanings

to terms in the professional vocabulary.

In the field of security, intelligence, and counter-

intelligence operations, certain professional terminology has

developed ostensibly to assist in the exchange of ideas by

persons in this field. However, as progress is made in a

field or a special segment of the field, new horizons develop

which require additional terminology or cause an evolution in

existing terminology.

This development or evolution in security

intelligence terminology, coupled with individualistic usage,

brings further problems in meaning which we also face in the

We have all noted

that our dictionaries do not always provide a single meaning

and we must be careful in daily conversation that we are not

misunderstood when merely using a conversational vocabulary.

ire face d similai problem in the use of professional terminol

.ogy in security and intelligence matters

as this terminology

takes on new meaning with additional experience and takes on

varying meanings to different persons.

An additional factor to consider in understanding

the meaning of terminology is

the context in which a term is

used.

For example,

the term "intelligence" may be vague and

confusing without the knowledge of the context in which it is

used.

It can, as a generic term, pertain to the whole field

of activities

undertaken by a governmentin the collection of

information, the protection of

its institutions, and

the con~

duct of nonattributable activities to facilitate the formation

and implementation of government policy.

Also, it can relate

to the organization devoted to the collection and production

of information necessary to the government. In addition,

it may pertain to the whole body of theory and practice on

the basis of which an intelligence organization operates.

Finally, the word "intelligence" may be utilized to mean

any part or all of the above.

The following definitions do not include all possible

meanings that have been utilized but,

instead, are

designed

to assist the reader in digesting this

study.

from target countries (such as

the Soviet Union) have the

potential for supplying intelligence regarding their countries

to United States

authorities.

Although physically located in

the United states, they are potential foreign intelligence sources.

•GEOGRAPHIC INTELLIGENCE

concerns the meterology, hydrography,

¡topography, and basic natural resources of an area.

• INTELIIGENCE

is the product derived from informatión collected

for the formulation and execution of Government policy and for

safeguarding the national welfare.

INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION is information collected for intelli

gence purposes that has not been evaluated by comparison with

the existing body of knowledge on the subject reported on; the

raw material of intelligence.

INTERDEPARTMENTAL INTELLIGENCE is integrated departmental

intelligence which is required by departments and agencies

of the Government for the execution of their missions; but

which transcends the exclusive competence of a single depart

ment or agency to produce.

INTERNAL SECURITY relates to the defense and protection within

the United States and its territories and possessions of the

people,

the government, the institutions, and the installations

of critical importance irom

all hostile or destructive action.

INVESTIGATION means systematic and direct inquiries or pro

codures (such as physical or tochnical surveillancos or neighbor

hood inquiries) aiming at developing information concerning an

individual's activities or background; investigation does not

include the acceptance or the development of information through

social contacts or contacts normally made by CIA agents in

discharging their cover functions.

MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: See Combat Intelligence and Strategic

Intelligence.

NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE is that intelligence which is required

for the formulation of national security policy, concerns more

lian one department or agency: and transcends the exclusive

competence of a single department or agency.

OVERT COLLECTION is cOllection activities conducted in such

a manner that they may be attributed to or acknowledged by the

sponsoring government.

POLITICAL INTELLIGENCE concerns foreign and domestic policies

of governments and the activities of political movements.

POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE may be described as a comprehensive

produce resulting from collection, evaluation, collation, analysis,

and interpretation of all available information relating to

national

security and co.cerning other countries where such

information is significant to our Government's development and

execution of plans, policies, and courses of action.

Such

intelligence can be divided into various categories,

such as

scientific,

sociological, strategic, tactical, and technical.

Perhaps the most simple

definition would be that positive.

Intelligence is all the things you should know in advance of

initiating a course of action.

There appears to be much confusion in professional

circles regarding the use of the term "positive intelligence."

continues that both "positive intelligence"

and "security

intelligence" can be against domestic targets, as well as

agains toreign targets.

for example, the department of state,

in connection with its formulation of

foreign policy, encounters

a large number of organizations of Americans whose parents came

from foreign countries. Many of these organizations the Poles

for example-have strong views on what United States policy

should be toward Poland.

The views of these organizations

regarding our foreign policy is likely to be a matter of some

importance to the Department of State in its policy formula

tion.

The knowledge of what these organizations think and

do can be a very significant phase of what might be called

"domestic positive intelligence."

In addition, the connections

which these organizations may have with the foreign country

such as Poland

sometimes provide a source of "foreign positive

intelligence."

SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE pertains to the progress of scientific

research and development and usually this intelligence is

within the framework of how it affects military or economic

potential of a nation.

SECURITY INTELLIGENCE is basically the intelligence behind he

SOCIOLOGICAL INTELLIGENCE pertains to the social, cultural,

THE HISTORY OF FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION IN THE

UNITED STATES

I.. Prior to World War II

A study of the history and progress of foreign

intelligence collection in the United States reveals that

prior to World War II such collection efforts were incidental

and in direct proportion to the intensity of the coverage

the history of foreign intelligence collection in the

foreign intelligence was a by-product. Historical

highlights

of the developments in this field are

as follows:

(a)

In August, 1914, when German espionage agents

Count Johann Von Bernstorff and Di. Heinrich Albert of the

D. C.,

arrived in the

,ond in German treasury notes to

finance the first foreign espionage and sabotage apparatus

to be organized in this country, United States Government

intelligence work was handled for the most part by five

small organizations (Bureau of Investigation of the

Department of Justice, Secret Service, Army, State and Navy),

all operating on their own with small

staffs and without

coordination and sufficient delineation of responsibilities.

(b) On April 6, 1917,

Congress declared war against

Germany and President Woodrow Wilson gave the Bureau of

Investigation the task of enforcing his proclamation

governing the conduct of enemy aliens. The Bureau at the time

had 300 Agents but shortly after the outbreak of the war

the staff was increased to 400.

(c)

As result of a rash of bombings believed

executed by Bolsheviks, Attorney General Palmer appointed

Francis P. Garvan of New York as Assistant Attorney General

to deal with the problem.

He created a General Intelligence

Division under command of J. Edgar Hoover and Mr. Hoover was

instructed to make a study of subversive activities in the

United States to determine their scope and the potential

for prosecution.

(d) On May 9, 1934, President Roosevelt called

a White House conference attended by the Attorney General,

secretary of Treasury, secretary of Labor, Director ot rBI

and Chief of United Statos Sacret Service

to deal with

the problem of growth of fascist organizations in the

United States.

The conference agreed that there should be

an invostigation of these groups and their activities for

intelligence purposes. Since the only Federal law believed

applicable at the time was the Immigration Law,

the President

docided that the Commissioner of Immigration and Naturalization

Service would confer with the Chief of Secret Service and the

Director of the fBI to work out details of the investigation

Mr. Hoover immediately issued orders to FBI

personnel

to conduct an intensive and confidential investi

gation of the Nazi movement.

This was the first general

intelligence investigation made by the Government into

fascist activities in this country.

(e) As a result of President Franklin Roosevelt's

concern over activities of the communists and other subversive

groups, a sorios di conforonoos was hold in the Intter part

of August and carly September, 1936, participated in by the

Presidont, tho Socrotary of State and the Director of the FBI.

As a result of his concern over the international character

of communism and fascism, the President stated the FBI should

conduct necessary investigations and coordinate inforation

upon those miters in the possession of the Military

Eius=2gen09 Division, the Naval Intelligence Division and

• the State Department.

It is noteworthy that it was specified the

investigation was to be for intelligence purposes only.

The Presidential Order was implemented by the

Director in a letter to all Special Agents in Charge,

September 5, 1936.

(1)

As a result of opposition primarily by the

State Department against accepting the FBI as the coordinating

agency in the investigations of all subversive activities in

the United States, President Roosevelt, on June 26, 1939, issued

a confidential directive to Cabinet members which established an

Interdepartmental Intelligence Coordinating Committee composed

of the FBI and the Intelligence Divisions of the War Department

and the navy.

He named the FBI as the coordinating agency to

receive all reports on subversive activities.

## Page 288

(g) President Roosevelt publicly designated the FBI

to investigate matters relating to espionage, sabotage and

violations of the neutrality regulations by Presidential

Directive dated September 6, 1939.

h) On May u1, 1940, President Roosevelt in a

memorandum

to the then Attorney General, Robert H. Jackson,

authorized

and directed the Attorney General in

such cases

as

he might approve to authorize the use of listening devices

directed to the conversations or other communications of

persons suspected of subversive activity against the Government

of the United States, including suspected spies.

Pursuant to such authorization, commencing on June 1,

1940, technical surveillances were installed on diplomatic

establishments throughout the United States of such countries

as Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and France.

These

installations in addition to providing counterintelligence

information of value produced

a substantial quantity of foreign

intelligence information.

(i) Although lines of responsibility were established

for domestic intelligence work in connection with the September 6,

1939, Presidential Directive, there were no clearly defined areas

of responsibility of overseas intelligence operations and as

time passed the need for decisions in that field grew more evident.

As a result, the Special Intelligence Service (SIS)

came into being.

By Presidential Directive June 24, 1940,

President Franklin D. Roosevelt set forth lines of responsibility

in the operations of United States intelligence agencies in

foreign field.

This Directive grew out of a series of meetings

involving representatives of State Department, Army and Navy

intelligence and the FBI wherein it was agreed that the SIS would

act as a service agency, furnishing the State Department, the

military, the FBI and other governmental agencies with information

having to do with financial, economic, political and subversive

activities detrimental to the security of the United States.

June 24th Directive placed the responsibility for nonmilitary

intelligence coverage in the Western Hemisphere on the FBI.

Less

than thirty days thereafter the FBI had organized an SIS operation.

Through World War II and until approximately March 31,

1947, the FBI continued its SIS operations. The culmination of

our activities in this field came about as a result of the

January 22, 1946, Presidential Directive establishing the

Central Intelligence Group and giving it the responsibility of

collecting foreign intelligence abroad.

a. The FBI's Role

during world lar Il, as prior to the war, toreign

intelligence collection in this country was goarod to ano

principally a product of our intensive efforts in the counter

intelligence field. It is also significant to note that a

steady stream of foreign intelligence continued to be developed

from our technical coverage of diplomatic establishments of

enemy-bloc countries, as well as other sensitive countiles

such as Russia, Argentina, Portugal and Spain.

In line with the Presidential Directive of

September 6, 1939, the FBI continued to be in charge of all

investigative work in matters pertaining to espionage, sabotage,

counterespionage, subversive activities and violations

of the

neutrality laws.

On January 8, 1943, the President issued another

Directive in which he reiterated tne previous Direcuive vi

September 6, 1939.

In ordering the FBI to take charge in the foregoing

areas,

President Roosevelt did not define the various types of

Intelligence involved but placed the entire intelligence and

internal security responsibilities involved under the

jurisdiction of the FBI. As a matter of fact, in carrying out

these responsibilities we did produce foreign

intelligence in

substantial quantity especially through our technical coverage

of foreign diplomatic establishments.

b.

Office of Strategic Services

The position of Colonel William J. Donovan as

Coordinator of Information (COI) was created by Presidential

Dixective dated July 11, 1941. On July 14, 1941, President

Roosevelt sent a letter

to the Attorney General stating the

position was created, "in order to provide a central point in

the Government for the analysis of intormation and data which

bears upon national security.

Donovan's duties as "assist me and'" the president described

the various Departments and

agencies of the Government in assembling and correlating

intormation which may be userul in the lormulation ot basie

plans

for the delense of the nation."

---

## Page 290

In the letter President Roosevelt clearly limited

Donovan's jurisdiction with the lollowing statement: "I

should like to emphasize that Colonel Donovan's work is

intonded to supersode or duplicate or involve any direction

of the activities of established agencies already obtaining

and interpreting delense information."

The Presidentlal order dated September 11, 1941,

established the position of COI with clear cut

authority to

collect and analyze information bearing on national security;

correlate and make such information available to the President

and other Government officials as the President may determine.

CoI was finally authorized to carry out, when requested by

the President, supplementary activities as might facilitata

the

securing of information not then available to the

Government.

Donovan, in a memorandum captioned "MEMORANDUM OF

-ESTABLISHMENT OF SERVICE OF STRATEGIC INFORMATION, " expanded

on the President's directive in general terms. Under his

plan for procedure there was a Coordinator of Strategic

Information responsibie direcily to the Fresideut. roie

this same organizational set up was later adopted

by the

Director o1 Central Intelligence. Donovan noted, however,

in his memorandum, "The proposed centralized unit will

neither displace nor encroach upon the FBI, Army and Navy

Intelligence, or any other Department of the Government."

(62-64427, serials 23 and X3.)

Our file on the Office of Strategic Services (OSS)

reveals that that organization continued its organizational,

training, and operational activities in this country based

on Donovan's premise that he was the central clearing point

for anti-Axis espionage and counterespionage.

< Act 6 (1) (C)

Our file on the OSS is replete with incidents

indicating OSS recruitment and counterespionage activities

in this country during the early 1940's.

By memorandum dated May 22, 1945, Stanley J. Tracey,

advised of a conversation overheard between two high-ranking

State Department officials. The conversation dealt with OSS

attempts to take over Bureau SIS operations in Latin America

with one of the State Department officials, Aura Warren,

stating that officials of OSS felt that organization was

-better equipped

to handle work than FBI personnel attached

to various American Embassies in South America.

In response

to this attempt of OSS to take over our duties, the Director

commented: "I would like iu know where Warren goto this.

According to. Ladd our contacts in State Department have

knowledge of such oSs efforts.

Also Tracey should point

out it is State Department duty to initiate it as we would

"service it.

and the State Department in fact started

the

SIS project. H"' (62-64427-1059.)

An interesting evaluation of OSS operations is

provided in a report prepared by Colonel Richard Park of

the War Department as a result of a survey of OSS operations

made as a special and confidential mission for the President

in 1944 and 1945. Colonel Park commented: "Without going

into details I was everywhere left with the same impressios

of utter incompetency on the part of OSS leadership....

"Everywhere that the subject of OSS. came up,

unsolicited remarks clearly brought out the very well known

amateurish nature of the organization.

"The OSS has been restricted from active operations

in South America by Presidential directive...."

Despite the absence of any jurisdiction in or

responsibility for counterintelligence operations in the

western hemisphere, an officer of OSS was reported to have

attempted to obtain cover. for an OSS agent in South Ameríca

under guise of employment by an organization doing business

in South America.

A closing paragraph of Colonel Park's report

commented on observations made by au official of OSS as

LOllOWS :

"This official of OSS added that it was the policy

of his agency not to give any more information than necessary

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

He pointed out that

Oss instructors in their school in the United States had

discussed the FBI in an unfavorable light and had painted

the picture of OSS replacing the Federal Bureau of

Investigation not only outside the United States but in

the domestic field.

The publicity campaign referred to

purpose."

3. National Intelligence Authority (NIA)

On January 22, 1946, President Marry S. Truman

addressed & Directive to the socretary of state, the Secretary

of War, and the Secretary of the Navy stating, in part, "I

hereby designate you, together with another person to be named

by mo as my personal.

representative, as the National Intelli

gence Authority..."

The Directive provided that each of these

three secretaries would from time to time assign personnel and

facilities from their respective departments "which persons

shall collectively form a Central Intelligence GrOUD" (CIG)

under a Director of Central Intelligence.

It was provided that

the latter would be responsible to the NIA.

President Truman then stated that subject to the

existing law the Director of Central Intelligence should

(a)

accomplish the corre.ation and evaluation of intelligence

and the appropriate dissemination within the Government of the

results; (b) plan for the coordination of such activities of

the intelligence agencies of the three departments involved as

related to the national security; (c) herform such services oi

common concern as the NIA determined could be more effectively

accomplished centrally; and (d) perform such other functions

and duties related to intelligence as the President and

in a couldch other cunctions

NIA might from time to time direct.

The Presidential Directive said that no police, law

enforcement or internal security functions should be exercised

under the Directive; that certain intelligence should be Ixeely

available to the Director of Central Intelligence "for CorrelatIOn,

evaluation or dissemination"; and that "the existing intelligence

shall continue to collect, evaluate,

correlate and disseminate departmental intelligence."

The ninth

provision of the Directive stated, "Nothing herein shall be

construed to authorize the making of investigations inside the

continental limits of the United States and its possessions,

except as provided by law and Presidential directives."

Vandenberg which submitted a proposed memorandum to the NIA and

a proposed Directive to be issued by NIA

extending the powers

and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence.

The Directive

provided, in essence, the following additional functions and

powers for the Director of Central Intelligence:

• 15 .

## Page 294

(1) Undertake such basic research and analysis of

intelligence and counterintelligence as may in his opinion be

required.

(2) Act as the executive agont of this authority

(NIA) in coordinating and in supervising all Federal foreign

intelligence activities.

Periom the LOLlOWINg SerVICeS OL COmMon COnCeIn:

(a) conduct all Federal espionage and counterespionage operations

for the collection of Loreign intelligence; (b) conduct all

Federal monitoring of press and propaganda broadcasts of foreign

powers for the collection of intelligence information.

In discussing this Directive which Vandenberg desired

issued, the memorandum stated the Directive did not conform

with the original plan proposed by the President or which was

envisioned by the discussions occurring prior to the time the

President issued his Directive.

The original plan, insofar as

the Bureau was advised, contemplated the setting up of solely

a coordinating agency which was given the power to periorm certain

functions which it would be determined could more adequately and

economically be performed centrally for the benefit of all

Government agencies.

The memorandum noted that "undoubtedly it

this Directive is approved and the Central Intelligence Group

is successful in setting up complete foreign coverage,

the

Bureau would undoubtedly be pushed into a 'second rate' position

insofar as purely intelligence functions are concerned in the

domestic field.

It is inevitable that the Central Intelli

gence Group must enter into the comestic field picture insolax

as intelligence is concerned because of the sources of foreign

intelligence existing in that field. Also, it is impossible to

separate entirely foreign intelligence and

the domestic functions

performed by the Bureau."*

In reply to the Directive proposed by General Vandenberg,

a letter was sent to him June 25, 1946, which stated that the

Directive was approved with certain changes suggested "for'

clarification purposes only."

The Director suggested that to

as the executive agent of National Intelligence Authority

in coordinating and supervising all foreign intelligence

activitios thore should bo added "performod outsido the

United States and its possessions relating to the national

security in accordance with the overall policies and objectives

established by this Authority." With respect to the proposal

that the Director of Central Intelligence direct all espionage

and counterespionage operations for the collection of foreign

intelligence, it was proposed that the phrase "outside the

United States and its possessions" also be inserted in this

provision.

On July 29, 1946, General Vandenberg sent over

a memorandum on the subject "Exploitation of American

Business Concerns With Connections Abroad as Sources of

Foreign Intelligence Information." He added & proposed

Directive. The Director replied by letter August 6, 1946,

"I should like to comment that there appears to have been

an addition to the field encompassed by CIG Directive #11

calline for a survev of the exploitation of American business

concerns.

I note that in your report and in the proposed

ÑIA Directive, you refer not only to American business con-

cerns but to other private groups with connections abroad.

This latter phrase, in my opinion, is extremely broad and

could be taken to include all tyyes of organizations,

including Foreign Nationality Groups.

In fact, I feel that

the report and proposed Directive should contine themselves to

the discussion of American business concerns and that no

references at all should be made to 'private groups'.

•I feel that at a later date the question of exploitation of

these private groups by CIG representatives might be worked

out by discussing them individually with the FBI when their

identities are determined." This matter remained unresolved.

On August 22, 1946, General Vandenberg submitted

another proposed Directive concerning exploitation of American

business concerns, nongovernmental groups, and individuals (in

the United States) with connections abroad as sources. of foreign

intelligence intormation.

A memorandum analyzing this on

August 22, 1946, pointed out the new Directive was even more

obnoxious than the one originally proposed. The Directive

noted, in part, "CIG field representatives will establish

and maintain liaison with the intelligence officers of local

• Army and Navy headquarters and Air. Foxco headquarters, 11

present, through the medium of local interagency offices."

the analyzing memorandum "ointed out, "Il this means the

CIG is going to maintain field representatives in the Unitod

States or establish offices, it cortainly is somothing new and

a provision that we did not understand was intended in the

President's Directive. • • Attached to the proposed Directive

is a discussion which is more or less the same as was attached

to the original proposed Directive. It, however, makes the

following statement which the Bureau cannot subscribe to and

It would seem must oppose, that is, 'Foreign Intelligence

Information related to the national security, although it may

be collected from sources whose headquarters

are within the

Limits of the United states and its possessions, is definitely

a part of the national intelligence mission, the coordination

• 01

which is specifically & lunction or the National Intelli

gence Authority under the provisions of the President's letter

OI 22 january 1946.'"

In pointing out the Bureau's objections, the

analyzing memoranaun of August 22, 1946, stated, "There

is now involved in this Directive

the fundamental question

of just what rights the Central Intelligence Group has with

reference to operations within the United States. Carrying

to a logical conclusion the statements set forth above contained

in the discussion, they could cover all foreign embassies in

the United states, take charge of double agents we are operating

or radio stations we are operating as double agent set-ups, eic.,

because essentially these operations engaged in by the Bureau

do not directly involve enforcement of the laws but rather are

concerned with obtaining information in the nature of coreigu

intelligence which, of course, is related to internal security

Essentially, the Bureau's

domestic operations in intelligence involve the determining

of the aims, intentions, and activities of loreign countries

or their representatives."

proposed Directive does not incorporate the changes suggested

in my letter of August o, 1946, and 1, thereiore, cannot

approve it.

This new directive also includes provisions

and statements to which I cannot concur and, in lact, must

oppose.",

The strong stand of the Director obviously led to

a conference between General Vandenberg and the Director

which was reported in a memorandum of September 13, 1946,

which the Director prepared.

As stated in the Director's

memorandum the conference concerned CIG's desire to gather

contacts among "nongovernmental groups and individuals with

connections abroad."

The entire conference was on this subject

matter and did not enter into collection of foreign intelli

gence from foreign embassies or from foreign officials os,

in fact, from any other source.

The Director wrote, "I told

the General that I could well appreciate that there

would be

cases in which his organication would be desirus of making

'contacts in the United States for the purpose of obtaining

infornation from abroad nd that the Bureau was not interested

in such contacts except in those situations wherein the individual

or the group might be engaged in activities within the United

States that were either under investigation by the Bureau or

might possibly be the medium of obtaining information con-

• cerning the activities of a subversive character being carried

on within the United States.

I told the General that I would

be perfectly agreeable to his suggestion, with the added

provision that if CIG was desicous of contacting any

individuals of the character that he had indicated, before

doing so it would check with the FBI."

The foregoing has been set forth rather extensively

since it shows the strong stand the Bureau took against CIG's

operating in the United States.

Actually, as will be reported

hereinaiter, Directives vere adopted permitting CIC to collect

positive intelligence in this country by contacting United . :

States citizens, American businessmen, aliens (with prior

FBI approval) through the foreign language press. and in later

years through contacts with United States governmental personnel.

Responsibilities of CIA

Many individuals, especially in Congress, expressed

fears that CIA could develop into a gestapo if permitted to

become operational in the United States.

The following two

excerpts, of interest in this connection, are itom a

congressional publication related to hearings prior to passage

of the National Security Act of 1947.

The publication is

entitled "Hearings Before the Committee on Expenditures in the

Executive Departments, House of Representatives, 80th Congress,

and scope of CIA, James Forrestal, then secretary of the Navy,

stated:

"The purposesol the Central Intelligence Authority

are limited definitely to purposes outside of this

country, except the collation of information gathered

by other government agencies.

"Regarding domestic operations, the federal Bureau

of Investigation is working at all times in collaboration

with General Vardenberg. He relies upon them for domestic

activities."

to do it under this bill as vrittea."

The National Security Act of 1947 vas approved

7/26/47. It provided that for the purpose of coordinating the

Intelligence activities of the several Government departments

and agencies in the interest of national security, the, Agency

under the direction of the NSC was:

(1) To advise NSC in matters concerning such

intelligence activities of the Government departments

and agencies of the Government

National Security Council Intelligence Directives

To implement the authority granted to it under ine

National Security Act of 1947,

the National Security Council

has issued a series of "National Security Council Intelligence

Directives," usually referred to as NSCID's and commonly called

"Nonscids."

The first of these was issued Decemper 14, 1941, and

provided for the establishing of the

• intelligence Advisory

Committee to maintain the relationship necessary for a fully

effective integration oi the national intelligence effort.

By

Directive dated September 15, 1958, the U. S. Intelligence Board

(USIB) was formally created

as successor to the Intelligence Advisory

Committee and a counterpart known as the U. S. Communications

Intelligence Board.

NSCID No. I provided that the Director of Central

Intelligence should coordinate the foreign intelligence activities

of the United States, such coordination to include both special

and other forms of intelligence.

The USIB under this Directive

shall "advise and assist the Director of Central Intelligence

Central Intelligence Agency. A more complete discussion with

regard to the Bureau's role in this over-all setup is set forth

horoinaitor undor tho caption "FBI Rolationa Wiüh tho

United States Intelligence Board."

National

security Council Intelligence Directive

No. I, originally issued 12/12/47, defines the various types

intelligence in Section 4.

(a) National Intelligence is that intelligence

which is required for the formulation of national security

policy, concerns more than one department or agency,

and transcends the exclusive competence of a single

department or agency.

The Director of Central Intelli

gence shall produce*

national intelligence with the

support of the U. S. Intelligence Board.

(b) Departmental Intelligence is that intelligence

which any department or agency requires to execute its own

mission.

(c) Interdepartmental Intelligence is integrated

departmental intelligence which is required by departmenis

and agencies of the Government for the execution of their

missions, but which transcends the exclusive competence

of a single department or agency to produce. The

subcommittee structure oi the U. S. Intelligence Board

may be utilized for the production and dissemination of

interdepartmental intelligence.

Director of Central Intelligence is then authorized

to disseminate national intelligence and interdepartmental

intelligence provided it is done consistent with statutes and

Presidential policy, and provided further "that any disclosure

Of FBI intelligence

information shall be cleared with that

agency prior to dissemination."

*: This acknorledges: that FBI information includes both

national and interdepartmental intelligence.

#A footnote here states: "By 'produce' is meant 'to correlate

and evaluate intelligence relating to the national security' as

provided in the National Security Act of 1947, as amended,

Section 102, (d) (3)."

collection activities "not covered

by other NSC Directives."

The Director of Central Intolliganco has responsi

bility for planning to assure there is no undesirable

duplication and that coverage is adequate.

Responsibilities are then assigned as lollows:

(1) The Department of State shall have primary

responsibility for, and shall perform as a service of

common concern, the collection abroad (i.e., outside

the U.S. and its possessions) of political, sociological,

economic, scientific and technical information.

(2) The Department of Defense shall have primary

responsibility for, and shall periorm as a service oi

common concern, the coLlectIon oi military intelligence

information.

Owing to the importance of scientific and

technical intelligence to the Department of Defense

and the military services, this collection responsibility

siail luciude scientitio and techrical, as nell as economic:

information directly pertinent to Department of Defense

MiSSIOnS.

(It seems significant that while State Depart

ment primary responsibility was limited by the phrase

"the collection abroad," there was no such limitation

on the. Departnent of Defense in its responsibility.)

(3) The Central Intelligence Agency may collect

abroad intelligence information in support of assigned func

tions or as a byproduct of assigned functions: Provided,

that this collection involves no undesirable duplication

of any of the specific assignments to State and Deiense

Departments, and Provided, that any such overt collection

is coordinated with the Department of state or with the

Senior U. S. Representative.

In Section 7 Of NSCID No: 2 there. is delegated to

CIA responsibility for overt collection of foreign intelligence

In the U.S: as follows:

BanCe BorId."

Section 9 of the same Directive provides that CIA

"shall conduct the exploitation of foreign languago publications

for Intelligence purposes, as appropriate, as a service oi

common concern.

When this fuaction is carried out in

the U.S.,

this also constitutes overt collection of foreign intelligence

by that Agency in this country.

It may be worthy to note at this point that NSCID

No. 's I and 2 were discussed, approved, and issued in their

original forms prior to 7/7/49 when the FBI was designated a

member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee.

NSCID No. 3 on Coordination o1 Intelligence Production

contains definitions of various types of intelligence (including

those defined in NSCID No. 1) and then delineates primary

responsibilities for "producing" intelligence among various

agencies, stating wita respeci to CiA:

"The Central Intelligence Agency

shall produce

economic intelligence on the Sino-Soviot Bloc and

scientific and technical intelligence as a service of

common concern. Further, the Central Intelligence

Agency may produce such other intelligence as may be

necessary to discharge the statutory responsibilities

of the Director of Central Intelligence."

Since, as noted hereinbefore, "collection" activities

are defined in NSCID No. 2, it would seem to follow that the

word "produce" as used in NSCID No. 3 has the same definition

as set out in a footnote to NSCID No. 1, paragraph 4, i.e., "to

correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to the national

security."

Thus, NSCID No. 3 would not appear to extend CIA's

jurisdiction to collect intelligence or be operational in any way.

:?÷•

The remaining NSCID's appear to have no" bearing on

the subject matter of foreign intolligence collection in the

United States.

c. Director of Central Intelligence Directives

To implement the National Security Act of 1447 as

amonded and the various National Security Council Intelliganco

Directives issued pursuant thereto, the Director of Central

Intelligence has issued numerous Directives (DCID'S).

The

first o1 these having a direct bearing on jurisdictional matters

is DCID No. 2/3, captioned "Domestic Exploitation of

Nongovernmental

Organizations and

' Individuals."

NSCID No. 2,

paragraph Y, states that CIA shall be responsible for the

selective exploitation within the

such organizations

and individuals as sources of forein intelligence information.

We, therefore, have avoided, and should avoid, any operations

among nongovernmental organizations and individuals designed

solely to produce Loreign intelligence without CIA priOT

approval or nullification of these provisions.

DCID No. 2/3 provides for exploitation of nongovernmental

operational interest in a U.S. Citizen, Central Intelligence

Agency wiii coordinate with

that agency

prior to further contact."

This DCID also provides for exploitation by ClA

domestic field offices of aliens, following a prior name checi

with FBI so our statutory obligations may be properly met without

CIA interference.

It is of possible interest to note that in dealing with

these two matters, DCID No. 2/3 refers to nongovernmental U:

citizens but only

to aliens (without the restrictive adjective).

The NSCID on which it is based refers to nongrovernmental

individuals without distinguishing between citizens and aliens.

Thus, there appears to have been an intention to confine CIA's

intelligence exploitation functions within the U. S. A review

of our file on CIA (62-80750) indicates this might well have

been a concession to the Bureau since we went on record opposing

delegation of any intelligence collection functions within the

U.. S. to CIA in letters to Lieutenant General Hoyt S. Vandenberg

(then Director of Central Intelligence Group)

on June 25, 1946,

(Serial 96), August 6, 1946, (Serial 138), and August 23, 1946,

Serial 222), which have been discussed more lully under the

heading "National Intelligence Authority."

DCID No. 2/8 is captioned "Domestic Exploitation of

U. S. Government Organizations and Officials." It begins in

very general terms, "Pursuant to thé provisions of NSCID No. I

and NSCID No. 2.

It providos, "The Contral Intelligonce

organizations and officials to modi community noods as a

As set forth above, there seems to be no basis for

such CIA jurisdiction in NSCID No. 1 and No. 2.

Paragraph 7

of NSCID No. 2 specifically restricts CIA in this area of

operations to nongovernmental organizations and individuals.

A review of our U. S. Intelligence Board (USIB) file,

62-90718, shows following apropos this matter:

The Draft Minutes of the 3/21/61 USIB

meeting report that the Board approved the

draft of a DCID on "Domestic Exploitation of

was first considered at the meeting held 2/23/60

at which the Bureau was represented by Fred A.

Irohbose. The minutes for that meeting reported

officials would be desirable. However, the

matter was referred to the Committee on Domestic

Exploitation for further study and the submission

of a revised draft for Board consideration.

(unnumbered serial between serials 1040 & 1041,

From the foregoing it would appear that the Bureau

concurred in the issuance of this particular Directive and thus

U:S. it this should, in fact, be interpreted as an extension.

respectively.

The latter one dwells on

division of responsibilities between IBI and CIA in the handling

of defectors within the continental limits of the United statos.

It providos that exploitation of such doloctors shall be conducted:

1.

To obtain internal security information or other

data required by IBI in view of its statutory responsibilitios

in the internal security field.

2.

To obtain foreign intelligence information required

in the interests of national security by the member agencies of

the USIB.

3. For such other purposes as are deemed to be in the

interests of national security.

The very next sentence then gives the implication that

exploitation of the defector for foreign intelligence purposes is

• the principal responsibility of CIA, for it reads, "Decision as

to the relative importance of internal security exploitation by

FBI and foreign intelligence exploitation by the Central

Intelligence

Agency (CIA) shall be made jointly hy representatives of

CIA and FBI."

There then follows a listing of nine specific FBI

responsibilities, one of which is to make available to CIA foreign

intelligence information resulting from the initial exploitation

of defectors. There is no subsequent specific delineation of CIA

responsibility over foreign intelligence exploitation until there

is a transfer of respons-jility for handling a defector from FBI

to CIA after FBI interests have been fully satisfied.

There is a

general assignment of such responsibility to CIA in the terms,

"CIA shall be responsible for:

Coordinating the activities of

other departments and agencies concerned with defector matters,

except those responsibilities assigned exclusivaly to FBI . . .."

As a matter of practice, il it is determined there is

little or no importance from an internal security standpoint

connection with a particular defection, we do not take over but

in

effect give clearance to CIA to proceed from a foreign intelli

gence standpoint.

DCID's in the 5/ series (numbers one through five) were

issued principally to implement NSCID Number 5 which deals with

U. S, espionage and clandestine counterintelligence activities

abroad.

There appears to be no conflict with FBI jurisdiction in

this series.

All other D'ID's relate to Flint Critical Intelligence

and other matters. which appear to have no bearing on possible

conflicts between CIA and FBI responsibilitios.

d. Dulles Committee 1249

the Dulles committee was appanted rebruary 3, 1948,

by the National Security Council (NSC) to make a "compichensivo,

Impartial and objoctive survey of the organization, activities

and personnel or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)." The

Committee was instructed to report its iindings and recommendations

on the following matters:

(a) The adequacy and effectiveness of the

organization structure of CIA.

(1) The value and elliciency of existing CIA activitles.

(c) The relationship of these activitiesto those of

other departments and agencies.

(d), The utilization and qualifications of CIA personnel.

The Committee's scope was extended on March 17, 1948,

to include the lollowing provisions:

"This survey will comprise

primarily a thorough and comprehensive examination of the

structure, administration, activities and inter-agency relation

ships of the CIA as outlined in the resolution of the National

Security Council. It will also include an examination of such

intelligence activities of other Government departments and

agencies as relate to the national security, in order to make

recommendations for their eifective operation and overall

coordination..."

This report, which is dated January 1, 1949, for the

most part concerned itself with administrative matters affecting

CIA and the necessity for reorganization within that Agency.

It

notes, however,

that the National Security Act, as implemented

•by directives of the NSC, imposed upon Cla responsibility toi

carrying out three essential functions:

(1)

The coordination of intelligence activities.

(2) "

The correlation and evaluation of intelligence

as meaning the production" of national intelligence.

## Page 308

(3) The performance centrally, subject to NSC

direction, of certain intelligence and related functions of

common concern to various departments of the Government.

The report noted that Section 102 of the National

Security Act of 1947 established a framework for a sound

Intelligence system and no amendment to that

soction of the

Act was deemed necessary.

Although the coordination of intelligence activities

of the several departments and agencies concerned with national

security was a primary reason ior establishing ClA, the report

noted the National Security Aci does not give CIA independent

authority to coordinate intelligence activities, as final

responsibility to establish policies was vested

In the NSC.

The statutory limitations upon the authority of CIA

to coordinate intelligene activities without the approval of

* the NSC were, according to the report, obviously designed to

protect the autonomy and internal arrangements of the various

departments and agencies periorming intelligence functions.

In spite of these calculated limitations uù tho authority of

CIA,

the report noted, it was clear the Agency was expected to

provide the initiative and leadership in developing a coordinated

intelligence system. In practice, the NSC has almost without

exception approved the recommendations submitted to it by CIA

for the coordination of intelligence activities.

The National Security Act does not define the

"intelligence activities" which were to be coordinated by CIA

under the direction of the NSC or specily the departments

whose activities

were covered.

Presumably; according to the

repoxt, all intelligence activities relating to the national

security were included, from collecting information in the Lirst

instance to the preparation and dissemination of linished

intelligence reports and estimates.

"The criterion," which the

report noted was a very broad one, was "such intelligence

activities..

, as relate to the national security and not

the identity of the departments concerned or the nature or

locale of the intelligence activity."

Thus, the report noted,

practically no limitations are set upon the scope of the intelli

gence activities with which the Central Intelligence Agency is

to concern itsell.

∞. 30

## Page 309

The report noted another broad field requiring

coordination is that of foreign intelligence derived from

domestic sources and the allied field of domestic counter-

intelligence.

This includes the exploitacion of intolliconce

crom United States business firms, travellers, etc., exploitation

of the intelligence possibilities

of groups and individuals of

foreign nationality in the United Statos, the tolating oi

¡omostic counterintellirenco to loreign intelligence and the

coordination of domestic counterespionage with counterespionage

abroad.

Except for the exploitation of private sources of

loreign intelligence in the United States which is centralized

in the Office of Operations, CIA, responsibility for other

activities is scattered among the State Department, the armed

services, the FBI and CIA.

The FBI, which has primary security and law enforce-

responsibilities, is concerned in fact with an important

This includes domestic counterespionage

and countersabotage, control of communist and other subversive

activities and surveillances of alien individuals and groups.

All of these functions, according to the report, are closely

reinieu iu the cumualaule activities abroad et the CIA.

The report noted the fBi was not. part of the then

l existing machinery for courdination of intelligence through

•ithe Intelligence Advisory Committee. and there was no continuing

manner whereby domestic intelligence and counterintelligence

were related to overall national intelligence in order to serve

the general purpose set forth in the National Security Act,

which was set forth as "of coordinating the intelligence activities

of the several Government departments and agencies in the interest

of national security."

It was the opinion of the authors of the dulles Report

that CIA had the duty under the Act to concern itself with the

problem of coordinating those phases of domestic intelligence

and counterintelligence which relate to the national security.

and CIA should submit recommendations on this subject to the

NSC. The report noted this was not inconsistent with the

stipulation oi the National Security Act that CIA "shall have no

police, subpoena, law enforcement powers or internal security

The Dulles Commission recommended that the TBI

should be made a member of the Intelligence Advisory Committee

to improve coordination of domostic intelligence and countor

Intelligence Insolas as these matters relatod to the national

security.

While discussing the production of National

Intelligence Estimates by CIA, the report noted, "There 18

no systematic way of tapping that domestic intelligence

information, which should be chiefly in the hands of the FBI;

having a bearing on broader intelligence issues and there

is no regular and agreed arrangement for participation by the

FBI and lor the use of intelligence Iron domestic sources in

could be very high if appropriate arrangements were made and

aiscrimination was employed.

It was felt the vast number of

organizations, institutions and individuals having foreigu

interests and

knowledge represented a potential source oi

intelligence that in many ways was superior to any other,

as it was felt that they were in a position to provide

information obtained from their foreign contacts and ixom the

findings on their own people abroad...

A further important source o1 information, che

exploitation for intelligence purposes of loreign individuals

and groups in the United States was also being developed.

The

report noted that these individuals and groups as well as

political refugees and former foreign government officials

were often engaged in political activity with signilicant

international implications.

CIA and other intelligence agencies had not developed

coordinated and effective policies and procedures for the

exploitation of intelli ence in this important field. The FBI,

accoraing to the report, had a major interest in foreign

It was also noted the FBI was,

in cases where

It had a security interest, reluctant on security grounds to

have intelligence exploitation by outside agencies. The general

result of this situation, according to the report, was that an

important source of intelligence was not being fully exploited:

The report noted that the question of the

exploitation for intelligence purposes oi foreign groups and

Individuals in the United States was a clear example where

the Intelligence Advisor! Committee, with the fBI being added

-as a member, should establish principles and rules for

coordination.

In discussing the administrative handling of

espionage and counterespionage matters within the CIA, the

report noted the FBI was charged with all counterespionage

responsibilities in the United States except those affecting

personnel of the armed services. The Dulles Commission

recommended the counterespionage activities of CIA should be

increased in scope and emphasis and that closer liaison in

this field should be established with the rBI.

Hoover Commission, 1948 and 1955

Task forces of the Commission on Organization of the

Executive Branch of the Government (Hoover Commission)

conducted surveys of CIA operations from 1947 to 1949 (under E.

Eberstadt) and from 1953 to 1955 (under General Mark Clark).

## Page 312

The Commission concerned itself principally with

the efiiciency with which CIA was fulfilling its statutory.

missions of coordination, correlation, evaluation, and

dissemination of the intelligence product of other Government

agencies and departments.

The Commission

examined agency

activity in light of the CIA primary mission of advising

NSC and performing, services and duties related to

intelligence and national security as the NSC directed.

(la) Eberstadt Task Force Report

The results of the first examination of CIA by the

direction of the Agency.

The report pointed out, however,

that CiA and its parent, NSC, had had little time to actually

implement the coordination necessary for leadership in the

field. The Task Force clearly defined its understanding of

•the CIA mission as:

"....., coordinate intelligence activities

of Federal agencies concerned with national security."

The duties of CIA were listed as:

I.

Advise National Security Council on national

security intelligence activitios of Federal departments and

agencies:

2.

Recommend necessary coordination of such

activities to National Security Council.

3.

Correlate, evaluate and disseminate national

security intelligence.

4. Render intelligence services for other Federal

• departments

and agencies." (62-88575-3 enclosure behind file.)

In discussing the duties of the CIA the Task Force

noted, "Under the statute CIA is entrusted with the performance

of such services of common concern as the National Security

Council shall determine.

At present these include, apart from

ScientitiC Intelligence, which is aiscussed separately:

maintenance of central indexes of report, records, and

documents

examination of foreign documents

from which intelligence material is extracted and disseminated;

maintenance of central map facilities; (d) monitoring oi

## Page 313

In evaluating the operations and location of CIA •

counterespionage the Task Force commented as follows:

"The counterespionage activities of CIA abroad appear

properly integrated with CIA's other clandestine operations.

Although arguments have been made in favor of extending CIA's

authority to include responsibility for counterespionage in this

country, such ar

extension of jurisdiction does not a present

appear justitiea.

For one thing, concentration of power over

counterespionage activities at home in the hands of a Director

of Central Intelligence responsible for espionage abroad might

justifiably arouse public suspicion and opposition.

Conceivably

it could form the basis for a charge that a gestapo is in

process of creating even though the power to arrest were

specifically withheld. To transier responsibility for domestic

counterespionage from the FBI, which has an established

organization and long tradition, to CiA, which is not equipped

tor the assignment, would probably create more problems than it

It is doubtful whether the logical benefit of

having one agency responsible for counterespionage throughout

the world would justify the dislocation and confusion that such

û transfer would inevitablv occasion. "

"CIA representatives have indicated that their present

working liaison with FBI is satisfactory, but the Committee

doubts that IBI-CIA relationships are completely adequate.

The

Director of FBI declined the Committee's invitation to appear

before it to discuss the CIA with the committee or its

representatives on the ground that he knew too little of its

activities."

The groundwork for CIA acceptance was laid by the

Committee recommendation and finding:

"CIA is not now properly

organized. Co-equal improvement In Go4, IBI, ONd, state

Department, and other Government intelligence services Is also

essential.

Spirit of teamwork must govern interagency

intelligence relationships.

CIA deserves and must have greater

degree of acceptance aud support from old-line intelligence

services than it has had in the past."

A pitch was made for a single agency controlling

internal security in the Committee's finding: "The committee

believes

that responsibility for internal security policies

should be immediately focused in one agency.

A more thorough

study of the subject than any yet made must be prosecuted, 'and

interagency frictions must be ended." It is noted that the

committee commented elsewhere in its report:

of four directed by Mi. Robert Blum of the Office of

With this statement it may be assumed

the Task Force oxcused omissions it may have mado with the

observation that the Dulles group was conducting almost the

same survey carried on in the Hoover Commission so far as

, CIA was Involved.

responsibility in the field of positive foreign intelligenco

as it pertains to national defense and security. It

qualified this survey when speaking of the FBI, noting

survey was limited to suivey of Bureau only to the extent

that it dealt in security intelligence.

Again the Hoover Commission through its Task

Force pinned CIA jurisdiction down to the areas defined by statute,

and emphasized the Agency was subordinate only to the National

Security Council in its coordination, correlation, dissemination

and collection of intelligence data.

The Task Force noted

that since CIA is charged with the over all responsibility

for coordinating the output of all intelligence forces,

the

Task Force was giving special attention to the wors oi

that

Agency.

The FBI was cited as one of the four members of

the Interdepartmental Intelligence Conference (IIC), created

by the NSC, approved by the President 3/23/49, to coordinate

"the investigation of all domestic espionage,

counterospionago,

sabotago, subversion, and other related matters affecting

internal security."

It was noted that the IIC charter did not disturb

responsibilities of its member agencies but made mandatory

action by those agencies deemed necessary to insure complete

investigative coverage in compliance with the needs of the

IIC, which had full responsibility for coordination of the

investigation of all domestic espionage, counterespionage,

et cetera, allecting internal

security.

The Committee stated, "The Central Intelligence

Agency is, by law, excluded irom duplicating the internal

security functions of the rBl. However, the CIA does develop

within and without the U.S., sources for foreign (positive)

intelligence, and incidental

thereto may develop leads as to

subversive activities within this country.

In such cases

CiA througü liaison gives its information

the FBI."

A Task Force survey revealed, "Through the Central

Intelligence Agency's dunestic field offices, contacts are

made on a highly selective basis with business concerns and

other nongovernmental agencies, as well as with previously

cleared individuals who travel

abroad

..

Under the

provisions of DCID 7/1, each member of

the Intelligence

Advisory Committee is required to establish in Washington

a focal office for the purpose of interviewing nongovernment

visitors.

Any visitors to these offices demonstrating

good intelligence potential are referred

to the CIA for further

exploitation. "

The Task Force noted that as far back as 1939

President Roosevelt by executive order directed the FBI to

coordinate and conduct domestic counterintelligence activities.

In 1949, according to the Committee's survey, the IIC was

formalized and by charter restricted to coordinating investi

gations in intelligence matters domestically.

In commenting on the role of the FBI the Conmittee

turther notes,

"The Federal Bureau of Investigation, however,

is the recognized center of the domestic aspect of internal

socurity including countorIntolligOnco within the Unitod Siaies

and its possessions. "

With regard to the use and surfacing of sources,

the Committee noted that CIA was not bound to disclose its

sources; however, it commented on the excellent liaison

system of the FBI which had overcome this restriction so lar

as internal security within the U.S. is concerned.

"Now,

as a matter of practice he CIA usually refers domestic sources

to the FBi, the only exception being where the source is to be

used in foreign intelligence work by the CIA." In the area

of defectors within this country, the Committee noted that

the FBI will receive from cIA or

by a direct interrogation oi

a CIA-controlled defector information which the defector may

have concerning internal security. Persons who defect within

this country, on the other hand,

were found to be under the

cognizance of the FBI. Then the reverse of the above situation

comes into play and CIA has access to the defector for developing

leads in tho lorsion intoluirence Meld. The Committee

commented,

"it is the duty of the FBi to conduct Investigations

of all cases involving I reign nationals in the United States

as set lorth in the Delimitations Agreement."

A review of the Commission report lends one important

Iact to our study of this subject matter. This was pointed

up by the membership of the various groups at the disposal

of the National Security Council within the field of nationat

intelligence.

Ten subcommittees or working groups with member

ship from separate departments or interested agencies acted

of these subcommittees the chairman was a representative of

the Director of CIA and the working groups were individually

serviced by a secretariat furnished by CIA. From the top-

heavy alignment of CIA personnel in IAC and its working groups

it was obvious in which direction advisory opinions would be

slanted when dissenting matters were presented by the IAC and

CIA tO the NSC.

The Doolittlo Committee, 1954

In July, 1951, we received information from the

White House that

the President had appointed lieutenant

General James H. Doolittle to study in collaboration with

the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) certain aspects of

the national intelligence effort.

By letter dated

July 28, 1954,

sherman Adams, the Assistant to the President,

requested that the Bureau brief General Doolittle's group

concerning the relationship that existed between the Bureau

and CiA.

We subsequently learned that at approximately the

same time & survey would be conducted by the Hoover

Commission under the chairmanship of General Mark Clark.

We learned from Allen W. Dulles, Director of CIA, that the

President strongly believed that General Clarks should not

permit the survey to get into CIA covert operations,

particularly in the field of political and psychológical

warfare.

The President had told Dulles that he was selecting

General

Doolittle to study CIA's covert operations.

• General Doolittle's group was briefed on

August 25, 1954, at which time the Bureau's position in

the intelligence field was described and the manner in

which the Bureau transacted business with CIA was explained. :

In addition, certain constructive criticism concerning

problems and conflicts

experienced in dealing with CIA was

furnished General Doolittle's group.

The following salient

features of the criticism appear to bear on the current study:

We were critical of a policy of the Ofiice of

Operations, CIA, which precluded that Division from

identilying any of its sources in the United States when

such sources possessed information bearing on the internal

security of the United States.

The

Oilice of Operations

source by CIA policy. We were of the opinion that CIA's

policy could be modified to allow us direct accoss to

the sourco in the united states when such was necessary.

As of 1951, CIA had Intorost in various

organizations such as Radio Free Europe and Others and

from time to time the Bureau vould get involved it

investigation of organizations only to learn they were

being supported or guided by CIA.

Our opinion was that

1i we had been appropriately notified of CiA's interest

considerable investigative time and manpower could have

been saved and in addition we would have been in a position

to notily CIA when anything of interest came to our

attention.

Concerning CIA investigations in the United

States, we readily acknowledged CIA's right to investi

gate its own applicants or consultants.

We did object

to CIA's undertaking any investigation in this country

when the facts indicated the case was clearly wichin

Bureau jurisdiction and pointed out that the Bureau had

recently become involved in investigating an individual

suspected of espionage activity. We were in contact with

CIA and had solicited its help concerning certain aspects

in the case but it was a few weeks before we learned CIA

had conducted a very close investigation of this same

individual.

We made the observations that close and open

cooperation between the Bureau and CIA was vital to the

proper handling of espionage cases.

The Bureau pointed out that as of 1954 it had

received little or no significant infornation concerning

espionage or sabotage agents coming to the United States.

We excluded diplomatic personnel in this matter but clearly

indicated that CiA should be in a position to give us some

advance notification whes spies were coming to this country.

Interested Government agencies as a major operation.

Our

discharge of our intelligence operation concerning the

Communist

Party and Soviet and Satellite diplomats was

explained

in detail to the satisfaction of all personnel

attending the briefing.

General Doolittle asked for recommendations

as to

what could be done to improve CIA so the Bureau would get

better service.

It was suggested that corrective action be

taken on the matters which had been criticized constructively;

CIA should establish adequate coverage (although not

specifically noted, this obviously regarded advance notice

of foreign intelligence personnel coming to the United States);

and finally CIA should transmit information developed

in an

expodite fashion.

Prior to submitting the report to the President,

General Doollitle expressed a desire to see Mr. Hoover, whom

he regarded

as the outstanding intelligence authority in the

world..

to be apologetic in tone for any shortcomings of CIA. The

reader obtains the definite impression the report was used as

a sounding board for differences of opinion as to methods and

Recommendation number 17 emphasized that CIA

that CIA should Increase intelligence support to unillod and

the great. number of requirements served on the Agency. ••

The main tone of the report was that greater

cooperation was required between the Joint Chieis of Stali

(JCS), Departnent of State, and CIA in carrying out foreign

intelligence collection missions.

The recommendations of

the Group were all directed toward this end and had no

bearing on internal espionage or counterespionage activities

within the United States.

In commenting on the coordination duties of the

DCI, the Group pointed out that USIB had been officially

directed to "establish policies and develop programs lor

It should be noted in considering the proposed

change of USIB membership that the Bureau was a member of

six of the twenty-six subcommittees which formed the committee

make-up or the USIb.

Memorandum January 10, 1961, Mr: Belmont to

Mr. Parsons outlined the proposed USIB membership change

for the Director.

It recommended that Bureau make no issue

of the proposed recommendation.

The Director underlined

a passage of the memorandum which stated "In one sense of

the word it could be argued the FBI would lose prestige

by changing from a regular member to an ad hoc member."

The Director approved the recommendation of the memorandun

with the following notation:

not changed and the Bureau has continued to hold full member-

shiy on the Board.

In briel, the Joint Study Group Report noted that

the majority of the recommendations of the study Group bad

in effect. Many of the recommendations of the Group were

I'lt to have been met by the creation of the Delense

Intelligence Agency (DIA) which acted as a coordinator and

overseer of the intelligence effort of the Joint Chiefs

There is no comment made in this report which

would bear on our present survey of CIA jurisdiction or

activities within the United States in conflict with our owa

jurisdictional and investigative interests.

reference to the Bureau in this latter report was as

previously mentioned in the comment relative to reorganization

Over the years, consideration has been given to

the Bureau's withdrawing its membership from USIB.

On each

occasion the Director has chosen to have the Bureau retain

Its membership on the Board.

The last such occasion occurred

In 1964 during the period when John McCone was Chairman ot

the United States Intelligence Board. At that time, the military

services were removed from membership on the Board and replaced

by the Defense Intelligence Agency.

At the time, Mr. Belmont,

then Assistant to the Director, orally discussed

with the

Director the possibility of the Bureau's withdrawing from the

USIB.

The Director's comments were that we would not request

removal ixom membership on the Board but would withdraw our

membership only il so requested by the Director of Central

Intelligence in his role as Chairman of the USIB. The Bureau's

withdrawal would, of course, require action on the part of

the National Security Council.

d.

The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (PFIAB)

This group was originally organized in January, 1956,

as the President's Board of Consultants on Fordion intolligance

Activity.

Its primary function at that time was to review

periodically the Government's foreign intelligence efforts

with specilic emphasis on the operations of the Central

Intelligence Agency.

It was established as a result of

recommendations by the Hoover Commission.

In the later years

of the Eisenhower Administration the activity of the group

fell off and it was re-organized in its present form with the

advent of the

Kennedy Administration.

Our relationship with this Board has historically

been one of informal liaison in view of the fact that the

primary function of the Board is concerned with foreign

intelligence.

There have been occasions where representatives

of the Bureau briefed individual members and/or panels of

the Board concerning our jurisdiction, techniques and

accomplishments in the intelligence field. These briefings

"have been received with a receptive and sympathetic attitude.

Our main concern in following the activities of this Board

has been to assure that the Central Intelligence Agency does

not encroach upon our j'risdiction and upon the functions of

the various intelligence communities in which we hold membership

agent resources to effect the required domestic

counterintelligence coverage of both bloc and

nonbloc official installations and personnel who

may be engaged in inielligence and related

activities inimical to the national security."

State with respect to authorizing technical

coverage (use of wiretapping and listening

devices) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation

of foreign official: installations and personnel

this country be re-examined with a view to

liberalization to the extent necessary to provide

the counterintelligence coverage required in the

interest of national security."

#20:

"That, in future, when consideration is

gence agents for imprisoned American personnel in

bloc countries, advance consultations be held with

of Investigation to assure that adequate attention

exchanges in the interest of the national security,

e. The Director's Stand Over the Years

The Director's stand over the yoars with respect

to jurisdiction concerning foreign Intelligence matters

within the United States is reflected in numerous comments

he has made dating back to the days when the Central

Intelligence Group. (CIG) was being formed.

In June, 1946, General Vandenberg, then head of

CIG, sent a memorandum to the Director proposing that the.

National Intelligence Authority issue a directive extending

the powers and duties of the Director of Central Intelligence,

which position General Vandenberg occupied.

The memorandum

was analyzed on June 21, 1946, in a memorandum from C. H.

Larson to D. M. Ladd In

it was pointed out that it

was inevitable that CIG must enter into the domestic

picture because of sources of foreign intelligence in that

field. An addendum was placed on the memorandum by Mr. Edward a.

Tamm and Mr. C. A. Tolson which was followed by comments by

the Director which is most pertinent to the subject matter

The addondum read:

"Mr. Tolson and MI. Tamm do not concur with

the conclusion expressed in this memorandum that

'It is inevitable that the Central Intelligence

Group must enter into the domestic field picture

insofar as intelligence' is concerned because of

the sources

of foreign intelligence existing in

that lield.'

They feel that a coordinated pro

gram for the exchange of information between the

Central Intelligence Authority and the rBI,

permitting a free and comprehensive exchange of

information in matters of mutual interest, will

enable the Bureau to work in the domestic field

without interference from the Central Intelligence

Authority in the same manner that the Bureau works,

for example, with local police depariments or other

• governmental agencies within defined jurisdictional

Lines.

We believe that the attached lotter to

General Vandenberg is satisfactory."

The Director commented as follows:

"I am not as optimistic as are Tolson & Tamm.

"I think it is inevitable that there viil be s

• collision with CIG over our domestic jurisdiction

• 50 ..

rather their expansion into it on intelligence

matters.

It ought not occur but this new memo

of CiG shows how greedy it is.

It is the

Donovan plan almost in toto & is boing slyly

put over.

It means we must zealously guard our

domestic jurisdiction & not yield an inch & be

ever alert to resist any encroachment."

On March 27, 1953, the Director testified before the

Senate Subcommittee on Appropriations. In response to & question

from Senator McCarran concerning liaison between FBI and CIA,

the Director stated: "There is close liaison. CIA has

exclusive jurisdiction abroad for intelligence. We have

exclusive jurisdiction within the United States. We maintain

continuous liaison with CIA Headquarters in Washington through

a liaison representative of our Bureau in order to facilitate

the transmission of material from them to us and from our

service to them."

In October, 1958, CIA approached us requesting

oùs concurrence in CIA's establishing physical and technical

•surveillance in the United States on the brother of the then

current ruler of Yemen.

CIA had an operational interest in

this individual. By memorandum it was recommended that the

Burezu not become involved in this CIA operation and that CIA

be informed that this would not establish a precedent for

approval of future CIA activities in the United States.

Responsive to continuing to present problems, the Director

"This is an understatement particularly if we are

going to adopt a macaroni backbone attitude instead of standing

up forthrightly for our rights and jurisdiction."

CIA, in April, 1959, advised us that one of its

Egyptian sources would be visiting the United States, and

requested our concurrence in CIA's establishing coverage

including technical surveillance. It was recommended we stay

out of this matter and inform CIA that this was not to be

construed as a precedent for approval of future CIA counter-

intelligence activity in the United States. • The Director

commented on the memorandum:

"The trend has gone so far we

have become nothing but a rubber stamp for CIA yet they won't

even allow us to perform liaison functions abroad much less

operational ones."

In January, 1960, CIA agreed to comply with

conditions imposed by the Bureau with regard to developing

positive interigence intormation through contacts between

U. S. residents and visitors from Iron Curtain countries.

CIA agreed to contact us

first before promoting such

associations. In March, 1960, CIA inquired if 1t might obtain

Bureau clearance at the

field

level for such contacts in the

interest of expodiency.

Mx. Tolson notod: "More and more we

are agreeing to CIA operations in the U. S. I am opposed

to this relaxation.

We can exercise better control here than

through our field offices." The Director added: "I share

Tolson's views."

CIA was advised clearance was

to be obtained

through. Bureau headquarters.

in December, 1961

and furnished information alleging

penetration oi American intelligence.

One serge Karlow, a.

CIA OiLICeX, was developed as a suspect.

On 2/9/62, we took

over the investigation.

On 2/26/62, Sheffield Edwards, then

CIA Director of Security, admitted CIA had had technical

coverage on Karlow from February, 1961 to 2/9/62. Edwards'

So arom to eated

Jaimed his raluctance to tell us of this situation earlier

because of obvious possible jeopardy to prosecution, plus

embarrassment to his Agency should the Bureau raise

objection to CIA's maintaining such coverage.

The Director

noted: "I only wish we would eventually realize CIA can

nevEr

be depended upon to deal forthrightly with us.

Certainly

my skepticism isn't based on prejudice nor suspicion but on

specific instances all too many in number. Yet there exists

wistful belief that 'the leopard has changed his spots'."

In April, 1962, we received information on a

strictly confidential basis from Jay Sourwine of the Senate

Internal Security Subcommittee to the effect that an

unidentified CIA representative had talked to Senator Eastland

concerning an alleged move to place CIA in charge of all

intelligence-gathering operations for the Government - to

include Soviet espionage in the U. S. The Director noted:

"I am not surprised at the above alleged effort.

There is no

doubt in many quarters a desire to eliminate the FBI in

dealing with espionage and subversion for we are a thorn not

only in the side of communists but also the ala and rabian

Socialists. CIA which failed again and again to know what

is actually going on abroad could be counted upon to blunder

the same way in the USA."

appropriate cover.

The Director noted; "OK, but

I hope you are not being taken

. in.

I can't forget CIA

activities in the U. S. nor

the false story concerning Oswald's trip to Mexico City, only

to mention two of their instances of double dealing."

The New York Office, by letter 2/14/64, set forth

its observations concerning a briefing given that office on the

matter of CIA operations in the U. s.

The Director commented:

"I think this domestic operations expansion of ClA is very

dangerous and will inevitably "muddy' the waters."

In May, 1964, the Bureau reconsidered its stand

with respect to permitting CIA to approach sources at foreigo

establishments in the United States, for intelligence purposes.

The following policy was proposed and subsequently approved:

(1) Where there was no indication a source would

be leaving the United States, we would deny CiA clearance

for contact until we had fully explored the person's

potential for our owa purposes. "

If we decided we had no

interest and CIA contact would not jeopardize any FBI

investigations, we would grant CIA approval to proceed

with its contact with proviso we be kept informed of

Information developed of possible interest to us.

(2) Where it appeared source would be returning

CIA clearance for preliminary contact with proviso we

we would undertake the recruitment and keep CIA advised

this very closely."

THE NEED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

FOREIGN INTELLIGINCE IN THE U. S.

In 1911, the U. S. allegedly had in its

POSSeSSIOn practically all of the toroign intelligence

it needed regarding military and strategic targets in

Japan.

The informavion was scattered among various

Individuals who had personal knowledge or was located

2n libraries, various Government agencies, private

business firms, institutions, et cetera.

Tragically,

the U. S. Government did not have any mechanism to

collect, record and evaluate such information.

Intelligence was badly needed in 1941, and we paid

dearly in lives and financial resources to accomplish

certain missions because the information was not

readily available.

Today, the need for foreign intelligence is

greater than ever. The stakes of foreign policy have

never been higher. The U. S., being a dominating world

power, has assumed vast responsibilities enmeshed in

delicate political situations throughout the world.

. The ever-existing threat of an atomic war with communist

countries demanas a cuninuing acquironent of knowledge

so thatpolicies and courses of action can be designed

in the most effective manner possible. The information

needed applies to numerous fields oi activity, a major

area being scientific research and development. In this

connection, the revolutionary break-throughs in the :

scientific

category are occurring with unusually high

Irequency, and il the U. S. is to remain in the

toreront, It Is absolutely necessary that we obtain

an accurate evaluation of the enemy's capabilities and

intentions.

We have been fortunate to collect high

quality positive intelligence through sophisticated

collection methods, i,e high altitude photography and

research in this area is proceeding at an accelerated

pace.. Nevertheless, electronic gadgets and machines

never produce all that is required.

We still need

supplementary coverage on a heavy scale, and

the human

inpenetrable or leveling-off depth.

Foreign intelligence is not geographically

restricted.

Information regarding Chinese Communists

can be obtained anywhere in the world, and even if it

Is of a fragmentary nature, the data can be of

signiricant value.

The demand for information is

heavy and is sought by every agency in the Government. :

Because of this,

it has been necessary for the

U. S. Goveinment to map a program of collection on

a priority basis. This has been. done through the

creation of a committee which is attached to the

•U. S. Intelligence Board. The committee maintains

a list of prioxities on a current basis. A recent

Iist of guidelines ior the collection of foreign

intelligence pertaining to scientilic affairs in

Communist China included approximately 170 iitms,

i,eLlong-range planning of Communist China in the

nuclear Lield; nature of research in oceanography;

computer capabilities of Shantung Univorsity; climate

nodification and cloud physics research; development

of meteorological rockets; development of nuclear

weapons; location of uranium relineries; strength

border; types of equipment being supplied to Laos

In the U.S. proper, the sources of foreign

intelligence are voluminous.

Most of these sources

overtly provide information through newspapers,

scientific publications, libraries,

tourists,

visiting

proiessors and students,

journalists, and immigrants.

The compilation, collation, analysis, and reporting

of such information involves an extensive program

and, needless to say, the U.s. today does not bave

the capability of tapping all available sources on

a current basis.

CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF CIA IN

THE FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION

TIELD IN THE UNITED STATES

In order that there may not be any

misuaderstanding regarding CIA's capabilities to

collect Loroign intelligence in the United States,

We should first clarily that one of the components

. Of tho Agency which has offices in the United States

does not engage in this particular activity.

The Office of Security, which is responsible fox

personnel and physical

security, maintains several

offices in the United States under authorized

Treasury Department cover. Personnel of this

ofLice conduct investigations of applicants, firms

or individuals who may be utilized by cIA on

a contract basis to support intelligence operations

overseas.

The overt collection of Intelligence by

CIA is handled by the Domestic Contact Service (DCS)

(Iomerly called Contact Division).' CIA estimates

that Dos has a capability of tapping approximately

15 per cent of the total potential of intelligence in

the U.s.

This Division has 18 field offices and

16 resident agencies in the United States, and each

office is openly identilied as being connected with

CIA. Personnel totaling approximately 140 carry CIA

credentials.

The Division regularly has a number of

officers from the various military services who are

assigned to this Division on a temporary basis.

These military officers concentrate on the collection

of that foreign intelligence which relates to the

immediate United States military needs.

The personnel

of DCs interview aliens, tourists, officials 01

import-export firms, students, scientists, and the

iniormation collected covers a

very broad

spectrun in

the positive intelligence category.

DCS. claims to have

contact with about 7200 organizations, institutions, or

businesses

and has approximatoly 60,000 contacts or

sources of information.

The information is reported in

the form of "Information Reports," which is disseminated

throughout the intelligence community. During 1965,

-459

MH 55120 DocId:32989629 Page 337

## Page 338

Des aisseminated 26,000 such reports. Dos does not

have any responsibilities in the clandestine collection

of intelligence, and in that sense it is very

specilically not operational. DOS delinitoly cannot

engage in any activity of an

intornal security nature,

and within CIA 1t 15 clearly understood that DCS is

not to be operational under any circumstances.

DCS has been the subjoct of some controvorsy within

CIA.

There is one school of thought which maintains

that DCS should be an appendage of the Deputy Director

oi Plans, who is responsible for all clandestine

operations.

The other school which has prevailed

holds to the line that DOS should be separate and..

continue under the supervision of the Deputy Director

of intelligence (DDI).

This situation not only has

causod headachos for CiA but also lor the Bureau because

of situations which ariso where the "left hand does not

know what the right hand is doing."

DCS is essentially carrying out CIA's

responsibilities emanating from National Security Council

Intolligence Directive (NSCID) No. 2 which has its roots

in a sinisar aireciive

issued under tho National

Intelligence Authority in 1946. It has been in business

for approximately twenty years.

Per agreement, DCS

cannot interview an alien without first clearing with

the Bureau.. This is done on a daily basis.

With regard

to American citizens, Bureau approval is not required

unless

the Bureau has indicated a prior interest in the

individual; however, DCS nevertheless submits name

checks on AmeriCans, and 11 1t so happens that the

subject of such an inquiry is a bureau source or

Involved in a Bureau investigation, we are in a position

to move to protect our interests.

It should be noted

that although.DCS is engaged primarily in positive

intolligonco collection, it is required to be on the

avert for sources who possibly might be useful to CiA's

clandestine operations.

For example, if. DCS encounters

an alien who can be utilized in an overseas operation,

thé lead is passed on to the appropriate division...

At the present time, DOs alerts the newly created

Domestic Operations Division (explained below) regarding

potential sources.

out arrangements where our field offices can contact

the local DCS offices concerning Chinese aliens who

might bo of interost to us either as subjocts tor

Investigation or as potential.Laformants.

This liaison

at the field level was deemed

dosirable so that we

could got information at the "horse's mouth" rather

than vait for a reply from CIA headquarters, which is

often prolonged and, when transmitted, is sometimes

stripped of pieces of information.

This occurs

because of the involved and sometimes complicated

maze of bureaucratic compartmentation within CIA:

In the latter part of 1963, CIA created its

Domestic Operations Division (DOD), which was to be

responsible for any clandestine development of sources

in the United states.

Prior to the establishment of

this Division, CIA actirity in this field was managed

Irom each individual area division at Mashington

headquarters.

The pressing need for more clandestine

sources,

coupled with the recognition of the vast

potential in the United States, prompted CIA to create

a new division which would be responsible for all of

the area division interests. DOD has headquarters

at lashington, D. C., and currently has field offices

at New York City, Boston, Chicago, van LIanCisco,

Los Angeles, Honolulu, and Washington, D. C., proper.

Approximately 40 intelligence officers are assignea

. to

the task of engaging in assessment and/or recruitment

of positive intelligence sources, primarily in the

diplomatic field.

Some of the personnel are assigned

signed

to the handling of firms or organizations which nay

be supporting certain CIA operations abroad. DOD personnel

in the field operat under authorized Department of Defense

cover.

The heads of these field offices are known to us,

and we have established a satisfactory liaison area at

the Lield level.

DOD is also responsible for the handling of

CIA agents (informants) who have been recruited abroad

and who come to the United States for assignments either

on a temporary basis or jor the duration of a normal

diplomatic assignment.

The creation of DOD within CIA was and st111

is a somewhat controversial Agency subject.

mistiES tO DOD.

From CIA's standpoint there appears

to be a definite need for a much stronger team within DOD.

Theoretically, DOD Is required to be on the

alert for all potential sources who can be used by CIA

in its intelligence operations, and the approach is

basically one of a long-range nature. DOD is required

to make use of all leads emanating from lellow employees

who may have developed social contacts or associations

wich foreigners abroad or who might meet potential

sources in the United States.

Since CIA personnel

operate under diplomatic cover when abroad, they do get

the opportunity to move in diplomatic circles.

Similarly,

undercover agents of CiA traveline throughout the world

also make contacts which offer potential exploitation 11

and when the target stops in the United States.

Since January, 1964, when DOD actually began

moving, it has recruited approximately ten individuals

in the diplomatic field. Most of these were in the

noncommunist-bloc area.

Alt of those recruited appear

to have been in a fairly low level category.

Alt of them

were career diplomats, and there was no evidence that

the individuals were connected with any intelligence

service.

In addition to the activitles of DCS and DOD,

there is a certain amount of CIA operational movements

which do not fall under either of the foregoing divisions.

One example is the ciA base in Miami which was set up

for CIA's operations directed against the Cuban Government.

This base is used for the training and dispatching of

agents into Cuba and to some extent into other countries

in the Caribbean, particularly the Dominican RepubliC.

This base is directly responsible to the Western

Hemisphere Division of CIA, which could be called the

Latin AmeriCan DiviSiOn.

HH 55120 DocId:32989629 Page 340

## Page 341

CIA also becomes involved in political and

psychological variare type oi programs directed against

targets in foreign countries.

The Agency broadly relers

to this activity as "covert action."

The programs axe

IOD does use people in the

Unitod States to help implement the overseas programs.

Quite often the Agency uses cutouts or covers for such

an operation.

Althoigh IOD does not engage in intelligence

collection, it is a CIA division which should be kept is

mind, since its activities quite often will be tangent to

matters of interest to the Bureau.

For example, 10L

objective is to neutralize communist influence. We, of

course, have had an interest in the restival because of the

participation of Americans, including members oi the CPUsA.

neoretically, IOD is required to coordinate closelr with

other appropriate components of CIA.

We do not believe

that this coordination has been elective enough.

There is no doubt that there are individuals

in CIA who aspire to broaden the Agency's operational

activities in the United States.

Such individuals would

like to see an arrangement similar to one currently in

force in England where Mi-6 has a free hand to assess and

recruit all ioreigners, including diplomats, where there

is no evidence that they are engaged in intelligence

•activity.

If such evidence is obtained, Mi-6 is required

to coordinate with MI-5.

There are people in CIA who

would like to see similar machinery and in addition would

want the freedom to conduct certain investigations and

maybe even institute technical surveillances.

is summary, CIA So iar has a very limited

capability to recruit foreign diplomatic sources in the

United States,' but the Agency appears: to have done fairly.

weil with a relatively small staii; however, it can be

anticipated that this capability will increase.

CIA's

effectiveness will probably be adversely affected for

some time to come because of the Agency's well-known

deficiencies, such as lack of discipline, loose admis

istration, and lack of skilled and talented personnel.

I. CURRENT CAPABILITIES OF THE FBI

I. Manpower Being Devoted

It is most difficult to give any specific figures as to

how much manpower the FBI is currently devoting strictly to

foreign intelligence collection, separate and apart from the

Bureau's internal security ind

counterintelligence functions.

Much of the foreign intelligence developed by the Bureau is an

outgrowth of our internal security investigations and cannot be

neatly separated in terms of manpower or time.

A substantial amount of our foreign intelligence activity

is concentrated in two offices where nost of the diplomatic

establishments in the United States are located; namely, New York

and Washington Field. Both offices were requested to furnish

estimates as to how much manpower is being allocated to foreign

intelligence matters, including both live sources developed and

technical coverage.

In both cases, the estimates provided were

highly tentative and both cifices stress that manpower commitments

in this area fluctuate widely from week to weeks depending on

international politics and other unpredictable factors. For

instance, during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, both offices

greatly

increased their normal manpower commitment to the develop

ment oI current toreign intelligence.

The present vominican crisis

which involves production of foreign

intelligence to a large extent

represents another "abnormal" situation.

However, for what it is worth, WFO and New York have

at the present time they are allocating approxi-

mately 35 Agents and 20 clerical employees to the full time task '

of loreign intelligence collection. Virtually all of the clerical

time and about 40 per cent of the Agent time is related to

technical coverage and the balance is aimed at the development of

live sources.

In addition, of course, all of the other offices, including

our Legal Attaches abroad, have devoted manpower to foreign

intelligence collection in varying degrees.

Anagram operations

conducted in different field offices have involved the assignment

of as many as 10 or 12 Agents for temporary periods.

In connection

with its responsibilities in the Cuban and Latin-American fields,

the Miami and San Juan offices have devoted considerable manpower

to the development of foreign intelligence in recent years.

Chicago Office in connection with its handling of our top-level

Sold informant has devoted manpower

to the development of foreign

intelligence. These represent only a lew examples.

On an overall basis and bearing in mind the difficulty.in

citing any precise figures, it is estimated that the Bureau probably

averages approximately 50 to 75 Agents and 25 to 30 clerks assigned

primarily to foreign intelligence work.

At present, Bureau has only one microphone surveillance in

technical surveillances and no microphone surveillances with the

exception of one on the Turkish United Nations Mission,

In addition, during recent years, we have maintained

approximately 50 so-called

"telex" surveillances on the teletype

facilities of various

foreign establishments.

This has been done

at the specific request of the National Security Agency, in

connection with its eiforts to break foreign codes and to read

foreign government communications.

We have had excellent results from these technical

installations. Any compilation of items of value to the Us.

Intelligence Community and policy-making ofiicials developed

through this coverage would

run many hundreds of pages.

The results

have ranged from information regarding plans and activities of

key foreign countries in the diplomatic field to information

regarding intelligence, political, economic and military develop-

ments in the countries

concerned.

In many instances, we have been

able to forewarn the White House, the State Department and other

interested agencies of impending developments and to furnish data

giving an insight into the thinking and strategy of key foreign

officials and

governments.

This coverage has proved specially

valuable during crisis periods such as the Cuban missile crisis of

1962 and during the tense negotiations involving the Panama Canal

in 1964.

On many occasions,

top-ranking United States officials

have commented on the effectiveness of this data.

The particulas

importance of this information has been its timeliness

to current

events as well as the lact that it represents a

penetiaion of

foreign diplomatic circles which is only infrequently available

through live sources.

In some instances, Of course, this type coverage on a

particular foreign establishment or official has not paid off.

We have had cases where this technique has been unproductive for

süstained periods of time on a particular country.

This is to be

expected and we have sought. to overcome this by rotating our

installations, correlating our technical operations with shifting

international developments and putting coverage on those countries

which appear to offer the most

promise for worthwhile intelligence.

3. Live Sources With Evaluation

At present we are making active efforts to develop live

informant coverage in the diplomatic establishments of 37 non-

Soviet bloc countries. This list of so-called "target countries"

varies from time to time but essentially we are seeking informant

coverago in countrios considerod

critical from an intolligence

standpoint such as those leaning towards the Soviet bloc or

countries in which the United States has paramount political or

military interests or which are otherwise of primary concern.

current list includes virtually all Latin-American countries, a

number of Middle Last countries, and scattered countries throughout

Africa and the Far East.

Our program was initiated in the early 1950s, and we

'are now using some 50 sources (This number fluctuates due to

and ve also clear with State prior to conducting interviews with

employees at the "target" establishment. In a number of instances,

including most latin-American countries, state has asked us to

restrict our efforts to American citizens. This, of course, is

a highly limiting factor.

Over the years this live informant coverage has on many

occasions produced foreign intelligence of rel value.

Our sources

have frequently provided data regarding proposed political,

diplomatic or economic action by the countries concerned, on

occasion in advance of other forewarning to U.S. intelligence.

They have

also been able to furnish a considerable amount ot

information regarding the whereabouts, background and general

activities of individual foreign officials of security interest,

thereby saving investigative time.

These sources have been

especially valuable in connection with the Anagram Program and

other sophisticated

attacks on foreign establishments, providing

us with data regarding the physical security, location of code

rooms, etc., oi the various foreign establishments.

In addition to so-called "target" countries which are

in the non-soviet bloc area, the Bureau has developed a number of

informants and defectors-in-place in Soviet-bloc establishments

who have been able to

furnish a substantial amount of foreign

intelligence.

In the

e Soviet-bloc field; we have also developed

a number of sources in quasi-oflicial establishments, such as

Ixade missions, who have produced valuable foreign intelligence.

In the soviet-bloc field, of course, our live informant development

has been aimed essentially at internal

security and counterintelli-

gence needs of the Bureau.

(

It is significant that we have been able to operate for

many years in the development of live sources in foreign diplomatic

establishments, both Soviet bloc and non-bloc, without encountering

any serious incidents embarrassing to the rBI or the United states

Government.

In assessing tho produci of such live sources in a numbor

of instances in the non-Sov..et field, State Department has

requested that we restrict our efforts to American citizens. To

i considerable degree, this has Limited the ertectiveness or oux

program in the ton-soviet field since U.s. employees ot toreign

establishments will normally not have access to top-grade data.

Thus,

especially in the non-soviet bloc field we are not tapping

the full potential which exists for high-level foreign intelligence.

• This can only be realized through the development of high quality

sources.

4.

Anagram Program

Anagram is code word for IBI program to penetrate foreign

diplomatic establishments in U.S. for purpose of securing crypto

graphic material. This material

is primarily of value to National

Security Agency in its communications

intelligence efforts.

Since inception of program in 1954, we have conducted Anagram

operations involving 38 different foreign countries and a total oi

57 separate establishments.

Approximately 10 FBI field offices

have participated in the program. Our operations under this

program have resulted in monetory savings to the Government estimated

at better than $13,000,000 and it has provided data oi incalculable

intelligence value.

While it has been of primary value to NSA, we

have on occasion produced information of primary interest to the

Bureau. For example, in April, 1963, we affected a successful

penetcation in the Polish field which produced material disclosing

the activities of Polish Intelligence Service in this country.

. 5.

Double Agents and Informants

In a number of instances, Bureau double agents and informants,

developed to assist us in connection with our Internal

security and

counterintelligence responsibilities, have been able to provide

significant high-level infornation of foreisp intelligence value.

6. Additional Potential

As indicated in the foregoing subsections, the Bureau is

currently producing a considerable volume, of foreign intelligence

through covert neans, much of it of a significant nature. Host of

Inis data 1s an ouigrowüh vi infurmanis,

decludiat coverago and

investigative prograns targeted primarily to fulfill our internal

security and counterintelligence objectives and relatively speaking,

we have committed only a small percentage of our assets exclusively

in the direction of foreign intelligence.

It is believed that the Bureau possesses considerable

potential for the development of foreign intelligence which could

be realized with a lairly modest expenditure of manpower and costs

if we were to make foreign intelligence collection a primary aim.

For example, with existing equipment and facilities, we coulo

expand our technical coverage of foreign establishments to include ai

additional 30 to 40 loreign establishments provided we could assigo

about 25 additional personnel to this lield. With the assignment

of an additional 75 to 100 Agents, ve could greatly intensify our

foreign intelligence collection through live informants, primarily

through the development and exploitation of additional sources at

foreign diplomatic establishments. :Ne.could place more stress.on

loreign intelligence collection in our training programs and

conferences to make more effective use oi our already available

We coula, for example, add specialized classes on foreige intellige

collection to our In-Service schedules or designate selectea bureau

regarding this subject.

AREAS OF CONTLICT, FBI - CIA

Any difierences between FBI and CIA are first

related to a basic problem existing in any country among

the major powers, namely. "How does a law enforcement

agency coordinate its internal security functions with

an

intelligence organization which must operate as a clandestina

service?"

The very nature of the functions of the two

organizations inmediately introduces potential areas of

conflict. One essentially operates overtly and the other

covertly. This alone is enough to create an atmosphere.

Because each

fraught with controversies and confusion responsibilitles

agency was molded differently and because

differ, there naturally will be conflicting approaches to

a into gone the

national security objectives. for example, in the field

of intelligence the Bureau is basically a counterintelligence

body.

CIA, to the contrary, has a much broader responsibility

in intelligence, which includes collection of foreign

intelligence, political and psychological warfare, inter

agency coordinating, evaluation, research,

etc.

Counter.

intelligence within CIA is actually a relatively small

component of

the agency.

Personnel in the two organizations

is recruited under diffeient citeria did standards.

Training is likevise ai variance. In a final analysis,

the experienced IBI Agent and the seasoned CIA intelligence

officer are not of the same mold but certainly are tailored

as two entirely and distinctly dilferent instruments.

We

should bear in mind that little has been done to introduce

truly substantive cross-lertilization of outlook, approach

and operational philosophy between the two agencies.

This

could be advocated from a Utopian point of view, but 1i

•also could be argued that there are distinct advantages to

maintaining sound compartmentation.

Separate from the above basic and fundamental

situation, the diîferences between FBI and CIA also relate

to other factors such as:

FBI was first on the scene and was well

established long before CIA came to lile.: This led to a

conception in the early years that CIA was an intruder.

2) The seed of CIA vas the Ofrice of Strategic

Services (OSS), an organization whose personnel, activities

and free-wheeling were the sources of numerous

conilicts

with the Bureau during World War II. It was during

these years that an atmosphere of mistrust and lack of

coniidence was created.

3>

CiA was ostablished as our IIISt OvOI.al1,

worldwide intelligence agency. The events and the

maneuvering which led to this certainly. did not bring

with them a harmonious relationship.

4) Uniortunately, CIA grew big and grew fast,

particularly because of an unsettled atomic world and

developnents such as the Korean War. The Agency did not

jell ellectively as an organization, and with this came

numerous difficulties, many of which exist to this day.

5) Each organization has lacked adequate

knowledge of the other's operational machinery, objectives,

and "ways and means of doing things."

6) An element of Iivalry actually developed over

the years, and this, when not tempered with prudence and

sound judgment, creates unhealthy situations.

7) A growing tendency on the part of CIA to

expand its operational activities not originally contemplated

• in the formation of that agency.

It can be recognized that with this background it

has not been an easy matter to establish a good working

relationship with CIA vithout frequent conflicts, and

sometimes agonizing negotiations. It could be suggested

that the ideal situation would be to remove CIA Iron the

U.S. with the understanding that we would assume respon

sibility for any and all activity in the intelligence field.

As described in another section of this report, such a

move would be highly infeasible for the Bureau.

It is to our credii that despite the problems of

the past there have been some highly constructive develop

ments in FBI-CIA:relations; particularly as they alfect.

activities in the U.S. Several years ago arrangements

vere made whereby CIA's Office of Security could conduct

diction.

All of this is commendable progress and certainly

benericial to national security.

All of the foregoing vas set orth in the way of

background in order to better understand the current source

of dilLerences with ChA,

namely the Agency's desire to assess

and recruit foreira intelligence sources in the U.S. In the

Ioreign diplonatic establishments, including United

Nations,

and to some extent among

foreign visitors.

CIA fully

acknowledges our internal security and counterintellitonce

responsibilities. This is clear-cut and free of any

debatable question; however. CIA leels that we have nor

legally-established responsibility in loreign intellirence

antlection and that somebody (in this case, CIA) should

be fully exploiting the foreiga intelligence potential in

the United States,

bearing in mind that there are approxi-

mately 10,000 foreign officials and employees in this country.

CIA argues that a foreign diplomat can be recruited anywhere

in the world but maintains that there is no better place

than the United States for assessment, recruitnent, training

and orientation of an informant.

further maintains that

if the Agency moves on a target,

such as an Argentino

diplomat who may be a career officer not connected with a

foreign intelligence service, there should not be any con-

flict because the activity is in no way related to tho

internal security functions of the Bureau.

CIA has also

expressed the attitude that in the communist-bloc fiold

CIA should be permitted to assess and recruit those

individuals not connected with an intelligence or intornal

security service.

There are some people in CIA ho are of tho

opinion that in the field o1 Loreign intelligence tho Bureau.

should be exerting more effort to actually assist CIA 1u

spotting sources and, when needed, give CIA support In

developing an individual through such means as survoillances,

neighborhood investigations, etc.. When CIA is permittad to

recruit a source in the U.S., the Agency takes the

position that il the source can be of help to the Bureau

we should levy requirements on CIA and not ask for access

to tho source unless it clearly appears that only through

accoss wo can properly dischargo our rospossibilitios.

CiA takes a very strong. view that once a source 18

developed it is basically unsound to introduce another

agency into the relationship.

The developing agency

may have used techniques peculiar to its own organization

may have developed a relationship under varied cir-

cumstances, and when a new agency is introduced this

relationship with the source could be unfavorably disturbed.

CIA does not dispute the lact that informant and Agent

turnovers sometines are absolutely necessary.

CIA maintains that 11 the Bureau is given access

to a CIA source we would be responsible for the counter-

Intelligence aspects, but if the source produces foreign

intelligence CIA should be responsible for handling this

information, including the dissemination. CIA's position

is that it is better qualilied to evaluate the information

and correlate it with the loreign intelligence being

developed abroad. Ior example. if a Nigerian souxce oi CIA:

also available to the Bureau, furnishes infornation regarding

the Nigerian Foreign Office, CIA claims that 1t can better

handle the report and dissemination.

Discussions and agreements with CIA, including

the actions stemming from meetings with the representatives

of that

agency in November 1965, have resulted in a greatly

improved coordinating nachinery. There still are areas of

potential conflict which will necessitate improvement.

They are:

1) DOD personnel receives leads or tips pertaining

to possible access to soviet-bloc diplomats.

This CIA

Division pursues these leads and is inclined to take the

position that such individuals contacted by CIA are their

"CIA-controlled sources." It we permitted this to go on

over a period of time, CIA would have a vast network of

sources not directly available to the Bureau.

This is

basically unsound, and there is no reason CIA shouldn't

immediately give us the lead or tip for exploitation.

He can recognize that, depending upon circumstances, 1t

might be lavorable to us and CIA for the Agency to handle

a particular individual, and i1 so, it would be clearly

coordinated. This would be most important it the

individual in any way was connected with or associated

with an intelligence service.

2) DOD is ansious to have freedom to assess

and recruit bloc diplomais noù known to be engaged in

InteLligence activity.

On the suriace, this does not

appoi to prosent a problem, but realistically speaking

it is impossible for us to know that a soviet diplomat,

not known to be engaged in intelligence activity one

day, appears on the scene the following week as an agent

or coopted agent.

To give CiA wide latitude in this field

could create a truly undesirable mess. We believe that

1I CIA is permitted to move on such targets it should be

done on a selective basis and with maximum coordination.

3) CIA's organizational

and operational

deiiciencies, such as lack oi discipline, poor internal

coordination, unsatisfactory records, all, introduce head.

aches which undoubtedly will continue to exist for many

yeaI's.

4)

There continues to be an element of mistrust

and misunderstanding between the two organizations because

of the historical reasons described above..

5) Continuing lack of one agency's appreciation

Iox the other's objectives, responsibilities and operational

philosophy.

6) The absence of a clearly dexined Bureau policy

and objectives in the lield o1 foreign intelligence collec

tiON.

CIA really does not know the nature and the extent

of our interests, and consequently this lends to confusion

and misunderstanding.

According to same SAC letter, agreement had been reached

by the FBI and CIA whereby CIA vas allowed to contact American

This agreement was based strictly on

been located.

above "ground rules" were modified and expanded and

As result of conference with CIA in January, 1966, the

agreed upon by

both agencies early this year (Confirmed by letter to Admiral

Raborn 2/7/66). New ground rules in summary are as follows:

CIA will not iritiate investigation of any loreign

official in U.S.. without concurrence of FBI. (Comment: This is

essentially same as (a) in January, 1964, ground rules. Only

difference is that wording of this modification implies more

sympathetic FBI attitude towards any proposed CiA investigations.)

b. CIA will seek FBI concurrence before approaching for

recruitment any foreign official or communist bloc visitor in U.s.

FBI will concur if CIA action does not conflict with any FBI

operations. (Comment: This is similar to (b) and (c) ground rules

adopted in January, 1964, with two differences.

First, it drops

requirement that CIA clear with us before approaching a non-Soviet

visitor although it must still do so with regard to non-Soviet

officials.

Secondly, it specifically commits the FBI to concur if

proposed CIA action does not conflict with FBI operations.)

ground rules provided considerable latitude with regard to who

would handle CIA source in the U.S. and this has led to some

disagreements with CIA. The current ground rules clearly provide

for CIA to retain contact with its agents not only for training,

financing, etc., but also for "procurement of positive foreign

intelligence."

In addition,

they make it clear that the FBI should

not ask for direct access unless

there is a specilic internal

security need.)

4.

In addition to the above, there is one agreement we have

reached with CIA which is of possible relevance; namely, our recent

agreement relative to treatment of Soviet students in the U.s.

By way of background, there are a number of soviet exchange

students

currently attending various U.S. universities. Each student, of

course, is not only a possible soviet intelligence agent but

also

a potential source for the U.S: aiter he returns to his homeland.

Accordingly, both FBI and CIA have an interest in these students. .

Per

memo dated 1/14/64 we advised CIA via liaison on 1/20/64

that the Bureau would adopt following procedure relative to soviet

students here. FBI will take responsibility for collecting material

regarding each student on expedite basis,

CIA as developed. At logical point IBI will confer with CIA to

recruits Soviet student, wi will resolve whether we should turn

him over to CIA beiore he leaves U.S.

Under this procedure,

CIA

will not make any inquiries (through its sources in U.S.) unless

EFFECT ON THE FBI OF FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR COLLECTION

OF FOREIGN INTACCIGANCE IN THE UNITED STATES

1. Overt Colloction Activities

It is evident irom the National Security Act of

1917 and the succeeding National Security Council Intelligence

Directives as vell as

Central Intelligence thai Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

is charged with major responsibilities in the overt collection

ot foreign intelligence in the United States.

In pursuit of

this, CIA exploits non-governmental organizations and

individuals, foreign language publications and aliens. Although

CIA claims to have contacts with about 7, 200 oxganizations

and businesses as well as about 60,000 sources of information

as a result of its overt activities for this purpose, CIA

estimates it is reaching only 15 per cent of the foreign

intelligence information available in this country.

The question we must consider here is whether the

IBI should take over the overt collection of foreign intelligence

in the united states, therevy maing CIA uperationut only in

areas outside the limits of FBI's jurisdiction.

In this

connection, the following would have to be considered:

(a) Reporting:

The Bureau is a fact-finding agency which has

traditionally gathered evidence and presented its findings

Without bias or conclusions.

This would not change.

Intelligence developed by the FBI would be evaluated by the

users in the intelligence community.

Our report writing

format might have to be geared to the needs and established

procedures of the United States intelligence community.

(b) Coordination With Other Government Agencies:

Foreign intelligence is a commodity produced

for

Government.: Because of this, I the Bureau were to nave

full responsibility for the overt collection of foreign

intelligence in this country, wé would häve to greatly

not only for dissemination

purposes but to assure that we are kept fully informed

regarding. all matters dealina with intelligence priorities.

## Page 356

Our role in preparation of National Intelligence Estimates

would

be more active as a

result of our increased contribution

under this program. It might be necessary to utilize the

assistance of highly trained personnel of othor agencies

assist us poriodically On interviews dealing with complicated

military or scientific maiters.

(c) Manpower:

While no manpower requirements can be presently

estimated should we assume full responsibility for overt

foreign intelligence collection, CIA is currently using

approximately/140 employees throughout the United States to

interview individuals in connection with its overt intelligence

gathering activities, and is reaching what it estimates to be

only 15 per cent of available foreign intelligence information.

These 140 CIA employees do not include personnel required at

CIA Headquarters to correlate, evaluate and disseminate the

data gathered in the field.

We would want to more effectively

exploit this intelligence potential.

To merely handle the necessary review of the vast

• number of foreign language publications would require many

additional employees proficient in foreign languages

with backgrounds in scientific or technical fields.

(d) Selection and Training of Personnel:

To assume full responsibility for the overt

collection of foreign intelligence in this country, would

require that me vastly broaden our selection and training

procedures.

We would require applicants with degrees in

the sciences, languages, history, government and economics.

Our basic training and In-Service agenda would have to be

geared to meet our new responsibilities. We would undoubtedly

desire to utilize the services of outstanding lecturers irom

the agencies constituting our intelligence community, and in

turn, we would wish to afford our personnel training at the

War Colleges operated by the Department of Dejense,

and from

"time to time furnish them the opportunity of specialized

training. and briefings provided by the members of

the U.S.

• Intelligence. Board.

## Page 357

(e) Legislation:

CIA currently has the duty to correlate and evaluate

intelligence relating to the national security and to provide

for appropriate dissemination of such intelligence within the

Government.

This is set out in title 50, USC, Section 40va

The overt collection oi foreign intelligence is not the subject

of legislation but rather of National Security Council Intelligence

Directives which would have to be revised in order to give the

Bureau this authority now lodged with CIA.

(f) Organizational Changes:

To carry out a program committing the Bureau to

the full responsibility for the overt collecting of foreign

intelligence in this country would necessitate a substantial

increase to

the headquarters staifs of the Domestic Intelli

gence Division and the Laboracory Divison, as well to the.

personnel assigned to the New York and Washington Field Offices

where diplomatic establishments and international organizations

are mainly located

In all probability the creation of a new

division at the Seat of Government devoted entiroly to overt

collection responsibilities, would

be required.

(g) Observations:

The many responsibilities that would be ours under

a program making the Bureau accountable for the overt collection

Of all foreign intelligence in this country would (1) require

an enormous increase in our own personnel, trained in many

specialized fields, or (2) the delegation

of varied intelligence

functions to other

governmental agencies and close supervision

of such agencies to insure efficient execution of the tasks

levied upon them. These overt collection responsibilities

would undoubtedly be subject to the scrutiny of many sources,

some of them hostile, and we would have to face the charges,

unjust though they might be, that the Bureau had ceased to

perform the duties for which it was originally created and.

had developed into a gigantic bureaucratic octopus.

GENDRAL FINDINGS

The study conducted by the Committee has

produced the following significant rindings:

(1) There definitoly is a vast potential

for collection of loreign intelligenco in the U.S.

available through overt and clandestine channols.

Even with the available capabilities of existing

agencies, there is a large reservoir oi untapped

sources.

(2) CIA has been authorized by statuto

and implementing directives to collect foreign

intelligence in the U. S. through overt nethods and

has been involved in such coliection since the

establishment of the Agency.

This includes review

of foreign language press and interviews with

selected individuals such as American businessmen,

aliens, and students.

In aGGItIOn, CIA has established

an elaborate system of processing, storing, evaluating,

and disseminating this information.

:

(3)

such overi collection by CIA does not

present any threat or infringement on fBI jurisdiction

or operations.

The present Bureau controls foI such

CIA activity are satisiactory.

(1) We concluded that it would be highly

undesirable for the Bureau to become responsible for

overi collection of loreign intelligence in the U. s.

The necessary reorganization, expansion of facilities

and manpower, and beavy tast

or information collection

and processing could place a damaging burden on the

Bureau.

RECOIENDED PLAN OF ACTION

A penetrative and objective study of the

Bureau's position has led us to conclude that the Bureau

should play a nuch moro active and iniluontial r0le in

the clandestine colleccion of positive intelligence in the

United States.

We are recommending the implementation of

a plan which vill lead to a valuaalo contribution to our

national security elloit and concurrentLy wiLL Improve our

internal security capabilities. This plan presents 2

concept of an IBI as an Agency primacily responsible tox

Internal security, but supplementing its coverage with a

substantially expanded capability in the clandestine collec

tion oi positive intelligence. We believe that we have the

capability of developing this new look knowing that at the

same time we can institute a badly needed leadership to

elininate a gap in the acquirement of high-quality intelli

gence in the United States. The main leatures of this plan

• are:

1) Establishment of a list of loreign diplonatic

targets consistent with the needs of the Government.

2) Expansion of our technical surveillance

capabilities wich emphasis on nisurs.

3)

Expansion of live sources characterized with

selectivity and high-quality value.

4) The

FBI assuming a role of leadership in the

clandestire exploita' ion oi positive intelligence in the

U.S.,

and in so doing making maximum use of the talent and

capabilities of other appropriate U. s. Agencies.

Authorization

The plan would be implemented under proper executive

authorization (Presidential) and furthermore would be coordi

nated with the United States Intelligence Board (USIB). A

letcer from the President authorizing the Bureau to expand

its capabilities in clandestine positive intelligence collec

tion, consistent with the needs of the government, would

sullico.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding or conjusion

within the intelligence community; USIB would be apprised o1

the Presidential authorization.

The letter Iron the President

expressed in general torns.

This same authorization could.

be curther defined by the Presidont's Foreign Intelligence

Advisory Board.

It Is roalized that it would bo necossary to

discuss this plan with the President so that he fully under

siood the purpose, scope and the controlling leatures.

With

his approval.

the plan could also be discussod with cho

Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.

Selection of Targets

Priority on targets can be established by appli-

•cation of the following criteria:

1) Review of requests or requirements levied on

us by the President and U. S. Intelligence Agencies.

2)

Review of priority listed by the USIB. (Thia

is done on a regular basis.)

3) Our ova ananjoin and evaluation ni international

political developnents.

This primarily will be done ai soG,

but we should be so organized that the lield would be Ixee

to submit recommendations.

As of March, 1966, the following could be set

forth as a tentative list of priority targets in the United

States:

At the present time we are handling a very limited

number of installations. With existing capabilities, we

could virtually double our present technical coverage.

Once we have established reasonable priority listing,

is believed ve should systematically expand our operations.

In this connection, the following should be borne in mind:

1) Heavy emphasis should be placed on microphone

surveillances.

2) Today we are placing greater stress on

coverage of ollicial establishments.

The new program asks

jor an

expansion of coverage on individuals and/or residences

of individuals.

Here again selectivity will be a dominating

characteristic.

3) The program should be so flexible that we

would be able to deactivate any installation for security

reasons or for non-productivity and whenever possible employ

techniques which would permit easy reactivation.

4) Except ior curreni intelligence requiring

immediate dissemination, the product should be handled as

communications intelligence and dissemination would be

subjected to well-established Comint controls of the

National Security Agency (NSA) pius any additional restric-

tions the Bureau feli should be imposed.

5) The product would be transmitted to NSA by us

Ior dissemination within the intelligence community.

NSA

would be responsible for handling any needed translation.

We must recognize that the program will produce voluminous

information and the responsibility los processing the data

should be lixed with an

agency which is organized and

equipped to handle the job.

It is believed that if the

Bureau assuned this responsibility we would be burdened vith

a gigantic task of information processing to the point that

this elenent would adversely affect other phases of the

Il the information collected by us suggested

a potential los the developnent of an operation, i.e.

the bureau could assume complete controi

of this operation including the dissemination ot

information.

7) Our involvement in the "sophisticated"

category should be increasod by expanded rescarch and

development bearing in mind we should be utilizing the

most productive equipnent available.

The inportance of

this field cannot be exaggerated in light of the rapid

cevelopments in

the scientific world.

Technical Surveillance Controls

Under this plan ve could turnish the President

This could even

include an annual evaluation of the progran.

Anagram Program (Clandestine collection o1 cryptographic

material)

This has been one of the nore productive programs

handled by the Bureau throughout the years.

We definitely

believe that this program should continue and where feasible

we should accelerate.

The produce would continue to be

disseminated to NSA.

Live sources

The categosy of "live sources" when broadly inter-

preted includes every individual Iron the casual contact

to the controlled informant who is delivering high quality

information at an obvious risk. At the present time, our

sources in diplonatic establishuents are for the most part

Anerican citizens. This situation is largely due to az

undesirable arrangerent where ve must first obtain clearaice

producing the best results. In our opinion this can be

removed by the President's advising the Secretary of

State that the EBl is being authorized to develop

penetrations in foreign diplonatic establishments without

obialning clearances from State.

It would be understood

that the Bureau would proceed in a discreet and secure

manner.

Periodic contact with the

Secretary of State or

other top State officials to discuss gonoral dovolopments

and any potential problems will provido a mechanism for

healthy coordination vich state.

We recognize that a

source can turn "sour" and, thecerore,

there is the danger

of potential embarrassment.

However,

it should be noted

that our record in this regard has been outstanding over

the years.

Any eificient investigative agency needs sources

of all categories and we are no exception.

Therefore, we

should continue our present program of general source

developnent, and this would include contacts tho can

produce information on an occasional basis or who might

be in a position to be oî assistance in a particular

investization.

In diplonatic establishments the reception

clert, chaulfeur, the maid, can always be of assistance.

However, the prinary emphasis of this new program

would be

directed toward high quality sources, such as:

1) Code clerks

2) Officials tho have access to files, records,

or communications

3) Oliicials or employees who are in a position

to penetrate communist-bloc circles or establishments

4) Members of foreign intelligence and security

services.

Our existing progiams of seeking penetrations in

communist bloc installations naturally must continue but

will require an increased effort toward production of

information relating to personally dain, and tais saoula

be done on a larger aumber ji individual

targets.

We.

'ta.

realize that Bloe personnel does live in a lairly insulated

world, and elementary investigative. techniques do not produce

voluminous and highly significant data.

It is therefore

belleved that our techniques should become more sophisticated

through additional coverage on the residences of individuals.

Such efforts naturally fall in line with our intornal

security responsibilities, but the coverage may a1so

provide leads for development of-sources in the positive

intelligence field.

Evory soviet is not a member of KGB

or GRU, but ho novortholess could oiles information oi

value, and he could

be mosi useful on a long range basis.

Our program very definitely should have this philosophy

in mind, and it is an elenent which must be inpressed

upon our personnel in our training programs.

In this

regard, ve must recognize that at some point it may become

necessary to turn over recruited sources co another agency

such as CIA or one of the military services. Such turnover

will, of course, depend on the circunstances. The guiding

principle should be the preservation of the source under

the best security.

In the non-communist bloc field we would con-

centrate on developmeni of high-quality sources to meet the

priority needs of the Government.

Training o1 Personsel

At the present time, our personnel are доё property

oriented to efiectively engage in a program as reconnended.

TO

accommodate to a new approaci, it will be necessary to:

1) Include in our training classes lectures

which

will cover a more detailed picture o1 U.s. intelligence, its

history, delinition of terms, junctions of intelligence

agencies.

Include lectures regarding the loreign intel-

Ligence needs of the U. S. Goverament.

3) Use outstanding officials of other agencies to

lecture on special intelligence matters. This would include

the critical areas throughout the worla.

4) " Disseminate a bulletin" to the fiela on á

regular basis to emphasize zoreign intelligence needs as

they relate to our capabilitles.

5) Institute a special In-Service class (once

or twice per year which will concentrate on foreign

intelligence. This will be designed to develop the leaders

or the specialists in the field.

6) Arrango 20r attendance of selected /Bureau

personnel to schools of other agencies such as State

Depariment, CIA, and the military services.

7) Arrange for attendance of solocted personnel

at War Colleges.

8) Expand the training or Agents in the handling .

or technical survaillanco incicilations.

Reporting Procedures

This program will not require any basic departure

from our present reporting procedures.

The Bureau should

not become involved in evaluating, estimating, eic. We

should endeavor to adhere to our craditional position oi

reporting the facts as collected.

We may wish to give

consideration to adding one feature to our regular reporting

on individuals.

This could be an annex for "Personality

Data."

The objective would be to maintain an up-to-date

book on everything collected relating to the subject's

character, habits, Lamily li?a, interests, weaknesses:

etc.

Language Capabilities

An expanded program for collection of foreign

intelligence would require increased capability to handle

Loreign languages. As explained above,

the material

collected through technical surveillances should be handled

as communications intelligence, and the major translating

responsibility would, therefore, be placed

1 On NSA.

We do, however, recognize that it is necessary to

maintain a strong foreign language capability in the field

wherever it may be useful to develop live sources. In

offices such as New -ork City and Washington, D. C., we

should expand the number of Agents who are fluent in Irench,

Russian, Polish, Czech, German, Chinese, and Spanish.

Relations with Other Agencies

II this progran-is adopted, other intelligence

agencios would be officially apprisod ol tho Presidential

authorIty granied to the Isi to collect foreign intelligence

in the United States.

Other agencies would be informed

rogarding the nature and tho extont of the auchocity boing

delegated to the Bureau.

It would be necessary to make

clear that the Bureau was not assuming responsibility for

the clandestine collection or all foreign intelligence in

the United States, but we were taking a constructive step

in an effort to increase the production of loreign intel-

ligence through assets available to us.

He rould clearly

point out that the IBI was not taking

this approach as a

solution to all of the problems relating to foreign intel

ligence collection in this country.

We would emphasize

that we would move against targeis in line with established

priorities and

that we would do so on

. a selective basis.

We would have it understood that operational activities

would be properly coordinated wherever it was obviously

DeCeSSary.

With regard to the handling of the product of

technical surveillances, it rould be necessary to effect a

working agreement with NSA.

To do this we might be obliged

to discuss this at the USIB level so that NSA could obtain

the required authority to support the hiring of additional

personnel and purchase of equipment for the processing ot

ous product. Our arrangement

with NSA would include ground

rules for processing, translation, and classification and

dissemination.

Since any announcement that we were in the foreign

intelligence field would prompt unusual interest and very

likely queries, we should brier CIA regarding the objectives

of our progran.

Our plan vill not abrogate the existing

ground rules which permit ClA to assess and recrult positive

intelligence sources in this country under certain conditions.

Since both Agencies will have loreign intelligence sources

in che U.s., we undoubtedly will find it useful to work out

an agreement whoreby one Agency knows that the other has

coverage in a particular area or establishment.

We already

It would not be

necessary for us to identily our sources, but ve could.

us.

This would permit CIA to levy requirenents on

for example, It we recruited the third secrotary

of the French Embassy, CIA might wish to ask any number

of questions dealing with the french political situation.

I we folt that the request was zoasonable, we could

handle this through our source.

It will be noted that the proziam doos noc

preclude CIA Iron development of joreign intelligence

sources in the U.S. for fulfiliment of CIA responsibilities.

CiA will contique to operate under existing ground rules

which are designed to protect Bureau interests.

We believe that il the program is implemented

and jells we will be in a position to "spot" sources

required by CIA and other agencies to discharge their

responsibilities.

This would apply to cases where the

target was in the U. S. for a visit or il he had sone

specialized knowledge not related to our internal security

responsibilities.

These would be targets which other

agencies could handle without interfering with our operations

and without making us carry a load for another agency.

This particular concept should include a Bureau atticude

that any and every source handled by anuulei agedy in tau

U.s. potentially ca. be useful to us.

We should have an

outlook that all sources should be exploited to

the fullest

extent and under secure conditions.

If another agency has

a capability to open a door we should take advantage of the

situation.

In those instances where CIA has a source in the

United States, ve should prod that agency to seek information

of interest to the Bureau, and where obviously necessary

we

should arrange access to the CIA source.

The important

feature of this new concept is that we assume the role of

projecting initiative, leadership and aggressiveness. Our

position should be such that we push the other agencies to •

use their resources even to the point of healthy irritation.

We have looked at CIA as the "other agency" in

this picture, buy ve should not negleci. une potenizal oi

agencies such as ACSI, Air Force, ONI and state.

All of

them have entree to diplomatic circles.

The day-to-cay

contacts which officials of these agencies have with

personnol of foreign governments produce many "pieces" of

personallty data which, when added up over a period of

time,

can prove to be extremely useful. le should conier with

these agencies regarding ways and means oi recruiting

sources either to be handled by us jointly or by one of

the intelligence agencies.

here again, the Bureau can

bo tho cominant and pushing source.

It is believed that it we moved along the lines

described

above, the Bureau, over a poriod of time, vould

have collected

valuable information regarding numerous

personalities and the inner worisings of the many diplomatic

establishments.

The acquirement of data of this type

creates operatIonal strengta.

it places us in a position

to exploit the development of new sources, bearing in mind

that in planning our approaches we will be equipped wich

ammunition not gained through casual surveillances and

observations.

With

the knowledge that we gain, we can

plan high quality operations. It is interesting to

that during the past two years the information receivote

Isom CIA's sources in the United States has been fairly

voluminous and vezy definitely valuable. It is a good

illustration of the Bureau's gaining useful data from

another agency with a minimum of Bureau expense and ellori,

but still maintaining very effective control of our juris-

dictional rights.

Undoubtealy related to the utilization of other

agencies' resources is the considerably vast potential

offered by friendly foreign security services.

If the

services of Great Britain, Germany, France, Holland, Italy,

Australia and Canada

provided us information collected in

Washington, D. C. and New York resulting Irom contacts with

communist-bloc officials, we would have another valuable

source of information.

We should bear in mind thai we do

spend hundreds and thousands of man-hours seeking such

information through ocher diliicult channels.

We should utilize the iriendly liaison services

along the lines described above.

Administrative Reorganization

competency to outline any specific administrative se

organization and propose what personuel, equipment and

facilities would be needed.

We feel that this could be

best handled only aiter the objectives of the program are

approved.

At that point, officials iron the Seat of

Government and the field

could meet to map out the necessary

reorganization.

The extent of reorganization will hinge on

our decision as to the pace we should set.

We recommend

that ve proceed ai a steady, even pace, making certain thât

we lay solid groundwork fos

all of our

activity. We should

refrain iron becoming involved in a "crash" program uniess

national security interests obviously warrant such an

approach.

In connection with any planning for reorganization,

it would be unwise to proceed wichout first obtaining a

reliable inventory of our current resources.

Such an

inventory would encompass the following: (1) The number

of Agents currently assigned to strictly positive intel

ligence collection; (2)

Our foreign language capabilities;

(3) Our current sources. and informants with an objective

assessmen of capabilities; (4) Number of supervisors at

the Seat of Government currently handling positive intel.

ligence matters.

In connection with any plans for reorganization,

we should not neglect to give consideration to the problems

which we lit encounter as time goes on in the areas of

information storage and retrieval. We, therefore, saould

realize that it vould be unwise to exclude research or

study regarding the computerizing. of information.

ALTERNATIVES

In addition to the recommended plan set forth in

preceding sections, there are several

alternative courses

of action we might take:

• *:

1.

We could take the position, and seek ways to implement

it, that the entire field of foreign intelligence collection

in the U.S., both overt and covest, should be handled by

tho IBI.

such an across-tho-board approach would exclude

CIA and other U. S: agencies from foreign intelligence

collection in this

country and would place exclusive

responsibility and jurisdiction in this field on the Fbi.

As indicated in Section I, this would require a revanping

of. existing legislation and directives and would necessitate

arastic changes in the Bureau's operations, including major

increases: in personnel and costs and a substantial expansion

in ous recruitment

and training programs, and other reorganiza-

tion. We do not feel this approach is warranted nor do we

believe it would be a practical and sound one.

heavy and fixed respons-bilities which in many cases would

be completely divorced ison the Bureau's internal security

and counterintelligence interests.

Second, we would become

to a large extent a service group

for other U.S. agencies

and departments (including CiA, state, the military and others)

in the handling of a host of foreign intelligence requirements

levied by other agencies.

This would involve a considerable

commitment of manpower,

conmunication costs, etc. on the part

of the Bureau. In addition, such an approach would necessitate

significant changes in our recruitment and training procedures

and vould also place on our shoulders a definite accountability

in connection with any failures in U.S. intelligence foreign

collection.

It is not ' alieved that this approach is. as sound

os desirable as our recommended plan of action: namely, that

we expand our foreign intelligence collection eiforts bui on

a.selective basis.and without our assumias. 7u17 responsibility

3. We could

endeavor to work out a division of

responsibility and work in this area hereby the Buseau

and CIA

would each have certain primary areas of operation.

For example, the EBI could make known its willingness to

contribute more heavily in support of U.S. foreign intelligence

collection efforts and propose this field be broken into

to categories; namely, technical coverage (this would include

Anagrati operations) and live informant development among

ZOIOLEN dipLOmatS.

We could proposo thai the rBi continuo

to operate exclusively in the first category (technical

coverage) with CIA continuing to stay entirely out of this

Izora.

CIA to handle technical

by reason of our long experience and expertise in this area.

With regard to the second category (live sources)

we could propose that CIA conduct no operations involving

countries where the Bureau's counterintelligence interests

are paramount or significant.

This would include the Sino-

soviet bloc countries and could aiso include certain other

countries, such as the Doninican Republic, where we have

"already developed strong capabilities or where there are

unique factors.

With regard to other countries (aun Sluù), ve

could propose that CIA should assume primary responsibility

for developing live diplomatic sources.

However, this

would be with the clear proviso that, in the event the FBI

should develop significant internal secusity interests, we

would have the precogative of levying requirements on CIA

sources, having direct

access to CIA sources when needed,

as a

final step, developing our own sources ii CIa could

not satisily our

needs.

This alternative plan would not involve as much

manpower or other expense to the Bureau as our recommended

plan.

However, it would involve our approval of CIA opera-

tions in the live informant field and would risk CIA infring

ing on FBI interests. It is our consensus that this

approach

not be adopted.

4. We could recommend that the FBI could withdraw

entirely from the field of covest foreign inteligence collection

• allowing CIA to nandle all aspects, including Anagran opera-

tions and both live and technical coverage.

We are strongly

opposed to such an approach on the grounds

that it would

drastically diminish the IBi's sole in the intelligence

community, would give CiA carte blanche to operate in the

U.S., and in many instances vould certainly result in CIAs

compronising on internal security and counterintelligence

operations.

Finally, ve could take no action to change the

current situation and, in effect, adopi a "status quo"

approach.

We are opposed to this. As indicated in this

study, U. S. Government needs for foreign intelligence

are growing on an almosi daily basis and CIA has made

delinite extorts to move more activoly into this tiela.

Il we were to adopt a

a question of time until this matter comes to a head:

when this occurs

the decision as to the IBI's role would,

of course, be subject to the thinking and aims of peoplo

outside the IBI, possibly including individuals who are
