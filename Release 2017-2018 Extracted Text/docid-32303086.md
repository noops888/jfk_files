B. ORGANIZATIONAL SETUP AND LEADERSHIP

During general investigations into criminal type matters

and from general public sources, the name SEBASTIAN JOHN

LA ROCCA, commonly known as JOHN LA ROCCA, of Pittsburgh,

has frequently been mentioned as synonomous with the

Pittsburgh area leader of the Maria. Pa: Ohio

On May 11, 1953, during an interview with JOHN LA ROCCA

in connection with an official matter, the subject of

the Mafia came up and LA ROCCA advised SA JOHN S. PORTELLA

as follows:

He denied current or past existence in the United States

of any organization known as the Black Hand or Mafia.

He said Sicilians who had come to the United States had

congregated in certain communities in the same fashion as

had Irish and other nationality groups, because of similarities

of interests and backgrounds.

These communities had

naturally given rise to social, fraternal and civic groups

and members of such groups as a matter of course assisted

other members who were in ay sort of trouble.

The tactics

used in some instances to achieve the ends desired by some

of these groups were not always according to the letter of the

law, but they were generally more effective. In any group

there are those who refuse to work for a living and sometimes

resort to extorting a livelihood from anyone who could be

frightened or terrorized.

In an Italian community these

few would naturally be referred to as the Black Hand or

Mafia because of the history of similar activities on the

part of the Mafia in Sicily.

During this conference GIANNI became angry with ROSA and

told him to "get out, you are througn.

ROSA left the room

and about a week later GIANNI was shot to death.

TONY RIPEPI

On January 3, 1958, PGIT-Iradvised that he has known TONY

RIPEPI for about 45 years and associated with him closely

until about 1950:

During a discussion of the GARROW-EVANS murder in Pittsburgh

in 1926, PG I-I commented that he did not have specific

information which would link TONY RIPEPI with the GARROW and

EVANS murder but. commented that he did not want to discuss

this matter adding,

"If word gets back to TONY that I have

talked to you, he will have my place blown up, and that I

don't want."

On January 20, 1958, PG I.-2, who has furnished reliable

information in the past,,advised. that

in about 1932, TONY

RIPEPI, DOMINICK ANZALONE and CHARLES ZIMMARO of Monasse, F

Pa.,

the latter an associate of RIPEPI, who was involved in the

numbers games, started thethe numbers business in a poolroom

believed to have been leased by ZIMMARO. at Monessen.

informant said that ANZALONE and RIPEPI wanted him, informant,

to use his influence to secure control of the numbers operations

in Washington County, Pa,, which at that time were being

operated by HARRY MILLER of Donora, Pa.

PG .T-2 said that he talked to. TOM WHITE, who was then Chief

of Police in California, Pa., and also ROBERT COWELL, deceased,

of around Roscoe, Pa., but that

individuals refused to allow ANZALONE and RIPEPI to operate

the numbers in Washington County. PG T-2 said that WHITE and

COWELL told him that HARRY MILLER was treating them all right

and that they had no intention of permitting anyone else to

operate numbers in Washington County.

Informant. stated that

he told this to TONY RIPEPI and RIPEPI said something to the

effect that "we will bump MILLER off and bomb FRANKIE PROTON'S

house in order to get control of the numbers.

Informant

explained that PROTON, who is deceased, worked for MILLER at

that time.

PG 94-363

The informant said that after RIPEPI told him about "bumping

MILLER off" he decided he did not want any further association

with RIPEPI or ANZALONE and he gradually broke away from

this association. He stated that to his knowledge, neither

RIPEPI nor ANZALONE took any physical action against MILLER

or PROTON; however, RIPEPI and ANZALONE eventually gained

control of the numbers racket in Washington County, forcing

MILLER out.

During the investigation of TONY RIPEPI in 1958, the following

sources were specifically questioned for information which

they might have relating to the so-called Mafia, syndicate or

organized crime in which RIPEPI and ANZALONE were associated.

a member' or connected with a state or nationwide syndicate

He said that in

spite of all these statements he knew that the FBI and other

governmental agencies would not believe him; however,
