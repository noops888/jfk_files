DETAILS:

AT CLEVELAND, OHIO:

PROSECUTIVE POSSIBILITIES

As previously reported FRANK J. KIERNAN, Special

Attorney, Department of Justice, advised that the Internal

Revenue Service (IRS) had obtained information that TRISCARO

received income during 1960 which the IRS believed would not

be reported by TRISCARO on his 1960 Income Tax Return.

Mr. KIERNAN had expressed the view that in view of the IRS

investigation it might be adviseable to hold in abeyance any

investigation into the financial affairs of TRISCARO until

IRS had definitely resolved its potential case.

As reported, Mr. KIERNAN advised on May 16, 1961,

that he had been informed by ELDON MYERS, Chief, Intelligence

Unit, Cleveland, that the Income Tax Return of TRISCARO had

been located, indicating that TRISCARO may have been

permitted to file a delayed return or that the return had

been filed but not yet processed. At that time Mr. KIERNAN

expressed the view he did not feel that the matter should be

held in abeyance indefinitely and that if the IRS matter is

not resolved in the near future any additional investigation

which might uncover violations of Federal law on the part of

TRISCARO should be pursued.

Mr. KIERNAN advised on June 26, 1961, that as yet

IRS had not located the 1960 Income Tax Return of TRISCARO

and due to this, it had not been established whether or not

TRISCARO had failed to declare certain income received dur-

ing the fiscal year 1960. Mr. KIERNAN suggested that inves-

tigation by the FBI of any potentially productive leads

should be pursued as the status of the IRs is still indefinite.

On July 14, 1961, Mr. KIERNAN stated that the IRS

investigation of TRISCARO concerned principally certain checks

on which TRISCARO's endorsement appears.

One of these is a

$10,000 check dated August 21, 1959, drawn on the account of

Servicios Internacionales, S. A., D. BARTONE, President, at
