(P)

PH 614-C-TE furnished following information re

activities. 6/26/63.

Bookkeeper at John's Vending Company, ANTHONY (LNU),

who is reported to be HARRY RICCOBENE's representative in

the business, discussed results of most recent meeting Pennsyl-

vania State

Pardons Board.

ANTHONY said (Attorney General

EUGENE) ALESSANDRONI and Judge BLACK (probably GENEVIEVE BLATT,

Secretary Internal Affairs) voted against commutation. BRUNO

said ALESSANDRONI 1S a,

"bad man" (cannot be reached), and

BRUNO's contact man died.

In past, BRUNO has used MITCHELL

COHEN, who died suddenly 6/22 as contact man in various fixes.

BRUNO then attempted to reach AL SCHWARTZ, a bail bondsman with

whom he has previously dealt. BRUNO also indicated possibillty

of using Philadelphia City Councilman EMMANUEL WEINBERG, but

the person who contacts him tried to borrow $1500 from BRUNO

and If BRUNO asks favor, he will have to make the loan.

BRUNO has been called to INS, possibly in connection

with his recent reentry to United States from Dominican Republic

when he had forgotten his wife's passports, as reported 6/24

by PH 591-C*.
