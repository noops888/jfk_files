MENURANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Subject was mat at the Hotel Dupont Flaza from 0930 to

2525 0n.15 Jure 1961.

Most of the convers√°tion at this l'irat meting centered

on deoriefing 2

staytonind not, propaganda effectiveness and,

primarily, MiRE)s oin future:

3.

Propaganda, Suuject stated that the fish symbol appears

everywhere.

He has seen the symbol in elevators, public buildings,

publle tollets, bus ard train depots, park benches, ete.

remark that,. "You were always conscious of tren despite the fact

that in most places they were taken down immedintoly," Is quite

Indicative

of the side distribution and use of the symbol. Most

of the symbols that he saw were in chalk

rather than the blue

stamp.

Subject believes most people thougrt the fish to be a

Christian g mbol rather than a counter revolutionary one.

Subtect had seen many elandastand resepapers. leatlets, and

panchlets even up untit the last moment of nia departure.

He

l1sted Avarce, Roscato, Prensa Libre, Bohemia Liore and la Marina

as periodicals he had seen.

He saw them in private homes (nost

of the homes he visitad were counter revolutionary). Most of ine.

copies were quite boat up, " Iridicating to him that they had been

passed from nand .to hand.

In his opinion, people treasures the

copies that they had..

Ho cited the case of one cirl who carried

coples in her handoad to snow to other girla in her office.

Luoject's

only criticism of the periodicals was that at times they becane a

little too flowery.

In his words, "Inere were too many adjectives."

He thought that a more direct approach would bo nore effoctive.

He clains that everyoody listens to Radio Swan out nobody

belleves 1t.

He mentioned one Swan broadcast which announced trat

bodies were ljing all over the Malecon and routing in the sur..

Listeners went to vlew this and found that there were no oodis

thore.

Voice of America 18 listened to and 13 quite highly regarded.

Susject cited two otner oroadcasts that he considers corter

revolutionary and wnich ere well thought of; ong oririnates from

sen lork and one fron Key lest.

to Miami when conditions are right. I asked wny peonle continug to

listen to Swan if it is so discredited.

1t is not belleved, it 1s still a contact with the outside world.

indivinual procrans.. Che militia man renarked, "If we don't dieten

to those broadcasts, how will we know what the imperialleta are

thinking?"

I asked about Amaricans in prison. Subject new of only BINAIRIS

and himself.

de clained that, although prison conditions were horrible

during his slay there because of lnck of adequate food ind sanflation

facilities, the prisoners wore not physically abused.

with the Intelligence usiness and wishes to continue with us' and

establish a career. He desires some foral. training. I agreed that.

he should get training and said

that, whilo he is on vacation, we would.

try to set up some courses for him.

Subject would like to have. a

contragt with us: he fears that his next aslennent might be for only

& short time and

that he will be cut loose when it is completod.

Altiough we did not discuss it, he evirently had in mind career

agent status.

I am not aware of Agency policy on assigning agents

this status, but I bellove that we hive a real asset in Milland

that consideration should be given to making him a career agent.

Subject's 201 shows an individual with a bactground voth of intelligence

experience that would indicate an assignnent in any Latin American

country. In addition, he has demonatrated a natural bent for the .

Intelligence cusiness.' Although his responsibility was not as wreat

as that of AIRYE, he nevertheless contrivuled very greatly in

establisment of the staybehind not, working lone hours under nost

trying circunstances. His concept of tradecraft is remarkable for
