JOHN GIRGENTI, the son of "JOE the Gent," both

of whom are from Camden, New Jersey, fronted for

ANGELO

BRUNO in the luncheonette business.

It was said that

JOHN GIRGENTI, after the Korean War, was in financial

difficulties, contacted ANGELO BRUNO, and BRUNO thereafter

put JOHN GIRGENTI to work in BRUNO's numbers office as a

representative of ANGELO BRUNO. JOHN also during this

period was working at the Poquessing Club, 1955 to 1959,

as a manager, operating the club at night

and working in

BRUNO's numbers house during the day.

The Poquessing Club

was a club originally chartered in the Holmesburg area

of Philadelphia but was moved to center city Philadelphia

where "Iittle JOHNNY" (a dwarf who formerly appeared in

commercials as a bellboy for Phillip Morris cigarettes,

ana MARIO MAGGIO were the proprietors of the club. During

this period of time, 1955 to 1959, JOHN GIRGENTI used to

In the largest bills (denominations) he has.

Informant

said an additional call was received from a person unknown

to the informant who wanted to know,

"Where shall I

deliver the cigarettes?

At clubhouse one or clubhouse,

two?"

There was some delay in the reply by BRUNO and the

party said, "Nevermind, I will pick them up." This

language,

according to

the informant, was used to camou-

flage their conversation when in reality the caller was

telling BRUNO when he said he would pick them up that he,

the caller, would stop by and rendezvous with BRUNO at the

Penn Jersey Vending Company.

It was further explained

that clubhouse one and clubhouse two are references to

saloons operated by BRUNO's associate DOMINICK COLLOZI,

2503 South Garnet Street, Philadelphia If These bars or

taverns are located at Chadwick and Moore Streets and

17th and Wolf Streets, Philadelphia.

It was the informant's

opinion, based on the above incident, that ANGELO BRUNO

has a depository of money in PHIL TESTA's house which money

1s accrued from BRUNO's illegal operations in numbers.

By separate communication, information furnished

by T-3' showed that ANGELO BRUNO at the present time had all

of his numbers activity handled by PHILIP TESTA.

said that BRUNO

stated that he declined new numbers business.

whereby this person

operated and issued insurance covering land travel. These

machines were explained to operate in a similar fashion

to those at airports that dispense insurance for air travel.

who had the authority to place this machine.
