Antonio CUESTA came to the U.S. from Cuba on 31 May 1960

as a refugee.

According

to his 201 file, he has had the following

U.S. Government association:

As of February 1961 he was cited as a crewman

aboard the M/V TEJANA.

A POA was requested on

15 March

1961 for his use in PM maritime

ops as a crewman

on the

vessel TEJANA under Project JMATE.

Due to cessation of

MATE activities, processing of the clearance was sus-.

ended on l' May 1961 until ne. interest was apparent.

JMNAVE Station advised the Army of ClA operational inter-

est in CUESTA on 26 May 1962.

JWAVE advised Headquarters

on $ June 1962 that CUESTA was not then being used and

There is

no jested ton in pertinent mariene intes or his zoi file

that he was ever used on an oucrational mission by CIA.

From the time he came to the U.S. in 1960 until he was ar-

rested by the Cuban Government, CUESTA was associated with the MRR,

UR, Alpha 66 and Commando L organizations.

The hit and run raids made

by these groups were well-known to all government agencies and, in

fact,

openly known in Miami because of the propensity of the Cubans

to talk.

There were a number of discussions at the highest level

(President) concerning what should be done about such raids.

They

were not sponsored by or connected with the U.S. Government.

Two

of these unauthorized raids are the ones referred to (attempts 21

and 22) in the article attached to Mrs. CUESTA's letter.

visit

with her husband.

In June 1967 the FBI advised

JMWAVE Station that she was recruited by the CUIS while

in Cuba and to hold this knowledge to a minimum because

they intended to operate her as a double agent.

She

said the pitch was made on behalf of the DSE and would

benefit both her and her husband.

She was told if she

successfully reported on anti-Castro activities in Miami,

especially Commando I activities,

for a period of six

months, they would release her husband from custody and

after

three years of reporting pernit him to leave Cuba.

This case was coordinated with the FBI representative,

via Ops Liaison, on 12 September who asked that we hold up

а те.

sponse to her letter until he could check out the status uf the case.

tional interest in Mrs: CUESTA was terminated circa December 1974
