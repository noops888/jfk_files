ATTENTION

SUBJECT

: Transmittal of OTS Files for Permanent

Retention by OLC

During the recent records review conducted by the

Office of Technical Service at

OTS surfaced 4

files that pertain to Lee Harvey

Oswald.

These files were

not found during any previous OTS searches because they

were filed by "Case Number", not by name. These files are

no longer needed by OTS, and they are being turned over to

the Office of Legislative Counsel for their permanent re-

tention. The files in question have been reviewed by Mr.

of the Office of General Counsel and they are

transmitted herewith as attachments to Form 141c.
