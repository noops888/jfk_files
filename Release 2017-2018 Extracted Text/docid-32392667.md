MEMORANDUM FOR: FI/OPS-Projects Branch

SUBJECT

Justification for Automobiles under Project LIEMPTY

It ie requested that the Mexico City Station be authorised to

purchase three used sedans for use by the LIMPTY surveillance team. The

Station plans to expand the LIMPTY survoillance team into a larger, well-

trained physical surveillance asset. They will need three automobiles.

Private automobiles or comercial transportation will not be satisfactory

since the cars must

be outfitted with two-way radios.

20.

Authority is also requested to purchase a panel truck to be used

In the LINTUP operation under this Project which mounts mobile photo-

graphic surveillances.

3o. "It is also requested that

a quasi-personal car be authorized for

Oliver G. Scantling (ps). Scantling is' an indigonous agent under oral

contract. A car is a prerequisite for his work for KUBARK which includes

casings, surveillances, and investigations. Because of the sensitive

nature of his work, and the heavy use made of the car, the Station has

decided that Scantling should be furnished a QP car.

40.

LIBIPTY agents were formerly carried under the LIJERSHY and

LIPSTICK: Projects.

The vehicles used by the LIMPlY agents under these

other Projects will be disposed of and now ones will be purchased after

the above TVA has been approved. The vehioles which will be replaced

are MV 2146, MV 2147, MV 2138, and UV 2042, One of the surveillance

cars will be new and will not replace an old core It was decided that

these vehicles should be replaced rather than transferred to the LIEMPTY

Project for security reasons and because of the age of the automobiles.

The sutomobiles are 1951 and 1952 models and have been used for sensitive

surveillance work for over two years.

The panol truck which was used in

the LIENIRAP Operation under the LIPSTICK Project has been operating for

two years in all parts of the city and has becone a security threat.

The

fact that the LIPSTICK surveillance team knows that the truck exists,

even to the point that one of the team members is the listed owner of the

truck, also dictates replacement of this vehicle.
