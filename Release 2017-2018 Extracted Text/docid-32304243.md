The enclosed letterhead memorandum is being classified

so classified.(&)

$(U)

Buairtel dated 8/16/67, requested Miami to check its

indices concerning two additional Cubans who were displayed at

a news conference in Havana and to furnish any pertinent infor-

mation in a memorandum suitable for dissemination.

Miami indices reflect that the Bureau sent a letter

to the Director of CIA, dated 10/8/65, regarding DANIEL RAUL

GARCIA CAZANAS,

wherein the Bureau stated that no record had

-been located at the Bureau concerning this individual and the

Bureau interposed no objection to CIA contact with GARCIA to

obtain foreign positive intelligence. (Su)

The Miami office also received an inquiry from CIA

locally concerning any derogatory information On ANIBAD, GARCIA. (e)U)

Accordingly, a check was made with CIA locally

on 8/23/67, AUSTIN HORN, CIA covert, Miami, advised that both

of these individuals were of operational interest to CIA and

were captured while on a CIA mission in Cuba. Accordingly,

no mention of these individuals is being made in the

enclosed

letterhead memorandum.

CESFINENMAL

Based on the information developed to date,

there

appears to be some indication that this operation was developed

and brought to a head by the efforts of PLACIDO HERNANDEZ.

Considering the manner in which the Cuban Government was able

to capitalize on the incident from a propaganda standpoint at

a particularly opportune moment during the OLAS conference in

Havana, it is reasonable to suspect that HERNANDEZ delivered

these men to the Cuban Government just in time to stage a "show""

for the OLAS conference.

It is further noted that HERNANDEZ

reportedly was wounded while resisting capture and did not

participate in the interview with the other four prisoners.

It is noted that ARMANDO MONNAR, who was at the meeting

in New York City on 5/15/66, to organize LA REUNION DEL PUEBLO

CUBANO, 1s very likely identical with ARMANDO MONNAR, who arrived

United States in November, 1961, and was identified as

a Cuban G-2 agent.

It is also noteworthy that MONNAR appeared

to have been a member of the same Cuban intelligence agency as

PLACIDO HERNANDEZ and at the same time.

With regard to ANTONIO LOPEZ OLARRIAGA, also in atten-

dance at the May, 1966, meeting in New York City, as well as

being involved with PLACIDO HERNANDEZ in his activities in Miami,

it is noted that he is under investigation by the Federal Bureau

of Narcotics in connection with a narcotics operation. LOPEZ

is alsó described' as a Castro sympathizer and is a friend of

BORIS RODRIGUEZ SORIA (Bufile 115-639). The Miami file in this

matter Indicates that interview of LOPEZ could jeopardize this

investigation, and accordingly a lead to interview him is not

being set out

at this time.
