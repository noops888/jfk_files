Title: John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: Las Vegas is requested to forward the document listed

below to the JFK Task Force as soon as possible due to an

extremely short deadline.

Enclosure: Copy of pages from requested serial.

Details:

Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full. Therefore, the serial will not be returned to Las Vegas.

Since the original will be sent to the NARA, a copy of

the serial should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ.

The serial should be received at FBIHQ no later than

C.O.B. 08/13/98.

Attached is a copy of the requested document. It was

located in a copy of Las Vegas file No. 92-308-Sub 2, following

serial 73. The raw file is at Headquarters in the possession of

the JFK Task Force. The original of this page is not located in

the raw file.

The document is a handwritten ELSUR record. It is

undated and reflects no file or serial number.

The ELSUR subject

appears to be Phyllis Maguire.

Because of the location of the

copy, the JFK Task Force requests that Las Vegas conduct a search

for the original of this document and reply by EC regarding

whether the original can be located.

Please ship the serial, if it is located, to FBIHQ, JFK

Task Force, Attention Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.
