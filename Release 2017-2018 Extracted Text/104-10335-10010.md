Re: Response to CIA-12

The following is responsive to ARRB Request CIA-12.

The

Agency has made a thorough search of its files

systems in an attempt to find files on the individuals noted

in referent request, namely, Ron Cross, Doug Gumpton, Bart

Henry, and Ted Shackley, particularly

as their Agency

employment/association related to their service with JWAVE.

The following files were located and have been reviewed, or

made available for review, by ARRB staff:

a.

Cross, Ron -- An Office of Personnel Security

file was found but, with research, it was determined that

the subject of the

file was not the Ron Cross sought by the

search.

b.

Henry, Bart -- No files were found on "Bart

Henry," which apppears to be an alias or pseudonym. Also,

no information was found to the name being registered as an

alias or pseudonym.

Gumpton, Doug -- Gumpton is an alias which was

used by retired Agency employee William M. Kent;

Kent's

personnel file

is in

the JFK microfilm; the search found

both his official Office of Personnel and Office of Security

files.

d. Sanchez Morales, David -- Subject's Personel and

Security files are located within the JFK collection at JFK

Box 244, Folder 23

and microfilm (box 64) Box 57, Folder 11

respectively.

e. Shackley, Theodore G. Jr. -- Subject's official

Office of Personnel file; employee payroll file; official

Retirement file; and, Office of Security file were located.

REFERENCE:

Shackley, Cross, Henry, Gupton (CIA-IR-12) DA/IRO No. 12

Bonnie:

This is with respect to your 26 February 1998 note wherein you asked that we check HRM for personnel files on Ron Cross, Bart

Henry and William Morris Kent. In an effort to bring the status of this particular tasking (CIA-IR-12) up-to-date, I provide the following:

My records show that on 18 July 1997 Barry requested that we conduct file searches on Ted Shackley, Ron Cross, Bart Henry and

Doug Gupton. We were advised by Barry, and as outlined in a 22 May 1996 letter from ARRB to John Pereira, that Cross, Henry and

Gupton are pseudonyms used by CIA personnel who testified to the HSCA.

Notwithstanding, we tasked OPS and HRM to conduct searches on these individuals in an effort to locate files. On 22 December 1996,

I advised Barry that HAM had located files on Ted Shackley and would provide them to Barry via this office once they arrived from RC. It

is my understanding that Becky gave you the OPF yesterday. HRM advsied further that they had attempted to locate files on Cross,

Henry and Gupton but failed to locate any files on these individuals in light of the fact that only the pseudos had been provided. We

further advised that if in the future you have access to the true names, we will glady search again.

On 23 December 1997, I advised Barry that QPS had located files on •Ted Shackle/PResClass and ReGupton and that the files were

in OPS for review. They were unable to locate a record on Bart Henry Itis my understanding that you have not reviewed these files to

date but are in the process of making assangements torto so. I

Conducted the search back in July and I am certain that

she will be glad to you in this matter (40000).

cAlt

And lastly, I have no record of ever having received a request to search on William: Morris Kent. Accordingly, I will request OPS and

HRM to do so.

Please let me know if I have misinterpreted the status of this request. Thank you. Frieda

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CIA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CLA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete •

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December, 1995. CLA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CIA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.

CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LB] Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.
