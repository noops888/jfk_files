the Chicago Office for a number of years as the Bureau

is aware, and undoubtedly had this individual's informant

status become known to the underworld, his effectiveness

would have long since ceased.

VITO NITTI is the subject of a case involving

counterfeit series E bonds and Bank of America Express

Checks.

In connection with this charge, NITTI surrendered

"himself to the United States Marshal's Office, Chicago;

however, he subsequently refused to furnish any information

to Chicago FBI Agents in regard to the counterfeit matter

or other criminal matters.

No informant or confidential source of the

Chicago Office has ever furnished information indicating

that information provided by FBI informants or sources

are available to the hoodlum element.

To the contrary,

sources have advised that hoodlums in Chicago

have taken

for granted that they "cannot get to the FBI."

As the Bureau is

aware, an incident occurred

during the past month whereby a United States Secret

Service Agent named ABRAHAM BOLDEN was charged with

attempting to sell a Secret Service report to a minor

hoodlum for $50,000. The incident received a great deal

of publicity and the bribery was

referred to in some

newspaper accounts as involving "Government Reports"

In regard to this publicity, this is a possibility for

the above allegation.
