CONFIDENTTAL INFORMANTS

One "I symbol" has been assigned to each CI, PCI or other

source required to be concealed, throughout the course of reporting

instant investigation.

Thus, Iol or 1-21 in early reports is the

same individual. as T-] or T-21 in any later report.

This system was

adopted before the current regulation requiring that informants in

each office territory be identified with the name of that office

preceding the symbol number.

In view of the large number of T

informants in this Investigation (131) and to avoid confusion in

review, it being noted that in each report only a portion of all

the informants are mentioned, no change-over has been made and all

the informants continue to carry the designation Albany I-1, etc.,

instead of New York T-10, Los Angeles T-5 and so on.

The identitisof I symbol informants in the enclosed report

are as follows:
