in June, 1963, he received a long distance telephone call from

DOLAN who stated that he was calling from the state of New

Jersey, but furnished no other information as to his whereabouts.

DOLAN told the informant that he and some of his associates

that and someon

whom he did not identify, were having a "beef" with ROBERT

PIERRE FETONTE,

FBI #459907 and that

as soon as

they found

FETONTI "it would be the end of him"

DOLAN attempted to secure from DN 249C the current

address of FETONFI, but the informant told DOLAN that he had not

seen FETONTI for two years and knew nothing concerning his

whereabouts.

Informant stated that DOLAN furnished no more

specific details to him, but he

got the impression that DolA

He stated the

call was prepaid and undoubtedly DOLAN used either a fictitious

telephone credit card number or a telephone upper housing key to

make

the call since DOLAN considerably used these methods to

make long distance calls without paying for them.
