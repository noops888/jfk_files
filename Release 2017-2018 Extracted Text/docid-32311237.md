WALTER WILSON JENKINS

SIL

TROHAN

wr 1409-s#/on 10/16/64, learned

that WALTER

while at the Mexican embassy

discussed with RuSs (ph) a story which he, TROHAN, had

written concerning Secret Service action with respeot

to the FBI record of JENKINS' arrest.

The discussion

was prompted by a report received by

RUSS to the effect

that the New York Times will publish an account which differs

with that reported by TROHAN.

The Times, according to RUSS, will pay that the

Secret Service admitted they did not send on to the White

House the arrest of JENKINS because they did not think

It was important.

For that reason, he wanted to know

whether any change was necessary in TROHAN's account.

CONT

TRONAN, in reply,

stated RUSS could tell them that ROWLEY,

& great friend of his, told him as a routine matter it was

sent there, it could be assumed it was sent there if it

concerned the President or Vice President of the U.S.

However, TROHAN continued,

"they wouldn't say that

the record, nor when the investigation comes through, being

under the control of the President are they going to put

the heat under the White House.

Last week, ROWLEY wrote a noted to TROHAN ThankIng him

the column defending the Secret Service after the Warren!

Consequently, he would

tell TROHAN the truth but

cannot on the record.
