February 16, 1995

Dear Mr. Rumig:

on 10/26/92, President George Bush signed "The John

F.

Kennedy (JFK) Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992."

This Act requires that Government records related to the

assassination of President Kennedy be sent to the National

Archives for public release.

It was passed because of the

renewed public interest in the release of all JFK records and it

facilitates the release

of information normally exempt from

disclosure under Executive Order and/or the Freedom of

Information Act (FOIA).

While the Act contemplates maximum disclosure of JFK

records, information can be withheld if certain requirements are

met.

Withholding information

is referred to as "postponement"

because the Act provides that in 25 years, all information must

be released unless the President of the United States certifies

that particular information should never be released. Attached

is a copy of the Act which specifies the bases for any

postponements and describes the Review Board which will determine

the validity of such postponements claimed for, JFK assassination

records.

The FBI has established a task force

62-40-1029205-941

the JFK assassination records.

to process

The FBI's goal is to maximize

release of information. Postponements will only be requested

where there is compelling justification for doing so.

This

letter serves to inform you that pursuant to the Act the FBI will

be required, in the absence of such justification for

postponements, to release all information received from agencies

such as yours that relates to the JFK Assassination and

to

identify the source agency. This requirement is limited to the

JFK investigation and the documents defined by the 1992 Act and

should not affect any future handling of your agency's

information concerning other subjects.

Enclosures
