JFK Assassination - Release of Information from FBI

Investigation of Foreign Officials fe

X& This is in response to your memorandum of March 21 on the above subject.

We oppose release of the referenced material.

(S) Release of the material would damage U.S. foreign relations by revealing FBI

collection of information involving Israeli diplomatic personnel, other Israeli

officials, and U.S. citizens conducting routine contacts with Israelis. We would

expect the Government of Israel to react quickly and negatively to the release of

such material.

(S) We also note that the referenced material clearly índicates there is no

connection between the information discussed by the Israeli diplomat and the

subject of the investigation. We therefore do not believe that the material would

be of any value to investigators if it were released. Its release would serve no

useful purpose.
