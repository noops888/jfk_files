Because of subject's wifes close association

"'with NY 1086-S and her continued membership in the CP, in-

terview with FRANK

is not being contemplated at this

time.

Although subject's membership in the CP and his

club affiliation have not been determined, the NYO shares

the opinion of the Bureau that there seems to be little

doubt that FRANK is a member of the CP.

Therefore, FD122 is again being submitted

recommending FRANK for inclusion on the SI in the NYO.

In the absence of additional instructions

from the Bureau, this

case will be closed administratively

following the Bureau's acknowledgement of NY's recommendation

and submission of FD 165.
