he determined

that Subject had a manservant named

CELSO CARRETO while he was residing at that address.

Supposed

CARRETO had

moved

to the United States and,

in fact, there was

a report that a friend of the Subject arranged his documents

to

immigrate

to the United

to have gone to New York

States.

CARRETO was supposed

Subsequently,

this same source contacted Mexico Cit™

architect ROBERTO MORALES, described as a close associate

of the Subject,

on

a pretext.

MORALES also identified CELSO

CARRETO as Subject's house servant and said that he had gone

to the United States and

that Subject and other friends had

arranged his documents

Thus,

it appears that from two sources there was

information that CARRETO was Subject's servant and,

The records of U.S. INS indicate that this individual

departed New York 9-25-72,

destined for Mexico City.

It appears

that he entered the United States 3-21-72, at Laredo, Texas.

His U.S. address was given as 135 Winthrop Place, Englewood,

New Jersey. U

It develops that the Vice Consul issuing this visa

well remembers the circumstances of its issuance.

Vice Consul

PATRICIA LANGFORD advised that the visa was issued in part

upon the recommendation of JOHN O'GRADY, former Labor Attache

at the American Embassy, Mexico City, who brought Mr. and Mrs.

GRANOFF to her personally and requested that everything possible

be done to expedite the issuance:

of the visa.

It appeared

that there was some health problem and that they wanted

CARRETO's services as a chauffeur to drive them back to the

United States.

of the extraordinary pressure exerted by O'GRADY and

the

GRANOFFS. Mrs. GRANOFF was supposedly a singer who was

known by the stage name of KITTY CALLEN. U

Above is for the information of Newark and New York,

Newark because CARRETO reportedly was going to Englewood,

presumably the residence of

the GRANOFFs, and New York because

of reports that he was going

to that area and because he

departed from the New York airport. u

It would appear that CARRETO worked for Subject and

then, possibly subsequently, for the GRANOFFS.

His apparent

stay in the New York area until September would appear to

constitute a possible INS violation. u

It is considered that, as a former employee, he

might be a rich source of information concerning Subject's

activities in the United States.

It may be also that the

GRANOFFs were operating as a front for Subject, or may have

just met Subject casually in Cuernavaca. U
