meeting vita Lala SOIDSA

DATE • 10 July 1963, 1800 bours

Le ANENBIR-I called me to tell me that he had had lunch

w1th Iula SONOSA. He said Somosa's apparent purpose in arranging

the luncheon, for it had been upor Sozosa's Initiative that they

had gotten together, mas to discuss certain Cuban refugees who

onem to be gearing up for action in regard to the question of

Cuban liberation®

I ased after nares and Subtect cited Vecians,

Batista Falla, and A'GIDDY-l, statinz that these vere the names

Somona had thrown out during discussion. I asted Subject.to. tell

me what he had said in regard to each and attempted to elicit

"Somona's on Vers on each of these personalities. Pertinent for

the record in the fact that Subject declared to Sonosa trat

ABIDDY-1 was, In his ou vien, a very questionable fellow for

two reasons:

the f1rat, he vas overly. encky and Inordinately.

anbitious and, secondly, he comes fron a pro commundat farily.

In an attempt to deteridne Somosa's viers on NBIDDY-1, I requested

case. Along the line Subject stated that Somsa had simply been

thinking of taking up some sort of contact wits AlBIDDI-1.

I did

not press for further details in ver of ry presumption that there

was probably some special sort of relationship between Somosa and

ArBIDDI-l, the nature of which it would be uncealthy for Subject

Those poitions of the phone elll devoted to AMBIDDI-I

did not bear the sane proportions to the mole as the discussion

of AMBIDDi-1 does to tale report.
