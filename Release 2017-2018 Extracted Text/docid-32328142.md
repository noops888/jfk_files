CONFIDENTIAL

"MM 342-C advised that the new "bag man" for

Dade County, IS

operator of some liquor

stores in

Miami Beach."

In referenced Havana letter of 3/19/58, it was pointed

out that JACK LANSKY had been turned back by Cuban

authorities at

Rancho Boyeros Airport outside Havana, when he attempted to enter

Cuba from Miami on 3/15/58.

Lieutenant HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ, Chief of the Private

Police at the Hotel Nacional, confidentially advised on 4/17/58

that JACK LANSKY returned to

Cuba on 3/20 or 21/58 and was allowed

entry. HERNANDEZ said that JACK LANSKY's refusal of entry by

members of the Cuban Military Intelligence Service (SIM) on'

Minister of the Interior, in an effort to ascertain the reason

for LANSKY being refused entry and that when REY found out

CANTILLO was responsible, he had CANTILLO transferred to a

regimental command in Holguin, Cuba. Thereafter, REY advised

LANSKY's friends that he could return to Cuba whenever he desired.

Lt. HERNANDEZ informed he understands, in return for this "favor,"

a gambling debt which REY had at the casino at the Hotel Nacional

in the amount of $20,000 was written off the books. It should

be noted the possibility exists that this matter could have been

an indirect "shake down" on the part of SANTIAGO REY, the affair

being engineered by him in order to put LANSKY in a position where

the debt would be forgiven. However, in the past, JACK LANSKY

has indicated that SANTIAGO REY has always been a good player at

the casino,

gever caused any trouble, and always paid his debts

promptly. (&)U)

On 4/2/58, Hav-31 informed that because of the bad

publicity Cuba was receiving in the press concerning revolutionary

activities, the gambling business had fallen off substantially.

Source stated the only casino that had not released employees

is the casino in the Hotel Nacional. Source said that the

Nacional had hired an individual known as "LITTLE BOBBy»

whose father, "BIG BOBYSASSO, was a wheel boss at the Havana

Riviera casino.

called the Stardust.

identified above, owns a yacht which he keeps in Havana and that

this yacht is for the purpose of entertaining wealthy gambling

clientele.

information

has been received.from some sources

that MEYER LANSKY was think-

ing of buying a

• yacht or had a yacht available to him so that

he could "sneak" back into Cuba.

Since LANSKY is known to be a

substantial hidden interest holder in the casino in the Hotel

Nacional, TUCKER's yacht could be made available to him; however,

JACK LANSKY has previously indicated that MEYER has no intention

of returning to Cuba without the approval of the Cuban Government.

On 4/14/58, it was ascertained through observation

at the casino in the

Hotel Capri that both FRANK RENZONI, also

known as Tommy/Renzoni, and BEN KRAKOVER are both working at

the casino.

Their presence at this casino tends to substantiate

information previously furnished Legat, Havana, from reliable

sources that SANTO TRAFFICANTE has an interest in the Hotel

Capri Casino,

since both RENZONI and KRAKOVER were long-time

associates and employees of SANTO TRAFFICANTE at the Sans Souci

Casino, where TRAFFICANTE is the principal interest holder,

prior to their going to work for the Capri.

substantial fall-off in gambling patrons in Havana, the Hotel

Havana Hilton Casino had initially cut the salary of all

Havana from Las Vegas at their own expense and the only extra

whether BRUDNER and REED had purchased an interest in the Havana

Hilton Casino.. Source stated categorically that MAX COURTNEY is

paid by the casino, the average minimum "nut" of the casino is

$6,000 a day.

reduce the daily overhead of the casino. Source said, further,

frequently in Havana in recent months. In addition, previous

information furnished to the Legat, Havana, has indicated that

JOE STASSI, as well as SANTO TRAFFICANTE, would have an interest

in the Hotel Plaza Casino when it opened.

Since MARTIN previously

worked at the Sans Souci, it would appear logical for him to

represent Sans Souci interests in the Hotel Plaza Casino.

The casino in the Hotel Plaza is not yet in operation.

GENERAL INFORMATION

No additional information has come to the attention

of the legat, Havana, concerning the construction of further

gambling casinos in Cuba.. Sources available to the Havana

Office have indicated that, because of the fall-off in tourist

trade as a result of revolutionary activities, projected con-

struction of additional casinos has been deferred until such

time as the political situation stablizes itself.

On 4/30/58, Hav-31 advised that, as a result of con-

versations with members of the gambling element in Havana, this

source came to the conclusion that an individual named

SALVATORE FALCONE in Miami may possibly be acting as a mail

drop for communications of importance among members of the

gambling element.

NORMAN ROTHMAN, who is operating slot machines in the

interior of Cuba, advised on 5/7/58 that because of recent

revolutionary activities, the slot machine trade had been very

slow and he was having difficulty retaining trained repair

technicians. He stated, however, that recently there had been

an upsurge in the business.

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared for

forwarding by the Bureau to New York, Miami and Salt Lake City.
