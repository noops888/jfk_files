Labor-Management Relations Act

Fraud Against the Goverrment

Bureau investigation into this matter discloses that the

Exhibitors Service Company (Esco) a Class II motor carrier licensed

with the Interstate Comnerce Commission, has disbursed checks which

were charged, under ICC regulations to an Account #4420, but which,

in fact, were cashed and the proceeds thereof were sent to Edward F.

Weinheimer.

12-1,2

It is the opinion of this Division that if evidence is devel-

oped to show that the disbursements charged to Account #4420 were,

in fact, "payoffs" to "Barney" Baker, organizer for Central States

Conference of Teamsters, then these facts would constitute a viola-

tion of the Labor-Management Relations Act (29 U.S.C.A. 186);

facts may also constitute a violation by Esco of 18 U.S.C.A. 1001 in

that Esco Illed lalse reports with the Interstate Commerce Commissign.

Venue in the false statement case would lie in the District of Columbi

as ICC regulations require that an annual report be filed with the tom-

mission in Washington.

This Division will, therefore, present this matter before a

Grand Jury in the District of Golembla for the purpose of determin-s

ing whether Esco has violated 18 U.S.C.A. 1001. If evidence develops

any violation of the Labor-Management Relations Act, then this matter

will be referred to the United States Attorney, Pittsburgh, Pennsyl-

vania, for appropriate action.

In conjunction with this Grand Jury it is requested that the

following investigation be conducted:

1.

Ascertain the identity of past employers of Edward F.

Weinheimer in Pittsburgh to determine whether his employers

in the Pittsburgh area had any labor difficulties in which

Weinheimer interested himself and, if so, the extent and

nature of Weinheimer's participation. In this connection,

refer to the report fof §peûilat Agent Torrens, dated

December 11, 1958, at Pittsburgh, which reflects, in an

interview of Allen Clark, dated December 2, 1958, that
