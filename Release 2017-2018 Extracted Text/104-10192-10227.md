Flold Comment:.

The MIRR has for some time been planning

to attack vessels of nations which trade with Cuba.

Besides sabotago on vessels in ports, members of the

MIRR have discussed plans

to attack vessels on the high

seas; some plans included the use of aircraft as well as

boats.

1. On 28 April 1966 Orlando Bosch Avila, leader of the Movimlento

Insurreccional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR

Insurrectional Movement for Revolutionary Recovery), said

that 20 men were located in varlous ports in the United States

and Latin Anerica with orders to place explosives, which they

bave, on vessels of nations which trade with Cuba.

best nen is in Costa Rica, and the firet act of sabotage

against a vessel may occür there.

He said that the men are

in touch with labor leaders at the ports where they are located.

According to Bosch, he has received a vote of confidence from

members

of the MIRR to

be solely responsible for the planning

and execution of the sabotage of ships which will be carried

out by these men.

Only he can identify the men and their

locations, and

he is the only person

who is in touch with

them.

He said

that not even the

oxecutive committee of the

MIRR

knows the identities of the men.
