Operations Agrinet Cube

Io: Açtlon: Thle menorandon 1a for your laformatiou

and purmiant to your request. Recommendationa for notion tra

conteined 10 Paragraph V below. The purpose of this menciror:

1n to dollnento an operational plan for the action which we.

bellove should be taken by CIA against Cubr for the predictable

future, In sunnary the plan provides for coatinulng, even

Intensilying, the intelligence effort sgainst Cuba and for

the reorientation of the current effort into # long ter

denled aron typo of oporation of the highest prlority.

I ASSUMPTIONS:

A. The Untted States Government will alre public

mssuranced that, provided no nuclear or offenalve weapore fir

present or re-introduced into Cuba, and provided Cubri dees

not tele action to threaten the ponce ond security of the

Mastera léalaphere, the Unlted Btates does not inter ris

B. These assurances will preclude any meaningful CIA

netion on a

phased basis to provoke a revolt inside Cube, since

unless there are major changes in operational and internal con-

ditions in Cuba, such a revolt 1! provoked rould be totally

destroyed by Cuban counteraction in a matter of hours or, at

a Per dave unlose supported, by a major Valted States

Military connitment. In additlon, the non-invasion assurances

as a practical matter will preclude invading Cuba on the pretext

of a contrived provocation such as an attack on Guantanano.

C. CIA operations involving a high noime level and "

dintinot element of attributability, particularly paramilitary,

guerrilla. and commando type operations will be unacceptable

as a matter of policy.

D. The Castro-communist regime will remain in power for

¡the Indefinite luture with its security and control apparatus

relatively intaot and with the capability not only of crushing

unsupported resistance activity, but of making operational

conditions in Cuba Increasingly difficult. While it 18

possible that recent and future developments including the

Soviet action in

removing the offensive weapons from Cuba mey

serve to weaken and discredit Castro, there ls as yet no hard

indication that the control of the Castro-communist regine over

Cuba has been substantially weakened.

The United States assurances of no Invasion and no

support ofian Invasion will, in elfect, constitute giving in

Castro and his regime a certain degree of sonctuary. This will

---

## Page 4

severely damage the morale and motivation of anti-regime Cubene

both inalde and outside of Cube, which will make It Incrensingly

diffleult for un to recruit sents, mintain agents already

recrulted, and continue of intenaily our intelligence and other

eiforte against Cuba and the Castro-communist regime.

iI. Despite the above lactons, Higher Authority probably

u1ll continue heavy prensure on the ClA for a meximun offort

agalast. Cubs and my ever continue to contend that the ultimate.

objective la the overthrow of the Castro-communist regime.

This 1s an unreallatle objective, however, except. on a very

long-term basts as the Unlted States Government, we belleve,

wilt be unwilling in the immediate future to comult troops

to support such an overthrow. The United States Government

In 1ts overt dealings with the Cuban exiles probably 1ll not

expross the above factors to then in the contest or with the

bluntnens stated here.

G.: In vlon of these factors, the so-called "Track Tria"

course of action, 1.e., unluited support of Cuban exiles

and exilo groups with no real control or objoctive purposes

In the hope that these groups will be sblo to shake the

Castro regime vill, although unrealistic, becone increasingly

attractive_at various levels in the United States Government.

I. As a matter of policy, polltical pressures and

economic pressures short of blockade, raids, and angressive

sabotago igninat Cuba will be continued.

## Page 5

In vien of the above assumptions paramilitary, commando

and sabotage operations, except in rare selective instances

w1ll serve little purpose; nlao they will be counter-productlyr

#Inco, Il undertaken, they will anke the collection of intolli-

gence more difficult and should only be undertaken in those vory

low lantances. where an unusually high return ern be denonstrated.

logardless of what other pressures are placed on CIA for

action againet Cuba, It would appear clear that Higher Autlnrity

Will lnsist on a contioued, even intensified, Intelligence

coverage of Cuba.

In view of the polley factors, an increased use of

facilities, real estate and basing outside the United States,

particularly In' latin Americs, will be both necessary and

destrable.

K. Adequate aerial reconnaissance of Cuba will continue.

II. OBJECTIVES:

Based on the above ansumptions, the following objectiven

appoar to be proper for continuing CIA operations against

Cuba:

A. Take all feasible clandestine netion to 1solnte

and anglst in Isolating the Castro-communiat regime in Culo

from the rest of the Western Hemisphere ind the rest of the

Free Norid.

• scion

¡ To the maximum extent ponsible, discredit the Castro-

cosminist regime in Cuba and in the lestern Hemisphere and the

rest of the world.

III. OPERATIONL PLAN:

A. Bapionage and Intelligence Colloction - All fereible

effort whould be undertoken to continue and Intensify intell

gence collection concerning Cuba. The status of, our Intelll

conce

collection and related operational actluity at the

prement iime and its development during the past six monthe

1s delinested

1n detail in Attachnent A, which was prepored te

serve as the basis for the il's report on this particular

matter to the President's Board of Consultante on Foreign

Intelligence.

You will note that this lengthy document

breaks down under nunerous sub-beadiage the intelligence

coverage which has been developed. by the Clandestine Service.

Set out below aro specifios of operational action it is

proposod to take to continue and, as possible, increase In-

telligence coverage of Cuba.

1. Intelligence Exploitation of Refugees: As gru

know, with the quarantine and the cessation of air

travel the heavy' flow of Cuban refugees has dwindled

almost to nothing. In vlew of this and in connection

## Page 8

with the contingency planning for supporting any possible

mplltary notion in Cuba, the Opa-locke Interrogation

Conter as auch was dimmutled, although the personnel

of the Center have been retained intact. In order to

re-establish. the flow of intelligence fron refugees,

It la proposed that Pan Anertoan Alrways and Klal be

Induced to cointitute their regular flights fron

Havana to Minni, This should be done an soon as

possible niter the settlement of the current negotintlong

and UN dlscusslone. Colncident with this, the Opa-locka

refugee Interrogation conter will be re-establiahed

wIth the same personnel.

: 2. Resident Agents In Cuba: Ivery effort will be

made to continue to exploit, to the fulleat, premerve the

viability of and, where necesenry, re-establish colmunten-

tions: with the 131 recruited agents now resident in Cuba.

To ais extent, the speed and effectiveness of this effort

will of course depend upon the stringency of future

Cuban security and control action, which it 1s imposalble

as yet to accurately forecast.

3. Inlid Countsy Operations: The priority on re-

crutting agonts in third countries for dlepatch to Cuba

will be relterated and strengthened and every effort

will be sade to lacrease this coverage, both through

the development of additional resident agente in Cuba

9. Communist Party Operations: A complete survey

has been made world-wide of all Communist Farty

penetration operations and wherever any such penetration

can be directed against Cuba either by dispatching the

agent to cuba or by pointing the agent arsingt Cubin

targets, this will be done, except in those cages where

such action would result in unacceptabloprejudice te

the operations in the aros where the agent is now baser.

It is bolleved that the most lucrative fleld for the

redirection of such operations to the Cuban targot will

be Lotin America where there are 65 penetrations of

varlous communist parties. Of this 65, the survey

we have conducted indicates that 23 have some dirert

pertinent access to Cuban targete. All oi these 27 mill

be directed against these targets unless in uny case

there are overriding reasons to the contrary.. The

remaining cases in the total of 65 are bain Individually

examined to see 11 they can be diverted to Cuban tergets.

In the aroas where the terms are operating (Plus del

Rio and Oriente). In addition, on the most carefully

solocted basis, where 1t appears feasible, auditional

agents and teans will be inflltrated black into Cuba

In an effort to duplicate the performance of the COBRA

and ANTORRID teans and particularly to rocruit and, re

possible, trals additional agents legally resident in

cuba.

11. Exfiltration: As feasible, agents and potentirl

recrulte now ln Cuba w1ll be extiltrated for

•training, Indoctrinatlon, supplying with communications,

and motivation. They will then be re-infiltrated into

Cuba, primarily on Intelligence alsalons, Were ponsible,

where this 1s not possible, it will be done wherever

feasible through our black infiltration-exfiltration

Much of the above effort aa noted will be primarily

directed tomarde developing all posaible evidences of stress

or strain within the regime and between the regime and other

antions, particularly the Bloc. An intensive program will

be continued to take advantage of any ponsible opportunity

to wonken, subvart, or aplit the regime in any ponsible.

fashion. This in banteally a long ters offort. A great deal

of work ulready has gone into this and the current

status of this program and the proposed further expidtation

0f the numerous leads we have developed is being made, in

the Interests of brevity in this nenorandum, the subject if

a soparato compilation. The offectiveness of assets aimed et

actually solliting the regime, 1,e., a palrce revolt, will of

course depond, to an extent, on the willlagness of the Unlted

Staten Goverment to support then and it te entirely possible

that any such effort night infl unless supported with military

loroes which on the basis of the assumptions in Paragraph I

above would appear unlikely.

C. Sabotare: On the basis of the assumptions set out

above, commando type sabotage, minor sabotage, and other

acte of sabotage inside Cuba would appear to serve 11ttle

purpose and should not be undertaken excopt In the rare

Instances where an opportunity 1s presonted with acceptable

slax to do major damage to the Cuban economy. It 1a proposad

to continue searching for such llaited opportunities, but.

D: Paramilitary, Commando, and Guerrille Type Operatlonil:

Given the assumptions in Prregraph I abovo, no wide scale

progian of such actlvity should be undertaken. However, we

propose to maintain in being our present facilitles and

the cipabllity of undertaking such operatins la order to

"fully exploit any substantial chango in internal Cuban con

ditions or any substantial revolt or uprising which night necur.

B.

Economle Warfare:. It la proposed to continue ind

Intensily the prograt already undertaken to deny through

clandestine and covert means critical materials to the Cuben

economy ...

This consists primarily of denial operations, possibly

some preclualve buying and inducing friendly U.S. and nilled

Birns and governents to prevont the ahipmenta of atrategie

materials to Cuba.

I. Counterintelligence: The current counterintelligence

and counteresplonsge progran agalnst the Cubrn G-2 and

relsted services will be continued and us posalble intenalfied.

This program has developed substantially and it should be
