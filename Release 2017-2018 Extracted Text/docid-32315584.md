Informant advised that he has recently gotten in "tight"

with NICK DITTA.

described his current relationship with

DITTA by stating "we're as close as two thin dimes". Informant

revealed that DITTA and PETE DE ANGELO have been selling "close

out" suits and coats and "making a pretty good buck" at it.

He

related that DITTA has been confiding in him of recent "torch jobs"

which he has pulled.

He said that DITTA just recently was paid

$5,000.00 in brand new bills, still in their bank wrappers,

from a

guy named: (FNU) STEFANI, who

Owns the Stefani Real Estate Co. at

: 10281 Gratiot Ave. Informant revealed that (FNU) STEFANI owned the

Rainbow Recreation at 10235 Gratiot.

He said that DITTA told him

that on the night of October 5, 1962 he (DITTA) and PETE DE ANGELO

"torched" the Rainbow Recreation, including the bowling alley, bar

and restaurant.

Informant said that DITTA told him he took

DE ANGELO along on this job as DE ANGELO really needed the money.

Informant advised that DITTA bragged about

the "job" he did

on Rainbow Recreation.

He said that DITTA told him that in all

of his "burn jobs" he attempts to "cave the joint in" and that he

does this by

burning from the top and the bottom simultaneously

which creates a blast and causes a tremendous inferno in the center

of the building.

Informant said that DITTA was very pleased with

himself on the

"burn job" of Rainbow Recreation but that he con-

siders a

"torching" a

real success if one or

more of the walls of

the building caves in because of this "blast" of fire at the

hilding's center. Informant stated that the Rainbow Recreation

"score" came to him from MIKE RUBINO, and that RUBINO was previously

given the "torch score" by SAM BAGNASCO. Informant said that DITTA

told him that RUBINO called him in on this "burn job" although

RUBINO had it in mind actually to rob (FNU) STEFANI after STEFANI

collected his insurance money

He related that the Rainbow Recrea

tion fire was reported to be a $200,000.00 total loss and that the

previous week (FNU) STEFANI collected a $132,000.00 check from the

insurance company. Informant said that RUBINO's hopes to "beat"

STEFANI out of some, or all, of his

insurance money in a B&E

of STEFANI's home was thwarted

apparently as (FNU) STEFANI

imnediately deposited the $132,000.00 in the bank.

Informant ad

vised that DITTA was bragging to him that he and PETE DE ANGELO

were given the keys to Rainbow Recreation by (FNU) STEFANI, the

owner of the place, and that they spent only eleven minutes inside

the building "setting up" the

"burn job".

Informant said that

DITTA uses polyethelene bottles filled with gasoline on top of

which he pours gunpowder and that he places these around the inside

of the building, "fuses" them all together and "blows" the joint

"into the middle" of the building.

Informant stated that DITTA

blew the Rainbow Recreation on the night of October 5, 1962.

Informant advised that DITTA is quite a talker and he

enjoys "cutting up jack pots", ie., rehashing his ola

"scores".

He stated that DITTA evidenced his intense dislike for LEO

DI FATTA, a deceased hoodlum who was killed in gangland fashion

and who was formerly a close friend of Informants.

He advised

-that DIA told him of a stick-up of a Newport Kentucky, gambling

club a number of years ago which he (DITTA) went on with LEO

in a gun battle they had with the racketeers who ran the club.

Informant said that DITTA, who was the first man to go in the

club, claimed that the reason MIKE TRIPP died was because, as soon

as the shooting broke out, and all the Detroit mob, including

DE PATTA

DITTA, was armed, LEO DI FATTA "Sot yellow" and ran and hid in

the men's room.

He stated that to this day, DITTA blames LEO

DI FATTA for MIKE TRUPIANO's death in the Newport gambling club

"heist".

Informant advised further that NICK DITTA, though he is

close to many of the Detroit Italian syndicate members, he is

actually an outcast of "the outfit".

Informant explained that

"DITTA does his own thinking''.

He said that, for example, when

DITTA hears something he doesn't feel that he is obliged, like

all otber syndicate members, to immediately run to the nearest

phone and call their superiors in "the outfit".

Informant ad-

vised that all "workers" in the syndicate have orders to report

attention regarding their duties or activities, legal and

illegal, engaged in by themselves or individuals in whom their

"boss" might be interested.

One of their prime "orders" is to

report any contact by a police officer, local or Federal, which

they might have had, including all details of their interview,

immediately following the interview. Informant stated that in

this way "the people" keep

abreast of the current activities not

only of their own "workers" but other hoodlums in Detroit and also,

more importantly, keep their 'workers" in a state of subservience

to the syndicate.

Informant advised that he is "in partners" with NICK

DITTA on a real good "horse swindle". He said that the last three

days he, DITTA, and a 70 year old guy named ROY (LNU) have been

operating a past-posting scheme. Informant advised that RoY is an

"American guy" ie, not Italian, who is an old-timer from boot

legging days. He

said that ROY is of German or Irish descent

snot that nox

and has been married 48 years.

Informant advised that ROY (LNU)

lives at 2935 Chalmers and has telephone number VA 4-7504. (It

is noted that this telephone and address are both listed to one

ETHEL C. MORROW •

He said that this Connecticut guy charges DITTA $22.00 for the

that day thereafter. He stated that DITTA calls the Connecticut

number daily and he must pay the same amount each day for any

looking old guy" and all they need to complete the past-posting

swindle

said that he had lined up a guy named JOE NAGEL who lives

on 31st Street in Detroit between the expressway and W. Warren.

He said that JOE NAGEL is "a guy who has his nose open" to "make

a quick buck" and that NAGEL "books" horses and numbers and also

runs a pretty big "cut" poker game in his basement.

Informant

said that he recently got real friendly wich NAGEr

whom he des

cribes as a "stone idiot"

', and subsequently introduced NAGEL tO

ROY (LNU). He stated that ROY (LNU) told NAGEL that he has

$250.00 a day " clean" horse action and soon ROY was "turning in"

his

"action" to NAGEL.

Informant remarked that, to show how

dumb NAGEL is "with the horses", NAGEL PayS ROY

(LNU) 10% of his

"action" daily, which in this case would be $25.00.

Informant

remarked that $25,00 a day for $250.00 a day

"action" is way

out of proportion to the usual "run-out".

He emphasized that

the combination of DITTA's "off-and-running race wire service",

ROY's

(LNU) "angelic"

appearance aud p2u0. horse action, and JoE

NAGEL's stupidity with the horses make for perfect ingredients

to their swindle.

Informant advised that ROY (INU) "turned in" his "action"

to NAGEL for two days and on the third day, yesterday, they.

"beat" NAGEL for $2200.00.

Informant said that DITTA gets the

"off-and-running service"

on the first race and ROY and Informant

have their appointment to "turn in" to NAGEL at 1:30 p.m. DITTA

dresses as a legitimate businessman and as ROY and informant are

entering NAGEL's place DITTA walko ly not anu

of the first race into ROY's pocket and then keeps walking.

ROY "palus" DITTA's

"fat ticket"' and outs it in with the

rest of the daily "action" and in this way they are "beating"

NAGEL blind.

Informant said that NICK DITTA told him that he

has been "going" with this past-posting scheme for twenty

years.

Informant disclosed that DITTA has relatives living in

Detroit, among them being two brothers, "BUTCH" DITTA and

"CHICHI" DITTA.

made parole at Jackson Prison and that MAZZEO, a trusty who

was assigned as chauffeur to former Warden BILl BANNON and

BANNON's wife, EMMA BANNAN, is now at the prison parole camp

waiting for his job approval prior to

his release.

Informant stated that he has recently gotten quite

friendly with RONNIE AHEE, a used car salesman at DICK

GREEN Chrysler-Plymouth Co., 11240 Gratiot Avenue. He described

AHEE as à good-looking young kid, clean-living, who has "a lot

of class".

Informant advised that RONNIE AHEE is a cousin of

MITCHELL RAHHAl and, In a recent conversation about rAHHAb AHE

remarked "there's only one thing wrong with my cousin, MITCHELL.

He's a Syrian". Informant stated that AHE's implication was

that because RAHHAL was not Italiamn he could get no further

In the syndicate than his present position.

In regards to MITCHELL RAHHAL, Informant advised

that it was not RAHHAL who bought the Indian Lodge Bar B Q at

Field and Jefferson Aves. but MITCHELL MASSU, MOS IE MASSU'S

brother. He stated that MITCHELL MASSI obtained a beer ano

wine license for the restaurant, which Informant calls the

Wigwam because the

store front is made in the form of a wigwam,

and that he understands that there is gambling and liquor sales

going on after hours in the back room of the restaurant.

In regards to ROY (LNU) (possibly ROY MORROW), Informant

advised that, in fact, many years ago vike RUbino used to work

for ROY. He said that ROY had the biggest blind pig in Detroit

at the time near Congress and St. Aubin.

He stated that ROY

had the reputation as one of the

best whiskey makers in town.

just "get in line" as AMORMINO Once owed four years back rent

on his apartment at the Chateau-Frontenac.

ever left his place during the day

as he was usually in the

process of planning a "score" or "sleeping off" a big drunk.

He recalled that AMORMINO once got caught prowling some of

his

neighbors apartment and that AMORMINO actually was only looking

for whiskey.

Informant, in conversing about "BIG TIME PETE",

stated "match wits with a guy like him and you've got to come

out first."

Informant advised that FLORENCE "PAT" DI FATTA who ran

a numbers office for SAM RUFFIND, Jr. and who was RUFFINO's

girl friend was just this week arrested, along with RUFFINO, by

surance money PAT got from her husband's death ran out.

later met in TRIG's lounge at E. Warren and St. Jean Aves.

Informant stated that TRIGLIA wanted him to go out and get RUFFINO's

numbers business. Informant said that this could easily be done

as all he would need to do is start picking up the numbers business

at all of RUFFINO's Old "stops". Informant revealed that TRIGLIA

now has pretty good numbers "action" which he is "turning in" to

MIKE RUBINO's numbers house. He advised that TRIGLIA

offered him a job running his number's office but he declined

TRIG's offer stating he long ago quit being "a numbers kid".

by the FBI and TRIG mentioned that every where he turned

that "STIFF" is a partner of "BIG TIME PETE" AMORMINO and

they were both members of the old "Model I Gang". He said that

himself. Informant advised that "STIFF" had a lot of nasty things

to say,

the upshot of it being that "STIFF" considered "Agent

MONTEFIORE" a "traitor" for being both a dago guy himself

and

being in the

FBI.

Informant remarked that "BIG TIME PETE" must

have been doing a lot of talking after being interviewed by the

FBI as PATSY CUVELLO, who owns the barber shop in the Glen Gables

the lesser Italian hoodlums, had also mentioned to him (Informant)

Ypsilanti

to a "meet" with her numbers "stop" there to "halance

the tapes".. Informant revealed that MARY GARIS makes a Long

telephone call to Ypsilanti each day in order to get the "numbers

phone action" and later she

makes a very short telephone call to

Ypsilanti not only to furnish the winning numbers for the day

but also to furnish the "ins-and-outs", the tabulations, for the

day.

In regards to the numbers, Informant advised that

"numbers kids" have to be at work in an office at 2:30 p.m.

six days a week.

He said that their work day runs till about

7:00 p.m. each night or later, at least until the number is

official for, the day.

Informant said that a "numbers kid is

kind of a strange breed in that he has kidded himself into be-

lieving

that he

gets prestige from his job - he is

"in the

rackets" yet

"he's clean".

The "numbers kid" is

"blinded by a

$50.00 bill."

If he works for a good house he gets $100.00 a

week plus a monthly bonus which can range between $250 and $500.

depending upon the month's "take". At Christmas time he usually

gets a present from his numbers house which may be an amount

equal to a bonus plus a pay.

This is all in addition to his

weekly salary and may bring his monthly pay to around $700.00

or more.

Informant stated that this is pretty good money

"numbers kid", ie, the

war an aces

for a

"workers" on the street and in the

numbers offices, and, when put with the money he can make

"hustling" on the street, the "numbers kid" can get by fairly

welt.

Informant emphasized that one of the big features in this

type of job is that the numbers guy doesn't pay any income tax

on this numbers money.

Lounge at 235 Bagley Ave. which was formerly known

as the Motor

City Bar. He revealed that MOCERI runs a taxi-dance hall upstairs

jewelry store some years ago and TONY MOCERI and PETE LOCRICCHIO

bought the load of jewelry for $1800.00.

Informant said that

the stuff was worth about $30,000.00 to $40,000.00 and that there

Potato Chip Co. and ROCCO "sung like a bird" on MOCERI and

LOCRICCHIO.

Informant said that when the police "pinched"

"MOCERI, TONY turned around and put the finger on LOCRICCHIO. He

claimed

that this naturally "queered" their friendship.

Informant recalled

that at the time PETE LOCRICCHIO

had

a "contact" in the Detroit Police Department and he got

actual possession of the statement that TONY MOCERI made to the

police implicating him (LOCRICCHIO) •

Informant advised that

LOCRICCHIO showed this same statement to him and to SAMMY GIORDANO

one day and LOCRICCHIO did his best to "put the bad mouth" on

MOCERI around town... Informant stated that MOCERI and LOCRICCHIO

re-made most of the diamonds they purchased in this "hot! load

into men's rings.

Informant said that SAM LENTINE and FRANKIE

GERLANDO still

wear diamond rings they got from this "score".

He believed that in fact most of the dago guys in town who wear

diamond rings got them from MOCERI and LOCRICCHIO's "score".

Informant displayed a man's diamond ring which he revealed he had

just gotten that day from RONNIE AHEE. He stated that this ring

was from the above described "score".
