CV 52-1918

LOUIS MARTINEZ arrested New York City PD charged

with kidnaping SIDNEY NEUBAUER, attorney for PETER LEBLOVIC,

who is alleged to have contracted to sell arms and medicines

for use by Cuban Rebels.

On non-delivery of arms and medicines,

LEBLOVIC delayed repayment of $34,000 to FRANCISCO VARONA

ALONSO and former University of Havanna students and sent

NEUBAUER to a pre-arranged meeting in New York City where

NEUBAUER was kidnaped and held from 10/16 to 10/18/58.

MARTINEZ

denied taking part in deal concerning arms and medicines or in

kidnaping of NEUBAUER.

Canton, Ohio since shortly after Labor Day, 1958.

Investigation at Canton and Cleveland of associates,

relatives and airlines to date fails to show LOUIS MARTINEZ

in Canton or Cleveland since early September, 1958. Investi-

gation at Cleveland Airport fails to show MARTINEZ as passenger

port Pete

on flights to Miami and San Juan on 10/13 or 10/15/58.

MARTINEZ denied ever being engaged in the purchase or trans-

portation of arms, ammunition or planes for Cuban Rebels.

If MARTINEZ is re-interviewed at New York, 1t is

noted in Cleveland Airtel of 10/20/58 informant advised of

contacting him through RUTHFORD, thereby indicating more of

an association than indicated by MARTINEZ on interview.

It is further noted in Cleveland Airtel of

1020/58, Informant states MARTINEZ during July and August,

1958, negotiated for ten planes in Toronto, Canada, which

planes were shown to informant by MARTINEZ. New York inter-

view reflects MARTINEZ denies purchase of planes for Cuban

Rebels and refused to give reason for visit to Toronto.
