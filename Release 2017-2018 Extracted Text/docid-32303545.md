Will continue to follow and report activities

of subject and his associates in accordance with Bureau

instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE

While the period of this report is slightly longer

than desirable, it is entirely due

to an almost complete lack

of activity on

the part of

subject.

that the MANNARINOs were alleged to have a contact in the

Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D. C., who could

see

to it that certain contractors got the contracts to build

on reservations.

By relet, 4/18/67, Cleveland Division advised:

On April 14, 1967, CV 646-C was recontacted,

and

he advised he had been unable to ascertain name of contact

of MANNARINO brothers, employed by the Bureau of Indiana

Affairs.

Informant advised he has been recently contacted

by JOSEPH "RED" GIORDANO, "go-between" man for the MANNARINO

brothers, and advised there is another construction project

coming up for bid on an Indiana Reservation, somewhere in the

State of Arkansas, and GIORDANO advised informant that he

will receive the

plans for this work in the near future.

Informant stated

he does not know any further details at this

time, but stated the job will be for between one and two

million dollars, and after he has had a chance to study the

plans and before making his bid, Unknown Subject, employed

by the Bureau of Indiana Affairs, is allegedly coming to Youngs-

town at which time he will discuss the job with informant.

the Bureau. of Indian Affairs.

CV 646-C stated. that GIORDANO continues to frequent

the Town and Country Motel, with restaurant and bar, Route 422,

Warren, Ohio. He stated GIORDANO has moved into the Warrer

as apparently ANTHONY DELSANTER has been unable to

handle racket matters satisfactorily in the Warren area.

Informant stated no doubt it was DELSANTER who helped GI ORDANO

locate a home in

the area, where he currently resides.

CV 646-c stated that just recently he was desirous

of locating GIORDANO and was unable to do so in the Warren

area, stated "I had to call way over to New Kensington (Pa.)

to get the number,"

and furnished Warren phone 898-4741,

an unlisted

number, as the residence of GIORDANo.

On April 14, 1967, it was determined that Warren

phone 898-4741 is an unlisted phone in the name of ARTHUR

MARKS, 2620 Risher, S. W., Warren, Onio, a residence.

CV 646-C was recontacted on April 14, 1967, and

he advised that he does not know the name of ARTHUR MARKS,

but this was the telephone number he received as the home

phone of GIORDANO.

The Warren City and Telephone Directories and

the Haines Youngstown-Warren City and Suburban addressakey-

telokey directory failed to list either the name of ARTHUR

MARKS or the address of 2620. Risher, S. W., Waren.

It is again to be noted that this is extremely.

sensitive information, and it would still appear that no:

active inquiry be made in Washington so that the informant

will not be placed in a

compromising position.

Continued

contacts will be made with the informant, and when positive

information is developed, the Bureau and

the Pittsburgh

offices will be advised.

AT PITTSBURGH, PA. (ALLEGHENY COUNTY)

Will continue to follow and report activities

of

subject and his associates in accordance with

Bureau

instructions.

ADMINISTRATIVE

While the perlod of this report is slightly

longer than desirable, It is attributable to an almost

total lack of activity on the part of the subject

and preoccupation of the preparing Special Agent with •

other, more pressing, matters in connection with the

Criminal Intelligence Program.

Route 422, Warren, Ohio, with JOSEPH

RED" GIORDANO

and JACK VEACH, of New Kensington, Pa.

stated that when he arrived, ANTHONY DELSANTER got up

from the table and left, apparently having spent some

time talking with GIORDANO and VEACH. 'Informant

was questioned as to the identity of JACK VEACH,

he stated VEACH operates a drug store for the MANNARINO

brothers in New Kensington, Pa., and does some "leg

work" for them from time to time.

cv 646-c advised that the purpose of the

meeting was to discuss some proposed construction

with GIORDANO and VEACH. He stated he had received a

call from SAM MANNARINO just before, and rather than

MANNARINO come to Ohio to discuss same, he sent GIORDANO

and VEACH.

Informant stated that the MANNARINO brothers

apparently have a "real good connection" with someone

in the Bureau of Indian Affairs in Washington, D. C.

le stated there is a "complex" to be constructed

in

the

heart of the Navajo Reservation at Many Farms, Arizona,

which may cost as

much as 15 million dollars.

He stated

that when he was telephonically contacted by

MANNARINO,

-B-

## Page 8

PG 92-228

MANNARINO asked him whether or not he might be

interested in the construction as a general contractor,

and he advised him that he might, but when he heard

he would have to make his bid by 1/19/67, he told

MANNARINO that this was not sufficient time for him

to get his bid together, and MANNARINO told him at the

time that the bidding period would be extended to

1/26/67.

OTHER 4

Bureau of Indian Affairs, and at that time it was noted

that the bidding period had been extended until 1/26/67,

and the name of his company and his name had been

inserted

on the list of general contractors who had been

invited to bid. He stated his company was the only

company east of

• the Mississippi River who had been

invited to bid.

Informant was questioned as to what

MANNARINO would be able to do for him should he be

interested in bidding, and he advised that should he

desire to bid, although he does not think he will

place a bid for the construction, he wouldffill in all

of the information on the forms, except the total

amount of his bid.

Then on the day the bids are opened

in Washington, D. C., after all the bids were open,

he would receive a phone call and would be told the

amount of the lowest bid.

At this time he would have

to make his final decision as towhether or not he wished

to bid for an amount, a few thousand dollars lower than

the lowest bidder, and the person, name unknown to

the informant, would then write in informant's bid

on the form, and he would be awarded the bid on the

basis of he being the lowest bidder.

Informant was questioned further as to the

construction and he advised that the current plan is

to construct a high school and a residence

of about 134 buildings, each containing four apartments.

He was questioned as to what amount of money would be

involved in a payment to the MANNARINOs for their getting

the bid for him,

and he advised as follows:

that if the lowest bidder was

a legitimate bidder who

had thoroughly checked out all costs of the construction,

then the job should ralize a net of five per cent; of

-C-

COVER PAGE

45854 DocId:32303545 Page 8

## Page 9

PG 92-228

this five per cent he would probably be required

to give the MANNARINOs a total of about three per

cent; this three per cent would

be pald "legitimately"

by check to various individuals for consulting fees

salaries, etc.

Informant was questioned as to anything

in addition to obtaining the contract that the

MANNARINOs would be doing for him, and he advised he

would be orally guaranteed no labor problems,

and

a limited number of inspections by the architects

and/or government inspectors.

CV 646-C stated he does not think he would

go through with the "deal"

and make a bid as he feels

that. this type of "deal" is too risky and that the

only persons to gain are the MANNARINOs, and should

he, himself, suffer a loss, they would not reimburse

him.

Informant was questioned as to any further

obligations he would have with the MANNARINOs supposing '

he would enter into the contract, and wouldimake even

more than the net of five per cent, and he advised

he would have nothing further, and

would only have to

abide by the terms of the

"contract" with the MANNARINOS

for this particular job.

At the time informant was questioned as to

any friendship between the MANNARINOs and/or GIORDANO,

with DOMINICK MALLAMO of Youngstown, and he advised

that when he arrived at the Town&County Motel on 1/10/67,

and before they entered into a discussion about the

"contract," GIORDANO inquired of informant as to the

health of MALLAMO, and wanted informant to make certain

that he carried GIORDANO's personal greetings to MALLAMO.

In view of this, informant stated he knows there is

close friendship among the group.

By relet dated 1/31/67,

it was set out that

on 1/24/67, Cleveland opened file 46-3365, entitled

"UNSUB - Employee, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Washington,

D. C.; GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka; SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka,

cerning this matter. This is extremely sensitive

information,

and it

would appear at the present should

active inquiry be made in Washington that the informant

could be plaed in a compromising condition.

In re-

obtain further indication which might be used to
