West German agencies for a long while.

He has been arrested

eleven times in connection with various fraudulent operations

and is presently serving a further sentence of four and one-half

years in the prison at Stade, West Germany.. The data which

Buske referred to in his letter to the Department of Justice

as having been submitted to German authorities was given first

to. the Landesamt fuer Verfassungsschutz - (LfV - State Office

which would in any way bear on the problem of resolving the

circumstances of the murder of President JOHN F. KENNEDY OT

the background of that crime.

The BfVeadded that BUSKE has,

in the past, frequently furnished information to various German

gencies and olficials which intormation was regarded as un-

elievable and the Bivexpressed the opinior

that there was

strong probability that BUSKE was attempting through these

current reports to the BiVand the letter to the Department of

Juscice to gain some favorable treatment for himself. The Bive

said that BUSKE's information pertained to alleged operations

and plans of the East German Intelligence Service which

information was regarded as fantastic and had resulted in the

(S)BIV Listing BUSKB's name on a warning

list of persons regarded

as unreliable information peddlers.

Subsequently, the Jurnished copies of the following

three documents written in the German language the second of

which is the material referred to by BUSkE in ais letter to

the Department of Justice.

(1) • A. copy from the Federal Penal Registe

(Strafregister) in Berlin - Charlottenburg

#9, Germany, reflecting previous convictions

November 3, 1918, in Nepzin, Pomerania.

(2)

A letter dated March 16, 1964, at Stade from BUSKE

to the "Office for the Protection of the Constitu-

tion, Field Office, Hannover" which was a brief

letter of transmittal of an attached "Statement

Written for the Federal Office for the Protection

feel sure that further such actions are going to
