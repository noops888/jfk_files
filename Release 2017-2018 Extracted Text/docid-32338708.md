Lincoln Brigade members in Spain, he 1s now closely associated with

them and ie active in Communist Party work.

The same Informant states

that MARCUS lives at TUTTLE'S home and has stated that he could have

married TUTTLE'S daughter, aged 17. TUTTLE was associated with BIBERMAN

in sponsoring the Motion Picture Denocratic Committee and the Hollywood

League for Denocratic Action, former Communist front organizations; and

he is described by various Informants as a rabid Communist. Dr. FRANK

KNOWLIN, proprietor of a West Hollywood hospital has advised that he has

personally attended parties at the TUTTLE residence, to which prominent

Follywood personages were invited. Russian entertainers performed at

these parties and Russian motion pictures were shown. The parties usually

lasted all night, and as the guests left, they were usually presented for

signature with a

check drawn on their ovn banke in suns ranging as high

as $1,000.00, "for the cause." The Informant stated that it was a matter

of comnon knowledge that these checks were for the Conmunist Party, though

he was not certain as to the identities of the payees of the checks.

Various Informants have advised that TUTTLE was concerned with

the naking of a motion picture alleged to depict the horrors and sufferings

of modern warfare, and which was financed by TUTTLE to the extent of $2,200.00.

In connection with the making of the picture, which was described by the

Informants as pacifist in nature and aimed at the American preparedness

progran, one of the associates of TUTTLE was overheard to say, "By the time

we get this picture out, the Government will have us either in Leavenworth

Penitentiary or in a concentration camp."

TUTTLE was described by JOHN L. LEBCH, a forner Communist Party

organizer and member of the Communist Party State Executive Committee in sworn

testimony before a Grand Jury as an active organizer for the advancerent

the communist cause.

As of interest to this investigation, attention is invited to

a letter from the Denver Field Division to all Field Divisions and the

Bureau, dated August ]l, 1941. Accompanying said letter was a memorandun

entitled, "Conmunist Party Set-Up." This purported to be a list of revisions

in the Communiat Party set-up nationally, and it was obtained by Denver

Confidential Informant Dr. 57, from a source which that Informant described

as the Cormunist Party letter received by JAMES ALLANDER, District Organizer

of the Communist Party, District #19, Denver, Colorado.

The memorandum

recited changes in personnel and office addresses in Communist Party

Districts 1 to 23, and in conrection with District #13, California and

Nevada, it contained the following statement: "JOHN HOWARD LAWSON with

HERBERT BIBERMAN will be in control of the Intellectuals and Motion Picture

Comrades in the Hollywood area."

It is recalled that the Bureau letter of August 7, 1941.

lutionary ranks today, by reason of the smooth manner, his unquestionable

brilliance of mind, his quick thinking, his pleasant porsonality, and

that quality which males him equal to any exigency. BIBERMAN warned

the crowd that the present war hystoria is endangering Amorioan civil

liberties

and that the talk of the fifth column was an attack on labor;

that the threat to deport HARRY BRIDGES and the organization of the Red

Squad in Los Angeles were examples of the growing threat.

ho had gono back East to help organize the Amerioan Union for Concentrated

Peace Efforts in New York. A year ago as a result, National Security and.

Peace Week was held throughout the country under the auspices of the Union
