SYNOPSIS

In a niceting 5 Aprul between LINLUCK? Victor Manuel CUTIERRET

by GUTIERREZ, of a 2& page report LINLUCK had prepared which, tu

LINLUCK'& option, concentrated on "negarive" security matters to the ex

cluston of the more important polirical considerarions, experience;

concerning the lil-fared MORENO guerrilla group, and (2), GUTIERREZ'

comments indicating that the PGT suspected June COBB of being the source

of "leaks" and commented on LINLUCK'S lack of discretion in his relation

ship with her.

LINLUCK, during this meeting, made some ill-considered remarke

"(ln the Station's option); again jumped to the defense of COBB, and verbally

attacked both GUTIERREZ. and ALVARADO Jerez, in effect, accusing the

latter of cowardice: LINLUCK also threatened to drop out of the work he

was doing. in comection with arms procurement, eic., and indtetted that he

wanted nothing more to do with such responsiblities if he were not trusted

When the Station lenraed of this quarrel, LINLUCK was instructed (I) not to

allow his zelatiguair with June COBB to alienate GUTIERREZ, one of the:

sanguine re the strengihening and increasing of security of the operacion

perhaps LINLUCK now has had impressed upon him the active danger which

which the PCT regards her.

never reported to anyone nor did he contribure to dangerous or important

actions.

LINLUCK took him to task for his "police-like" attitude wichin the

P&T and indicated his (LINUCK's) disgust with the fact that within the PCT

they could still act ot the basis of gossip and that selfish resentments should

have such a great play at a ilme when in Guatemala people were being mut

dered ky the pollce ot falling li combat. LINLUCK also hinted that

ALVARAD. Terer had never siven proof himself of the integrity which he

was demanding since Elve hours before ARBENZ, resiguarion in 1954,

ALYARADO Jerez had tecorded the maguetic tape which was te be broad-

pier on the radio and wai making preparations for hie extle while the PET

people, iguerig all this, were still flgating in the streets and exposing

themselves ip terrible danger": LINLIJCK labelled ALVARADO JETEZ

attitude as destructive and brazen and of being motivated by envy, even

of his own brothers.

6. According to LINLUCK, he was aware af the effect his words were

producing and he continued by saying he was rired of the systemaric attitude

which members of the PC leadership assumed in his case and that, stace he

did not enjoy absolute confidence, he did nor want to continue to be bi charge

of anything.

"While some become i friendly with really susplelous people

within the PoT leadership and he could ill afford to alienate him especially

when the basic point of disagreement was his relationship with june @OBB...

a relarionship which the Starion had instructed him to end as far back as.

November 1961 due to the fact that she was suspect by the PGT and a contin-

uation of the relationship with her made him subject, at the very least, to

suspicion of indiscreetly talking too much abour PGT affairs. The Station

of course; could not tell, him how much proof we had of the extent of his in

discreet contersatiots with COBB but we tried by every means short of the

tuth to warn him of the danger of continuing this relationship so far as the

PoT and the Soviets were concerned. LINLUCK, atter the quarrel with

CUTIERREZ ANd ALVARADO Jerez, finally seemed to realize the darage

On 10 April, LINLUCK visited Carlos Humberto LESCAS, at

ILLESGAS' request through his wife, Norma.

ILLESCAS seemed quite

friendly but immediately began to scold LiNLUCk for his murral with

GUTIERREZ and ALVARADO Jerez.

ILLESCAS repeated LINLUCK's own

words to him, "You have always said that courage is the possibility of

thinking while in danger, of acting cooly in the midsi of violeuce, but I be-

Ileve that this time you became confused and behaved like a hurt child tather

than like an expertensed politician who knows how to handle a struarien

GUTTERRE? did not agree with this and attempted to explabi

the possibility that the interest of the Soviets may extend deeper. and be

concerned with a thorough security check of LINLUCk before deciding.to

use him li anything sensitive. LINLUCK reported that he had the distiner

impression that GUTTERREZ organized this 18 April meeting to "force"

Liluck to contime to arend the meetings of the four "leaders" in

• Mexico and to prove to him that none of the other three, (GUTtERRed,.

ITESCAS, DI ALVARADO Jerez) had any bad feelings toward him as a

result ot the violent discussion above.

13, Later, at a meeting between GUTIERREZ and LINLUCK on 21

Aprl, CUTIERREZ gave LINLUCK some paternal advice concerning the

internal struggles within the leadership of the PGT and stated his Interest

in seeing LINLUCk" through his own actions and responsibilities regain

his position within the PGT leadership". GUTIERREZ then referred ro the

disagreement with ALVARADO Jerez and criticized as "not good." the state-

ments made by LINLUCK to the deffect that he could practice his patriotisi

even withont the CP. GUTIERREZ said that it is better to continue to

struggle for uniry within the PGT without paying atrention: to those who h

trigue. He added that he was alarmed by LINLUCK's attitude re practicing

patriotism outside the PGT "since that would be a tremendous blow to the

to behave himself and work on the lasks assigned him as long as the PCT

had full must inhim. GUTIERREZ said that they had full trüst in hi and

said that was why he had emphasized m the report at the previotis meering

"the congrarulations which Bernardo ALVARADO Monzon expressed to

us, cherue to the magulficent work in the orginization of the sekrilla

then dischssed his milary work with GUTIERREZ and asked CUTlERREZ

categoriently to again consult the PGT leadership about his (LINLOGK'S)

retiring to Guatemala to contr lbute with his efforts and experience to the.

millary etfort". GUTIERREZ was pleased but they agreed that the ex

tensive work assigied LINIUCK in Mexico took precedence at this time

but that the PET leadership would be asked to consider LINLUCK'S request

when they thought his return would be "opportune and determining."

COMMENTS

1, The Station considers this quarrel as an unfortunate ourgröwth

of LINLUCK's stibbom refusal to recognize - up to this point - the danger

June COBB represents for him and for the future of the operation. He has

been instructed by the Sarion numerous times to stop seeing. COBB and we
