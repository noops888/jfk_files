ReBuäirtel to NY, dated 1/21/64.

Inquiry by Ny at Dun and Bradstreet, Inc.-

and Credit Bureau of Greater NY,

failed to reveal any

information concerning the identity of the washington

Wich financed wail bodegan as or feel loan!

NY 3936-C, whose identity is known to the Bureau, advised

that auditors or bank examiners examined loans approved by

GILVIE at First National Bank, Washington, D.C

the Rockhill loan and these loans were found not ir

accordance with good practice.

He further advised that due

to the request of the First National Bank, Washington, D.C.

to repay this loan Rockhill is making efforts to obtain

a loan from a bank in Montreal, Canada to repay a loan

at the Washington Bank.

It may be possible for WEO to make inquiry with

the National Bank examiners and/or Federal Deposit Insurancer

examiners in order to obtain information re examination of

irregularities at the bank.

This would then give WFO a reason

to contact the First National Bank, Washington, D.C.
