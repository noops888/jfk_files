The omership and bookkeeping of both the LINEsA and

LILYRIC properties ta carried in the name of a real estate company

which LIMOUSINS controle.

This company owns several other prop

orties including a major tract of land on the outskirts of Mexico

City which LIMOUSINE has been holding for resale at a profit.

However, his oxpenses on this property have been heavy over the

past year which bas left his company in a very short cash position,

LIMOUSINE delayed selling this tract pending completion of & high

way which gives

access to the property and increases 1ts value.

This highway is now complete and LIMOUSINE ie working out the

details of the sale of this property to a consortium of insurance

compantes which will construct a housing developient.

LIMOUSINE

expects to start realizing substantlal cash on this salo during

the third quarter of 1968,

"Due to the short cash position of his company LIMOUSINE

has asked the Station for a moratorium on the money due to the

Station from tbe LIMESA and LILYRIC properties for calendar year

1967 and the first half of 1968, LIMOUSINE'S indebtedness to the

station for calendar year 1967 1e as follows:

LILTRIC - As detailed 1o HMMA-25310, 3 Februnry 1965,

LIMOUSINS is repaying his construction loan from the Station on

the LILYRIC property by repaying to the Station the rent on the

LILTRIC apartment wiich te 3,000 MN por month or 36,000 MN por

year. 01 his origiol loan of 150,000 MN he bad repaid

98, 790 MN

by 31 December 1966 leaving a balance 51,210 MN•

According

to the

repayment schedule he should have paid 36,000 MN during 1967

leaving a balance of 15,210 IN. Also, according to the schedule,

the loan should be fully repsid by June 1968.

your 19671, 0 12,50206 a fines stat 96,000 sada

By 30 June 1968 bis indebtedness will be locreased by

approximately 25,210 MN (approximately 18,000 MN for LIKESA and

15,310 IN fOr LILYRIC:

LIMOUS INSo estimated total debt to the

Station by 30 June 1968 1o estimated at 86,542,61 MN (58, 332.61

ot 1968)

86,543.61 MN equale $6,923.11 (US/CY).

Therefore LIMOUSINS requests a loan of 68,332 MN,

amount already due to the Station for calendar year 1967 and a

second loan of approximately 28,210 MN which represents the money

which will be due on 30 June 1968 (LIMOUSINE accounte on a sent

annual basis) le has promised to repay all monies due to the

Station during the third quarter of 1968.

5.

The Station strongly recommends approval of this loan

for the following reasons:

LIMOUSINE has been a faithful Station saset for many

Fe has nover refused a request of the Station's and has

offered his serrices continuously without renumeration (the Station

does give hia Christmas gifts). He has always been honest in his

financial denlings with the Station and we have no reason to believe

that he will default on this debte

Die to unexpected construction and repair costs on

the LILYRIC building and a poor rental performance (this latter

1s partially due to the Station which bas vetoed soveral potential

tenants on security grounds), the LILIRIC building 18 in the

red, LINOUSINT doesn't expect it to be la the black for at least

two more years. Since the Station bas turned down several tenants,

it is partially responsible for

this problem
