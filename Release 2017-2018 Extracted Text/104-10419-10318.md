at which time STANLEY ciaimed to have learned from an Eastern

Eastern Airlines because of homosexual activity. STANLEY said

that FERRIE had been dischärged by a Captain GRENNIER whose

When STANLEY eSked WARINAyYou mean LEE HARVEY OSWALD ras with

yOU?! MARTIN Wlanmed up" and vould talk no more about itzhin

anster to a direct question STANLEY said MARTIN had not mentioned

the assassination speciflcally."

It is noted that STANLEY indicated that MARTIN had

talked to him about the association of FERRIE, OSWALD, hinself

and the others on only one

occasion although STANLEY gave three

different versions

Beginning

about January 5, 1967, STANLEY received two

telephone calls from JERRY DE PUGH in New Orleans, Louisiana,

asking that STANLEY come to New Orleans to start a mission and

a church newspaper

Thereafter, STANLEY received a third call

from DE PUGH, whose voice he recognized but who did not identify

himself, telling STANLEY "if you open your mouth about us, I

Hill shoot you.

STANLEY explained "they knew MARTIN had talked

to me and had referred to the plot against the President"

STANLEY said that "about a month ago" he called the

Chief of Police at New Orleans giving him the above information

about the association between OSWALD, FERRIE, MARTIN, DE PUGE,

and HYDE.

STANLEY said he offered to go to lew Orleans but the

Chief of Police told him it would not be necessary.

STANcEY sald he did not report the information he

obtained from MARTIN previously because

the Warren Report

indicated that there was no conspiracy involved in

the assissi

nation of President KENNEDY. STANLEY indicated

that he was

reporting this information now because from recent newspaper

publicity it appeared that there might be a plot.

STANLEY continued "MARTIN had a connection with CASTRO

because he asked me to consecrate,a Bishop to go to Cuba"

Izter he said he did not know whether the Cuban organization

which he alleged OSVALD, MARTIN, FERRIE, DE PUGE,

HYDE to have been connected was pro or anti-CASTRO.

still later

STANLEY said he had received a telephone call fron Colonel

"something or other," the head of an anti-CASTRO group in New

Orleans. STANLEY said he could not recall the name of the

Colonel but said he had read about him in the nerspaper as the

heed of an enti-CASTio group.

STANLEY said that MARTIN in 1963 and 1964 resided

at 20% Mason Street, muston, Texas,

and worked

as a writer

for a nerspaper.

MARTIn during this period also corresponded

with STANLEY from New Orleans and STAMuEY feels WARTIN is now

STANLEY described DE PUCA as

35 to 10 years old,

shorty inches tall, and tough when drinking.

STANLEY has never seen HYDE but said that HYDE had

been arrested for homosexual activity in Washington, ". C

At the beginning of this interview when STANLEY was

first approached, STANlEY said he would not talk to an fBI

Agent but would talk only to the police officers.:

He refused

to give a reason for not talking to an FBI Agent, but thereafter

when the interviewing Agent offered to leave, STANLEY suddenly

changed his mind and agreed to talk to police and the Special

Agent togeiher.
