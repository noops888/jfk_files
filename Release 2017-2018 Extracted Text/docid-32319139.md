Dear Terry:

The ARRB staff requests access to any and all FBI informant files (or "source" files) associated

with the person or persons designated by any of the following symbol numbers: DL 172-S, NO

172-S, and MC [or MEX] 172-S. Our request extends to any and all such files presently or

previously maintained by FBI Headquarters or any FBI field office, legal attaché or resident

agency, with particular reference to the Dallas and New Orleans field offices and the legal attaché

in Mexico City. Our request includes all files presently or previously maintained on such person

or persons under the "134" or "137" classification, regardless of whether the FBI may have

designated such person or persons as criminal informant(s), potential criminal informant(s),

security informants), potential security informants), confidential source(s), counterintelligence

asset(s) or any other type of source of information, and regardless of whether such person or

persons ever received payment from the FBI.

In view of the FBI's stated concerns regarding inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure of

W2C-N0-1029205-869

informant-related material, we will be happy to discuss with you appropriate procedures for our

handling and review of any material responsive to this request.

Thank you for your continuing cooperation.

Sineerely yours,
