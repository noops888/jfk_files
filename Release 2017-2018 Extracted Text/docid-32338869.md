Dear Sir:

Declagally an: 9Af

Reference is made to teletype, dated May 14, 1947, advising. the

Bureau that the technical surveillance on the above-named Individual had

was ascertained that he did not use his telephone.

Tests were immediately

the service should be in perfect condition.

After the above tests were

made it was still noticed that the subjeot did not use his telephone and

attempts were made to reach reliable contacts previously developed in the

California Water and Telephone Company, at which time it was ascortained

that, withuthe, erreption of one inditidual who was on vacation, they had
