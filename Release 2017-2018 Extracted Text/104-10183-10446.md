MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Neeting with ANHIP/1, lew lork City, 28 April 1965

alis

1. Time-Place-Purpose

AMVHIP/1 was wet on 2S April in New York City for the purpose

of introducing the undersigned's replacement and to debrief him

on his recent trip to Europe. The undersigned met ANIlP/l at his

office at 1215 hours, and chatted there for a short time. The

undersigned and ANVHIP/1 then went to the lobby of Waldorf Astoria

Hotel where the undersigned's replacement, Mr.

introduced to ASMIIP/1. Mr.

a Bused the alias "Harry fills."

After a working lunch at the Waldorf's Bull and Bear Restaurant,

the party motored by taxi to the Taft Hotel (Room 551). The

meeting lasted, including lunch, from 12l% hours until 1700. At

the conclusion of the debriefing at the Taft, the undersigned

accompanied AMHIP/l back to his office and made the appropriate

goodbys. Following that, the undersigned returned to the Taft Hotel

to pick up Mr.

2. Details of the meeting

A majority of the items covered during the meeting have been

the subject of previous cables from the field. However, for

greater clarity, a number of these were reviewed with AlNHIP/1 and

additional information and comments obtained.

a. Cuban Government efforts to obtain foreign exchange

through the Florida lotteries.

(1) A'WHIP/I stated that he had been approached in

Madrid by Rafael Garcia-Bongo Dirube (see

and related traffic who wanted him to act as a contact man with

Santos Trafficante who is presently living In Miami. According

to GB, he had been told by(UNSNAFU/19 (U/19). that DsE Chief

Pineiro had okayed the following operation involving the Cuban

lotteries played illegally in Florida. The Cuban Government as

prepared to give throushcho three winning numers per week for.

Trafficante to use in proffting on the Cuban lottertes played: In

Florida, Trafficante was to pay $50,000 upon receipt of the numbers

from(u/19 and an additional $50,000 after the win. This money,

which would have been a free source of income to the Cuban Government,

would then be either banked in Europe byuy19 on behall of the.

Cuban Government or sent to lavana according to instructions he

received. GB had found out that AMSHIP/1 knew Trafficante in

Miami and, had contacted him to act as a messenger to Trafficante.

AMVIIIP/1 was also offered, but declined, sum of money for his

participation in this operation. As a matter of interest this

ploy for illegal winning from the lottery was

first conceived in

1959 by GB and Trafficante but it did not materialize as Pineiro

and

perhaps other govt officials would not play ball at that time.

It is interesting to note that, for the price of $100,000 a week

in foreign exchange, the Cuban Government is now willing to enter

into a conspiracy of this level with well-known gangster elements.

Other people in the Florida

area who will probably be affected by

this action are Amlato Batisti (former owner of the Seville

Biltmare Hotel in Havana) and one. FNU Santos both

of whom are also

involved as king ping in the lottery racket in Florida.

Accoring to mill, Paupa is the center for this activity.

AMMIlIP/l stated that if we wanted to take any action in this

matter, it would have to be done soon as GB would expect him to

react regarding the contact with Trufficante in the very near future.

Extreme caution should be used in any aetion in this rield as any

leak might readily finger to AMWHIP/l. It is interesting to note

that in an intervier

with a

202

öfticer (cited Parà 5 •

4386), GB stated that he had turned down a DSE request to

work for them overseas.

He had however offered to become involved

In Illegal business deald abroad on behalf of DSE. He never recelved

a reply to this offer. It is also noted that, according to ANTIP/?,

CO/l9 is not witting that he (ANWIIP/1) has this opportunity to

act us a go-between with GB and Trafficante on this matter.

b. Luts Blanca Fernandoz, Vice Minister of Communications.

(1) In response to the question AMMIlP/l stated that he

knew Blanca slightly but had no significant assessment to give on

the man. He did know that he was an old DR member and that the

best sources of information on him would be AMLASH/1, /2 and /3.

c. ANNIP/1

(1) In discussing the general situstion in Madrid and

Europe, A'MHIP/l again deplored the use by kUBARk of ANNIP/l

in operations against the Castro Cubans. He stated that he didn't

know him personally but that many people had told him that A'NIP/1

was no good and a person in show one could have obsolutely no

confidence.

He cited for an example how ANNIP/I had told the

mother of Diaz-Argueles

that he had been sent frow AMLASHl/3, a

statement, which according to AMIIP/l, was simply not true.

d. Milan Travel Agebey

(1) AMHIP/1 mentioned the Travel Agency in Milaxi which

he had noticed was advertising trips to Cuba. AMNIP/l had

nothing more

to contribute to this bit of information beyond that

already reported 1n 13900 (IN 17562).'

•. LAYAS Basan, Cuban technician at La Rochelle, France.

(1) AMWIP/1 mentioned this man may in fact have a

brother, Enrique ZAYAS Bazan, who is syupathetico and lo now

working at the parking lot

at the Miaul Airport. He had found

nothing to add on this lead other than

that provided in

1. ANNILIP/l's itimerary in Europe.

(1) For the record, AMWIP/l varied his itinerary

during his last trip in Europe to some degree from that agreed

upon with his leadquarters case officer. His itinerary was as

follows: New York to Paris, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Milan, Madrid,

Miami.

g. Jorge Modüll Rivas, Vice Minister for Foreign Commerce

(1) AMMIIP/l stated that Jorge MEDAN has a brother now

Ilving in Miami, Ricardo MEDAN Rivas, who would be an escellent

entre to the former. A'WHIP/l reported on Ricardo .in

20-1

0190

(IN 35169). ANWHIP/1 stated that Ricardo was a trustworthy man

who knows ANCRUMB/1 well, plus a great many people who are still

In the Cuban Government today. (Writer's note:

This lead should

be followed through.)

1. Dismissal or (4N9VAFU/9 by CUNÊNAFU/19

0253 (IN 37416). A'WHIP/l repeated his feelings as

basically reported in the aforementioned cable. He stated that

CUNEUAFo/19 in discusadng the incident actually was very fair to

GUNSNATU/s and had stored at he was trifly sorry to have had to

dismiss (UNSNAFT/9. He said however that CUNSNAFU/9's pugilistio

attitude and threats to himself as Cuban Ambassador to France

could simply not be tolerated. He stated that had this flare-up

by UNSNAFT/S taken place in Havana, then it might have been

dealt with as a man-to-man matter rather than as an employer-

to-employee matter. He also said that he hated to firéCUNSNAFU/9

due to the latter's friendship with AMIP/l and ANWUIP/1. As a

0z

result ofCiNAFU/g's being fired, his wife also lost her job with

the Cuban representation to UNESCO in Paris. She has since

however found another job in UNESCO working for the delegation of

another country.

i. ('i9's recent trip to llavana

(1) Because of the interest in the "coincidental"

02

trip to Marana of both OS.WFU/19 and AYCASH/3 shortly after

having receired the "planted" information of the MISPAWN operation,

we queried UNHIP/ regardins(19's trip. AWUTP/l stated that,

to the best of his knowledge, Clip went home because of the

precarious condition of his mother's health. UDl9 was called by

Foreign Minister Roa in Madrid and adrised that he should return.

C%o carried certain medicines with hin for his mother.

ASWIP/1

did not know the nature of the mother's illness, but apparently le

came on rather suddenly (if possible, the medical history or(ul/19's

mother should be traced). ASlIP/l stated that LLASH/2,

Garcia-Bunga, and Gallerreta all confirmed(U/19's mother's

illness. Carrillos left for lavanu on about the zoth of sarah.

J. for the record AlMIlPI, in discussing the CUNSNAFU/9-

CUNSVAFU/19 affair, stated that only(U%19 and his family and the

code clerk (Clavista) and his family now are liring in the Embassy

building itself. The living quarters for a number of the other

Cuban mission employees are now located in the Consular. (Check

this)

k. AMLASH/3 returned to Havana

(1) "Cucu DeLeon told A'MIlP/1 three or four days ago

in Miami that AMLASII/3 had called from Madrid very recently and

stated that he was going to return to lavana. LIP/l had no.

other details on AYLASH/3's return or shether in fact he had

actually done so.

1. AMLASH/2

(L) AMNHIP/1 stated that AMLASIl/2 and 3 were indeed

disillusioned with the Americans to date. AMASH/3 still believed

that it had been through the office of the American Government

that he had been refused a visa to the Dominican Republic. (It

will be recalled that AYLASHl/3 had complained of this before to

AMMHIP/1, and AMTIP/I had been instructed to suggest to AMLASH/3

that it was his own known employment by the Government of Cuba in

a legitimate capacity which was probably reason enough in itself

for the Dominican Government to refuse him a visa.) ANIlP/1

stated that he had used this argument with A'ASH'3, but that

AMLASII/3 remained convinced

that there was more behind the refusal

than this.

AMLASIl/3 stated, in

discussing his dissatisfaction with

the Americans, that he vas generally displeased because Americans

would use people like A'NIP/1 und then did not wish to talk to,

let alone deal with, people like himself and AMLASH/2. He did

not probe into the discussions in Madrid betreen AWHIP/1, AMIASHl/2, 13,

and @USPORT/1. AHIP/l did say that there was no point in trying

to argue with these people at that time, or to defend the possible

American positions vis-a-vis them, because they were in fact so

convinced in their own minds that there would be little use at

that time in trying to change their viers (this point at a

subsequent fuller review of these discussions should be conducted

in Spanish by Swenson at an appropriate

time in the near future).!

•. MISPANN Operation

(1) ANTIP/l did not have much addittonal information

to contribute concerning his MISPAWN talks with Uy19 beyond that

20 - 4

reported in_

10355 (IN 11111), lle did say, hoever, that he

had actually given

the name and address of Mr.

Carrillos who included this in his cable about the matter directly

to Celio Sanchez

to lavana. A'MIIP/l stated that he digressed

slightly from the story as given him in the briefing because he

felt that if he pin-pointed Fidel as the one leader who must go,

C/19 would possibly then not have taken such quick action on the

matter, and in fact, may not have

reported it at all. AlIP/l

telt that Carrillos undoubtedls will discuss the MiSPAlS information

on his current trip to lavana. 19111P,/1, as stated in above

rible, sold that be offered to try to get more information from

Mr. Callado it lin so desired. Old stated that he rould await

comment from Havana before decinding on ins further aceton. AmllP/l

was certain that this ploy worked without suspicion, and stated

that he was willing to go further with this operation if so

desired by KUBARK. Caution! !

п.. A'WHIP/1 representative to travel to lavana on invitation

oICUy19.

(2) Regardine Yo's asser for AHIP/ Or AWHIP/3

to travel to Havana on ? May with a french theatrical group in

order to examine additional paintings, geus, and other loot taken

from Cuban refugees and now offered for sale by the Cuban Government

to obtain sorely needed foreign exchange, AMlIP/i stated that he

would need an

¿swer on this matter fairly soon. (It will be noted

that we told

in DIR 99721 that there was interest in this

offer and that te were secking a suitable candidate). Since

Headquarters has not had a suitable candidate for this trip and

did not have prospects of developing one who could make the trip

securely, we asked AWHIP/l if he had someone

in mind who could

make the trip. AMMIlf/l stated that he thought an "experienced"

person of our choosing would be able to get more useful information

for us.

He stated that perhaps it rould be best not to involve

an agent witting of AMlIP/l's true relationship with KUlARk in

the event that the agent was irrested and forced to talk. We told

AWIIP/1 that as a safer, but obriously less desirble, alternative

we might have an unwitting person go in, beeause much of the

information that he rould normally get as a result of a legitimate

business interest in the loot will be in fact of use to kill.

ard te were willing to forego i miximum "take" for the trip in the

interest of security.

AsmIll then said, "In that case, perhaps.

' business partner in Milan, Oreste Corletto, would be willing

so make the trip for me." AMlIP/l did not have details on

Corletto at his fingertips but said that he would either send

•. them or telephone them to "Harry Wills" the folloing days.

2WH11P/l stated horever that Corletto, tho is about if years old

and born in Milan, is very pro-American and defends the American

position in the sorld at the drop. of a hat with anyone who takes

issue. A'WIIP/l stated that Corletto had just returned from a

pleasure trip to Moscow and that if anything, was even more pro-

West and pro-American after this experience. (Follow up soonest)

•. UNSANFT/19 Gas-Light Club Nembership

(1) It has suggested. previously that 1907IP/1 buy

0Z

QUNAFT/19 a membership in the Paris Gas-Light Club as i gesture

al friendship and good Will. CiSSWArUN, decording to AMlIP/s,

enjoys the Gas-Light Club and its attractively dressed (or

undressed, as the case may be) hostesses. It is noted for the

record that Jester Sanchez Originally had had the idea that it

might be possible to use this Gas-Light Membership in order to put

& willing, witting, ind attractive roman against (lSSNAFT/19 to

attempt the type of classic operation.

In other words, the Cubans in the interest of cconomy are prepared

to saerifice a degree of security. AMHIP/A stated that if we

a had a girl who could handle this assignment, he would be willing to

propose her employment to (rsssArt/10. (This ne should sollow up

soonest).

This lead also was receired by cable according to

p subsequent to the undersigned's leaving WH/Cuba.

3. Security

There were no instances of a security nature to be reported.

However, it is the recommendation of the undersigned that the

res case officer/s conduct their meetings with ANNHIP/I away from

his office as much as possible. There was no reason to believe

that any of AMMlIP/l's employees have overheard any conversations

in the past, but they probably are well avare that the undersigned

is not alkays calling on AMMIIP/l to discuss strictly commercial

matters.

Since there may be a change in the complexion of the

AMLASH/1 operation and an increased operational use of AMMIlP/1

in Europe, it would be well to vary the pattern of meetings with

1M1IP/1. There is probably no danger in calling on him at his

office occasionally, but prolonged conversations and too frequent

meetings with the new case officer on the premises should be

avoided.
