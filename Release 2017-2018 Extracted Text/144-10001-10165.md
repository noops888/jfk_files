CUBAN STATEMENT ON VISA FOR OSWALD

25 Nov 63

3.:

I am reproducing below the note given to the press by

with relation to the informat on. publtsned today it the

newspaper Excalsion in Mexicr Cicy, affirming that LEF pARVEY:

OSWALD had requested a transit visa for travel to the Soviet

Union at the Cuban Consulate ir. Mexico in Seprember, the Caban

Governent regestad informat lon from the officials of aut t

Consulate in that city confirming that it 1s

certain: that;

MK. LEE HARVEY OSWALD requested the transit visa for treelito

the Soviet Undon on 27 September in the said Consulate.

44USC2107(5)(g)(2)(D

On being informed

1, by

the consular officials that their

office could not

grant

'such a visa without the authorization:

of the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Relations, which likewise

would not grant it lf it was not previously authorized by the

country of destination, Mr.. OSWALD left the Consulate vistöly

disgusted.

The said visa was never granted.

This detail, in connection with the other circumstance le

that surround the facts, confirm our suspicion that the

assassimation of KENNEDY was a provocation against world peace,

perfectly and thoroughly planned by. the

most reactionary sectors

It is evident that these sectors planned beforehand to

involve Cuba and the Soviet Union in these deeds.

The Inconceivable and irexplicable impunity with which an

individual of known penal antecedents

assassinated OSWALD, ther

principal

accused of the assassination of President KENNEDYy 10

the presence of the police thenselves and in the (5G) of a

prison, denonstrates in a scandalous and indisputable nanner 23

chat the powerful reactionary polltical forces within the

Unitad States are naking use of all their resources and influences

In order to conceal those who master-minded KENNEDY's assassination,

and the true motives for it.

world public opinion demands the enlightening of the deeds:

It is absurd that the political authorittes and the prosecuting

attorney of Dallas have declared that the case is closed when

hardly 48 hours have passed since a deed of so great a result as

the assassination of the President of the United States.

Regards.
