to some newspaper articles, particularly. the "Scott-Allen

period of 111ness, MORA rerused to discuss any political

matters and her entire atcention was absorbed by her iliness

and her household chores.

Her refusal to discuss matters

was,

therefore, not limited merely to the OSWALD case. C. l

Informants further advised that CHARLES SMALL 1S

some time and that OSWALD must have visited SMAL's store

while in Mexico Ci

visit to Mexico,

accoraing to the intormants, has created

even more fright anong sone of the ACM assoclates by

taking the position that, of course, the assassination of

President KENNEDY was a plot, implying the involvement of

the Cubans. (Cans
