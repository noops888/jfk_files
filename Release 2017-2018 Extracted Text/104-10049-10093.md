Ref:

Resale of U.S. Surplus Military Eguipment

TMM-W-1473 -200-7-54-51

Mr. Jack LAMONT, named in reference as one of the principals

in a transaction involving the purchase of surplus U.S. military equipment for

resale to Delmont, A.G., of Vadus, Lichtenstein; has been the subject of former

Investigations on the part of the U.S. Ireasury Department, the FBI, and the

Embassy Political Section. A review of references to him in the files of these

offices indicates that he bas a generally shady reputation but has not been

Involved in any subversive activities inimical to the interests of the U. S.

LAVONT may be described as a promoter who 1s willing to participate in any shady

or 1ll1clt operation where he stands a chance of making money, but it appears

unlikely that he is motivated in his activities by any pro-Soviet or pro-Coumunist

sentiment

Regarding the deal in question, which the Treasury has inves

tigated In detall (see Attachment I), LAMONT told the Treasury representative

on 26 March 1951 that the transaction had never come about. In an Interview on

that date in the office of the Treasury representative, LAMONT confirmed all of

the information contained in Attachment 1. LAMONT stated further that the

and on to da best vote rotat aton the Merican abase a lach to,

with the help of e(Mr.) Kenneth MILlER of that city. However, it was not possible

to obtain the necessary permits from the U.S. Goverment and the whole trans

action fell through, according to LAMONT. No purchases or sales were made, at.

least Via the lexican channel, and fig money changed hands. As far as LAMONt:

knows, the matter is completely deal. (Confirmation of the fact that the arm

export permit was refused by Washington has been received since by the Treasury

representative)

Attachment 2'is a photographic copy of a memorandum from the

FBI to the Ireasury Department representative, dated 31 May 1951, which gives

some background Information on LAMONT and his wife.

The most recent report concerning LAMONT Came from the American

Consulate, Merida, Tucatan, to the American Ambassador, dated 20 July 1951. This

report deals with the difficulties which LAMONT and his partner were experiencing

in the operation of a shrimp fishing enterprise off the Mexican Gulf Coast. The:

report is long and Involved, and 1s of no Intelligence interest except in so far
