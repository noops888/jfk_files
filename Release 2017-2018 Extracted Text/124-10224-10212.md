The above information concerning the meeting and GOMEZ' statement

is considered as administrative in nature and is furnished for the Bureau's

rumored to be back in Miami; BONDS said that INS was trying to verify this

sihce if it were true, SANCHEZ ARANGO had doubtless re-entered the U.S.

illegally.

On the evening of 5-8-52, Cuban Minister of Defense NICOLAS. PEREZ

HERNANDEZ requested SA CLARK D. ANDERSON of this office to call at the

Ministry as soon as possible. ANDERSON had previously met the Minister

through an office contact and friend, LUIS CASTELLANOS, who has a very

close connection with the Minister®

PEREZ advised that the Cuban Air Force had verified that MURPHY

had landed at a point known as Loma Colorado in the Province of Oriente,

Cuba, where two men, believed to be SANCHEZ ARANGO and RODRIGUEZ SANTOS,

had left the plane. He said that he had subsequently received information

which he considered completely reliable to the effect that SANCHEZ ARANGO

had come into Havana. He said that they had just received information that

SANCHEZ ARANGO had gone back to Miami and requested that this office

endeavor to verify this fact inasmuch as they desired to continue the search

for SANCHEZ ARANGO if he was still in Cuba®

The Minister was told that

SANCHEZ ARANGO is the subject of an INS inquiry in Miami and that in the

event he is located in Miami, he will be advised.

An extra copy of this letter together with a copy of GOMEZ'

memorandum of 5952 is attached for forwarding to the Miami office. It

is being left to the discretion of the Bureau as to whether copies of the

Re: Opposition to BATISIA Government

Reference is made to the conference held in the office of the Ambassador

Ambassador, entitled "JUNIA REVOLUCIONARIA CONSTITUCIONAL"

In connection with the above, enclosed herewith are photostatic copies of

that this communication may be pertinent to the contents of Mr. SPEARS'

At the moment, the only information this office, has been able to secure on

MENORANDUM FOR MR. CRAIN

Re:

Opposition to BATISTA Government

Reference is made to the conference held in the office of the Ambassador

on 7 May, attended by the Ambassador, yourself, Colonel PITTS, Mr. SPEARS, and

the undersigned. At this meeting a secret memorandum sent by Mr. SPEARS to the

Ambassador, entitled "JUNIA REVOLUCIONARIA CONSTITUCIONAL", was discussed.

In connection with the above, enclosed herewith are photostatic copies of

an envelope (Exhibit A) and enclosures addressed to "Srta. Violeta CANO,

Empedrado 211, Apt. 18, Habana, Cuba", postmarked Miami, Florida, 8:30 P.Mo,

23 March 1952, the envelope bearing return address "Hotel Vereen,

313315 North

Miami Ave., Miami, Florida" and a notation under the AIR MAIL sticker,

Rosa."

This envelope and contents were intercepted in the mail. It is possible

that this communication may be pertinent to the contents of Mr. SPEARS'

memorandum.

At the moment, the only information this office, has been able to secure on

the addressee, Violeta CANO, is that her father, Prospero CANO, is a radio

operator employed by Western Union in Habana.

As of possible interest, a study of the enclosed exhibits indicates the

following:

Exhibit B is a piece of stationery from the Hotel Vereen, in which were

enclosed txhibits O through K.

Exhibit C apparently concerns the location where Gervasio Street meets

Avenida de Maceo (also known as the Malecon) • The small circles on this plan

describe the traffic buttons which divide the westbound traffic from the eastbound

traffic on this wide avenue.

A study of this drawing would lead one to believe

that the "x-s" represent armed men, the little squares marked "1 - 2 - 1 - 2" are

automobiles without drivers which would be used to block traffic.

The "y-s"

representing men on foot here total 14, which total when added onto the number of

men included in the other exhibits brings the grand total of men to be used in

operation to 230, which coincides with the figure represented on Exhibit D.

which of the stations are to be the targets.

Exhibit F apparently is a plan to take Cuban Naval Headquarters, and the

figures are self-explanatory. It is interesting to note that there also

appears a notation that 10 navy uniforms are to be used.

Exhibit A A "peloton" apparently refers to a group of 10 men, 4 armed with.

M-l rifles, I with a machine gun, 5 with pistols and 2 with hand grenades,

which will be used where necessary.

Exhibit H refers to the radio stations RHC, CMQ, Union Radio, and Radio

There are certain discrepancies in the arms total as represented on the separate

exhibits, and the grand total represented on Exhibit D.

For example, Exhibit D

shows a total of 35 machine guns to be used, whereas a study of the various
