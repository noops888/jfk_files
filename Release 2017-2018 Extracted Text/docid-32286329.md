I. BACKGROUND

A. Residence

ANTHONY JOSEPH ACCARDO

Former CG 6261-C advised SA JOHN . ROBERTS,, JR.,

on March 7, 1960, that TONY ACCARDO continues to reside at

915 Franklin, River Forest,

Illinois.

River Forest is a

suburb of Chicago, situated just west of Chicago.

On March 10, 1960, a vehicle bearing 1960 Illinois

license 736 was observed by SA ROBERTS parked in the driveway

of 915 Franklin, River Forest, Illinois. This vehicle

915 Franklin, River Forest,

1s registered to C. ACCARDO' is noted that CLARICE ACCARDO

Illinois, on a Pontiac.

is the wife of TONY ACCARDO.

GUS ALEX

A.C. JAWOREK, the building manager of the Murray

Hill Apartments, 4300 North Marine Drive, Chicago, was

contacted by SA WILLIAM F. ROEMER on March 16, 1960.

Mr.

JAWOREK has been contacted numerous times in the past and has

advised previously that ALEX has resided in the Murray Hill

Apartments since approximately 1946. He resides there

under the pseudonym of MICHAEL RYAN in apartment 1001 with

his wife,' MARIANNE RYAN ALEX.

Mr. JAWOREK advised that

"RYAN" continues to reside in apartment 1001 and that he

saw him in the building on approximately March 14, 1960.

MI. JAWOREK advised that ALEX has not as yet renewed his

lease which will come up for renewal in April and that he

will keep this office advised concerning this situation.

FRANK FERRARO

JOE VAN MEENIN, building engineer of the apartment

building at 320 Oakdale, Chicago,

advised SAs MARSHALL E.

RUTLAND and ROEMER on March 14, 1960, that FRANK FERRARO

continues to reside under his

true name in apartment 1801

at 320 Oakdale.

very shortly by airplane for his Miami area residence. HUMPHREYS

then asked GODFREY:

"How much is my bill over there at the

hotel?" By GODFREY's answer it was apparent that HUMPHREYS

was at that time residing in the St. Clair Hotel in Chicago

through arrangements made for him by GODFREY.

CG 6343-C* advised on January 28, 1960, that on

that date HUMPHREYS was in conversation with Chicago top

hoodlum JOEY GLIMCO. They discussed the fact that on the

following Sunday evening they intended to have dinner and

take in the floor show at Mangum's Chateau, a night club

and restaurant located on Ogden Avenue in Lyons, Illinois,

just west of Chicago. GLIMCO indicated to HUMPHREYS that

he would call him Sunday morning concerning arrangements

for travelling to Lyons and asked him what room he was

staying in. HUMPHREYS told him that he was residing in

room 14E.

It is noted that information has

been developed

previously that HUMPHREYS and the other Chicago top hoodlums

frequently meet at the St. Clair and have conferences therein.

It has also been developed

that-HENRY SUSk, concerning whom

information is set out hereinbelow under the caption "Associates",

maintains a permanent room, 14E, at the St. Clair Hotel under

the name of JOE HENRY. Former PCI TURA SATANA, & well known

burlesque dancer, has advised SA ROEMER that as of February,

1960, SUSK continued to rent room 14E on a permanent basis

and that he told her that he rents this room for friends

of his who may come into town and who do not desire to

register with the management of the hotel in order that

no record will be kept of their presence in Chicago.

CG 6343-C* has advised that on three occasions HUMPHREYS

has discussed with other Chicago top hoodlums the fact

that they are "protected, from the owner on down" at the

St. Clair Hotel.

210 Harbor Drive

Key Biscayne, Florida

CG 6343-C* on January 26, 1960, advised that or

that date HUMPHREYS engaged in & short conversation with his

associate JIMMY CELANO. CELANO

had just returned from a short

It would appear that HUMPHREYS referred to the

health of ALEX in view of the fact that information has

previously been developed that during the past nine months

or so ALEX has been extremely concerned with his health

and has been virtually "retired" from activities involving

the Chicago Crime Syndicate as is set out elsewhere: in

the cover pages of this report under the caption "Travel".

It is noted that ALEX has spent very little time in Chicago

during recent months.

MURRAY HUMPHREYS

Concerning the status of HUMPHREYS health,

reference is made to the comment of HUMPHREYS reported

immediately above concerning his

remarks to GIANCANA

that "the older I get the better I get".

CG 6343-C* advised on January 26, 1960, MURRAY

HUMPHREYS had a brief conversation with PAT MARCI, nicago y

co Alderman JOHN D'ARCO, of the lst Ward, City of

MARCI asked HUMPHREYS how he felt and HUMPHREYS told him

that he felt 'pretty good: I have that trouble at night.

Keeps me up half the night. They give me some medicine

that works pretty good."

On January 28, 1960, HUMPHREYS told JOEY GLIMCO,

according to CG 6343-C*, that he "had a bad night last night".

C. Marital Status

MURRAY HUMPHREYS

As has been set out labove under the caption "Residence"

in reference to HUMPHREYS residence in Key Biscayne, Florida,

information has been developed by the Miami Office Indicating

that HUMPHREYS is residing in Key Biscayne, in & house which

may value $70,000.

This house is owned ostensibly by one

BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT, who is believed to be the present wife

of MURRAY HUMPHREYS, although it is not known that HUMPHREYS

had benefit of a civil or religious ceremony to bind their

relationship. However,

information has been developed through

former PCI

that HUMPHREYS divorced his wife of

36 years in the summer o1

1957 and that shortly thereafter he

married a younger woman

woman referred to byl

It would appear that the younger

is

BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT.

On March 3, 1960, SA ROBERT F. FETZNER of the

Miami Office observed a woman leave the residence of

HUMPHREYS at 210 Harbor Drive in Key Biscayne, Florida,

driving a 1959 Thunderbird.

SA FETZNER observed that

this woman was white, age, middle 30's, 5'6" in height,

135 pounds, blond hair. It is noted that this woman

exactly fits the discription of HUMPHREYS wife which

was given by former PCI

and by HENRY VAN DERKERKHONE,

the manager of the apartment building where HUMPHREYS

maintains an apartment in Chicago, with the exception

that both

and' VAN DERKERKHONE advised that HUMPHREYS

new wife was approximately 5'2' or 5'3" in height.

On March 4, 1960, ROBERT WALL, Director of

Personnel, Florida Light and Power Company, Miami, advised

that his company as of that time was furnishing service

to a Mrs. LEWIS HART at 210 Harbor Drive in Key Biscayne,

and has furnished said service since April 23, 1959. _It

is

noted that VAN DERKERKHONE, above, advised that residing

with HUMPHREYS and his wife in apartment 1001 at 4200 North

Marine Drive in Chicago last spring was an individual

who used the name HART.. It is also noted that HUMPHREYS

has previously used the first name of LEWIS.

therefore,

It would

seem that it is very possible that "Mrs.

LEWIS HART"', BETTY JEANNE NEIBERT and HUMPHREYS Wife

are one and

the same person.

II. CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

Information appearing under this caption is set

but in other activities of interest to the Chicago Crime

Syndicate. It is believed that this information will show

that these five hoodlums have many interests which interlock

and which thereby show the existence of the Chicago Crime

Syndicate and the activities of these individuals in support

of the Chicago Crime Syndicate.

advised SA HARRY A: WALKER On

that over the past several wonths he has

heard rumors that SAM GIANCANA and WILLIE "Potatoes" DADDANO

had been bucking one another for control of the Chicago

Crime Syndicate which has been left vacant by ANTHONY J.

ACCARDO.

This PCI advised that ROBERT PRANNO, who was

placed in power as the front man for the Aurora - Kane

County Amisement Company, would lose his position 1f

DADDANO achieves eminence over GIANCANA, 1n view of

the fact that PRANNo was placed in this position by

GIANCANA.

It is noted that information obtained from

CG 6343-c* and other informants who are in a better

position to have information concerning the setivities of

GIANCANA have not indicated that there is any dispute

botreen GIANCANA, DADDANO and ACCARDO.

HUMPHREYS:

Then say I won't be

available until Thursday.

I'll be around; but no lunch.

Then they can't

say to one another, well Thursday is the

"day.

just do it ourselves.

Then if we want to go out and talk to MooneY,

or want to go out West, we can catch them,

them, and go over, and we've

I think that's your best bet, FRANK.

Then if

you've got & problem, you call me, and say,

meet me at so and so, and then I meet you.

We go over to the car or go over to HENRY

SUSK's, or where ever it is, and we talk about

whatever it is, and then break up.

FERRARO:

That's a good idea.

HUMPHREYS:

Because this every day, every day, one day,

near elections, they'll try to catch every

body

together:

that the above reference to "HENRY

SUSK's" is to a suite which HENRY SUSK maintains in the St. Clair

Hotel under the name of JOE HENRY. This suite is located at the

southeast corner on the fourteenth floor of the hotel and is

numbered 14E.

It is noted that information concerning HENRY

SUSK is set out herein above under the caption "Associates",

sub-caption

"HENRY SUSK"

In February, 1960, TURA SATANA, one of the leading

burlesque dancers in

the United States,

advised SA ROEMER that

she has been intimately associated with HENRY SUSK for the past

several years and that he has advised her that he maintains

Room 14E in the St. Clair Hotel, not particularly for his own

use, but for the use of his associates

who, when they visit

Chicago, do not like to register in a hotel

so that a record

will be kept of their presence in Chicago.

Miss SATANA furnished

a floor plan of the suite maintained by SUSK and it was noted that

it consists of a bedroon, living room,

and bath.

CG 6343-C* advised that on March 8, 1960, FRANK

FERRARO went over the expenses which were incurred during the

month of February by his bodyguard and runner, HY GodFrEY.

During the course of the conversation, it became apparent

that GODFREY was given a "thousand dollar bank roll" every

month in order to meet the expenses incurred by him in running

errands and making telephone calls for the Chicago top hoodlums.

In tallying the bills submitted by GODFREY in

explanation for his expenses, FERRARO was heard to comment,

"St. Clair, cab, $85.00":

CG 6343-C* advised on March 7, 1960, that on that date HY

GODFREY

asked FRANK FERRARO if he should meet him at "three

o'clock in the lobby?" and FERRARO replied "second floor".

GODFREY apparently was used to meeting FERRARO in the lobby

and in order to confirm FERRARO expected to meet him in the

"What do you want to do if he doesn't show?

Now if he's in

there at 3:30 that means I gotta meet you and see you tonight".

: Informant advised that it was apparent to him that FERRARO and

GODFREY intended to meet someone at the St. Clair Hotel at

3:30 p.m.

Normandy. Lounge

CG 6343-C* advised on January 18, 1960, that on that

date, SAM GIANCANA was asked by an unknown individual, possibly

RAY NICCOLAI,

where FERRARO waS and GIANCANA replied "he went

to Washington".

It is believed that GIANCANA referred to the

Normandy Lounge which 1s lochted on Washington Street just west

of LaSalle Street, across the street from City Hall in Chicago's

Loop.

has advised SA ROEMER that this is a.

well known meeting place for FERRARO, ALEX, and Alderman JOHN

D'ARCO and other political figures in Chicago in view of the fact

France,

SEELEY advised her

1960, and returned to her..

It is noted that under her passport

regulations, she may use this passport for lawful travel until

1t expires February 24, 1962, Whenever and as often as desired

without turther notification to the Department of State.

It is noted that ACCARDO has passport number 1282923

which was issued on December 12, 1958 and which will be valid

until December 12, 1960.

GUS ALEX

CG 6343-C*

advised on February 12, 1960, that on that

date Alderman JOHN D'ARCO of the lst Ward, City of Chicago, made

a comment to JOHN T. "SANDY" O'BRIEN, International Vice-

President of the Teamsters Union, as follows:

"You know where SLIM goes?" He goes over here to

Colorado to Sun Valley.

They got a hospital there and everything.

They got as abulance there and everything".

It is noted that D'ARCO's reference to SLIM 1s a

reference to GUS ALEX, who is known to his associates as SLIM.

It is apparent that D'ARCO is confused about the location of sur

Valley inasmuch as it is located in Idaho rather than in Colorado.

The fact that they have a hospital there would apparently refer

to the fact that ALEX has been in very poor health in recent

months and possibly utilized the services of a hospital in Sun

Valley.

On March 15, 1960, PCI ALANSON J. KLINE, Accounting

Department;

Sun Valley Operations, advised that guest records set

forth the following information regarding GUS ALEX:

cancelled out and ALEX

FRANK FERRARO

CG 6343-C* advised on March 1, 1960 that on that date
