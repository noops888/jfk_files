MEMORANDUM FOR:

THROUGH

SUBJECT

: C10s, 638, Frankfurt

: Notification of Designation as a Participant in the Organization

Retirement and Disability System

REFERENCE

: Book Dispatch 5098 dated 12 August 1065

1. You have been found to be qualified as a participant in the Organization Kellrement

and Disability Systein and have been so designated effective 25 Beptember 1966.

2. Although such designation under present statutes is viewed favorably by most persons,

the regulation governing this retirement system gives the Indlvldual the right to appeal such

a determination I he deems the designation adverse to his best interests.

In order that this

technical requirement may be satisfind, you are hereby notifled of four right to appeat. An

appeal with reasons therefore must be received in Headquarters within 60 days of the date of

this memorandum or acceptance of designation will be assumed.

Any questions that you may

have in connection with your designation that cannot be answered by referring to referenced

Book Dispatch should be forwarded to Headquarters.

3. We believe that the benefits of the Organization Retirement System are superior to the

benefits of the Civil Service Retirement System.

However, there are a few situations in which

an employee at the time of retirement may have so many years of service (almost 37) that he

would receive a higher annulty under the Civil Service System.

Because of this, the policy

decision has been made that a participant in the Organization System who would receive &

higher annuity under the Civil Service System may, not later than one year prior to his retire-

ment, apply to be removed from our system and transferred to the Civil Service System.

Thus,

ou should not anticipate flits contingency. as a factor In deciding whether you regard you

esignation as a participant adverse to your best interest

TO

: Harold F. Swenson

SUBJECT: TDY in the Dominican Ropublic

Most of you who went down to the Dominican Republic

departed with so much speed.and

SO

little ceremony

that

there was no time to explain

the importance and urgency

of your assignments.

Now that you have served there

during the

crisis,

the importance

of the task necds no

embellishment from

tribution

US,.

but you should know that the con-

of the augmented Station was decisive in shaping

the policies and actions

of the government and in avoiding

several major mistakes.

For weeks after the April revolu

tong

our Station reporting was literally the only source

of information that the United States had on the role of

Communism among the rebel forces and on conditions outside

the capital.

Many fine things were done in the Station and in the

hinterland by all of you,

Manning the check-points under.

fire, flying to remote and hostile villages, moving tons

of supplies through the gauntlet of the communications

country's only corno link -- all

toiling over midnight reports, and keeping open our

these things were common-

place.

The dedication, discipline, and routine of our

personnel placed them in a class apart.

To the sense of pride and

accomplishment you must

already feel, I want

to add the gratitude and admiration

of the DDP and of the Agency.

During much of the reporting perlod, Nr. Swenson has been on

TDY overseas attempting

to recruit

member's

of the Cuban Intelligence

Service:

In these endeavors he has had noteworthy success.

Also

during this period Mr. Swerson and his staff developed the first

comprehensive picture

of the Cuban intelligence structure and

organizational details.

These results were due to Mr.

Swenson's

diive, experience, and ability.

As stated in my previous

report

on Mr. Swenson,

"he is

impatient with colleagues and collaborators

whom he feels do not measure up to his own high standards."

This

continues to. lead to personal friction and detracts

from his many

capabilities, I bolieve he is best suited

as a senior high-level

operations officer or the chief of a small active station rather

than as a staff officer.

He handles funds and manpower prudently.
