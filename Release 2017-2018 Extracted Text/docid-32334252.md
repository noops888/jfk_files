willing to do this, he could furnish voluminous information

concerning matters of a criminal intelligence nature, as

well as concerning shipments of both legitimate and crooked

gambling paraphernalia throughout varied points in the

unknown, and stated he intended to immediately contact KRESS

to determine his attitude toward cooperation with Bureau
