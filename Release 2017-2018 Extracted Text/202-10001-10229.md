General Lansdale gave an Interim report on the progress

of stepping up recruitment of Cubans into the U. S. Army. He said

the consensus is that there are not more than a thousand

suitable

individuals from whom additional recruits could be selected.

The

Attorney General commented that the President wishes to have a large

number.

General Lansdale said that various alternatives for training

of such Cubans are being looked into.

It was agreed that such a cadre of Cubans would be an asset

to the U.S., which might be used in a number of ways. General

Lansdale, supported by General Taylor, pointed out that in this

connection the matter of holding the Individuals and giving them

useful employment after they are trained is an important and a

difficult one.

2.

Mr. Harvey gave a rundown on progress to date with agent

teams and in the general field lf intelligence, including the

Opa-Locka interrogation cente

He outlined vart

-difficulties encountered, and said

that chree

ent teams have been infiltrated and that five W/T sets

are in place.

Approximately 72 accual or potential reporting sources

are also in place. [A significant development is that Major Duque has

refused to allow agents responsive to him to be dispatched on purely

intelligence-gachering missions. (This sort of attitude had been

forecast earlier as a possibility, but it now assumes particular im-

portance in view of Duque's stature.)

3. ^ Me. Harvey also coumented on che two atrempts made to incrude

Into Havana IV programs.

The Group asked that a check be made, as

soon as possible, on how effective these operations were. They also

asked that a copy of the scripts used be made available. The Group

felt that it is worthwhile to check this capability out, as is now

being done, but questioned whether once proved effective it should

perhaps be kept in reserve for a more meaningful time.
