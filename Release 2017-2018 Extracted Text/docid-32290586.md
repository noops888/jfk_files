Re reports of SA J. ROBERT PEARCE dated January

30, 1961 and March 22, 1961, at

Philadelphia.

CG 6343-C* on September 8, 1959, advised that

ANTHONY J. ACCARDO and SAMUEL J. GIANCANA, in discussing

a nine or twelve man "commission", named JOE ZERILLI

from Detroit

as

Lash member.

JOSEPNY

ZERILLI, 702 Middlesex, Grosse Pointe

Party,

was born December 11,

1897, at

and

entered the United States March 14, 1914. He was

active in the liquor traffic at Detroit during prohibition

days, later accumulated considerable wealth from legitimate

enterprises, and is considered a so-called "elder statesman"

among Italian hoodlums in Detroit.

DE 370-C has

advised that ZERILLI has the final

word in settling disputes among Sicilian and Italian

gamblers in Detroit and is probably the top local policy-

maker.

DE 370-C expressed the opinion that if there is a

national crime syndicate, ZERILLI would be the Detroit

representative handling policy matters with representatives

from other cities.

Other Informants agree that ZERILLI has the final

word in arbitrating local disputes.

It is to be noted that ZERILLI's son, ANTHONY

ZERILLI, is married to the daughter of JOSEPH PROFACI of

New York (also named as a "commission" member).
