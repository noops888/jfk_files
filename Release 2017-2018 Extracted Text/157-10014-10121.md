and he has this committer for this purpose in trying to place

responsibilitv squarely on him in do that.

Now this would not mean, however, that the Secretary of

Now, the next parran!.? -

Mr. Kirbow. Could "e taka these one at a time hecause

these

are rather critical

Mr. Chairman, one of the things that came before this

Committee when

I quess it was it. Colhy testifving and at each

menting that Mr. Miller ard the staff had with the people from

the white House and the cin when we

and being able to expend them without a treat big red tape

If, as navid. savs: his recommeridation here is to prevent

renrogrammina.. excent within verv narrowly defined statutory

limits. is a first sten toward restricting that further

activitv. I would like to excent on this and have it discussed

before the Full Committee, or in the absence of that, or

connected with it, have the record that ve have that shows us

that we should restrict by loriclation here -

Senator Huddleston.

What is the major thrust there?

Is it to in fact limit or rectrict or is it to actually have

it defined and specified in the statute as to what circumstances

miaht nrevail?

Me. Aaron. The thrust here is as follows. The liCI

can now recroram car lin his own agency to come crtent.

Senator Huddleston. No can't take scmething out of the

Man now and put it over?

Mr. Aaron. No. Me

can't do that. But in his new

responsihilities as DCI for preparing the budget of the entire

national intelligence program. he will now be in a position to

reproaram the entire hudoet and therefore. it's a much larger

kind of flexibility.

Now the thrust of thir particular pronosal is not really

aimed, this particular mo :... later one ve do have one which

does place some constraints aud the purpose is to make it clear

where the money comes from and where it's going to ao to

make it clear to the Conoress at least.

But this particular

one simply says that hacause this is a much wider reprogramming

flexibility, that it ought to be subiect to certain kinds of

definitions and consider the limitations so that the Congress

knows what is hannening to the monevs that it appropriates for

particular nurposes.

Senator Huddleston:

ME. KirioW..

Where there is an authorizing and an

to reprogram missile money avar to aircraft, for instance, it

has

to be anproved by all fur of those committers, both

Arns serviong and hoth annanciations comnittees with the

is that the office of estimates uns created under the Eisenhower

Now I don't know there the equities lie in this thing,

Mr. Kirbow. I want to talk about the testimony that

was given before the committae on this from two of the former

nCIs. Mr. Colly, at both the broakfast briefings he gave and

in testimonv. favored the use of individual intelligence offices

around in these various arancies, originating estimates and

everything else: whereas Me.. Helms,. when he testified here,

savs I really don't know ho: that system is corking richt now.

I didn't favor it when Mr. Colby established it, and i had the

other sustem and it worked well for me.

So I think here anain you are talking about a man

staffing rennirements as thar suit the narticular times and

the individual as to how he wants to run the intelligence

community and what apparently suited Mr. Helms fine didn't

suit Mr. Colhy and he uned a different system which he says

works qreat.

And I say that that is, again, a step down thing.

Unless vou want to encourage him to do it in a recommendation

and not mandate that he do it, it kind of makes him Inn his

husiness the way you want it tun and to ne apparent abuse

problems.or anything like that.

Senator Hart.

Well, my only thought here is that some

future oversicht committe, or salect committee is gring to be

Mr. Kirbow. There', no difference of opinion between

the

former

secretaries of Defense. Everyone concedes that the

control of intelligence should no for Defense's purposes in

time of war,, the principal control.

Mr. Davis. The noint is: too, the arqument in the past

has been the Secretary of trense needs the control he has

had in order to prepare for war and now you're saving the

pet's soing to do more but vall don't vant to upset the

And this to a way of saving that we

understand that in vartime it is oin. to no back. It is more

of the work I quess on the subject being done by that group.

THinn't want the absent momber

other activities when he is the nverall director of Central

Intelligence, and that therafare this separation, his removal

from that, would be a good idea.

The second argument is that you really want to mlace the

authoritu squarely on the mur director of this agency who's

anina to ve responsible for alandestine activities. If he

still has a hoss above hir! who is kind of responsible but who

in fact because of his increased responsibilities won't be.

that he might, if he didn't havo these dreater responcihilities

one should make the linee of authority clear and place the

Now the armument arainst that is that ... well, there are

two kinds of arguments roninst. one is that the situation now

is justified and that this is a mood thim and we don't need

Tooking at what we have learned as a result oi our inquiry

and saving, in fact. this is mind to be an impediment and it

is my personal opinion and I think supported at least by some

testimony that that would he the case.

The second araument. I think, is a somewhat broader one,

and I quess

I'm not arenare to make it. Bu we're hail an

inquiry iuto the CIA, somo of ite problems. some of its

accountability problems. come of its management problems, and

as a

as beina some inconsistency to he arqued between having this

more powerful Central Intelligence Agency in every respect

Now vou can only carry that so far but it seems to me

that there te a serious muestion here as to, and it is seen in

Mr. McCone

and also Mr. Helms. Mr. Helms characterizing the

agains; divesting the director of the Aneney, although

thers

is

Let me sco if I can clarify that record a

First of all: the reoposal is not to divest him from the

The

second point is that I believe the record goes to

the question of sortina out no saparating the director as he

has to this time existed in the sort of general kind of overseer

and the kind of jawbone authority that he has had. And the

questions that have been out to the witnesses generally have

Senator Huddleston. I think that's a mood point.

Mr. Lombard. He Firit of all has to resent the budget

and that's in at least four committees. And

then he's got to

have an analvtical base, and presumahly the national estimate

function and on top of that, worrving about the day to day

onetations of the Adency.

I don't know if that is more than one may should be

asked to do.

We did not take that testimony any further than receiving his

testimony. That is, we have not taken it to che point of:

asking the agency whether in fact they have such a program

in the Southwest. So the testimony was limited to that one

charge which I personally rave some

real credibility to.

Ms. Culbreth. Can you explain just what the charge is

here? What is the wrong that has been done?

Mr, Kirbow. What's wrong with that?

That's the question!

the original suggestion. at the staft level.

The only human collecticy we are getting from behimd

the Iron Curtain in Russia today is principally either though

our cooperation with the

comnunity using

just this sort of individual and sending them back, or sending

this type of individual from this United States back inside.

we're not getting the other human intelligence.

Mr. Bader. I was only responding to the question of

what the testimony was.

To go on to the further issue which

I think is going

to be addressed by the connittee, it's not the question of

whether e should, the Contral Intelligence Agency should be

the Committee would want in take a position about recruitment

of that particular group.

Mr. diGenova. My position is this, Bill. The first

time

I heard about this was when I read it in these findings

and corclusions. I never saw a hearing on it, I never saw a

document about it, I never had a chance to comment on it as

a desianee, and I never har a chance to bring it un with my

Senator.

I'm not sure that we want to say this, ask

the Senators

to say this, without having.

something in a report about

the practice is, how it's been conducted, who has obiected to

it. what's the extent of it, before we start makiug a

recommendation.

We're saving we question the practice of recruiting.

I have no objection to the Comnittee ultimately making

statement like this, I lust don't know what the record is.

This is the first time l've ever seen this.

Mr. Bader. That's why I wanted it bracketad so it could

be so discussed.

Mr. Maxwell. I think the only question is if we r

recommend against this practice if we

don't even know

Sepator Huddleston. It hothers me that

we would indict

the Adency with such scant evidence we

have.

Mr. Aaron.

My recommendation is that we jet the Agency

on record as to whether this is the practice or not.!

Mr. Kirhon: I recommend it be dropped from this if

we had only one witness and

re're not heard the Agency or

that we develon a record to support both that and the sama

part of that first paragraph; which I con't think we have a

record on either.

Mr. Aaron. We do have a record on that. It's an

interview record, it's not a aworn testimony record. But the

first sentence: there is an interview to support that.

- Mr Kirhow.. Mr. Chairman. I think the subcommittee then

should carefully consider whether or not it is concerned about

the use of American companies in the nursuit of foreign

inteliiaenon and if so. how this innacts on anybody s rights

or otherwise.

When we talk about expresaly prohibiting penetration of

was do you have any regulations that prohihited

You from

doing the same thing with an American company? And

the answer was no, we don't, although we don't do that or

we haven't done that or

something to that effect.

That is essentially the story and how it came to pass.

Mr. Maxwell. There's some question on both of these

whether there are ways of saying things that are important

as

recommendations ithout tmolving that A, these had gone on

and B, that we have a record to support that.

There's also. I guoss, a clight question in my mina

as to the order of maanttute. of the recommendations that flow

from this in the promulantion of a specific directive.

That's slightly out of synch with the order of some of

the other reconmerdations. The Committee might want to choose

upon whether this subcommittee meets tomorrow morning, we've

arranged for representatives of the

testimony on some of these issues that have been raised, such

'as?!

the use of immigrants, some of the figures that they're given us,

and this question of penetration of American businesses.

That will be scheduled, as I say, at either ? or, 10:00

that in view of the fact that there is specific legislation

relating to that subject and that's in the Immigration Act

Mr. Bader. I've asked them to be prepared to speak to

would take the testimony right here and if need be, move it

to another room.

Senator Mathias. In the event that I should not be

able to be here, and I hone I will, I think we ought to look

at this

thing pretty.clesely.

As

Senator Huddleston said earlier, you don't recruit

these people just out of the blue unless there's some reason

for them to sign up, and I don't think we want to be too

In the meantime; of course, we can still be working on

bu the end of next week, too, then the Full Committee would

be in a position of at least having the material

available to

them if we decided to release everything at one time or 1f

I think the end of next week is probably

On the other hand. I think that before the end of the

into some enormous snas.

Mr. diGenova. Yestarday: Mr. Bolton indicated to me

when I was there that there was no way that they could complete

sources and methods review by the 15th of March, and I said

I didn't see how they could either, since they had just really

begun having access a week or so ago or whatever it was.

And they seem to think that the end of the month is probably,

considering the rewrites and a chance to look at the rewrites--

Senator Mathias. I have been independently advised of

the same thing, that the end of the month is mavhe a little

ootimistic:

Mr. Miller.

Senator Church just talked to Directo

Bush

and I talked to Mitch Rogovin Just prior and worked out an

arrangement on the question of clearances of sensitive material

and the Chairman told Mr. Bush that he will take whatever time

is required, he asked for expeditious effort on their part.

MI. Bush said that he would urge his troops onward, and he

recognized that there had been snags and difficulties. The

Chairman said that he was not going to press beyond the

capability of either side. He wants to do the proper job

and whatever time is required.

He said that he hoped that we could cooperate and work

It out so that we could fintch by the and of the month.. And

Mr. Bush said that he would make every effort to do that.

So that seers amicahir between the Chairman an! the

Director.

This is probably the most difficult task that faces

would be their job to compile it.

And that does not

exclude other functions. For example,

the analytical function is not mentioned here. This is simply

to rive it the collection function and that is because the

paper is simply organized in that fashion. It doesn't try to

step up to the whole charter, every aspect of it. We just try

to hreat it rown.

Mr.. Maxwell. Should there be a kind of nvert foreign

Intelligence which the NSC with the mechanism for allocating

priorities

within the intelligence community

should

done by the CIA?

It could under the formulation now do that.

Mr. Aaron.

That's why for examole there's one thing that

they do that's overt. Even their clandestine people abroad

do an overt collection job and that is biographic information

and that, while it was once in the State Department, was

transferred to the CIA because they have a lot of clandestine

bioaraphic Information and as a matter of centralizing and

efficiency the decision was made to move it over there.

That kind of thing would not he precluded and muld still

exist.

Now it goes on to state that in doing this ve would also

recommend authorizing the did to carry out the recruitment of

agents within the United states for this purpose.

Further to say that there would he an annual review of this

activity by the senate p'ersight committee and by the

counter-intelligence committee which we proposed be established

and has been agreed here as a recommendation of the National

Security Council.

Now the further sentence that is in brackets calls upon

the Attorney General to

certify

to the president and to:

the oversight committee that these actions are being taken in

a manner that does not violate the Constitutional rights of

American citizens or any other provision of law.

Trying to keep track of the domestic intelligence

recommendations is a little hit like painting a moving train,

but this tends to coincide with their recommendation, and the

purpose of this is obviously to place a little tighter

restriction and more authority in the hands of the Attorney

General to ensure that these domestic espionage-related actions

that are conducted on a covert or clandestine basis aré in

fact not infringing on Constitutional rights or attempting to

break the law in any way.

MI. KtIbow. You're really talking about recruitments

noir.

You're not talking shout other clandestine and covert

activities and operations?

Mr. Aaron. That's correct. It's not, for example, if

vou were to establish a hare in Florida for the purposes of

harassing Cuban shippig.

That would not come up here.

Mr. Kirbow. And the bracketed Information, Mr. Chairman,

was that I didn't feel at the time we considered this and I

asked that it be bracketed, that the Attorney General who is

never going to operate in this area alone, he is not going

to make these decisions without staff support of some description,

and if he's going to do that with people in the Department of

Tistice, which is where he gets the staff, the concern of the

people in the Agency about broadening even within their own

agency those people that know about the agent orocurements and

where they are and whom they are is of vital concern. It's

probably one of the most carefully guarded secrets. Even

Chairman?

It seems to me that one of the concerns that you have

with having the Attorney General certify in this specific

case to the

president and also to the oversight committee

is a consistent

problem that I think runs throughout our

recommendations.

On the one hand, we are describing for accountabtllty

within the Executive Branch of the proper people, and on the

other hand ve

are afraid that if we make him accuuntable, we're

alving him so much pover that they are soing to dieronard the

In this specific ribuntion, for example, we've already

Attorney General heing involved with the oversight

responsibilities. When he takes office he already has the

obligation to see that all the laws and activities of agencies

are carried out as they're supposed to be.

And in addition to that, we are proposing in another

nart of our recommendations that the general counsel and the

inspector general of the CIA he subject to

Senate confirmation

so that there are lots of other kinds of checks, and I would

just hope that as the Senators consider additional proposals

Ike this. that we don't get to the point that the Congres

is hanstringing them inside the agencies on how they carry

Each one of these standing by itself may look like.

certification or this addition chain of reporting and making

I would just urge a caution if there: are situations where we

Mr. Migenova. Mr. Chairman, I would add in that regard

that with regard to the smactic recommendation, this 18

not going down into the Ayency. This is talking about the

Attorney Ceneral who is the head of an agency, first of all,

and the history has shown that other Attorneys General who

took the same oath that.

one of the reasons was that they didn't know ahout certain

And the nurnose of this provision is to make them aware

about the legality of procedures attending

recruitment of agents and other activittes within the confines

The nrovision for confirming the inspector genaral and

it doesn't go to the prohlem of reaching down into the Agency.

Mr. Aaron. I thin! that's a fair point. The question,

I quess, the case at which the certification would run most would

add to what already, is in the sentence

preceeding it which I'

is review. by the Committee which the Attorney General is

to chair, would be the case in which the Attorney General is

aware of a particular activity, is aware that it is illegal

but fust dogsn't do anything about it on the theory that it

is somebody else's business. And he doesn't really, he doesn't

have an obligation in this category of matters to render

a indement and bring it to the attention of the President

Br

the Congress.

Senator Mathias. Why don't we say this, that the

Attorney General be required to advise the President and the

oversight committee that he is familiar with the procedures

established to accomplish this purpose and that he is not

aware of any violation of the constitution or other law in'

the execution of the action..

I think you can lay that kind of a burden on the Attorney

General .

Mr, Aaron, Would it he cossible to just make it sort:

of a

reporting function in which he said; and this is in the

same Airection, the Attorney General will he required to

advise the President and the ovarsight comnittee if he finds

Senator Huddleston. If in his opinion.

Senator Mathias: I wouldn't have any trouble with that.

Me. Maxwell. I have one other point on that paragraph

and that is it provides for annual review by the counter-

intelligence committee of the National Security Council.

I had understood we were dealing with the recruitment

of agents for the United States foreign intelligence purpoges,

and the question is whether the counter intelligence committee

which was

to focus on resoliing issues involving the bona

Eldes of defectors, issues hetween the FBI and CIA would be

the body which would have the appropriate knowledre in the

positive intelligence value, or whether it should be assigned

to a counter-intelligence function..

It's simply a question of where the responsihtlity

should be allocated for reviering those within the National

Security Council

structure, and I wasn't clear whether the

counter-intellidence committee was the appropriate one.

Mr: Aaron. Well, on that point. the purpose

of setting

un the counter-intelligence committee is essentlilly to look

at the domestic innact of our intelligonce activities, the

primary ones being in the couter intelligence field but also

The CIA sort of dues this in part as a service of

cummon concern to the in'elli ence community and in part at

least heretofore it does the prort collection function as a

service to its own analysts.

This was particularly in the early days when we had

less access

It was a very rich soures o' information for us. It still is

muite a anod and important ant coonomical source, and it's

mestion is how much it should f involved

in clandestine support and if you want to find a way to

encourage it, to. if vou will, enchasize its overt mission

over its covert mission or de vou want to put it back into

Mr. Maxwell. I have come vers mixed feelings about this
