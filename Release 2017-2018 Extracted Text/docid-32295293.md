At this meeting, MARINO stated that he owns a large

tract of land in Las Vegas and he is arranging to build a

hotel or motel, with casino, on this tract of land.

MARINO

has arranged for majority of the financing in Las Vegas and

currently has half the remaining amount.

MARINO proposes for

CARLOS MARCELLO to put up the other half of this unknown

amount. At this meeting, CARLOS MARCELLO insisted that he

should

put up the whole amount of this downpayment and that

MARINO should be his manager in this deal.

During ensuing

argument, JOSEPH MARCELLO shouted to MARINO

"We're not ready

to take you out of the Sands Hotel yet".
