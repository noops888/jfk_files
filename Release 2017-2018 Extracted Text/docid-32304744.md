We have received a request from the Department for a list of

all individuals named by former NY 3864-C-TE as members of La Cosa

Nostra. This source was Alfredo Sanantonio, member of the Carlo

Gambino "family" in this organization, who was the victim of a gang

slaying in Brooklyn, New York, on July 11, 1963. Sanantonio had

furnished us extremely valuable information on La Cosa Nostra,

including the identities of a large number of its leaders and other

members. In making this request, the Department did not specify what

use they intend to make of such a list.

New York is now completing a summary report covering

recent developments in the investigation of this organization across the

country, which should contain some of the data requested by the

Department. It was necessary that a few amendments be made in this.

report and when New York has completed these changes, the report will

receive further careful review at the Bureau.

ACTION:

We are not disseminating material to the Department at this

time on La Cosa Nostra. While we do not propose to give the Department

a blow-by-blow account of information developed concerning this organiza-

tion, nevertheless, since the Department does know we have been investigat-

ing;, if approved,

this voluminous report, after a lapse of time for careful

review at the Seat of Government will be routinely disseminated-to the

Department.
