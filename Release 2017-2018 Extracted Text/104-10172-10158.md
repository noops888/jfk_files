Headquarters Corment. TDGSDB-3/650,267, of 23 May 1962, fran the same source,

reported that Efigenio Amjetras, former poiice chief, had been appointed

chief of Fidel Castro's personal guard.

The foliowing is the sourcelg

personal opinion of mejoiras and his influence within the Cuban Government.

1. Eligento Amejolras! abilities are linited. He 1s capable of being

a radio squad-car man, but not a polico chief. He 1s trulgar sootsultere

type who reportedly formerly used marihuana. However, he showed great

bravery in the Sierra Maestra and 1s a very old friend of Castro.

2. Castro probably permits Amejejras to take an open anti-Coummist stand

partially because it pleases Castro to show tolerance and at the same

time to Ignore the disapproving attitude of the Coumnist leaders, and

partially becauso Castro does not take Anojeirag! anti-Communian seriously.

Ame foiras 1s almust 11literate and opposes Coummiem because it 1s too

complicated for him to undsrstand. His opposition 1s ineffective.
