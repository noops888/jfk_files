else to whom we disseminate it.. It is

Labeled TOY SECKET. However, even such a

high classification seems to be no bar

today to a leak, and should this leak out

it will add iuel to a mattor which may

already be in the cards as a

political

issue during the forthcoming Presidential

Memorandum

TO

MR. BELIVIONT

DATE: Cctober 25, 1963

FROM:

C. A. EVANS

SUBJECT:

COMMUNISM AND THE

NEGRO MOVEMENT

The Attorney General telephoned at approximately a. a.m.

He advised that he had tried to call the Director who was temporarily out of

the building. The Attorney General stated he had just learned that the Army

had received a copy of a report submitted to the Attorney General about the

communist activities of Martin Luther King.

The Attorney General was reich ap

to the report captioned "Communism and the Negro Movement -- & Current.

Analyses, " dated October 16, 1963.

There is no question this is the report

to which he is referring:

although he persisted on calling it the report on the

communist background of Martin Luther King.

•..

The Attorney. General said he would like to know what other

dissemination was made of this report in addition to the Army and the purpose

for such dissemination. He was obviously irritated. He went on to.ask if the

Army got copies of all reports submitted to him.. I told the Attorney General that

obviously the Army did not get copies of all reports we sent to him personally,

but that there were hundreds of reports that did go to the Army that did not

concern matters of sufficient importance to warrant the Attorney General's persona?

attention. I pointed out to him that we regularly submitted some type of reports

lin matters of current interest under our internal Security jurisdiction, and that

dissemination of these summaries was made to the military authorities as well

as other top governmental officials because of responsibilities they have in this

connection.

The Attorney General asked what responsibilities the Army had in

{relation to the communist background of Martin Luther King. I told the Attorney

General the report went beyond this and that the Army had an interest in communist

(activities particularly in relation to racial matters because the military had to be

callcd'on if civil disturbances arising out of such matters went beyond the ability

'of the civilian authorities.

This explanation seemed to serve no purpose.' The Attorney General

said he still could not understand why we sent a report to the Army on King's

communist activities. He reiterated his request for information as to the dissemina

tion of the report in question and the purpose for it.

This memorandum recommends that the National Science

Foundation (NST) be furnished information concerning the

communist influence exerted on the Southern Christian Lendership

Conference (SCIC) and its President, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jx.

This appears necessary since the SCIC has been contacted by the

NSE for the purpose of obtaining applicants for southern schools:

has furnished information that

was advised that the MiSt

desired qualified applicants to enter the University of

and other schools in southern states where the ast has its

progran in progress.

was advised that the NSf was

contacting organizations such as the SCIC and other civil rights

srouns to bandie the cecrement progran for Negre sturianis since

they

did not want it to appear that the Sr was

attenpting ta

put regro applicants in southern schools.

was advised that each qualified applicant

1. Fould receive a $3,000 scholarship from the MST. Since this

is a Government project any expenses incurred. in this matter

"would not come out of anyone's pocket."

This would adicate

that any expenses incurred by the SCIC in their recruitment

effort would be paid for with Government funds.

The communist intluences exerted on King are well

Known to the Bureau.

would only ggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. leland J. Hanorth, Director,

risE, should be furnished infornation regarding

communist

Iniluences excited on the scue and king. In this regard

we accently disseminated to the White House and

the

heads of the incolligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

sunnary entitled "Connunism and the legro loverent--A

Curgent Analysis" which contains information regarding the

SCiE a d King.

This summary doole with king's communist

connections and'|technical surveillance information) With the

receint of this sunnary by Di. Haworth, the SCIC would

program to obtain qualified

negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the SCIc participation.

In the NST progran is being sepazately disseminated to the

Department and interested intelligence agencies.

RECO: WINDATION:

There is attached for approval a letter to

DI. Icland do Haworth, Director, ast, transmittzng & copy

RE:

U. S. Government are involved. The Atlanta Office has

recommended that

be

advised concerning this matter. This appears inadvisable

since

such action could conceivably cause repercussions which

Hould only aggravate the racial situation that exists in the

South.

It is felt that Dr. Leland J. Haworth, Director,

NSF, should be furnished information regarding

communist

influences exerted on the SCIC and King. In this regard

we recently disseminated to the White House and the

heads of the intelligence community copies of a "Top Secret"

summary

entitled "Communism and the legro lovement--A

Current

Analysis" which contains information regarding the

SCIC and king.

This sunmary deals with King's conmunist

connections and his personal inoral activities. With the

receipt of this summary by Dr. Haworth, the SCIC would

undoubtedly be removed arm the Nin

program to obtain qualified

Negro students for southern schools.

The information concerning the scIe participation

in the NSF progran is being sepazately disseminnted to the

Department

and interested intelligence agencies.

that I intend to be governed by and I will comply with the following provisions:

(1) That I am hereby advised and I understand that Federal law such as

Title 18, United States Code, Sections 793, 794, and 798; Order of the

President of the United States (Executive Order 11652); and regulations

issued by the Attorney General of the United States (28 Code of Federal

Regulations, Sections 16.21 through 16.26) prohibit loss, misuse, or un-

authorized disclosure or production of national security information, other

classified information and other nonclassified information In the files of

the FBI;

(2) I understand that unauthorized disclosure of information in the files

of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the FBI could

result in impairment of national security, place human lifé in jeopardy, or

result in the denial of due process to a person or persons who are subjects

of an FBI investigation, or prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its

responsibilities. I understand the need for this secrecy agreement; there-

fore, as consideration for employment I agree that I will never divulge,

publish, or reveal either by word or conduct, or by other means disclose to

any unauthorized recipient without official written authorization by the

Director of the FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory

and in this regard I agree to request approval of the Director of the FBI in each

such instance by presenting the full text of my proposed disclosure in writing to

the Director of the FBI at least thirty (30) days prior to disclosure. I understand

that this agreement is not intended to apply to information which has been placed

in the public domain or to prevent me from writing or speaking. about the FBI but

it is intended to prevent disclosure of information where disclosure would be

contrary to law, regulation or public policy. I agree the Director of the FBI is

in a better position than I to make that determination;

duties with the FBI and all official material to which I have access remains

the property of the United States of America, and I will surrender upon demand

by the Director of the FBI or his delegate, or upon separation from the FBI, any

material relating to such information or property in my possession;

(4) That I understand unauthorized disclosure may be a violation of Federal

law and prosecuted as a criminal offense and in addition to this agreement may

be enforced by means of an injunction or other civil remedy.

Lloya N. Cutler, Esquire

Wilmer, Cutler

1666 K Street, N.W:

Washington, D.C.

20006

Dear Mr. Cutler:

Pursuant to our discussions concerning the disposition of

certain records relating to the surveillance activities

directed at your client, Mr. Joseph Kraft, the Department

is making the following

temporary arrangements:

I. Pending further vepartmental action relating

to the policies which will govern records of the

¿ype invuived in ta. Mast's case, ali. documenter.

s custody or control which constitute,

summarize, or describe the contents of the over-

hearings obtained

the result of any electronic

surveillance directed against Mr. Kraft and mem-

bers of his family will be placed under seal.

2.

As long as the items described above remain

under seal, no olliclal or employee of the Depart-

ment will have access to them for any purpose, an

no official or employee of the Department. will

allow any person outside of the Department to have

any such access, cxcept as described below. The

only material referring to these items will be a

single index card needed to locate the sealed itens.

The index carâ will bear only Mr. Kraft's

name and

a file number.

3.

Should some future need which we do not now

foresee require any official or employee of the

Department to obtain or permit access to the

aforesaid items, the decision on such access shall

be made personally by the Attorney Ceneral. The

Attorney General shall not grant any access without

notifying it. iraft or his counsel in writing at

least ten days prior thercto, and providing him or

NW 54929. Docld:32989718 Page 91

## Page 92

-2-

them an opportunity to discuss the matter per-

sonally with the Attorney General before the.

grant is made.

The notice shall set forth the

date upon which access will be permitted if it is

granted, and

the purpose for which and person by

whom access is sought. The Attorney General will

personally inform Mr. Kraft or his counsel of a

decision to grant access as soon as practicable

after it is made, but in any event at least five

business days before access occurs.

4. Although this arrangement is not intendea to

constitute a permanent solution to the questions

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney

General or his successors unless the Attorney Gen-

eral gives Mir. Kraft or his counsel ten days'

prior notice and affords him or them an opportun-

ity to discuss the matter personally with the

Atiorney General before he rescinas or modifies

this agicamont.

If the ittorna; Cencial then

decides to rescind or modify this agreement he

shall. personally norm lit: Kraft of his counçel

of that decision at least five business days before

it is implemented.

As a result of our discussions, I understand that this

: temporary arrangement is acceptable to Mr. Kraft, of course

without waiver of any legal rights he may have as a result

of prior surveillances.

As I advised you, we are working

now on genoral policy dcterminations which, we hope, will

offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-

orarily.

Of course, under the terms of this agreement we

will notify you of ary policy determination which would

involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement shoula:

assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use

these documents in any. manner so long as they remain under

the seal arrangement.

sincerely,

Lawara ni

UBJECT: RELATIONS WITH CIA

Reference is made to my letter of 3/2/70. I made the

statement, "Unfortunately., CIA also belleres that in the past

we did not always act in a forthright manner, and the Agency

undoubtedly could present a list of grievances." It is my

understanding that you want such grievances identified. There

is enclosed herewith

a list of cases or situations which arose

over the years.

Based upon a review of files and my personal recollectio=

this list would be representative of matters which CIA could use

for making charges such as:

not being forthright, not playing

fairly and squarely, not cooperating, not being of assistance,

not recognizing the need for concrete FBI contributions to the

foreign intelligence effort.

Khat CIA may have compiled over the

years is unknown.

What situations are known to CIA and have not

come to our attention cannot be answered at this time. I am

thinking of leaks including distorted information which may have

been passed to CIA from ex-Bureau employees and CIA informants

and sources;

It should be clearly emphasized that there is no

indication whatsoever within CIA that the Agency has been seeking

any kind of a showdown or confrontation with the fBI. Contrary,

to what some people may believe, the relationship between the

two agencies up to the recent crisis was never better despite

better, the

the problems which have arisen from time to time.

I am confident

that a thorough and impartial examination will conclusively

•support the foregoing.

In order that there may not'be any misunderstanding, it

Is Important to emphasize that the Bureau can also produce an

extensive list of justified grievances. We can also produce an '

excellent record of support which we have given CIA; presumably

CIA could do the same.

There are ingredients for continuing

conflict and there is also adequate machinery for maintaining

sound working relations and producing badly needed intolligence

any problem of issue with anothergency, very often working with

very limited information. It is expected that the Bureau Agent

it should be noted that protests from the Bureau always were

easy to handle because the Agent had J.. Edgar Hoover behind hin.

CASES AND/OR SITUATIONS

INVOLVING CONFLICTS WITH THE

CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY (CIA)

(1) MOCASE (THE BORIS MORROS CASE) .

This was a sensitive Soviet-espionage case

which originated in 1943 and terminated for the nost

part in 1957.

The case had many wide foreign ramifi-

cations and historically has been, and undoubtedly

will be, one of the most important. and involved cases

of Soviet operations in this country and abroad.

We

did not disseminate any iniormation of significance

1n this case until 1954. On various occasions when

the Liaison Agent has become involved in heated argu-

nents with CIA officials, they have seen fit to raise

this case as an outstanding example of FBI failure to

cooperate with the Agency. The position taken by CIA

was that it should have been advised regarding the

Soviet operational activity in foreign countries,

claiming that the Agency would have had the opportunity

to develop more information of significance, identify

Soviet agents, and possibly prepare conditions for

recruitment or doubling of Soviet operatives. He did

not disseminate our reports to CIA because of the

permit CIA to handle any investigations relating to

the MOCASE until 1957.

• :

In 1957, CIA complained that it certainly had

every right to have received the information earlier

because many aspects of the MOCASE pertained to CIA

employees and operations. CIA further argued that it

had been greatly handicapped in effectively carrying out

the leads in 1957 because the leads were given to the

Agency at the same time that the case was publicized.

The Agency argued that the failure of the Bureau to

coordinate with CIA those French aspects of the case

permitted the French, rather than the U.S., to play &

dominating role in Europe.

With regard to dealing with the French, we

took the position that we would cover the leads through

our Legal Attaches wherever possible and to furnish

leads to CIA in those countries where we did not have

Legal

Attaches. ClA maintained that since we were on

record that our Legal Attaches do not handle operations

abroad, the Bureau had an obligation to levy those French

leads on CIA or at least coordinate with the Agency

before going to the French.

It is to be noted that in any argument relating

to jurisdiction in this matter, CIA will fall back on the

responsibilities placed on the Agency under the provisions

of the National Security Act of 1947 and the implementation

of the foregoing through National Security Council Direc-

tives. CIA will maintain that' it is incumbent upon the

Bureau to recognize the provisions of the National Security

Act of 1947 and the Directives.

The 'Agency would argue

that in the MOCASE. these mere ignored by the Bureau.

(3) THE ABEL CASE

Although CIA has not raised the point for

several years, the prevailing attitude was, and probably

still exists,

that the FBI did not play it square with

CiA in the abel case by not making certain that the

Agency was given the proper recognition for its contri-

butions. CIA feels that in the first place, there would

Inot have been any U. S. access or availability to the

source in this case,

because CIA took

the full responsibility for moving

NAME frOM PLACE

Ito the U. S. in 1957. CIA claims it took the risk and

responsibility of doing this after the Bureau declined

to become involved in any operation designed to transport

NAME

to the.U. S. It should be noted that NAME

was an alcoholic and that his first contacts with CIA

in PLACE raised questions concerning NAME

stability.

After NAME arrived in the U. S., we

arranged access to him for a period, the purpose of

which was to obtain a complete story of his intelli-

gence activities in theU. S. and we were particularly

Interested in identifying all of his associates, es-

pecially the man who later was identified as Rudolph

¡lAbel. After a short handling period in the U. S., we

dropped NAME because he became a problem.

It was

an extremely critical situation because we had not yet

I#dentified Abel. CIA agreed to take the responsibility

were given free access to this difficult source. ' This

was a most fortunate arrangement as far as CIA was con-

cerned, because this adjustment gave us the time to work

and subsequently develop the leads which

led to the apprehension of abel. The Agency has main-

tained that it was largely responsible for making

absolutely certain that NAME

CIA has- also referred to

the heavy expenses incurred by the Agency, all for the

(6) BUREAU HANDLING OF CIA REQUESTS FOR TOURS

FOR FOREIGN OFFICIALS

On occasions in the 1950's,

CIA complained that

officials visiting the U. S. under CIA sponsorship were

given excellent treatment on the tour but, nevertheless,

many. of the visitors left most disappointed because they

had not had any contact with any Bureau officials.

CIA

felt that contact with Bureau officials had very

significant

benefits and left lasting favorable impressions because of

the FBI's world-wide reputation.

CIA also pointed out that

when foreign visitors had no contact with Bureau officials,

they were left with

the suspicion that there was some kind

of friction between the FBI and CIA..

In 1956, we had a

clear-out policy to the effect that

tours for such visi

tors would be of a restrictive nature in that such

visitors would view our facilities normally seen by the

public and

nothing more.

CIA was so informed but

past. In addition, we have learned more about these

countries, their services, and their security chiefs

• by spending a few minutes with them. Needless to say,

this kind of treatuent has also immeasurably helped

our Legal Attaches.

(7) CIA - DUTCH INTEREST IN SOVIET ESPIONAGE ACTIVITY

In 1965, the. Dutch Internal Security Service

was in the process of investigating individuals in

Holland who allegedly had been engaged in Soviet-espionage

activity. The Dutch wanted to have certain individuals

in the u. S. interviered and approached ClA to make

inquiry at the Bureau. At that time, our relations

with the Dutch had been practically nonexistent because

the Dutch had failed to honestly deal' with us in the

(10) INTERNAL SECURITY LEADS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES

During the 1950's, we gave our Legal Attaches

numerous leads stemming from internal security cases in

the U. So. In many instances we did not see fit to

notify CIA although the Agency always maintained

that

you could not separate "internal Security" from "counter-

intelligence," namely & lead in France pertaining to a

communist in the U. S. warranted advising CIA, if not,

at least asking the Agency to handlé the lead. In the

last several years, it is not believed that there is

any basis for complaint since we have regularly been

notifying CIA concerning subjects of cases who travel

abroad.

Il the Legal Attache is investigating, CIA is

notified in order to avoid duplicate efforts. There

have been exceptions where we have taken the position

that CIA should not be notified because of the sensitivity

of the matter. How many such exceptions are known to

ClA cannot be established Irom our Illes; however, we

should boar in mind that when nur Legal Attaches inves-.

tigate, they contact many of the same foreign officials

normally contacted by CIA. How many of these foreign

officials are CIA informants, or on the Agency payroll,

is unknown.

(II) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN CUBA

We operated informants in Cuba when we had a

Legal Attache's Office in Havana. Informants reported

on activities of communists and other subversives in

that country. During the perion we operated these

informants, we did not coordinate our operations with

CIA. We did not advise the Agency that we had such

sources.

However, In 1960, after Castro

came on the

scene, it became infeasible to handle certain informants

in a secure manner. Approval was granted to turn certain

Informants over to CIA. What these informants may have

subsequently told CIA about past Bureau operations is

unknown. This item is being cited in the event CIA had

evidence to establish

that we had been operational in

Cuba and had not coordinated with the Agency pursuant

to Directives.

(12) BUREAU OPERATIONS IN BRAZIL -

In YEAR the U. S. Ambassador in Brazil accused

our Legal Attache of engaging in uncoordinated covert

Intelligence activity "of a nature which I believe

exceeds his terms of reference."

The Ambassador further

indicated that CIA was unhappy over the Legal Attache's

activities and the Agency allegedly had told the Ambassador

that the Legal Attache had disseminated information from

& source who was a fabricator or a provocator. This

situation arose as a result of the Legal Attaches

operation of an informant in Brazil. Some of the

Information that he received from the informant was

of a derogatory nature and related to a Brazilian who

was being

touted as a Presidential, candidate. CIA

asked for the identity of the informant and we told

the Agency that the person could not be identified

because he did not wish that his identity be disclosed.

This case is being cited because ClA may have evidence

that we had been operational in Brazil, had not coordi-

nated pursuant to Directives, and that the matter ras

further aggravated because of the alleged unreliability

of the information.

In April, 1960, CIA inquired if the Bureau would

give any consideration to assisting the Agency toward

developing coverage in Africa.

CIA was looking for the

services of any Negro informant who might be available.

The Agency also inquired about placing a Negro in the

Connunist Party, USA, under a plan which would have as

Loaning an informant on a short of long term basis.

has become vitally important to U.S. interest, bearing

In mind that both the soviets and Chinese Communists have

made significant inroads into the area.

CIA could argue

that as early as 1960, it had the foresight to recognize

the need for additional coverage, that it appealed to the

Bureau for assistance, and that we did not cooperate.

We do not have any reason to believe that CIA

CIA has never been able to understand why the

schools or training courses. CIA has felt that through

a careful selection of lecturers, the Agency could make

a very valuable contribution both to the Bureau and to

CIA.

The Agency has indicated that its participation in

(37) POSITIVE INTELLIGENCE

This is an area where discussion with CIA

officials can

rapidly generate criticism of the Bureau

for failure to cooperate and offer the necessary assis-

tance.

Positive intelligence, briefly, is that information

which might assist the U. S. Government in formulating

foreign polici.: Much' of it is of a political nature and

8 vital portion pertains to sclentific developments, military

capabilities of foreign countries, and intentions of foreign

countries. Positive intelligence

is rot only important

as it concerns the communist-bloc countries but also

the non-bloc nations.

There never has been,

any'lar, Directive, or

Executive Order which has fixed the responsibilities for

the clandestine collection of positive intelligence in

the U.S.

The Bureau does have a responsibility which

we refer

to as internal security and which falls into the

accepted area of counterintelligence. He do investigate

subversives spys, and

we develop penetrations of foreign

intelligence services. Our work in the positive intelli-

gence lleld, for the most part, has been restricted to

the compliance of requests imposed upon us by the state

Departnent, usually when a political crisis occurs in

some country.

• CIA has maintained that there is a tremendous

unexplored

feld for expanded acquirement of positive

Intelligence in the U.S.

This would mean vastly increased

technical surveillance coverage, development of informants,

and collection of cryptographic material. CIA does not

feel that we have aggressively moved as this particular

subject and that over the years, the igency has been

thwarted in its attempts to do much about the problem.

In DATE

• Install technical surveillances at the offices and temporary

residences of two FOREIGN Governuent officlals visiting the

V. S. Pursuant to instructions, CIA was told to seek the

authority of the Attorney General. The Director stated

that he did not want CIA utilizing FBI as a channel.

CIA has never made any official comment or

by the Bureau as unfriendly and uncooperative. The Agency

has looked to the Bureau

as the logical point of contact and

as the only organization baving the besources and capabilities

of adequately determining if such coverage is even feasible.

(38) MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

The Liaison Agent recalls fragments of other

situations or conflicts which occured over the years and

which resulted in the voicingo CIA displeasure or criticism..

The Agent cannot recall the names of the cases which is

necessary to acquire the required data. There was one

Instance early in the 1950's which involved information

received from a source of unknown reliability charging

Allen Dulles with having been a communist and a spy

while

in Europe.. He disseminated the information to several

agencies. Dulles exploded but never lodged a protest.

The Agent also has recollection of instances when

CIA alleged that its source or informant was compromised by

Bureau revelation of CIA infornation during the course of

interviews conducted by us.

Technically, this would be a

violation of the third ageney rule and, if CIA had hard

core facts, me would be vulnerable, particularly if an

important informant was lost. CIA never made any official

Honorable Richard Helms.

Director

Casting in bl gence Agency

Dear Mr. Helms:

As I am sure you will agrae, the need for close

coordination of the/intelligence-gathering ans/counter-

Intelligence efforts of the fBi and the Centrál intelligence

Agency (CIA) is self-evident. This matter is one which

requires a continuing analysis to assure that both agencies

have established working agreements whereby we can most

effectively realize positive results with a minimum of

duplication, misplaced effort, and jurisdictional problems.

During January, 1966, representatives of this

Bureau met with officials of the CIA to consider coordina-

tion of our mutual efforts in the collection of positive

Intelligence in the United States. Ag a result of these

conferences, a set of ground rules was drawn up and agreed

to by both agencies. A copy of this agreement was transmitted

In my letter of February 7, 1966, to then CIA Director

Vice Admiral William F. Reborn, Jr. A copy of the agreement

is enclosed for your information. This agreement has proven

generally effective and no major probleng have been

encountered since

Its adoption in the areas it covers.

matters involving the internal security of the United States

as well as for conducting counterintelligence operations in

this country. While this Bureau does not have any statutory

responsibilities with regard to the collection of foreign

Intelligence, I have always recognized that the potential

for the development of such intelligence in this country 1s

considerable. The FBI has, in fact, made a concerted effort

to obtain positive intelligence of value to other U. S.

: Intelligence agencies, Including the CIA, and policy-making

officials of the Government. While these efforts,have,

of course, been incidental to our main internal security:

and counterintelligence responsibilities, we have on a

selective basis developed sources, both live and technical,

providing coverage at key foreign establishments in the

United States. The product of this coverage has been furnished

on & regular basis to the CIA and other interested agencies

and officials uf the Guverineni.

I know that you will share my belief that this

matter requires a periodic reexamination to assure that the

national security interests continue,to be served in the

most effective and complete manner possible. After reviering

this matter, including the attached 1966 agreerent, I would

welcome any observations you may desire to make.

Sincerely yours,
