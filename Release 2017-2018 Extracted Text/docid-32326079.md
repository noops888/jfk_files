contacted and after Bureau permission has been received,

will be interviewed with the Polygraph.

It is noted that subject has'

expressed his

desire to fully cooperate in any way possible to establish

the fact that he is not now and never has been a member

of the Communist Party, and has never been opposed to the

United States in any manner.

The Bureau is being requested by separate

communication to authorize interview of the subject using

the Polygraph.

This report is being classified "SECRET" Inasmuch

as it contains information originating from CIA which was

so classified and because it contains information pertaining

to operations within Cuba and participants in those

operations, some of whom may still be at liberty and have

possible interest, operational or otherwise, to other

Government agencies.
