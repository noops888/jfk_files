of

the residence about one year ago, but he still sees

her periodically..

He said that his wife, although not

related to the REGINO family, remains loyal to the

family members.

advised that about six months ago,

REGINO accused him of stealing some tools and struck

him in the face.

He did not retaliate because he did

not wish to get into trouble, but he has no loyalty

to REGINO. He advised that under no circumstances

will he ever testify to anything he says and he does

not wish his contacts with the FBI to become known

to anyone.

He will furnish whatever information he

can but admitted that this will be limited.
