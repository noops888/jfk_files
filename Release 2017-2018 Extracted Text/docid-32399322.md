Request for Field Traces and Investigations

1. It has been ascertained locally that Identity B and her husband.

& PiPRiME national, own a modest home located 300 yards west and 25 yards

south of the Jefetura Politica in San Juan de Tibas, a suburb of San Jose.

The house is currently occupied by the mother of Identity B and by Identity C.

2. Due to the smallness of the neighborhood in which the house 1s located,

it was not deemed operationally secure to attempt to make any neighborhood inquir-

signed who met then first in another Central American country in 1954. The name

as a surprise.

It is entirely possible, however, that if she had been married

before there was no reason why she or her husband should tell writer of that fact.

3. A check of all available indices including those of the Costa Rican

government revealed no information on Pedro/MARZAL. His name 1s not listed in

the current telephone directory. Discreet inquiry of a cleared station informant

concerning MARZAl, proved to be negative. He had never heard the name before.

4. It has been ascertained that Identity B applied for a United States

tourist visa at the local United States Consulate on 4 April 1957. In her

application for the visa, Identity B indicated that she had not been divorced

but was married to Identity A.

In all of the papers concerning ber visa-ap

pitcation she gave no indication that she had been married previously. Her

application for the visa indicates that she was born on 15 March 1915 in Sar

Jose, Costa Rica and that she holds a valid Costa Rican Passport. Discreet

inquiry of an Embassy employee who is in the confidence of this office provided

little information on Identity B.

She is known slightly to the employee who

advised

he had never heard Subject voice any opinion on politics, either dom-

estic or international.

5. Identity C, until recently, was employed as a beautician by a local

beauty shop named Bordalos. It is known that she requested a week's leave of

absence from her job in order to take Identity B's two children to her in an-

other area. Her employer refused to grant the leave and Identity C was forced

to resign her position in order to take the youngsters to their mother and father.

Identity B returned to San Jose only recently from this trip and since that time

has been seeking employment without success.

HRS-A-2938*

Discreet inquiries of local PBPRIMERS and cleared station informants failed to

reaveal any information concorning Identity C other than that she is a quiet,

attractive girl who has been away from Costa Rica for many years.

6. It has been ascertained that Identity C also applied for a United States

visa on 4 April 1957. In her application, she indicated that she wanted to accou-

pany her sister and the latter's children to the United States in order that they

might all join the husband of Identity B. It later developed that the trip was not

made and the visa application cancelled.

Her visa application shows that she was

born on 2 July 1925 in San Jose, Costa Rica, and that she holds a valid Costa Rican

passport.

writer recalls that Identity B once told him (in 1954) that during

World War Il she and Identity C had been employed by one of the Post Exchanges

In the Panama Canal Zone.

Identity B, at that time, said that due to the fact

she was so dark she was paid from the Silver Roll (for Panamanians only) but

that Identity C was paid from the Gold Roll (for white, Americans) at the same

tine. Identity B 1s quite dark, has thick lips, is short and quite plump. Even

with the passing of ten years, it is difficult to picture her as a dancer during

World War II.

8. A check of the files of the local Guardia Civil, Traffic Department,

and Detective Bureau falled to reveal any arrest record on either Identity B or
