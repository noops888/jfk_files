his regular bartending job in the early hours of the nornlag. LIBOSIN

VALDEZ DOT MOREHO are present during the night of 31 July • 1 Auguat when

LIRING-3 told CROZCO that the latter was in fact a deserter from the FAR,

refusing to indicate how he knew this (ROTON had passed LIRING-3 Liforation

on OROZCO received by the Station from both LIREBEL! and 2). The tro men

arrived at LIRINJ-3's apartment in the early noraing hours when OROZCO

had adaitted everything and thus do not know what prompted him to tell the

truth.

Thirdly, LTRINC-3 tainta that he told OROZCO nothing about hie

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

° SUBJECT: LITAMIL-7

1. According to Gerald D. FAHLANGER.

is a jemale, was a secretary in the Mexico City PBRUMAN Embassy

for more than 30 years.

She was originaily recruited by former

Station asset LITAMIL-3 in approximately 1966-67. Although Subject

was never a very productive asset, she did provide information on

activities of the installation and individuals working therein.

approximately 1969-79, Subject was retired by the PBRUMAN Embassy,

ending her previous usefulness for the Station. In spite of her loss'

of acer.ss to the embassy, she did continue to maintain contact with

the personnel, including the ambassador. For this reason the Station

maintained contact with her through LITAMIL-3. However, this too

was not very productive because she felt she had been treated fairly

upor retirement, and felt a certain degree of loyalty to them. This

was somewhat incongruous, since she did not feel such loyalty when

she was working in the embassy.

2. Subject met FAHLANGER, as Jose (Pepe) Martin, approx-

imately six times in her home. The last time she was told that in

view of her retirement, which resulted in the loss of access to the

embassy, our relations with her would be termina ed. However, if

she reestablished contact with the personnel, or was recalled to work

part or full time, we would, of course, consider contact again. This,

of course, never happened.

3. While Subject was not paid a regular salary, she did receive

spot payments for the information she submitted.

She also received

occasional small gifts at Christmas time and on her birthday.

LITAMIL-7: LITAMILY, tDe Station's coly

was finally retired

This had been in the wind for sore tim.

The problen was that according to Mexican laws

208-7300731

every year worked, and she had worked for LIBING 38

years.

She was notified on 88 March that on

Instructions fron the Foreign Hinistry her employsent

with LIRING was being teruinated effective 31 Marcb

1968-

On 28 March, all ber paoue books, leys, et

39 Narch was a mire formality, Her termination pay !

(36,000 0.8.) la boing elven ta three installients,

with the last one the end of April.

LITAML7 gave

her Case Officer no advance notice of her relosso,

probably for lem of compromising her retirement

bereftts.

Station will,

however, contizue to mat

tain casual contact with her after she receives the

last Installment of her severance pay.

She may bo

Summary:

During the perlod of this report, LITAMIL?

Most of the metings with LITAMILY

vare conductod in the presence of LITAMIL 3, who has known

===

An Ins vady ison Do can pressure her

Into reporting information on the dally LIBING actlvities.

Unfortunately, LITANIL-T has reported only routine information,

mch of which the Station already obtained through other roans.

In many cases, borever, her Information served to suf port

infornation the Station suspected or needed to confirm.

The

folloning vere factors that contributed to LITAHIL?'s apathy

and reluctance to collect and report inforantion of value.

First, there was the problen of her health.

Although she

did have high blood prossure, ost of her preoccupation over

this condition vas paycioninatic.

It apperred that it provided

ber with a crutch to justify her inability to service Station

roqutresents.

Second, and this was probably the most signili-

cant factor behind her reluctance to collaborate fully,

sha

was awnra of the LIRING attitude towards retentior of Lorelg

olenees in that office.

In January 1938, LIBING released

al] local employees except LITAMILY, and as the months vent

by it becuas Incrensingly evident that lt was only a utter

0f tino before she rould be released also. Evidence of bor

mainent

tersination vas given by the fact that she was givea

less

dutles as the noaths passed, until at the very end she

did little more than put in her time.

with the spectre of

unemployment looming over the horizon, LITAMILY was reluctant

to take any risk that might have compronisad nor sicuaiion at

LIBING.

At stake vas a sizable teruination payment which the

PaRUskers vere obligated to pay her according to local

enploysent regulations.

Obviously, she would do nothing to

Jeopardize tL. & paysent, which anounted to approxinately

$6,000 (U.S.).

A furtber deterrent to her collaboration with

the station,

even after her release by LIBING on 31 March,

was the LIBING arrangenent to make the termination paynent in

three incresents,

the last to be made at the end of April 1968.

In view of this latest development in this operation, the

Station has terminated the weekly meetings between the statlon

Case Officer and LITAMILY

I.

Introduction:

report, LITANIL-T was met and debriefed on a weekly basis.

Her information was very linited and usually dealt with internal

activities of a routine nature In LIBING. As pointed out above,

administrative duties.

Consequently, she lost access to

virtually everything that may have bech of interest to the

Station.

The Station asked her to bring out the book of

addresses and telephone numbers which she had compiled over

the yoars, but she refused for fear that it would be missed

caring the afternoon when she was not on auty.

The Station

then asked that she begin to copy the contents of the book a

few pages each day.

She agreed, but before she began thir

process the book disappeared, and all efforts to find it failed.

she tea began to compile a new book of assresses and telephone

mumbers, which she intended to bring out, bat one

of the LIBING

officors asked for it on the day she was iired.

•In the end,

the sun total of LITAMILY LIRING information during the first

three months of 1908 was the identitication o1 several

photograpns of LIkING employees, the tentative identification

of offices and rooms In LIRING (tentative because she had

not been in the second floor area since 1961, thus much of

the identification was fron memory), and finally, LITAMIL?

confirmed telephone numbers assigned to specifie LIRING

personnel and furnished telephone nuabers of individuals and

compantes servicing LIBING maintenance requirements (dry

cleaners, pharmacy.

typewriter repairmen,. ete.). LITAMILY

volunteered to provide additional inforuation on LIRING to the

Station provided it was within her capability.

received her final severance payment fron LInInG.

Yinance:

LITANILY received no salary and no term

tlon bonus from the Station.

Security:

Since all contact with LITAMIL? "As

nintained through LITAMIL-3, LITANILY does not| have a Statlon

telephone mumber.

She does not know the true nues of any of

the Station Case Officers who handled her.

All meetings with

her were hold in her home, thus no safehouses were used, and

she was never seen with Case Officers in publie.

She had no

telephone, so no contacts were made with ter by phone.

From

the socurity point of view, the LITAMIL T operation enjoyed

• long life, January 1961 through March 1968.

Taking into

mccount her fear and apprehension, plus the lact that she

maintained good relations with LITAMIL 3, this record is all

the more remarkable.

From the intelligence point of view, 18

Is unfortunate that her production mas so aislaal.

1. Future of the Oneration: Although for all intents

and parposes the LITAKil? operation has come to an end, the

Station intends to nalatain a casual contact with her.

I*

de very likely that she my know ner personnel assigned to

IRING and may be ab'o to furnish information on these

individuals.

There may also be developments in LIBING which,

on the basis of her lengty service in LIKING, she night de

able to assess and clarity.

Since LITAMIL vas not &

salaried agent for the Station, the operation cost nothing

more than the investaent of Case Officer tise,

and a

occasional gift of flowers.

In vier of her intense pride,

there is little reason

to belleve that she will accept money

in the future.

If she la able to provide information to the

Station It will probably be done without any thought of

compensation.
