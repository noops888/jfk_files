could

At the outset of the interview,

apprised of the FBI's interest in the overall operation of Local

560, their officers and Welfare and Dental Funds and he was

informed that it was felt he was in a position to be of

assistance on a confidential basis.

explained that during the eight years

in which he has been a member of the Board of Trustees he has

found enumerable questionable procedures most of which he and

his associates have corrected.

explained that

at the present time the Hudson County Branch of Local 560's

Welfare Fund has over $11,000,000 invested in stocks and bonds

which are handled by Lehman Brothers, an investment advisory

service at One Williams Street, New York, New York.

stated that Lehman Brothers maintains the Welfare Fund's port

folio and makes available an audit of this account on a bi-yearly

basis.

stated that he has received information

indicating

that many

of the members of Local 560 are suspicious

of the activities of its officers including Mr. PROVENZANO,

the handling and accounting of union dues and the unavallability

of information pertaining to Local 560's fiscal picture and

investments:

He stated that on the other hand, employers

located in Hudson County have from time to time raised questions

tributions to the Welfare Fund.

stated that his primary responsibility.

entails

examining all

procedures within the operation of

the

fund and is the frequent contact with Mr. MARVIN ZALK,

Local 560's administrator of this fund.

He stated that he has

found Mc. ZALK a capable, efficient administrator and understands

that during a recent convention of wefare fund administrators held

in Atlantic City Me. ZALK was praised for his efficiency.

stated that based on the accounting procedures presently

in effect within thisiund, he belleves it would be extremely

difficult for anyone to misapply or divert monies from this

fund.

The writer then proceeded to query

relative to his familiarity with the dental program which is

applied with 560's Welfare Fund.

I stated that he was

of the opinion that if any officers or individuals employed by

Local 560 were considering embezzling or misappropriating monies

from this fund it would be done through the dental program.

stated that he and several other members of the Board

of Trustees disapproved of establishing a dental program at

the outset; however, through the insistence of the membership

officers of

Local 560, they advertised in various metropolitan

newspapers for

an experienceddental fund administrator. He advised

that as a result pi. their efforts Dr. too Marcus, a brookLyn,

NEW

jork dentas practitioner who had previcusly headed a dental

welfare program for an unrecalled union in Brooklyn, was employed.

Trecalled that Mr. PROVENZANO was the one individual

he felt primarily responsible for securing Dr. MARCUS.

::

He stated that since the inception of this program,

he has found Dr. LEO MARCUS Incompetent and very lackadaisical

relative to the

operation of the dental fund. He explained

that during a recent audit of the dental fund many irregular

procedures were noted and imnediate recommendations were made

to correct these procedures.

explained that it is possible that a

dentist on the rolls of Local 560's Dental Fund might become

obligated to those responsible for securing his services in that

he would be expected to reimburse them a portion of the fees

which he has claimed.

Ho stated that if this were the case,

however, he would not be in possession of specific informatior

regarding the dentist or the amount kicked back or to whom the

money was furnished.

he has met Mr. PROVENZANO frequently during

his association

with the welfare fund and has found him to be intelligent,

capable

and understanding.

stated that on the other hand,

he has, through his association with the union's Welfare Fund,

heard contradicting stories indicating that PROVENZANO was

and had practiced illegal methods in securing union contracts

in the past. In his own personal dealings with PROVENZANO,

he has never received the impression that PROVENZANO was any-

thing other than a capable union leader sincerely concerned

with the welfare of his membership.

In concluding,

not in possession of their names or affiliations. NK T-4

"over whether the IU or the teamsters union

would represent the workers. About seventy

crossed the picket line last Thursday with

police escort in and out of the plant.

"IUE members have charged Local 945 of

the teamsters union with importing workers

in an effort to win a representation election.

"A twenty-man police detail, under the

direction of Captain Stanley Nowah, remained

at the plant today. Nowah suffered cuts and

several other policemen were injured slightly

in the outburst at the plant last Wednesday and

Thursday. Four men were arrested each day.

NK T-13 advised that the conflict between team-

sters and the IUE at the Duralite Corporation stems en-

tirely from ANTHONY "TONY PRO" PROVENZANO's instructions

to BOBBY LUIZZI, the organizer for this newly created

teamsters local, to secure the contract from Duralite

at all costs.

NK I-13 stated that "STRETCH" TRUSSO, the

act-

ing shop steward at either Roadway Express or Smith's

Transportation Company, Jersey City, New Jersey, was in

contact with the informant during the early part of

September to determine whether he would be willing to

earn $25 a day protecting the employees of Duralite as

they entered and departed the plant. NK T-13 stated that

after indicating his willingness to assist in the

Duralite strike,

he proceeded to the Clifton plant on

September 8, 1961, and there met TRUSSO, who appeared to

be acting as the over-all boss of the teamsters men

picketing the plant.

While at Duralite NK T-13 observed

a number of known Hoboken criminals in front of the

building

Among those observed

GWINNENT, "DUKE"

BROWN, and

NK I-13 stated that he met TRUSSO at a restaurant

located diagonally across the street-from the Duralite

plant and was there informed by BOBBY LUIZZI that all

teamsters men were willing to take an active roll in com-

bating the IUE pickets and would receive $25 daily.

NK T-13 stated that after surveying the situation, he

concluded that violence would eventually break out and

decided not to join the teamsters pickets.
