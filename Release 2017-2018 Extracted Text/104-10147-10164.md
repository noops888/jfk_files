HSCA

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT : HSCA Interest in Nosenko

1.

Ray Reardon of the Office of Security has been

interviewing Agency employees connected in some way with

the handling of Nosenko during the period of his confine-

to see in particular if any drugs had been administered

to him. One employee, Tom Ryan of SE Division, was not

interviewed as he was awaiting interview and deposition by

HSCA personnel; as he was deposed last week Ray and I inter-

viewed him today. In essence, he recalled no such use;

Reardon will do a separate memo on that point.

2. We had heard that Ryan had been told that he

might be called to testify at public hearings, and asked

him if he minded telling us what the interests of the

HSCA investigator were.

He stated that he was asked about

the treatment of Nosenko, including the question of drugs.

One general question was asked about the question of bona

fides, which he avoided answering by saying that any

answer

would have to be a long one, and that what he

felt at different times would

be different; the questioner

did not persist.

be an indication that the HSCA is now focusing on the treat-

ment of Nosenko, rather than the issue of bona fides.

far as Ryan is concerned, he is underl

cover and would be unable to testify at public hearings

without severely complicating his future service.
