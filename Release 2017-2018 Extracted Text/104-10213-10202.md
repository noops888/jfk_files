THE 201 SYSTEM

Rescission: Annex B of Chapter III, CSHB 70-1-1; 27 October 1968

1. INTRODUCTION

The 201 system provides a method for identilying a person of specific in.

terest to the Operations Directorate and for controlling and filing all pertinent

information about that person. The system also provides a means for identifying

subjects of 201 files from various categories of information abut them and for

producing lisits of 201 personalities according to those calories. Only a rela-

tively small number of personalities indered are of sulficient interest to justify

opening a 201 dossier. These are normally subjects of extensive reporting and

CI investigation, prospective agents and sources, members of groups and organi-

zations of continuing target interest, or subjects on shom a volume of corre-

spondence has accumulated.

2. THE 201 SYSTEM

The principal features of the 201 system are:

a. The 201 Number: a unique number, l.e., 201-123156, assigner to each

individual in the system to serve as identifying file number for reporting on that

individual

b. The 201 Dossier: the official file containing the 201 opening form (Form

831) and all biographic reporting on and references to the individnal, ie., per-

sonal history, current status, and prospects.

c. The Master 201 Record: a machine record generated by the opening of

a 201 file. This record produces the master 201 reference lor the Main Inder and

stores the pertinent information which may later be setrieved for specia! listings.

d. Main Index Master 201 Reference: this reference, printed in reply to an

Inder Search Request, is printed as illustraied below. When data are absent

within the record, succeeding data items or lines will be moved up and the ref-

erence consolidated

c. Ol Code: a two letter symbol used in conjunction with the 201 per.

sonality records in the 201 system to record the association of an individual

with organizations or activities of operational interest. Of codes cover intelli-

use as security serie of oDo chest There are a Coones of of

codes for use by components:

(1) general Ol codes (Attachment 1)

(2) 0I codes assigned to a specific component for intelligence services

or other specific organizations.

A component may request an Ol code be established by submitting a mem-

orandum to the DDO/RMO through the component Records Management

Officer.

A 201 personality may be assigned two OI codes. An Ol code may be assigned

when the 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) is initiated (see

paragraph 3b below) by filling in Bor 13 or a code may be assigned or added

at a later date by a Form 831 amendment

The 201 system has the capability of producing machine listings of 201

personalities bj Ol codes. For example, if an Ol code has been opened for the

security service of a certain country a listing may be compiled of all members

of that service.

1. 201 Machine Lists: produced from the mechanized 201 Index, based on

names or other identifying information of personalities on whom 201 dossiers

exist.

3. OPENING A 201 DOSSIER

=. General

The opening of a 201 dossier is the prerogative of an operational com-

ponent, in coordination with the Information Services Group. An opening creates

& master 201 record. Changes to the master record and the occasional closing

of a 201 dossier are controlled jointly by the desks and ISC. 201 dossiers may be

opened on persons who meet the carding criteria described in Chapier II of this

handbook, when there is a reasonable expectation that additional information

will be acquired and filed in such a dossier. Generally dossiers are opened on

persons about whom counterintelligence information is being reported, and per

ons of operational interest to the Operations Direciorate, specifically those

persons for whom provisional operational approvals and operational approvals

are requested (see exception belos). 201 files are not to be opened on stall

inployees, staff agents and most catezories of contract employees. Files of

and on whom no DDO records correspondence exists are not a part of the DDO

records system and are to be maintained by shat unit. Some destis lery require

ments on ISC for automatic 201 openings on certain categories of persons whose

names appear in incoming dispatches. These are listed in Altachment 2 201

dossiers should be opened in the following categories:

(1) Subjects of provisional operational approval and operational ap-

proval requests. However, a file need not be opened when a POA is requested

for persons being trained for a foreign liaison service and who are of opera-

(2) Persons for whom the field requests a 201 opening.

(3) MHFIXTURE personalities: bonafide diplomals of other than

denied area countries, in close association with stalf personnel.

(4) Subjects of a Personal Record Questionnaire Part I.

(5) Persons on whom a Sain Inder search reveals inforination in five

or more documents (see DOI 70-20).

(6) Subjects of Interagency Source Register memoranda from ISN/

ISR (opened only by 1P/ RMS).

b. Requesting & 201 File Opening

Headquarters desks may open a 201 file by filling out and submitting

a 201 Personality File Action Request (Form 831) to the Reoords Main-

tenance Section (IP/R.MS). Form 831 is also used to create or amend the

master 201 record and 201 machine listings

and to register the assign-

ment of a cryptonym to a 201 personality. Attachment 3 consists of saliple

201 Personality File Action Requests for opening and amending 20l's. A field

station may request the opening of a 201 file by writing 201- in the Head-

quarters file or cross-reterence box on the dispatch form and/or alter the

subject's name in the body of the dispatch. A telepouch request for a 201 opening

is made by indicating 201- in the file number line. A cable request is made by

placing 201- after the term

• "File" on the last line of the transmission. IP/AN

vill open 201 files as requested by dispatch or telepouch but it is the respons

ility of the desk to respond to cable requests. Field stations are notified o

201 openings through receipt of the field master 201 record.

a Purging

Purging a 201 dossier is the responsibility of the dest olficer. lt requires

discrimination in recognizing operationally useful material, rather than the

simple distinction between official and unofficial papers; it sill therefore take

place under the supervision of a Records Officer. Purging should be don

periodically. A 201 dussier heing forwarded to Central Files for retention shoul

be purged. A 201 dossier should be purged of the following:

(1) Duplicate material, le, exact copy (5) of a document

(2) Name trace form (Form 362) unless it has been the basis for

the opening.

(3) All abstract slips.

(4) All document restriction notices (Form 1884).

a copy of the raw report is contained in the 201 file; the dissemination number

(8) Routing slips, routing and record sheets (Form 610) and dispatch

cover sheets unless there are remarks such as coordinations of comments,

_.. (7) Record copy documents sshich only repeat substantive information

contained in other documents in the file; authorization fur destruction is

by the Records Officer.

(8) Top Secret documents are not to be retained in a 201 dossier

forwarded to Central Files; the document must be downgraded for setention

in the 201 dossier. To downgrade a Top Secret document, an authorized

officer in the originating office or the Records Olficer having jurisdiction

over the contents of the material must possess Top Secret classification

authority. If the document cannot be downgraded the file should be retained

at the desk or the copy of the TS document should be remored, retained

in a desk TS file or fonvarded to the Top Secret Control Officer, and a

ross-reterence sheet (Form 867) placed in the 201 file giving the locatior

of the TS document

All standard listings are cumuntive; previous editions inust be elestroyed

upon recript of current editions. These listings are by their very nature extremsly

sensitise compilations of information and must be given every possible saleguard.

b. Y'on-Standard Listings

Based on one or more of the following selection criteria:

(1) Country of location

(2) OI codes (organization and/or intelligence affiliation)

(3) Citizenship

(4) Year of birth (plus or minus a given number of years)

(5) Occupation.

These selection criteria may be used singly or in combinations. For example,

a user could obtain a list of all 201 personalities who have ben assigned the

Ol code of XX or codes of XX, XY, or XZ. A 201 personality list could also be

procluced of all persons who sere bom in Germany between the years 1915

and 1920, with the occupation computer specialist, who are now citizens of the

United States, located in Mexico, and who had been assigned the Ol code AA

Note however that the listing would contain only those personalities with an

O1 code AA. Those personalities with an Ol code other than AA and those

with no OI code would be excluded. The requester could however ask that

persons who have not been assigaed an OI code also be included. Note also

that when retrieving lists based on occupation, the listing will be only as specifie

as the occupation code (Attachment 1). The occupation rede for a courier

covers only a documented courier. Some occupation codes cover more than one

occupation. For example, the occupation code CRAF covers those who practice

some trade or manual occupation, i.e, carpenters, bricklayers, painters, mechanics

and elestricians. If a list is requested for electricians, all others in this category

will be includer in the printout. These non-standard listings may be sorted

..(arranged) according to any, but not more than three, of the following keywords:

groups and organizations of continuing target interest. Each of thes

personalities is assigned either a 201 number or an IDN number.

2. The 201 number serves a dual purpose. It brings the files on

these personalities into the CS records system. A single number,

e.g., 201-123456, is assigned to each person, and a dossier controlled

by this number is established which contains, or has cross referenced

to it, all of the reporting on the invidual's personal history, current
