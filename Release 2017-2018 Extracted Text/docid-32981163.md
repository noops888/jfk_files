PLANS TO ASSASSINATE CUBAN LEADERS

On June 2, 1965, Victor Domindador Espinosa

Hernandez, a Cuban refugee, was interviewed at the New York

City Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Espinosa advised

as follows:

On May 29, 1965, he returned to New Yorl City after

spending twenty-six days in Paris, France, where he was in

contact with individuals involved

in a plot to assassinate

Fidel Castro and other Cuban Government leaders.

The main

figure in this plot is Rolando Cubela, a close friend of

Espinosa and

an intimate friend and current neighbor of

Fidel Castro. Cubela is identical with forner Major Rolando

L.. Cubela y Secades, who has resigned from the armed forces

of Cuba and is now practicing medicine in Havana. Alberto

Blanco, an employee of the Cuban Foreign Ministry, and Major

Juan Alneida Bosque are the other leading figures in this

plot.:

He conferred in Paris for about ten days with

•Alberto Blanco who was then on an inspection tour of Cuban

Embassies and Consulates abroad.

He learned that the plot

! Is directed toward the assassination of Fidel Castro, his

brother Raul Castro, Erresto "Che" Guevara, a Cabinet

member

in the present Cuban Governmeat, and Ramiro Valdes, the Chief

of the Cuban Intelligence Service.

The assassination of these

individuals is to take place in public, possibly on July 26,

1965, when all the Cuban leaders would be together at the

annual July 26th celebracion in Havana. After the assassination,

•those involved in the plot hope to seize the radio station

• and call for American help. Cubela and others associated

with hin in this plot desire to know whether or not the

United States would help if the plot was successful and if

the United States would de ready to give this assistance at

a moment's notice as the plotters may be able to hold the

covormiant for only a day or tivo.

recent trip and in that country he contacted other Cuban

exiles and learned that a ran named Willianson, who is in

01,02,11

chargo of the Central Intelligence Agency Office in Madrid,

is aware of this plot to a certain degree. The Cuban exiles

do not trust lillianson and allege he has been compromised

by a Cuban girl nicknaned "Tota," who was sent frou Havana

to Spain for the specific purpose of gotting in contact with

01:

He requested to be put in contact with a representative

of the Central Intelligence Agency who was thoroughly familiar

with the Cuban situation and knowledgeable concerning the

individuals involved in the plot.
