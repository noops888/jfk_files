Informant advised that JOHN DE FOREST finally

got out on bond on the "meat case".

He said that Dr. JOSEPH

RASAK told him that on the day following DE FOREST's release

DE FOREST came to him (RASAK) and demanded $4590.00. Informant

stated that DE FOREST apparently thinks that it was

Dr. RASAk

who "put him down". He said that obviously DE FOREST must have

something good on RASAK, at least enough to "put RASAK in the

grease", or else why the shakedown.

Informant stated that

DE FOREST demanded that RASAK have the $4500.00 in DE FOREST'S

attorney's office by Friday afternoon, 4/5/63.

Informant

stated that he does not know the identity of DE FOREST's attorney

nor actually, for that matter, that DE FOREST even had an

attorney.

Informant advised that Di. RASAK pays "juice" weekly

to SAMMY FINE on a shylock loan he has with JOHNNY SERRA.

Informant advised that he recently ran into Little

EDDIE MORAN at the coffee house on E. Jefferson across the street

from Fr. HEALEY's Antique Store near the Chrysler Expressway.

He said that he mentioned to MORAN that he frequently sees MORAN's

old "sidekick", DAVEY EDWARDS and MORAN pleaded with Informant not

to mention to EDWARDS or any of EDWARDS associates that MORAN was

in town.

Informant stated that MORAN told him that he was now

working

with "some guys" in Youngstown, Onlo.

Informant advised

that he believed that EDDIE MORAN waS

"working the pigeon drop"

or slse "going with the switch", ie a type of con game, in Youngs-

town, Ohio.

Informant stated that LOUIE PETERS, who owns

Master Realty, 13331 Mack Avenue, telephone VA 2-2600, had

the real estate listing for HANK

THOMAS' home. Informant said

that PETERS told him that THOMAS pulled his house off the market

recently. He stated that THOMAS is "in a world of trouble"

as he has now "double-crossed" the Judge who sentenced him and

who stipulated that THOMAS must move out of the neighborhood.

Informant advised that, from stories he hears from PETERS,

THOMAS'

neighbors want to force THOMAS out of the Grosse Pointe

area but THOMAS does not want to go.

He said that THOMAS is con-

sidered to have plenty of money though he has moved his wife and

children out of the family home. Informant stated that he heard

that HANK THOMAS actually had been carrying on an affair with

the mother of the young girl THOMAS was sentenced to jail for

molesting and that THOMAS now intends to use this "affair" as a

"big stick" to hold over the head of the doctor, who is the

father of the young girl supposedly victimized by THOMAS and who

was the one pressing the case against HANK THOMAS, in order to

stay in the neighborhood.

sister and that EDWARDS works for PETERS at

Master Realty.

Informant said that he has been spending time

around Master Realty as it has become "a den of thieves".

He

stated that EDWARDS has been a

gambler operating mostly in the

downriver suburbs most of his life. He said that when

EDWARDS came out of the Army in early 1946 he ran a barbute

game in River Rouge for seven years.

He stated that EDWARDS

told him that for the first three years he operated alone,

unmolested by "the outfit" and he made "a bundle".

a that one night as s

that EDWARDS related that one night he was visited by PETE LICAVOLI

who persuaded" him to become 50-50 partners with him (LICAVOLI)

30-50 parter s

Informant said that EDWARDS commented to him that for the next

four years he was "in partners" with LICAVOLI and they were

"splitting up' about $12,000.00 a week from his barbute game.

He

said that EDWARDS claimed that he faithfully sent PETE LICAVOLI

Informant advised that EDWARDS

blamed PETE CORRADO for putting him out of the barbute business

in 1952.

Informant stated additionally that EDWARDS has booked

both horses and numbers from time to time in the Detroit area.

Informant advised that EDWARDS claims that "CHICKIE" SHERMAN

pays off to the Detroit Police more money than any other gambler.

He said that for years "CHICKIE" took money "out of his own

pocket" to "pay the coppers" in many instances where "the outfit"

wouldn't "come up with" the money.

He stated that EDWARDS told

him at length about a Detroit Police Sergeant, DAVE HARRIS, who

is now assigned to the 13th Precinct, who "has to be" one of the

richest cops in Detroit as he has

been "shaking down" gamblers and

hoodlums for years.

Informant said that EDWARDS told him that

years ago DAVE HARRIS arrested him on numbers and took $6200.00

as "evidence" off him. EDWARDS claimed that when he "got off"

the charge and went to get his money only $1300.00 had been

"booked in" by HARRIS at the police station.

Informant said

EDWARDS' claim is that Sgt. DAVE HARRIS has had "a license to

steal" for years.

Informant commented on the recent police raid of

DANNY COSENTINO's handbook operations

and stated that COSENTINO

is a nephew of JOE: MASSEI, one of the former syndicate leaders

in Detroit, and that COSENTINO is believed to be "on the lam" and

hiding out in Florida.

Informant stated that he understood that

COSENTINO and a guy named "BREEZY" (LNU), who operates downriver,

had the two largest horse handbooks in the Detroit area.

He

said that "BREEZY" reportedly had the biggest "action" in town

and that RUBINO had a part of "BREEZY's" action. Informant

stated that he heard that MIKE RUBINO supposedly "had a hand" in

DANNY COSENTINO's operation too, although, Informant emphasized,

he would think that COSENTINO's

"book" belonged to TONY GIACALONE

He added that "BREEZY" can be found every Sunday in a restaurant

on Dix owned by the brother of TOMMY KARAMANOS, a missing Greek.

assasination.

revealed that DITTA and MUDARO worked the bar for a while and then

DITTA burned the place down.

collected

He added that DITTA and MUDARO

from the insurance company also.

Informant advised that ABIE RAHAIM is being sought

by the Detroit Police Dept. following a numbers raid on an office

on Orchestra Place which was operated by RAHAIM.

Informant said

that RAHAIM lives on E. Outer Drive near Harper Ave. He said that

RAHAIM has worked for

EDDIE WINGATE for several years and that he

does much of WINGATE's betting on the horses and also handles

WINGATES' Layoffs" to the "horse books" around town.

Informant

said that RAHAIM has the "horse disease" and that he lives with

the Negroes now, working in WINGATE's numbers and horse books and

handling some of WINGATE's many race horses. Informant added that

the talk is that RAHAIM is in Florida "on the lam" from the Detroit

Police.

Informant revealed that the winging number comes

out around 5:30 pim. or 6:00 p.m. each night six days a week.

He said that this is about the time that the last digit is received

from the single action offices. Informant stated that the winning

number is followed closely by

numbers

people, including workers and

ettors, as it is "turned out" by the single

action, the lst

digit,

the and digit, the 3rd digit, and so on.

He

said that, to

get an idea of the enormity of numbers betting

in Detroit, a per-

son need only try to dial a WAlnut exchange around the time the

number gets out..

He commented that the winning number gets

around town in less than seven minutes and most of these contacts

are by telephone.

He advised that shortly after the winning

number is "turned out" you sometimes wait up to three minutes

for a dial tone in the WAlnut exchange, which covers-a predomin-

antly Negro area in Detroit.

Informant advised that he has long known of a

device to "prostrate" the numbers in Detroit.

He said that the

numbers would be thrown into "complete turmoil" if someone

(such as the FBI) should print up a phony "green sheet".

In-

formant offered that this "green sheet" should be a duplicate

of the numbers tip sheet printed up and distributed weekly by

the syndicate in Detroit, although it should reflect that a

number of "fancies" fell

the previous week, numbers which are

played daily on a very heavy basis by many

bettors. These

numbers, of course, would be printed in the "green sheet" in

place of the actual winning numbers which had previously come

out.

Informant emphasized that the phone company would be tied

up completely ten minutes after the phony tip sheet came out.

he said that not a numbers writer in Detroit could show his face

on the streets the

following day.

bettors, who used the "green sheet" as their "numbers bible" for

twenty-five years and who hand't been paid on a "hit", as they

can

than 1000 phony

Informant offered to distribute such a phony

numbers tip sheet.! He said that he would drop off four bundles

of phony sheets at each of four locations in different parts

of town. Informan't advised that he would surreptitiously leave

a bundle of 250 tip sheets at a blind pig on Canfield Avenue

that he knows to be presently a "numbers beehive", another

bundle of 250 at a blind pig on Brush Street, another bundle.

at a numbers headquarters in the barbershop he knows on 12th
