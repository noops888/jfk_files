in recruitment and manarcment of Latin Ancrican Communist

agents.

During this period, I also received two courses in

Clandestine Tradecraft given by the Headquarters Covert Training

Branch.

It was my understanding that my work was above average

and indicated a flair for clandestine operations.

Later, some

of my actual case histories of penetration operations were

sterilized and reproduced as training aldes in the Covert

Training Branch.

During this service, I also gained experience

in postal intercept and surveillance,

audio surveillance,

photography, and the operation of equipment used in these

activities.

"After a four-year tour in Cuba, I volunteered to under-

take an FI mission with CASTRO's forces then in the Sierra

Maestra (April 58). The results of this mission were hailed

as satisfactory and well recorded and although I was never

really satisfied with Agency support and follow-up on this

mission, it is now buried under the Cuban situation which is

a dead lien behing much pawed over these days.

â€¢Potucen March and August 1900, I processed at Head-

quarters and did some

"outside" pl work for the Cuban

dest on the deteriorating situation in Cuba. In late

August, I signed the secrecy agreement for project JMARC

and went to Miami for "inside duty" in a KUBARK installation

for the first time.

Although quite convinced that Cuba

would "not be another Guatemala"

and that the project was

destined to fail, I reported this heresy, then suppressed

it and pitched in

to do a job that was not infrequently

praised and for which there are tangible records of production

and affect on the enemy.

This tour ended with my transfer

from JMWAVE on 15 January 1963 under inexcusable circum-

stances which are recorded in my file of last fitness report

and need not be reiterated here.

"Without going into the "growing pains" of my development

in various phases of intelligence,

and using a special

restraint on the Cuban situation, I want to make it clear

that my talents lie in the Foreign Intelligence Field.

Indeed,

I know little else or have worked at little else

in my life.

If I may be permitted some insight in my case,

I am mid-way in a career which has yet to yield the best

twenty years of service, and would be of such mutual con-

venience to government

and individual that it would be un-

fortunate if this/

problem were permitted to destroy

it or render it non-operational.

"At the same time, I am cognizant of KUBARK forbearance

in this matter, and that my statements, vows of promises as to

future conduct cannot be valid unless

proven by time and

performance.

Recognizing that such a probationaly period

is a requisite before approval can be obtained for an FI

assignment in WH, I would suggest an interim Headquarters

duty of minimum duration, preferably within the Task force,

(SAS) where my current knowledgeability might be more

productive.
