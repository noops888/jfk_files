acquire more knowledge of law enforcement matters, because at a recent

Police School held in New Smyrna Beach,

Florida over twenty-five of

the officers attended

on their own time'and drove a considerable dis-

tance to and from the school at their own expense.

The department lacks leadership and the espirit de corp is:

strictly at á low ebb.

When ROSIER was made ActingChief of Police he

took Detective Sergeant. A. G. LAYNE out of the Detective Bureau and made

him Night Sergeant and put in LAYNE's place a motorcycle policeman with

no previous detective experience and thus impaired what little efficiency

the Detective Bureau had. This change was made because Mayor PADGETT "had

a mad on for LAINE".

E. POLICE TIE-UPS. WITH ORGANIZED CRIME

There can be no doubt of the connection between the police and

the gambling element in the city, for the BEACH CLUB, SEABREEZE GOLF AND

TENNIS CLUB, and all three horse bookie joints are within the city limits

and the police had authority to take such action as would close the joints,

if they had so desired. But the police were 'ham-strung by the Mayor and

the City Commissioners who were getting the "gravy" and they were told to

"lay off the gamolers". It is seriously: doubted that. any of the in-

dividual officers are being paid off, but previous allegations have been

made indicating that TOM JOHNSON had been paid off by EARLyARNIR and there

is little doubt that Acting Chief Of Police BILL ROBIER is!getting his share.
