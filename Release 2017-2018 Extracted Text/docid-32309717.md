various means to have the matter squashed. DARDIS related

in strict

sergeants was approached

by HARRY

cated that he was acting as a middle man in an effort to get.

this matter squashed. DARDIS commented that his sergeant

told him a sum of $15,000.00 would be paid to DARDIS if he

would see to it that the matter was dropped. DARDIS also

said his sergeant learned from LASSER that LASSER was acting

in behalf of SAMUEL OCHLAR...

He remarked that his sergeant has set up another meeting witr

LASSER and at that time LASSER will be told that DARDIS will

only talk to SCHLAR regarding the matter.

DARDIS further stated that he has discussed the

matter with DANIEL P. SULLIVAN, Operating Manager of the

Miami Crime Commission, and the State's. Attorney's Office.

He said the State's Attorney's Office is making plans to

secure adequate evidence with the view toward prosecuting

SCHLAR should he make the $15,000.00 offer to DARDIS per-

sonally.

DARDIS also advised that another similar payoff

proposition is beginning to move beyond the rumor stage.. He.

amount of money that would bereeded to pay off the Chief of

Police so that gambling would be permitted at the Harbor

tion is moving much slower than the one previously explained,

and as a result he is concentrating on the Treasure Isle

deal and hopes to obtain satisfactory evidence for prosecu-

tion of SCHLAR.

The "Miami Herald" newspaper of January 24, 1958,

reported that lie detector tests were ordered for five mem-

bers of the Coral Gables Traffic Bureau on January 23, 1958,

after a discrepancy of $10.00 was noted between the amount

turned in to the Traffic Bureau and the amount paid by an

individual who violated a traffic ordinance.

The article

related that RICHARD N.

RACO of Miami violated a traffic

regulation and produced

à receipt for $35.00 written. by

DONALD M. POOLEY, Coral Gables Police Department, on a

slip of plain white paper.

RACO was skeptical of the re-

ceipt because it was

not written on a printed receipt form.

The receipt was charged against the summons on file at the

Police Department and it was found that only a 525.00

fine was recorded.

The article indicated that there was

evidence of erasure on the ticket in the Police Department,

which altered the offense from driving sixty miles an

hour in a twenty-five mile zone, to fifty miles an hour.

This article pointed out that the penalty for a sixty

mile violation was $35.00 and the penalty for a fifty mile

violation was $25.00.

Chief WILLIAM G. KIMBROUGH, according to the

article, stated Patrolman DOOLEY's work sheet reflected a

Traffic Bureau cash register.

KIMBROUGH also commented

with respect to the receipt issued by DOOLEY that the

Department had run out of regular receipt forms.
