Director Sec'y

This is to recommend attached letter be sent to

the Attorney General in response to his memorandum of 7/16/75,

also attached.

For your information, there are additional

attachments relating to prior correspondence with the Attorney

General on the matter of direct operational liaison with the

White House.

In attached letter to the Attorney General the

response to the first matter was prepared by the Special

Investigative Division (R. J. McCarthy memorandum to

Mr. Cleveland, 7/21/75, captioned as above).

It is to be noted that attached memorandum of N. P.

Callahan to the Director dated 4/24/74 captioned "Proposed

Management Changes in the Department of Justice" indicates on

page ?, item number 5, Department opposition to the FBI

exercising any policy-type liaison with the White House.

Director Kelley on page 3 of this memorandum wrote,

President told me the Director of the FBI has direct access

to him and he with the Drtr. He described this as a traditional

relationship.

I do not contemplate bypassing the AG but on

the other hand may not be able to keep him completely informed

at all times. This may possibly be pertinent to number 5.

II not, I see no reason to mention it." In this Bureau's

reply to the Department, copy attached, dated 5/2/74 captioned

"Revision of the Department of Justice

Organization Regulations

(28 CFR Part O)" in which the need for Bureau operational

liaison with the White House is documented, the above comments

were not mentioned, and there does not appear to be any need

for elaboration on

this point in our current letter_to the

Attorney General.

Oliice but on a more limited basis.. Also, liaison contact is

maintained with other NSC Staff members concerning mattere of

very sensitive intelligence involving foreign nationals.

Ilaison is maintained with the Vice President's

Staif to assist them in dealing with Soviet-bloc nationals who

have shown an interest in developing contacts with that office

and also to provide name checks on certain persons contacting

The avallability of a regularly designated

the Correspondence Unit requests information to assist in

Fron time to time, FBI investigative matters develop

At 10 a.m., Monday, 4/22/74, I delivered to Associate Attorney

proposed Order which would amend Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations.

PORTIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

I expressed our appreciation for being given the opportunity to present

the Bureau's reaction to the proposed Order and at that time briefly discussed.

the points raised in our memorandum to the Attorney General. Mr. Sawyer

indicated that he would review our memorandum and discuss it with the people in

the Department who were working on the proposed Order and be back in touch

With me.

On the afternoon of 4/23/74, at about 4 p.m., Mr. Sawyer asked me

to stop by his office, which I did. The following points were covered:

1. We had requested specific assurance that the Director of the FBI,

would be permitted to continue to exercise complete control.over EBI,personnel

including making assignment to Supergrade positions except those of Associate

Director, Assistant to the Director, and Assistant Director, which would be sub-

mitted to the Attorney General for approval. Mr. Sawyer stated that the proposed

Order would be revised to specify that delegation of authority to the Director.

2. As to continuance of the FBI to be excepted from the Department's

Executive Development Program and that no FBI personnel or positions would be

includea in any intra-Departmental personnel exchange program, Mr. Sawyer

stated that he agreed that the Bureau should be excepted but it was not thought

desirable to provide for this in the Executive Order, Instead, it was the's 41

which the Office of the Legal Counsel of the Department will prepare.

3. Mr. Sawyer referred to Section 0. 190 regarding the provision

that the Attorney General's approval must be secured for the proposed establish-

ment, transfer, or reorganization of major functions, sections, or other sub-

units, these being defined as any organizational activities under the supervision

or proposed supervision of an individual at or above the GS-15 or equivalent

level. We proposed that this item be revised to read, "The head of each office,

division. Bureau, or board may from time to time propose the establishment,

transfer, reorganization,_ortermination of major.functions." Mr. Sawyer

stated that the new Order would adopt our proposed language.

4. As to the Bureau's request that we be delegated authority to

continue unobstructed direct liaison with the Office of Management and Budget

(OMB) on EBI,budget matters, Mr. Sawyer stated that there would be no change

in the proposed Order but that there would be an understanding that the FBI

would have direct access to OMB after clearing with the Deputy Attorney General.

5. As to our request that the

FBI's operational liaison with the White

House be excepted from the scope of Section 0. 6(e), Mr. Sawyer advised that

he was opposed to the FBI exercising any policy-type liaison. He suggested that

we prepare a communication to the Attorney General and to the Deputy spelling

out our need for operational liaision so that a decision could be made based on

As to the request that the FBI be specifically excepted from Section

0.75(k) dealing with the functions of the Assistant Attorney General for

Administration in regard to Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Mr. Sawyer

stated that there would be no change except that the Order will specify that

security is to be maintained as to operations... He stated that the Department

wants to know specifically what these items are and would like to have a

separate advisory memorandum. This will be prepared by the Computer Systems

Division and-sent through for approval:

Re: Proposed Management Changes in the .

Mr. Sawyer indicated that the Order will be announced on 4/24/74,

to be effective 5/11/74. In this regard, however, the elimination of the functions

of the Associate Attorney General would be effective immediately and the

Office of Management and Finance, which is headed by the Assistant Attorney

General for Administration, will commence operating under the Deputy Attorney

General immediately.

RECOMMENDATION:

This is prepared for the immediate information of the Director.

I will follow closely to see that the information which Mr. Sawyer requested

I respond to your memorandum of April 18; 1974, and

your earlier memorandum of April 2, 1974, concerning the

revision of the Department of Justice organization

regulations. (28 CFR Part 0) •

After reviewing your memoranda in light of policies

I wish to pursue for supervising the work of the Department,

I believe that some of your concerns can be met without

specific changes in the regulations. Supergrade positions

in the FBI will continue to be controlled by the Director,

although any personnel action by any officer of the

Department is subject to the discretionary review of the

Deputy Attorney General under section 0.15(c). The FBI

will continue to be excepted from the Department's

Executive Development Program but since that program is

not referred to in the regulations, it was not necessary..

With respect to your requests that the FBI be given

authority for dicect liaison with the Office of Manage-

ment and Budget on FBI budget matters (s0.76(v)) and with

the White House on operational matters (50.15(b)(7)), I

believe it desirable to have the same language in the

regulations apply to the FBI as applies with respect to

other organizational units of the Department. Your

request for direct operational liaison with the White

House Office is reasonable, but we would need clarifica-

tion as to what you regard as "operational" as distinguished

from policy matters. I believe this request can be

accommodated by further correspondence without a change in

the regulations.

Because of the desirability for uniform treatment of

the various units of the Department in the regulations, I

do not believe that the FBI should be exempt from section

0.75(k), relating to policies and procedures applicable to

automatic data processing. However, the FBI's security

interests will, of course, be protected.

I appreciate your concern in these matters and assure

you that the FBI will have an opportunity to submit its

views before any policy changes affecting it are finalized.

and other Bureau personnel familiar with the opertions of the Director's

oilice, considerable knowledge concerning the citicial and contidential

There is also an estensive request contained in captioned Committee's

letter of 5-4-75 pertaining to information surroanding these files.

Additionally, we responded to a request of the Committee contalned in their

RE: SENSTUDY 75

In light si thie response, Mr. Citenstein requested that

the Burean identily the personnei involved and it is his obrious intention

that the personnel will be luterviewed.

Insomuch as the inspection Division is condacting inquiry

Into this matter, i would appear proper for that Division to determine

the identities of such personnel and, it deemed necessary, interview in? r

connection with the current inquiry. It is also believed that while this

request is oral in nature from the Committee, we should consider

furaishing the information as to the identities of employees to the

Committee inasmuch as if we do not respond to the oral request

Mr. Citenstein indicated, because of the Committee's interest in this

matter, there would be no probiem in his staining autority to furnish the

raquest in writing. it is apparent at this point thai we would not be able

to keep such intormation from the Commitice it such a written request were

• to be received. Additionally, by responding to the pral request it will

encourage the Committee, in the areas they described as tabuse-type,"

to give us an advance indication as to their inquiries.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Inspection Division make the necessary inquiry

conceraing the identities of the employees and, if deemed advisable,

make available to the Legal Analysis Silice that information which will

be furnished to the Committee.

By memorandum dated May 23, 1975, you were

advised that captioned Committee had directed a letter

to the U. S. Postal Service requesting information con-

cerning mail covers initiated by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation. The Committee was referred by Postal

service to the Bureau.

Mr. John Elliff, Task Force Director,

was advised to direct

a letter over the Chairman's

signature requesting the information.

On May 30, 1975, we recontacted Mr. Elliff again

asking_that a letter be directed to the Bureau asking for

the information.

He was instructed that we had been gathering

the requested information, however; prior to our responding,

we should receive a confirmation from the Committee.

Present

at this discussion was K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel

to the Deputy Attorney General. The same information was

conveyed by Special Agent Paul V. Daly to Paul Wallach, Staff

Member of the Committee, who had been making the mail cover

inquiries.

Mr. Wallach indicated that he would correspond

to the Bureau in accordance with this request.

K. William O'Connor advised subsequently that the

Department had received a letter from Wallach to the Department

June 7, 1975, containing the request. Mr. O'Connor stated

that this was not in accordance with our discussion with the

Committee and he was to convey the fact that the request should

be over the Chairman's signature.

Memo to Mr. Adams from Legal Counsel

SENSTUDY 75

On June 11, 1915, Mike Shaheen of the Department,

who is working with K. William O'Connor in handling responses

to the captioned Committee, informed Special Agent Paul V. Daly

at 5:30 p.m. that we should respond to the request concerning

mail covers without waiting for a letter from the Comnittee

over the Chairman's signature. He advised that this instruction

was received by Deputy Attorney General, Harold R. Tyler.

Tyler distinguished this postal request from others

by stating that inasmuch as the Committee Chairman had

authorized the Committee to inquire concerning mail covers

in a letter to U. S. Postal Services, it should not be

necessary for them to write a subsequent letter.

The requests to the Department were conveyed to

the Section Chief of the. Intelligence Division, W. O. Cregar,

on June 1i, 1975.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division expeditiously prepare

the necessary responses concerning mail covers.

Following the death last week of Clyde

removed some documents from the late director's

house in Washington, where Iolson had been 114-3. 5/21/75

ing. Officially, the FBI denies taking any

such action, and a friend of Tolson's says the

only Hoover documents Tolson had were old can-

reported earlier that some of Hoover's private

dossiers,

including information "very, very

damaging"

to persons in the Nixon White House,

were left in Tolson's custody, and a source

told Newsweek this week that the materials were

carted away in a truck.

Assuming that the files in question may be part

of the so-called

"Official and Confidential" files, your

testimony before the House

Judiciary Committee on February

27, 1975, is Instructive.

You said that the number of

files which yo. reviewed contained matters relating to

, and use of the FBI to

gather political intelligence.

Furthermore, at the same time, Director Kelley

suggested that materials from the "Official and Confiden-

tial" files were taken to Director Hoover's home. He

stated:

Immediately after his death Mr. Hoover's/

•some of his employees, including his personal

secretary, went through his files and completed

the destruction of the remainder of the files

that were purely personal.

These were destroyed

by shredding.

Some I understand were taken

out

to his home and placed in his home, they being

historical I presume to some extent. There is

no indication that they were other than personal

files.

Please determine for the Select Committee whether

• any documents were removed from Mr. Tolson's or Mr. Hoover's.

residence by FBI agents or former FBI agents after

Mr. Tolson's death. If agents of the FBI did go to

Mr. Hoover's or Mr. Tolson's residence to remove files,

cription of the documents taken into custody by the FBI.

Were any such documents copies or originals of documents

relating to the business of the FBI? If so, please des-

cribe the subject matter of each such document. Also

indicate the individual within the FBI who has custody

over these files. Furthermore, I respectfully request

on

behalf of the Select Committee

that such files not be des-

troyed or removed from the FBI's custody until further

notice.

April 30, 1975

This memorandum concerns paragraph IV of the attachment

to Senator Church's letter of March 19 to the Attorney General.

On behalf of the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental

Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, I would like to

request

the following:

1. Superseded Sections of the Manual of Instructions.

Certain sections of the Manual currently in effect have been produced

ito us. We had intended by the request to ask for the relevant super-

seded sections (note the absence of the word "current" in Section IV

jas compared to Section IlIA) and we did indicate previously to the

saison staff that ve were interested in superseded sections. But 1. 6/17/15

without regard to that, it is clear from documents such as the

2.6/18/75

Director's letter of August 7, 1973 to the Attorney General that

3.6/20/25

certain superseded sections will be highly relevant in analyzing

the question of legal authority, as well as in understanding particu-

Lar events in earlier years. We would appreciate their being. sent

to us promptly or if that causes mechanical problems, being able to

promptly review them at the FBI in order to select particular

portions for copying. At a minimum we would be interested in •

superseded Manual provisions for the sections set out in Appendix A.

the Bureau has set up particular incidents, anã the attack has

been from the outside. At the present time, nowever, thera is

the Government's attack on the Party principally through

prosecutions under the Smith Act of 1940 and the Internal

Security Act of 1950 which is made to order for an all-out;

disruptive attack against the CP from within. In other words,

the Bureau is in a position to initiate, on a broader scale

Eing of

and fostering from within the internal fight currently raging.

We have been considering possible courses to implement

such a program and, at the present time, we are actively working

on the following four:

1) The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is making an all-

out effort to win over CP members who have become disillusioned

with Stalinist communism.

SWP members are distributing copies

of "The Militant" (SWP publication) at CP rallies and meetings

them the SWP philosophy. This SWP program could very definitely

benefit the Bureau provided we can achieve through our informant

coverage in the SWP some degree of control and direction over it.

The ultimate goal would be to continue and intensify pressure on

the CP from the left. Since the Party is already under pressure

from the right, the combined pressure would contribute materially

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to the

15 offices having SWP activity in the U. S., is attached, sounding

out these offices through their SWP informants as to the

possibility

of initiating several specific steps aimed at the Bureau's

furthering, assisting and possibly adding to. the current sWP

disruptive

program.

2) The CP national convention is scheduled to be held

during February 1957.

At the present time there appear to be 4

separate views within the CP leadership as to the degree or change to

be made in the organization and program oi the ee, UsA. the farty

nas publicly announced that the theory of democratic centralisa

has been modified: and that each CP member has the right to

express his views as to the past mistakes and future path of

communism in the U. S.

Preliminary material for the drait

resolution for the

national convention has been prepared and is

being discussed on a national level prior to being sent to the

various districts for preconvention discussions on a local level.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to 12 key

offices is being prepared, requesting these offices to submit to

of certain informants who will be

briefed and instructed to embark on a disruptive program within

their own clubs, sections, districts or even on a nationallevel.

These informants will raise objections and doubts as to the succass

of any proposed plan of action by the CP leadership. They will

seize every opportunity to carry out the disruptive activity not

only at meetings, conventions, et vetera, but also during social

and other contacts with CP members and leaders.

It is noted that

Memor andum for Mr. Boardman

a letter has been sent to 12 key offices (dated August 27, 1956)

requesting informati on as to the view points of the national and

district leaders relative to the faction within the CP that each

appears to favor. This information can be used by the various

offices in briefing the informants who will carry out the

disruptive program.

It is pointed out that the informants chosen

and approved for this program should not be endangered, since,

as pointed out above, the farty nas publicly encouraged

•all

members to participate in the current discussions.

3) Recently, Albert Blumberg,

national CP leader

and convicted Smith Act subject, was assigned by the Party

contacte

a state ious steals patrist or tap unbon tation,

suggested that

Muster prepare and distribute a document calling

an exchange of opinions by individuals interested in forming a new

sociaist organization.

This is the first step taken by the CP in

A forming a new socialist coalition in which it hopes to participate.

Maste has prepared a document which eriticizes the absence of

Civil liberties, free trade unions and outlets

for dissenting

opinions in the

Soviet Union. It further urges that European

satellite nations, be free from Soviet domination.

The CP hopes

Ito persuade Musterto mollify his criticism of the Soviet Union

before the document is released. At the same time the CP feels

that some mila criticism of the soviet Union and the

USA, Will

be beneficial in gaining noncommunist support for Master proposal.

ACTION: This plan of the CP may create a situation

which would lend itself to a disruptive operation by the Bureau.

It appears that it is too early to actually make a move, but we

are alerting certain offices to this plan of the CP and

instructing that this operation be closely watched so that if a

situation does present itself we will be in a position to make

any move which appears

logical and workable.

Memorandum for Mr. Boardman

4) When the CP underground was put in operation on a

large scale in 1951, CP leaders decided after extensive study,

that underground personnel should either disregara their tax

obligations or file under false names.

ACTION: We have obtained Irom the fleld, the names and

current addresses oi former underground leaders with a view toward

. to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for

appropriate action A memorandum has gone through (August 28,

1956) recommending that the names and current address of 102

such leaders, all of whom nave smith Act ramilications, De

transmitted to the Department and the Depariment be requested

to advise if there is any objection to the Bureau furnishing this

material to IRS.

If there is no objection, the Bureau proposes

to transmit the names and addresses to IRS via Liaison for

appropriate action.

1951 to 1954, of these subjects who actually filed returns

aliases and admit such action, or (2) result in possible

prosecution of those subjects who did not file returns or who

refuse to furnish details if they did file. It is believed that

action by IRS at this time would deal a further devastating blow

at the CP and would certainly reflect very unfavorably on the

John Martin Muste, who, in 1951, was

teaching school in the State of

Maryland; and a daughter, Constance familion, whose adaress is unknown

It is believed the Bureau at this time should consider

engaging in an enlarged program of counterintelligence activities in

connection with the formation of this new broad

socialist organization

which the CP appears to be attempting to create. It is believed that

"the Bureau's interest In considering this possibility the Chicago

Office has been instructed to initiate an intense investigation to

determine the extent of CP domination of the 10/5/56 symposium; to

determine whether the CP is the driving force behind the symposium;

and to afford complete coverage of this affair. By this coverage

Mustets attitude and line of thinking regarding this new organization

might-be ascertained. Upon receipt of this information the Bureau

would be in a better position to make a derinite determination

concerning the feasibility of this plan and the best course to be

followed.

In finding a suitable and reliable third-party contact to

carry out the Bureau's intentions in this matter it is desired that

the New York Office be instructed to thoroughly review its files

concerning Muste fin an effort to locate close contacts of his who

Imight be willing to assist the Bureau; to institute an investigation

Information; to develop information concerning the present whereabouts

of Muste Sison and daughters; and to consider, depenaing upon the

results of its file review. tr

the desirability of Muste's son and

= daughters as possible third-party contacts m order to enlarge on

Muste's background, authority should be granted the New York Office

to interview Louis

as well as the possibility that Budenz might make a good third-party

contact. Outside of

this contact of Budenz, the New York Office will

be instructed-not to make any contacts whatsoever until it has

submitted a "plan of attack" together with its comments and

"Communist Party, USA, Factionaliamy Internal Security - C,"

requesting information as to the vieupoints of the notional

and distriot leaders relative to the particular faction

within the Communist Party (CP) which each leader appears

to faUor.

There is eristing within the CP ot the present

time consicerable internal friction resulting from the

developments at the 20th Congress of the CP of the soviet

Union and from the Government's attack on the Party,

principally through prosecutions under the smith Act of

1940 and the Internúl Security Act of 1950. This situation

appears mode to order for an all-out disruptive attack

against the Party on a broader scale than heretofore

attempted by the Bureau.

Accordingly, the Bureau is thinking

in terms of a counterintelligence program aimed at the CP,

not by harassment from the ouiside which might only serve

to

bring the various

factions together but by jeeding anz

fostering from within the internal fight currently raging.

Among the several courses of action under

consideration by the Bureau

is one which will involve the

use of certain confidential informants tho will be

and instructed to embark on a disruptive program within

their own clubs,

sections, and districts.

It is contemplated

that these informants will seek to continue

and increase

the current confusion existing within the Cp by raising

questions and doubts as to the success of any proposed plan

of action by the CP lecdership. For example, when the

draft resolution for the forthcoming national convention

comes up for discussion in the various districts throughout

the country, these informants con point up the weaknesses

inherent in the resoluiiong the weaknesses and mistakes of

the present leadership; the conditions which existed in

Russia during stalina leadership; failure of the CP leadership

in this country to make any progress in the

labor field, the

Negro question; and many others.

The ain of the informants will be to take advantage

of the CP requests for open discussion by the membership to

force discuasion of topios reflecting on the effectiveness of

CP leadership, programs, and philosophy Such discussion is

intended to shake the confidence of CP members in their

movement and render them more susceptible to development as

informants or cause them to abandon the Party or to follow

some other course of actian which would interfere with an

effective reorientation of the policies of the CP.

It is not

intended that the informants compromise themselves

in advancing

these topica for discussion. Their approach shouls be overtly

constructive and exploratory rother than critical.

Under no

circumstances will any indication be given to the informants

participating in the program that other informants may be

engaged in similar activit!, and the questions and topics

raised by our informants will be so carejully planned and

introduced at the meetings in such a manner that they will not

attract any more attention than other members who are taking

part in the discussions.

It is contemploted that the informants will seize

every opportunity to carry out this disruptive activity not

only at official Party functions but also during social and

other contacts with CP members and leaders.

It is felt that.

if the informents are properly selected and briefed, there

should be no danger involved in such action on their part

since all CP members have been encouraged by the ncileral

leadership to participate fully in current and fortigering

discussions

"Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and other Hate Groups" was

approved by the Director authorizing the Domestic Intelligence

Division to give consideration to the application of counterintel-

ligence and disruptive tactics to hate groups and to thereafter

make appropriate recommendations.

It is our recommendation that

we immediately initiate a hard-hitting, closely supervised,

coordinated

counterintelligence. program

_to expose, disrupt

and

otherwise neutralize the Ku Klux Klan _(KKK) and specified other

hate groups.

This new counterintelligence effort will take advantage

of our experience with a variety of sophisticated techniques

successfully applied against the Communist Party, USA, and related

organizations since 1956.

Primarily, we intend

to expose to public

scrutiny the devious maneuvers and duplicity of the hate groups;

te frustrate any efforts or plans they may have to consolidate

their forces;

to discourage their recruitment of new or youthful

adherents; and to disrupt or eliminate their efforts to circumvent

Or violate the law.

Our counterintelligence efforts against hate

groups vill be closely supervised and coordinated to complenent

our expanded intelligence investigations directed at these

organizations.

We are furnishing general instructions to 17 field

offices (14 Southern offices responsible for active investigation

of 1? Klan groups and 6 hate organizations, and New York, Chicagon

and Baltimore, who have active investigative responsibilities

counterintelligence activity during the prior 3-month period.

Each office will be instructed to open and maintain a pending

Investigation relating to this program and to assign a Special

Agent on a part-time basis as the program coordinator responsible

for folloving and initiating counterintelligence action.

As is the instance in our established counterintelligence

program against the Communist Party, USA, land in our current 90-day

trial counterintelligence program directed against Soviet-Satellite

intelligence Tall recommended counterintelligence action against

lan-type and hate organizations will be required to be approved

at the seat of Government.

This new counterintelligence program directed at Klan

and hate organizations will be supervised at the Seat of Government

by the Special Agent supervisor responsible for our similar programs

directea against the Communist Party, USA Land Soviet-Satellite

intelligence. His efforts will be closely coordinated ith

supervisory personnel responsible for the intelligence investigations

of the Klans and hate organizations and their membership. An annual

memorandum justifying continuance of the program will be submitted

and the participating field offices will be periodically apprised

of techniques which have been found to be most successful. At

such time as the program is considered to be successfully under

way, a status memorandum will be submitted which will include any

additional recommendations relating to manpower or other administrative

requirements.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1.

That the Domestic Intelligence Division be authorized

to immediately initiate a coordinated counterintelligence program

directed at exposing, disrupting and otherwise neutralizing the

17. active Klan organizations and 9 active racial hate organizations.

RE: COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

BACKGROUND

By letter dated 8/25/67 the following offices

were advised of the beginning of a Counterintelligence

Program against militant Black Nationalist-Hate Groups:

Albany

Memphis

Atlanta

Newark

Baltimore

New Orleans

Boston

New York

Buffalo

Charlotte

Philadelphia

Phoenix

Chicago

Cincinnati

Pittsburgh

Richmond

Cleveland

St. Louis

San Francisco

Jacison

Washington Field

Los Angeles

Each of the above offices was: to designate a

Special Agent to coordinate this program. Replies to this

letter indicated an interest in counterintelligence against

militant black nationalist groups that foment violence and

several offices outlined procedures which had been effective

in the past.

For example, Washington Field Office had

furnished information about a new Nation of Islam (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

of Columbia who investigated to determine if the school

conformed to District regulations for private schools. In

the process Wro obtained background information on the parents

of each pupil.

The Revolutionary ACtion Movement (RAM), a pro-

chinese communist group, was active in Philadelphia, Pa.,

in the summer of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police, who then put RAM leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested on every possible charge until they could

no longer make bail.

As a result, RAM leaders spent

most of the

summer in jail and no violence traceable to RAM took place.

The Counterintelligence Program is now being

expanded to include 41 ofices.

Each of the offices added

to this program should designate an Agent familiar with black

nationalist activity, and interested in counterintelligence,

to coordinate this program.

This Agent will be responsible

for the periodic progress

letters being requested, but each

Agent working this type of case should participate in the

formulation of counterintelligence operations.

GOALS

For maximun effectiveness of the Counterintelligence

program, and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

1. Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist

groups.

In unity there is strength; a truism

that is no less valid for all its triteness.

An effective

coalition of black nationalist groups night be the first

step toward a real "Mau lau" in America, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

2. Prevent the rise of a "messiah" who could

unify, and electrify, the militant black nationalist movement.

• Malcolm & might have

been such a messiah; he is the martyr

of the movement today. Martin Luther Kins, Stokely Camichael y

*and Flyan truhanned all

aspire to this position.

Bi gan Di

muhammed is less of a threat because of his age.!

be a very

real contender for this position should he abandon

his supposed "obedience" to "white,

liberal doctrines

(nonviolence) and embrace black nationalism. (Carmichael&

has the necessary charisma to be a real threat in this way.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups.

This is of primary importance, and is,

• of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it shouid

also be a

goal of the Counterintelligence Program. Through

counterintelligence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublemakers and neutalize them before they exercise their

potential for violence.

4. Prevent militant black nationalist groups and

leaders from gaining respectability, by discrediting them

to three separate segments of the community.

The goal of

discrediting black nationalists must be handled tactically

in three ways. You must discredit these groups and

individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community.

Second, they must be discredited to the white community,

RE:

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

-

both the responsible community and to "liberals" who have

vestiges of sympathy for militant black nationalist simply

because they are Negroes.

Third, these groups must be

discredited in the eyes of Negro radicals, the followers

of the movement. This last area requires

entirely different

tactics from the first two.

Publicity about violent tendencies

and radical statements merely enhances black nationalists

to the last group; it adds "respectability" in a different

way.

5. A final goal should be to prevent the long.

range growth of militant black nationalist organizations,

especially among youth. Specific tactics to prevent these

groups from converting

young people must be developed.

Besides these five goals counterintelligence is

a valuable part of our regular investigative program as it

often produces positive information.

TARGETS

Primary targets of the Counterintelligence Program,

Black Nationalist-Hate Groups, should be the most violent

and radical groups and their leaders. We should emphasize

those leaders and organizations that

are nationwide in scope

and are most capable of disrupting this country. These

targets should include the radical and violence-prone

leaders, members, and followers of the:

Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) .

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) :

Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM) :

Nation of Islam. (NOI)

Martin" Luther King

INSTRUCTIONS

Within 30 days of the date of this letter each oface

should:

Agent assigned to coordinate this program.

Agonts assigned as Cointeloro coordinators in the Chicago

and New York Offices should immediately confor with key

personnel assigned to soviet-Satellite-type investigationg

for the purpose of devising one or several sophisticaied

counterintelligence techniaues against Soviet-Satellite

intelligence activities or personnel.

As the Washington

plans for implementing one or several such operations.

Care should be taisen to insure plans devised under this

program do not conflici with existing prograns or operations

directed against Sovice and Satellite intelligence activities.

No Coincelpro action should be initiated vition specific

Bureau authority.

This new application of the Cointelpro is not

meant at this ¿ire to ba an all-out attack against Soviet-

feasibility of extending our organized counterintelligence

effort. The results of our expanded elforts will be reviewed

Selection of Informants - An analysis of

the

available informants should

be made by each office

with counterintelligence potential in order to

select those informants who could be used for dis

ruptive tacties.

Each informant approved for use

in connection with counterintelligence operation

will, of course, have to be briefed individually on

issues and controversial subjects which are to be

raised.

The informants should not be told that there

is any over-all counterintelligence program or that

disruptive tactics are deing undertaken

as a program

but each informant should be given the impression that

he is operating on an individual basis.

Bureau

approval must be obtained for the informants selected

for this operation before the informant is briefed.

In the event a review of the available informants

shows that additional informants with counterintelli

gonco possibilities ara needed. plans should be laid

to develop such informants, bearing in mind that

this is a long-range progran.

The analysis should

also include the adequacy of informants who can keep

the office effectively advised of the internal

operations of the organizations involved so that

disruptive tactics can be undertaken on a sound basis.

Organizational Tactics • consideration should be

given to placing informants in each opposing faction

of an organization to play one group against the

other. Consideration should be given to the possi

bility of having anonymous telephone invitations issued

to one group to attend open meetings of the other group;

should be prompt to furnish the bureau sufficient

copies of such articles for forwarding to interested

border offices so that if desirable, arrangements

can be made to have those articles anonymously mailed

to selected comnunist leaders locally or from some other

area in Mexico.

should be given

to tactics wiich would bring indi-

vidual communist leaders under suspicion of being

The Bureau will consider any well-conceived plan

ot causing disruption inside ine ur or related organizations.

In any counterintelligence operation, however, it is impera-

tive that the office submitting the recommendations nake

sure that it will not jeopardize informani coverage or cause

embarrassment to the bureau.

Consideration should be given to the possibility

of setting up thoroughly safe cutout arrangements for con-

tacts with

good newspaper sources through which information

can be fed to the press regarding semipublic procomunist

meetings or communist domination of tront groups and through

which information can be led to the press to produce bad

publicity relative to c?

activities.

Any proposals to set

up such an arrangement must be submitted to the Bureau for

approval before implementing them.

The Bureau appreciates the fact that Albuquerque,

through absolute lack of communist activity, is not in a

position to implement a counterintelligence program; however,

a copy of this communication is being sent forinformation of

that office.

tactics,

through

various

connunist sympathizers or former CP members who are

still considered to be sympathetic to commnism in order to

make sure that those groups continue to be disorganized.

In view of the ineffectual operations of the CP

in Juarez and the excellent informant coverage existing in

that

group at the present time, it would appear that dis

ruptive tactics among the CP cells in Juarez may not be

desirable. El Paso,

however, should give consideration to

possible use of disruptive tactics, through raising contro

versial issues and sharpening antagonisms, among the communist

sympathizers and former conmunisis who are siiii synathetic

to the conmunist movement in the Juarez area. El Paso should

also submit its observations regarding the possibility of

• using informants to raise controversial issues in the Chihuahua

State Committee of the CP of Mexico.

Any recommendations along

this line will be referred by the Bureau to the Legal Attache's

Office, Mexico, for comment to insure that such tactics will

not destroy existing

informant coverage of that office in the

Chihuahua State Committee.

Both El Paso and San Antonio should give con-

sideration

to the possibility of using discrediting techniques

in conneccion with individual communists who, although not

are a threat to the securaty of

the United States in order to bring out into the open their

communist sympathies and destroy their potential usefulness

as Soviet intelligence agents or to neutralize their propa

ganda value to the communist movement..

The Phoenix Office should give consideration to

the possible use of disruptive tactics to further divide the pro-

communist groups in their area and to sharpen antagonisms

(COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PRUGRAM)

105-66754

Both the San Juan and New York Uffices should prepare,

from public source information,

a proposed timely article wüch

would not jeopardize any infomant or bureau technique showing

the nationalist ond/or connunist luerto Rican indepéndence

organizations to oe basicaily anti-ruerto Nico.

These articles

will be considered for publication through either Bureau contacts

or contacts of the San Juan and New York Uffices.

We should particularly direct our efforts against the

leaders of the suerto rican organizations which advocate to any

degree the use of force or violonce to obtain fuerto kico's

independence.

Consider the use of anonymous letters where

disparaging statements arc made by one leader against another.

The Agents concerncil with this matter in the New York

Office should review for ideas, techniques anl tactics employed

in

the counterintelligence progran against the Comunist Party, USA.

It appears that in Fuerto Rico the most imediate target

of international communisn

is to infinence the Federacion de

Universitarios tro Independencia (FUP]). San Juan shouli, therefore,

consider tactics designed to lessen commist influence in the FU'I

and to lessen FUlI's influence anong the stulent bouy at the

University of Puerto Rico.

Future communications should be captioned as above.

San Juan is being considered office of origin in this

matter and copies of communications prepared by San Juan should be

furnished the New York Uffice.

New York should furnish San Juan

copies of communications prepared by New York.

6.

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

long-range counterintelligence program designed to provoke

a

dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostra

under the code name of Hoodwink.

OBJECTIVES:

A dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and

La Cosa Nostra would cause disruption of both groups

having each expend their energies, time, and money attacking

the other. This would help neutralize the activities of both

groups which are detrimental to this country.

BACKGROUND:

La Cosa Nostra has no sympathy for the communists.

The Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostra come in contact

I with each other in the labor field where hoodlums operate

businesses under "sweatshop" conditions. By making it appear

that the Party is attacking hoodlum labor practices, over a

period of time we could provoke a bitter dispute between the

two organizations.

The New York Office has recommended a specific

technique to initiate this program. This technique consists

of anonymously forwarding one leaflet to a local La Cosa Nostra

leader attacking the labor practices of one of his enterprises.

The leaflet would ostensibly be published by a local Party

unit.

A note with the leaflet would give the impression that

it has received wide circulation ReC 10

"Let's show

the hoodlums and the bosses that the workers are united

Take the usual precautions to insure this mailing

During its Investigation of the Communist Party,

USAg

the Bureau has sougat to capitalize on incidents

Involving the Party and its leaders in order

to Loster

factionalism, bring the coamunist party (Ch) and its Leaders

1nt0 aisrenute bezore the imerican public and cause coniusion

and dissatisiaction among rank-and-lile members of the CP.

Generally, the above action has constituted

harrassment rather

then aisruptlon, since, Icr

the most part;.

Ithe Bureau has set up particular incidents, and the attack nas

been from the outside.

At the present time, nowever, there is

existing within

1 the CP a situation resulting fron

the

develop-

menis au the 20üh Congreos on tho CP ci tho Seriet Union and

ine Governmeni's attack ui the Party principally thecugh

prosecutions under the Smith Act of 1940 and the Internai

Security Act of 1950 which is made to order for an all-out:

disruptive attacs against the CP from within. In other words,

the Bureau is in a position to initiate, on a broader scale

than beretorore altarpiad, a counterintel ence natal sansel

various factions together, but by feeding

and fostering Iron within the internal light currently ragingo

We have been considering possible courses to implement

such a program and, at the present time, we are actively working

on the following four:

1) The Socialist Workers Party (SWP) is making an all-

Tout effort to win over CP members

who nave become disillusioned

when stalinist coumunise.

Sip members are distributing copies

or "rhe Militant" (SP publication) at CP rallies and meetings

them the SWP philosophy. This SWP program could very definitely

benefit the Bureau provided we can achieve through our informant

coverage in the SWP some degree of control and direction over it.

The ultimate goal would be to continue and intensify pressure on

the CP from the left. Since the Party is already under pressure

from the right, the combined pressure would contribute materially

to distracting

the CP from its primary goas.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to the

15 offices having SWP activity in the U. s., is attached, soundin:

out these oflices througn their Sip Informants as to the

possibility

of Initiating several specific steps aimed at the Bureau's

furthering, assisting and possibly adding to.: the current sWp

disruptive

program.

• 2) The CP national convention is scheduled to be hela

during February 1957. At the present time there appear to be 4

separate views within the CP leadership as to the degree of change to

be made in the organization and program of the CP, USA.

The Party

has publicly announced that the theory of democratic centralism

has leen modified and that each CP member has the right to

express his views as to the past mistakes and future path of

communism in the U. So Preliminary material for the draft

resolution for the national convention has been prepared and is

being discussed on a national level prior to being sent to the

varlous districts Ior preconvéntion discussions on a local level.

ACTION: A memorandum, together with a letter to 12 key

offices 1s being prepared, requesting these offices to submit to

of certain informants who will be

briefed and instructea to embark on a disruptive program within

their own clubs, sections, districts or even on a nationallevel.

These informants will raise objections and doubts as to the success

of any proposed plan of action by the CP leadership. They will

seize avery opportunity to carry out the disruptive activity not

only at meetings, conventions, et vetera, but also during social

and other contacts with CP members and leaders. It is noted that

a letter has been sent to 12 key offices (dated August 27, 1955)

requesting information as to the view points oi the national ana

district leaders relative to the laction within the CP that each

appears to favor. This infcrmation can be used by the various

offices.In brieling the informants who will carry out the

disruptive progran. It is pointed out that the informants chosen

and

approvea 1or this program should not be endangered, since,

as pointed out above, the party has publicly encouraged all

members to participate in the current discussions.

3) Recently,

a national CP leader

and convicted suith at subject, was assigned by the party to

&. semireligious Sucialist pallfist organization.

suggested that

prepare and distribute a document calling for

an exchange of opinions by individuals interested in forming a new

sociaist organization.

This is the first step taken by the CP in

forming a new

socialist coalition in which it nores

to participate.

Jhas prepáred a document which criticizes the absence of

(civil liberties, Iree trade unions and outlets lor dissenting

opinions in the

Soviet Union. It further urges that European

satellite nations be free irch soviet domination. The CP hores

¿ to mollify his criticism of the Soviet Union

tefore the document is released.. At the same time the CP feels

nat some mild criticism oi the soviet Union and the CP. UsA, will

be beneficial In gaining noncommunist support lor

proposal.

ACTION: This plan of the CP may create a situation

which would lend itself to a disruptive operation by the Bureau.

It appears that it is too early to actually make a move, but re

aro alerting certain offices to this plan of the CP and

are

Instructing that this operation be closely watched so that if a

situation does present itself we will be in a position to make

any move which appears logical and workable.

Memorandum for MI. Boardman

4) When the CP underground was put in operation on a

large scale In 1951, CP leaders decided after extensive study,

that undergrouna personnel should either disregard their tax.

obligations or file under false names:

ACTION: We have obtained from the field, the names and

current addresses of former underground leaders with a view toward

furnishing them to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) For

appropriate action. A memorandum has gone through (August 28,

1956) recommending that the names and current adäress of 102:

such leaders, ald of whom nave snith Act ramilications, be

transmitted to the Depariment anâ the Department be requested

to advise if there is any objection to the Bureau furnishing this

material to IRS. If there is no objection, the Bureau proposes

to transmit the names and addresses to IRs via Liaison for

-appropriate action

We will then lollow IRS very closely since

InS action should: (1) uncover the aliases and whereabouts; iron

1951 to 1954, of these subjects who actually filed returns under

aliases and aimit suci action, or (2) result in possible

prosecution of those subjects

who did

not file returns or who

refuse to furnish details if they dia file. It is believed that

action by IRs at this tine would deal

a further devastating blow

at the CP and would certainly reflect very uniavorably on the

Party leadership for the instructions issued in 1951. :

OBSERVATIONS:

We are going ahead with the 4 courses of action listed

pIn this memorandum. A detailed memorandum is attached covering

the SWP angle; a memoranium has gone through separately covering

the first phase ol the ins angle, ano a detailed memorandum

covering the disruptive program by confidential informants is

being prepared as is a menoranaum covering the

will be given as to whether it will be of benefit to the

situations which might afford additional opportunities for

This Agent will be responsible

Agent working this type of case should participate in

GOALS

For maximum effectiveness of the Counterintelligence

program, and to prevent wasted effort, long-range goals are

being set.

I. Prevent the coalition of militant black

nationalist groups.

In unity there is strength; a truism

that is no less valid for all its triteness.

An effective

coalition of black nationalist groups right be the first

step toward a real "Hau lau" in America, the beginning of

a true black revolution.

3. Prevent violence on the part of black

nationalist groups. This is of primary inportance, and is,

of course, a goal of our investigative activity; it should

also be a

• goal of the Counterintelligence Program.

Through

counterintellizence it should be possible to pinpoint potential

troublenakers and neutalize them before they exercise their

potential lor violence.

4 Prevent militant black nationalist groups and

leaders fron gaining respectability, by discrediting them

to three separate segments of the community.

The goal of

discrediting black nationalistmust be handled tactically

In three ways.

You must discredit these groups and

Individuals to, first, the responsible Negro community.

Second, they must be discredited to the white community,

both the responsible community and to "Iiberals" who have

vestiges of synpathy for militant black nationalist sinoly

because they are regroes.

Third, these groups must be

discredited in the eyes of Negro

radicals, the follovers

of the novement. This last area requires

entirely diffcrent

tactics from the first two.

Publicity about violent tencencies

and radical statements merely enhances black nationalists *

to the last group; it adds

"respectability" in a different.

way.

5. A final goal should be to prevent the long-

range groth of militant black nationalist organizations,

especially anong youth. Specific tactics to prevent these.

groups from converting young people must be developed. •

Besides these five goals counterintelligence is

a valuable part of our regular investigative program as it

often produces positive information.

TARGETS

Primary

targets of the Counterintelligence Program,

Black Nationalist-Hate Groups, should be the most violent

and radical groups and their leaders. He should emphasize

those leaders and organizations that are nationwide in scope

and are most capable of disrupting this country. These

targets should include the radical and violence-prone

leaders, members, and followers of the:

RE: COUNTERIYTELLIGENCE PROGRAM

BLACK NATIONALIST-HATE GROUPS

The effectiveness of counterintelligence depends

on the quality and quantity of positive information

available regarding the target and on the imagination and

initiative of Agents working the program. The response of

the field to the Counterintelligence Program against the

sio

Communist Party, USA, indicates that a superb job can be

done by the field on counterintelligence.

Counterintelligence operations must be approved

by the Bureau.

Because of the nature of this program each

operation must be designed to protect the Bureau's interest

so that there is no possibility of embarrassment to the

Bureau. Beyond this the Bureau will give every possible

consideration to your proposals.

_DISRUPTION OF THE NEM LEFT

-Our Tation is undergoing an era of disruption and

violence caused to a large extent by various individuals

generally connected with the New Left. Some of these activists

urge revolution in America and call for the defeat of the

United

states in Vietnan.

They continually and falsely allege

police

brutality and do not hesitate to utilize unlawful acts

to further their so-alled causes.

The New Left has on many

accasions

viciously and scurrilously attacked the Director

and the Bureau in an

ättempt to hamper our investigation of it

and to drive us off the college campuses. With this in mind,

LE IS Our

recommendation that a new Counterintelligence Program

be designed

to neutralize the New Left and the key Activists:

The Key Activists

those individuals who are the moving

forces behind the New Left and on whom we have intensified our

investigations.

The purpose of this program is to expose, disrupt and

otherwise neutralize the activities of this group and persons

connected with it; It is hoped that with this new program

their violent and illegal activities may be reduced if not

curtailed.

General instructions are being furnished to all offices

relating to the purpose and administration of this new program.

Briefly, these instructions require all offices to submit an

analysis of possible counterintelligence operations on the New

Leît and on the Key Activists on or before 6/1/68, including

any specific recommendations for action.

Thereafter, all

offices will submit a 90-day status letter setting forth a

summary of their accomplishments and future plans.

Each

office will maintain

• PURPOSE:

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend a

long-range counterintelligence program designed to provole a

dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa

under the code name of Hoodwink.

NostrE

OBTECTIVES:

A dispute between the Communist Party, USA, and

La Cosa Nostra would cause disruption of both groups by

having

each expend their energies, time, and money

attacking

the other. This would help neutralize

the activities of both

groups which are detrimental to this country.

BACKGROUND:

La Cosa Nostra has no sympathy for the communists.

The Communist Party, USA, and La Cosa Nostra cone in contact

I With each other in

the labor field where hoodlums aporate

businesses under "sweatshop" conditions. By maling it appear

that the Party is attacking hoodlum lakor practices, over a

period of time we could provoie a bitter dispute betweon the

two orgagizations.

The New York Office has recommended a specific

technique to initiate this program. This technique corsists

of anonymously forwarding one leaflet to a local la Cosa Restra

leader attacking the labor practices of one of his enterprines.

The leaflet would ostensibly ve published by a local Party

unit.

A note with the leaflet would give the impression that

it has received wide circulation

Enclosure.

results.

key fork should also submit follorouy recommendations

to continue this program.

Ine Party has been the subject of recent boibings

• typical boodlum technique.

Consider'a spurious Farty

'statement blaming the ICN for the bombings because ei

"party efforts on behalf of the workers." This statenenen

dould be ained at specific loN sembars ii appropriate.

*In developing this progran, thought should also be

given to initiating spurious ICN attacks on the CPUSA, so that

each i

group would think the other vas nounting & canpaign

agalast it.

The Buresu very much appreciates New York's careful

analysis of this program and the initial "lor-key" technique

suggested.
