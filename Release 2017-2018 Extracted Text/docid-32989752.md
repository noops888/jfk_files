Letter. #2

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

• Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This letter serves to confirm the understanding reached

between this Committee and the FBI on April 12, 1978, concerning

1) the roles the FBI informants within the Invader organization

relative to the activities of DI. Martin Luther King, JX., and

2) the possible cooperative postures of the informants who have

provided information concerning

the relationship between Klan

members and Arthur Hanes, Sr., in the course of the latter's

representation of James BAbA REC:72 62-117 290 - lX

As to the Invader situation, it is understood that the

FBI will locate and sanitize the informant files of all informants

within the Invaders during 1968 and provide the Committee with

access to these files. The sanitizing process will be undertaken

only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the in-

formants.

The FBI will also provide the Committee, for interview

purposes, with the control agent or agents for these Invader

informants.

This Committee, however, reserves the right to

request production of the identity of all Invader informants

during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent interviews-be.

inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by the Committee.

2 AIR 19 1978

As to the informants who have provided information

relative to the Klan relationship with Arthur Hanes SrT during

the course of Hanes' representation of James Earl Ray, it is

understood that the FBI will contact the informants listed in

he serials listed below. to determine it an interview with this

- Committee can be arranged.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated

matter, SL 3167-C, St. Louis File 137-16185, Bureau File

13/-36945, was reviewed.

This file contained a contact

memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information

relating to several criminal matters and also contained the

following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,

date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as

to whether they could get together to talk, and they later

did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo., in the area of a

Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on

business.

Beyers talked freely about himself and his

business, and they later went to informant's house where

Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis

County, now deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a

• contract to kill Martin Luther King.

He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who

walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually

the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing.) Beyers said he had declined to accept this

contract.

He did remark that this lawyer had confederate

flags and other items about the house that might indicate

that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also commented that

he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices

and files failed to reveal this information was if any way

disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant

file.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

3:54 p.m.,

Mississippi, FBI Division, appeared before representatives

of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

at Washington, D.C.

SA Sammon was questioned by Mark A. Speiser,

Peter G. Beeson, and Wendy S. Collins, all of whom

identified themselves through the use of credentials,

as being associated with aforementioned committee.

At the outset, SA Sammon was asked to furnish

background information concerning his career with the

FBI,

the number of offices and dates assigned and

classifications worked.

SA Sammon was asked to identify Special

Agents in Charge (SACs) and Assistant Special Agents

e (5A9)

in Charge (ASAGs) assigned to the Miami, Florida,

FBl Office during the period of 1961-1964, when

SA Sammon was so assigned to that office.

The identity

of these SACs was furnished as Wesley G. Grapp and

Fred A. Frobrose (phonetic). It was explained that

former SAC Frobrose is now deceased.

SA Sammon was asked to identify members of

his squad while he was assigned to the Miami Office.

SA Sammon advised that he would be unable to identify

each and every Agent assigned to the Number 5 squad

during the years of 1961 and 1964 inclusive, due to the

length of time that had transpired since that period.

as well as. other law entorcement agencies, not to

reveal the identity of Bureau informants to those

agencies, even though the information furnished by

SA Sammon indicating it was their feeling that the FBI

"receives all information but does not share information"

with other law enforcement agencies, Federal,

local.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

336356

By letter dated December 13, 1977, this Committee re-

quested that the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau

of Investigation, respectively, provide the Committee with docu-

ments and lists of attorneys and agents relative to a) the FBI,

COINTELPRO program directed against Dr. Martin Luther King,

, and b) the MURKIN investigation.

By January 25, 1978, the FBI had complied with that

portion of the request which pertained to its files and its

agents.

However,

the Department of Justice has yet to supply

the similar materials requested of it.

Any. further delay.in com-

pliance will begin to interfere

substantially with the efforts

of this Committee to resolve in a professional and thorough

manner any issues surrounding the responsibility of Federal lay

enforcement and activities in the conduct.of the MURKIN Invést1-

gation. Therefore, in order to avoid a delay with such effects,

it is necessary that the Department of Justice comply with this

Committee's request of December 13, 1977 by no later than Apral

10, 1978.

BY letter dated 2/6/78, it was requested that the FBI

provide this Committee copies of all bank records secured in

the investigation of certain members of the Ray family.

In

FBI memorandum dated March 1, 1978, reference was made

• to the

Bureau having included John Raynes (father) in the bank records

search. It has come to our attention, subsequently, that spe-

cific records of John Raynes were secured by the St. Louis

Field Office in connection with their investigation; oddly

those bank records do not appear in the materials furnished

3/1/78. In view of these facts, it is hereby requested that

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS

(HSCA)

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Atlanta

Division, was contacted telephonically on Friday,

March 17, 1978 by Robert Walker who identified

himself as a Staff Investigator for the House Select

Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) • Walker made

arrangements to meet with SA Rackleff at the

intersection of North Avenue and Spring Street, Atlanta,

Georgia, at 11:00 AM on Monday, March 20, 1978.

Walker stated he would be in

Staff Investigator whom he identified as Mr. Reeves,

a black male.

At 11:00 AM on March 20, 1978, SA Rackleff

met with Robert Walker and Floyd Reeves, both of

whom displayed credentials identifying themselves

• to be members of the Investigative Staff of the U. s.

Congress.

Reeves conducted the questioning and requested

the intormation relating to the neighborhood canvassing

conducted by SA Rackleff in the vicinity of North

Highland Street and Ponce

de Leon Avenue in April,

1968.

Reeves inquired as to the person or persons

coordinating the investigation conducted in the Atlanta

Division and specifically asked whether other areas

of Atlanta were canvassed in addition to this one

particular area.

Reeves specifically asked it other

areas which were identified by markings on a map

recovered from the apartment of James Earl Ray were

canvassed in addition to this one area near North

Highland Avenue and Ponce de Leon.

SA Rackleff explained he could not recall •

specifically how many markings were on the map, but

believed there were basically four areas marked.

He stated three of these markings were identifiable

as being significant to the approximate location

of the home and church of Doctor Martin Luther King,

JI. and the apartment of James Earl Ray. The fourth

marking on the map as recalled by SA Rackleff was

not significant or identifiable with any known activity

of either James Earl Ray or Dr. King, and therefore

an extremely thorough, door-to-door

survey was conducted

in an area well beyond the boundaries of the fourth

marking on the map. Each and every adult member

of each household was contacted and interviewed concerning

any knowledge or association with James Earl Ray

or Dr. Martin Luther King. Photographs of Ray were

displayed and

as best as could be recalled,

there

was no pertinent information developed specifically

identifying any associates of either James Earl Ray

or Dr. King.

The Special Agent in Charge of the Atlanta

Division was identified as Frank Hitt, and the Assistant

Special Agent in Charge at that time was identified

as Jack Keith, Jr.

Mr. Reeves reguested an additional interview

of SA Rackleff in the Conference Room at the Headquarters

of the Atlanta Police Department at 3:00 PM on that

same date for the purpose of displaying a replica

of the map recovered from Ray's apartment. At 3:00

PM, a second interview was conducted. by Mr. Reeves

and Mr. Walker.

Mr. Reeves displayed

what he

identified to be a replica of the map recovered from

Pay's apartment in April, 1968 and also displayed

a legal sized handwritten paper showing separate

investigations conducted by. SA Harry Lee, SA James

The investigation

by SA Rackleff identified the streets and addresses

canvassed during the neighborhood investigation.

SA Rackleff explained that he reported to the Atlanta

Office in about January 1968, and at the time of

the

investigation of the King

assassination, he was

not familiar with

the streets and locations. SA

Rackleff was unable to recall specifically observing

the map displayed by Mr. Reeves, however, did

made some fourteen of more trips out of the Miami Division

reporting on Klan organizations and leaders of White Hate

This later resulted in the prosecution and

The extent of the information

Some information was

Police Department was reluctant to furnish information

The investigators were primarily interested in

information developed by Sommersett on or about April 3,

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation by this Committee

into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin

Luther King, Jr., it is requested that the Federal Bureau

of Investigation make available for reproduction all blueprints

and rough sketches used in the construction of the mock-up

of the crime scene.

These documents are housed in Bulky

Folder 5586 of the Headquarter's MURKIN file and have been

reviewed by the Committee.

The Committee forsees using only

a few of the documents, therefore, we request that, rather

than reproducing these materials in their entirety, you allow

a Committee representative to identify these documents as

needed.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S, HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (#SCA) /

On March 17, 1978, Special Agent Jim Haggerty,

St. Louls Field Supervisor, was contacted regarding additional

information concerning this matter.

Haggerty advised that

St. Louis informant had spoken with russell George Beyers

who 1s a fence in the St. Louis area.

Beyers was opened

as a source (su 131-16541; Buffle unknown) on October. 3,

1975, and closed November, 1976. A copy of the original

source contact memorandum was placed in Beyers' Informant

file and an 87-file, however, there is no evidence that Beyers

was ever questioned

about the meeting with the deceased

St. Louls attorney. Additionally, there 1s no evidence that

this Information was éver acted on or disseminated outside the

St. Louls Office.

Beyers was arrested approximately two

weeks ago by the

St. Louis Police Department as suspect in

a st. Louis museum burglary and this precipitated the

file review which surfaced the information in question.

Haggerty stated that both the Agent and Supervisor who handled

original contact memorandum with St. Louis Informant have

retIred.

The original St. Louis Informant (SL 3167-C; Bufile

137-36945) to whom Beyers spoke has been closed as an Informant

and is residing in Chicago, Illinois.

Response regarding Beyers' Informant status was

coordinated with Special Agent Jeff Jamar, Criminal Informant

Unit, DivisIon Six.

A search was made of the central records index for

Russell George Beyers.

The only reference to Beyers was in

BUfIle 87-129497-11, which concerned Beyers: possible

Involvement in fencing the proceeds from a St. Louis museum

theft. No Bureau informant file was located.

Original St. Louis letterhead memorandum dated

March 13, 1978, contained Informant symbol number,

and

St. Louis and Bureau informant file numbers, and was, therefore,

retyped with this information deleted,

As the HSCA is expected tò have an intense Interest

In this information, It 1s being furnished in memorandum form.
