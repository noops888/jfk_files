External Oversight

1.

DCD's only recorded contact with Joscph Raymond Merola

prior to August 1961 occurred on 6 February 1961.

It followed

a series of telephone calls over a period of several months

in which Merola had expressed interest in offering his assis-

tance in connection with Cuban matters. The DCD officer had

declined contact until 6 February when Merola claimed to have

information on

a Brazilian senator who was a "close friend

and confidante" of "Che" Guevera.

Because Guevera was the

subject of requirements levied on DCD, our officer agreed to

a meeting.

The substance of the 6 February 1961 meeting is

described

in report 00-A(S)-3179213, dated & february.
