SA Hugueley advised that in the recent past both

of the Werbells were arrested by BATE Agents as a result

of their selling seven automatic weapons to a BATF under-

cover Agent,

in violation of Federal law.

The Werbells

won an acquittal in United States District Court (USDC)

of these charges in the recent past.

SA Hugueley continued that in addition to the

above matter, his bureau is currently investigating the

Werbells under the provisions of the Gun Control Act of

1968, Section 922M. He advised that his bureau recently

reviewed the records of DSC and found discrepancies in

these records. He explained that the Federal law requires

that anyone having a Class 3 license to export automatic

weapons from the United States is required to be able to

account for every weapon which it has in its inventory or

which it exports, and that it was in this regard that the

Werbells came under scrutiny by the BATF. He continued

that as a result of his investigation, the BATE secured

a search warrant from the USDC, Northern District of Georgia

(NDGA), Atlanta, Georgia, and subsequently seized approxia

mately 3,500 automatic weapons and approximately 1,400

sound suppressors (silencers) from DSC.

At this time

has in its inventory only one automatic weapon.

SA Hugueley continued that on December 13, 1974,

the Class 3 license of DSC was due for reissuance.

explained that the BATF must authorize re-issuance of this

export license but that in view of their continuing inves-

tigation, that the BATE has not as of May 22, 1975,

renewed

their Class 3 export license.

He explained that this pro-

hibits DSC from exporting any weapons from the United States.

SA Hugueley continued that DSC does not manufac-

ture any weapons, that they are

merely a wholesaler or a

broker and due to the recent seizure of all their inventory,

and due to the fact that their Class 3 license has not been

renewed to date, the DSC has no inventory whatever for

exportation.

SA Hugueley explained that in 1969 the Werbells

and George Salesky formed the MAC, which was engaged in

the manufacture and export of automatic weapons.

the Werbells split from MAC and formed the Defense Systems

International (DSI), which only dealt in automatic weapons

and was not engaged in their manufacture.

At this time

Salesky continued to own MAC. Sometime between 1972 and

the present, the Defense Systems International became known

as the Defense Services Company and is owned by the Werbells

SA Hugueley said that MAC has cooperated with

BATF completely, that its books have always been found to

be in proper order, and that the BATF has never had reason

to suspect Salesky of any questionable activity.

SA Hugueley continued that the MAC is owned by

the Quantum Corporation and its officers are as follows:

R. R. Reeves, President and Chairman of the Board;

George Whipple, Vice Presidint and Secretary;

Michael Adali, Director and Principal stockholdellity

He stated that Salesky is the President of MAC/

and that R. R. Roby is the Secretary-Treasurer of MAC.

said that at present the MAC has in excess of 8,000 auto-.. Perf

matic weapons in its inventory, approximately 6,000 9 milli-

meter MAC 10's, approximately 2,500 45 caliber MAC 10's,

and approximately 400 380 caliber MAC 1l's.

SA Hugueley further advised that he has a reli-

able informant who is very closely associated with the

Werbells and that he is aware of their activities. He

said that he is certain that the Werbells have not in the

recent past traveled to the Middle East]for the purpose of (5]

isplaying or selling weapons or for any other purpose

Kand further, that the names Aladdin M. Äl-Tayyarland CS_

William Apikian are not known to him.

He also pointed

out that to his knowledge no individuals representing

the Iraq Government] have been in contact with the Werbells (S

for the purchase of firearms.

SA Hugueley further advised that in the past year

there has been a steady flow of MAC 10's to Saudi Arabia, <S

a total of approximately 1,000 non-suppressed weapons.

The MAC is in the process of delivering these weapons at

present.

He said that upon request, it would be easy for

him to determine exactly how many weapons have been sent

to the saudis and on what dates they were shipped.(SJ

SA Hugueley pointed out that before any Class 3

exporter can sell or export weapons to a foreign government,

permission of the United States Department of State (USDS)

must be secured. He added that BATF is not interested in

which foreign government purchases the weapons as long as

export records are in order, the

exporter's Class 3 license

is valid, and the USDS's permission has been obtained for

the sale.

When all of these requirements are met, it is

perfectly legal for the exporter to sell to any "foreign

government.
