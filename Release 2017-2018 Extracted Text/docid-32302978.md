CONFENTIA:

MM 165-8435

up a Yugoslav vessel

known to be engaged in Cuban

trade, and a German ship presently in port in Veracruz.

HARBER claimed to plan to place explosives aboard ships

which will be detonated by a radio device when they

arrive in Cuba.

He further claimed payment of $3,000.00

by a private source in the United States to perform

the operation.

Miami informant MM 639-S advised that HARBER

heavy drinker, and a homosexual.

Informant advised that HARBER has been on the

fringes of anti-CASTRO activity for some time, but has

not been seen in Miami since about the end of

November,

1963; he apparently does not have the courage to handle

explosives or to participate in any action against Cuba.

LEADS

LOS ANGELES:

Requested to contact sources and informants

conversant with anti-FIDEL CASTRO activities to ascertain

if HARBER is presently in Los Angeles.

MIAMI:

Will maintain contact with GERALD PATRICK

HEMMING, who is trying to ascertain subject's present

whereabouts.
