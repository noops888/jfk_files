COPIES MADE

It is to be noted that this report contains ie-

of interviews conducted by U.S. Customs of CHARLES

WILLIAM T. SHEARER, ARMANDO MARTINEZ and BERNARD A.

attorney for DAVID ROE, Owner of the EBB TIDe, JI.

sequently, it is telt that reinterviews of these in-

dividuals would be an unnecessary duplication of effort by

this office at this time.

Also, it is felt that inter-

views of BUSH, SHEARER, ROE and MARTINEZ would merely

serve to make the MIRR more security conscious

at a time

statement to press claiming

that bombs would have been dropped on crowds in Havana

celebrating 5th anniversary of the revolution on 1/2/64

had boat not been seized carrying bombs to secret base

in Caribbean. MM T-l has advised that BOSCH gave this

distorted statement to press for propaganda purposes as

MIRR intended only to bomb oil installations at Nuevitas,

Cuba.

tempting to raise more money to carry out further bomb-

ing raids against Cuba.
