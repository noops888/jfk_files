MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Everette Howard Hunt, Jr.

24

1. On 30 June 1972, MI. Arnold I Parham, Federal:

Bureau of Investigation; inquised of the Acting Deputy Director of

Security (PS), MI. Leo Dunn, as to documents losuod by the Agency

to Everotte Howard Hunt, JT., In the alias Edward Joseph Hamilton

or any other allat. He mentioned specifically, al

Drivers

License; Massachusetts Auto Regiutration Formay

Card

and Insurance Polley.

2. I telephoned ad Duffy, TSD Security Officer, but he wasn't

in.

I ended up talking with Wesley M. Parcells, 12531, who checked

TSD files on documentation tamed in the alias "Hamiiton." This in

the only way the name is now listed on TSD'a records.. They have no

first name or middle initial. Their records "imply reflect that on two

occasions sometime between 1957 and 1964, alias documentation was

issued to someone in the name of "Hamilton." The requests are numbered

1005 and 2134 on the TSD Control Card. They do not cross-reference

alias names to true names, and could not any whether or not Subject wan

Sasued any other alias.

3. Office of Security records show that Subject was to mve beer

inaued, among the other iteme, 'y

Drivers License with a

Providence, Rhode Island, address. Mr. Parcella said it in possible

that this was issued, and also possible that he would have been lenued

Card and insurance policy. None of these would have

been backstopped. Mr. Parcelle said. it would have been difficult or

impossible to renew the

Driver. License because one

would have to show up for a test. (It has been the writer's experience

that thia was not necessarily true in past years.) Thel

10

Drivere License would have expired in two years. The

24

Card, while fake, would be "valid" indefinitely.

The insurance polley

would presumably expire at whatever date it bore.
