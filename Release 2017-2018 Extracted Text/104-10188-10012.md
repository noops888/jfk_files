MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Western Hemisphere Division.

SUBJECT

: Project KDAFGHAN Termination

1.

A request for termination action is contained in

paragraph four, herein.

2.

Project KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides

the Vexico City

Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The objectives of the project are to furnish photographic cov-

erage of the Cuban installation during daylight hours, to.

assist the Station in compiling dossiers on officials of the

installation,

and to fulfill various requirements in support

of other

Station Cuban operations. The KDAFGHAN project

en -

compasses two assets,. NDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been

associated with the project since 1962.

3.

While this project may be of some value to the FBI

(FBI compares KDAFGHAN photographs with the photographs of

known leaders

of extremist groups in the U.S. as

well

as with

photographs of persons who are subjects of identification

orders prepared on badly wanted fugitives in the U.S.)

of little value, as presently constituted, to Mexico City

Station.

There

are other means of obtaining photographs of

PCS and

TDY Cuban personnel.

In early 1972 the Station mounted a thorough CI review

of all Cuban operations in an attempt to improve their overal!

security.

Although KDAFGHAN-1 passed the SGSWIRL with no

apparent deception, his Cuban exile status, the long period

time he has been operating his OP site in close proximity

to the Cuban Erbassy, and the potential (perhaps imnediate)

danger presented by his and KDAFGHAN-2's Cuban relatives made

it clear that the agents should be terminated.

In view of the

aforementioned,

as

well as

security considerations in the JMYAK

case, infl requests approval to terminate this project effec-

tive

31 July 1972.

In order to mect termination commitments,

project. KDAFGHAN was amended on

30: June 1972 by DIRECTOR: 28525S

from $11,950. to $20,950

were terminated on 1 August 1972.

KDAFGHAN - Mexico City, Mexico - FI/CI Support Project

Targetted Against the Cuban Embassy ta'Moston Clev

Purpose

KDAFGHAN is a support project which provides the Mexico

Cits Station with fixed photographie and physical surveillance

of the Cuban

Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The

objectives of the project are to furnish photographic coverage

of the Cuban installation during daylight hours,

"to nssist

installation and to fulfill various requirements in support

of other Station Cuban operations.

Description

The KDAFGHAN Project continues to encompass two assets,

KDAFGHAN-1 and KDAFGHAN-2, who have been associated with the

Both agents continue to turnish information

on a timely basis on the personalities and activities of the

Cuban target. A description of the individual assets

is sot

forth below:

a. KDAFGHAN-1 (201-288218) :

A Cuban lawyer in exile in

Mexico wno left

Cuba in 1960.

He has been the principal

Changes

The only major change during the project reyr was the

Installation of a TV monitor/robot camera combiration during

October 1970, the month designated as

"Cuban month."; This

added coverage contributed to

the compilation of targot

studies on several Cuban officials.

Piese Studies will be

used as a starting point for future operations, nanely the

rocruitment/defection of these officials.

Accomplishments

1. The main value of the production of the KEAFGHAN

Project has

been in establisning the pattern of various Cuban

Embassy employees.

The monitoring hag also revealed which

automobiles the various employces usually drive.

Photographic

coverage of

the visitors to

the muin kate of the Cuban Embassy

and logs of the movement of Cuban Embassy personnel have proved

very useful in identifying now Cuban PCS employees

in Mexico

Normally the Station has buen able to match movements of new

and old esployees during the initial period when duties and

contacts were being turned over to the new employees and so

identify their duties.

KDAFGILN has provided current photographs

of TDY and transiting Cuban officials and Headquarters has

often provided positive identifications of these persons.

Norberto Hernandez, a DGI headquarters officer

1191t1ng lexico, was identified In this way.

2. The Station utilizes KDAFGIAN photographic coverage

logs to verify the visits of Station assets to the

Cuban

Embassy•

3. KDAFGHAN also provides covernge of what appears to

be American

visitors to the Cuban Embassy main gate.

In the

caso of Americans who arrive in automobiles

bearing U.s.

license plates, the license plate number,

car description,

and storile copies of photographs are given to the fSt for

identification.

A significant

result of the KDAFGELY operation

included a photographic of a specific individual - ac old FBI

target - who had been seen visiting the Cuban installation.

KDAFGHAN also provided useful coverage for the

KDACOUSTIC-3 operation,

an operation aimed at the recruitment

or defection of a DGI officer®

This coverage enabled the

Station to determine KDACOUSTIC-3's movements, an inportant

factor in timing the calls and visits of our access agents.

This use of the operation should prove extremely valuable during

the coming year since a more aggressive recruitment program

against the Cuban target is planned.

Problems and Security

No agent control or operational problems have been

reported.

Neither were there any security problems encountered

during the period.

Gerald D. FAHLANGER

continues to be the

Case Officer and handler of KDAFGHAN-1.

FAHLANGER has met

and could continue to meet KDAFGHAN? in an emergency. The

alternate Case Officer is Terence D. SISTONE who meets

KDAFGHAN-I when FAILANGER is not available.

Both Case Officers

are known to the

assets in alias,

and both meet KDAFGHAN-1

in a Safehouse. During February 1971 the safchouse was

changed in compliance with normal operational security.

Meetings are generally held once a week.

"I haven't

KDAFGHAN-1 speaks English.

Coordination:

The Ambassador is aware of our efforts against the

Cuban

target in general. He has not been specifically briefed

on this operation.

Future Plans:

The Station is constantly exanining the possibility of

an audio installation at the main gate of the Cuban Embassy®

A successful audio device would serve, in most cases,

to

identify the individuals who are photographed by KDAFGHAN1

since they normally identify themselves to the gite house

attendant.

There are a few Station assets who have occasional

access to the gate

house, and it is conceivable that one of

them could

place a quick

plant device, provided security

conditions

are favorable.

The

Station currently has under

consideration i recruitment effort against a lower level

employee of the Cuban Embassy who would be of tremendous

help in such an operation.

MENORANDUM FOR: Chief, Westorn Hemisphere Division

SUBJECT

: LIONION Project Renewal Request

Approval is requested of the LIONION Project for tho

poriod 1 July 1909 through 30 June 1970 (FY 1970) for_

Funds are avallable.

2.

Project LIONION is a suppore project which provides

the Nexico City Station with fixed photographic and physical

surveillance of the Cuban Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City.

The surveillance is conducted by two indigenous ayents located

In : basehouse directly across from the Cuban compound.

At

times the principal agont also acts as a dispatcher for the

LIEMBRACE surveillance team.

Information is radioed to the

team concerning the departure of Cuban officials,

thus allowing

the team to remin a more discreet distance from the target.

3.

As reflected in the attached Project Renewal, an

nudio

device planted in the gatehouse of the compound could

be monitored at the LIONION

basehouse, aiding greatly in

identitjing visitors.

Since the time

the Station submitted

the

ichewal, hoverer, this device ceased to function along

with the rest of the LISANPAN devices.

This installation

was monitored through carrier current

from the LISAMPAN/

LISASH baschouse,. also situated in front of

the compound.

Since the

connection between

the two baschouses was by carrier

current

only, and

since

the agents in each baschouse are un-

aware of the

other's

activity, i possible compromise

of the

LISANPAN/LISASH activity should not affect LIONION security.

Although the LIONION Project does not produce dis-

seminable positive intelligence,

it is considered by the

Station as essential to its Cuban operations.

The 1.100 or

selective individual photographs produced annually,

1. The following comments are for the information and assistance

of those

officers who are in the process

of determining the future

of the LIONION operation:

a. The ANOis have reccived and reviewed a number of the

prints

trom

the LIONION

operation and

report that it

1s a time-consuming and largoly unproductive effort.

b.

The practleal results of such a review, 1.e..

identitication of the createst number of visitors to

LIRING, can

be realized best through the widest ci

culation of the prints among the AMOT staffers, con

tacts, and informants.

This practice would result

in wide knowledge of

the existence of the operation,

and in the expenditure of many man-hours which,

could be more productively spent in other

The AMOT organization currently does not have either

It would appear from JMWAVE's experience with ANOT exploitation

that further activity in this connection

PROJECT LIONION

RENEWAL REQUEST

A. Objectives:

1.

Project LIONION 15 a long-term. support profect designed

to provide fixed photographie, technical, and physical surveillance

of the PBRUMEN Embassy and Consulate in Mexico City. The specific

objectives aro:

To furnish photogiaphic covcrage during the

daylight hours of the main entrances to the target

Installations.

lo matntain in readiness a listening post to

support technical opcrations against. the targets.

To radio dispatch physical survelllance teams

against persons associated with

the targets.

To provide for & mechanism which can fulflll

various niscellancous PBRUMEN support requirements.

The above-cited objectlves are in agreement with the over

all objectives of Station Mexico CIty.

B. Changes:

In late January 1967 the operational and administrative

responsibilities for Project LIONION were transferred from lowerd A.

TRECKLEK tO Cornclius L. PEUVION.

No agent handling, control, or

administrative problems

were encountered during the past year.

C. Intelligence Production:

As noted in Section A above, project LIONION is an operational

support project and does not, produce disseminable positive

intelligence.

During the past year this project did provide over.

5000 individual photographs of persons and/or vehicles entering

or leaving the target

installations,

as well as approximately 8000

feet of pulse camera film.

Information on the comings and goings

of target personnel and visitors to the installations, which

LIONION-1 provides in daily 10g5,

has been incorporated into Station

and on occasion made available to other stations or LNHARP

LIONION has been particularly

useiul in

new employees whose photos

are then passed to LITAlIL-7

for identitication.

## Page 49

- 2 =

D. Effectlveness:

1. PrOJeCt LIONION is considered by the Station to be highly

ettective and essentlal..

In addition to providing the valuable

photographic coverage cited above, LIONION-I continues to provide

Interesting observations on the personalities and activities of

the personnel working in the targets.

LIONION-1 reporting is

being incorpornted into the recruitment operations targeted against

LIRING=? and LIRING-IG.

In early July LIONION-I obtained and furnished a new safe

apartment which is being used for sensitive or lengthly

meetings

with LIRESORT-1 as

well is LiONION-l.

The safe site has been

stocked with &

sufficient supply of food so as to allow two persong

to live there

for at least three days in the event the Station

ever needs a coollng-off site for au agent of defector.

3.

Throughout the past project year LIONION-1 continued to .

function effectively as the radio dispatched for the LIEMBRACE

Surveillaice Team.

Much of this effort was expended in estimating

the movement/ habit pattern of LIRING-2, a prerequisite for his

pending recruitment.

E. Problems:

1. On 27 June LIONION-I was hospitalized for emergency

surgery to

treat a perforated ulcer.

Since LIONION-2's presence

required at the hospital durin

the operation and also through-

out the postoperative convalescence period, photographic coverage

suspended until 10 July.

Other than a temporary postopcrative morale slump on the

part of LIONIOY-1, there have

been no significant personnel,

security, or administrative problems.

F. Liaison:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

G.

Interagency Coordination:

Not applicable to Project LIONION.

H. Plans:

The Station plans to continue to exploit LIONION-l's

experience, training, and location to provide the photographic

covernge cited above.

In addition, the Station plans to make more

extensive use of the operational loy books and personality

observations provided by LIONION-l in support of an intensive

physical penetration program.

Renewal of Project LIONION

(Photographic/Technical Covernge

of Cuban Embassy in Mexico)

ACTION REQUIRED:

Approvals Requested Paragraphs One

and Four

Approval is requested.to renew Project

LIONION for the period I January through 31 December

1967 At an annual expenditure of for FY 1988.

J including

for FY 1967 and

WH

Division programmed

for this activity for

FY 1967 and funds

are avallable.

The Project cost

has been increased by

over the previous yoar,

occasioned by a small

monthly raise for the Principal

Agent and a new provision for miscellancous operational

expenditures.

2. Although this two-man Project does not

produce positive intelligence, it contributes.sub

stantially and directly to the coverage of the Cuban

Embassy and Consulate in Mexico, producing photographs

in bulk of personel and visitors as well as intorma-

tion on patterns of activity and personal associations,

and supporting recrultment attempts.

It is contemplated

that the Project will afford support to the extensive

technical penetration of the Cuban Embassy (LISAJPAN)

currently scheduled for installation in mid-January

1967.

One of these penetrations

is scheduled for the

Embassy gatchouse where visitors would normally

Identify themselves.upon entering.

Information from

the gatehouse is to

be transmitted securely to the

"LIONION baseliouse as well as

to the LISANPAN listening

post.

By collating this

and other LISANPAN intormation

is hoped to be able to identify

photographically many of the visitors to the Embassy.

contemplated for the coming year.

C. Intelligence Production:

The intelligence production ia the

some as that reported in the renewal

It do difficult to estimate the Intelligence value in

numbers of reporte as there are so few positive reports made from this type of

production on the photographic end of the project.

But this photographic

coverage la of inestimable operational intelligence value in coverage of the

PBRUMEN target.

Should the LISAMPAN operation become active, part of LIONIoN'e

Elme will be used in support of that operation.

D. Effectiveness:

The Station's estimate of the value of this project has not changed from

that expressed in the renewal request of last year.

LIONION has further eg

cablished his importance to the Station's mperational activities by demonstrating

his ability co spot surveillance targete at LIRING from only a physical descrip

tion provided by

the Case Officer.

If the planned LISAMPAN nctivity gets underway,

LIONION observatione and insighe

Into activities of LIRING will be Increased

greatly.

The apartment spotted by LIONION*l and obtained by the Station across from

LIRING that was mentioned in last year's renewal request is scheduled to be

utilized in the LISAMPAN operation. The location of LIONION] across

target and his background knowledge built up over the years are invaluable

to che Station's coverage of the primary target of the Related Mission Directive.

E. Problems:

There were no major problems

during the past year.

One security problen

involved the

clatoed spotting of some of the photogaphic equipment from the

street by David M. WILSTED (P). A thorough check of the basehouse by LIONION*l

and the Case Officer

talled to reveal any such equipsent as being visible fron

the street. However, auditional security measures were taken by darkentag the

background

in the room behind the equipment through hanging of heavier drapes

on the window;

drapes on the wall, and putting up a portable screen behind

che equipment. This also serves as a security check against the prying eyes

of the household servant as LIONION-l can now open the door fully to the room

when the servant pages him and she cannot see the equipment.

The other problem

lo the obtaining of inmigrado status

fOr LIONION-2.

This involves the depositing

of funds to a bank account and ta discussed under paragraph I.

F. Liaison:

There is no liaison involved in the project.

Co Interagency Coordination:

• Not applicable.

H. Plans:

It is planned to have LIONION*I keep special logs on

the accivities of

selected targets in LIRING as he has done over the past ycar. With the case

officer handling LIONION-l directly on a weekly basis, it is planned to continue

picking his brains for addicional details on the LIRING target. Hopefully

LIONION"1 and 2 will be utilized for assistance in covering the proposed take

from the LISAMPAN operation.

I. Costs:

base and che expert kinçwledge of LIONION-l of target personnel and activicles,

such an operation as lIft could noc have been rounted. It might be noted chat

this operation was an accerpe to satlofy the top priority requirement laid on

Stätion Mexico by Headquarters. It le expected that additional similar operation

will depend to a large extent on the facilitles provided by the LIONION operation.

Another very effective performance by LIONIONal was his obtaining - by

sharp observacion and quicis, Intelligent, secure action - an apartment in a

bullding directly across the street from

che target Echassy, The Station had been

soaking an apartuent in this bullding for mny years.

E. Probleng. The problem of cover for LIONIONal worked out well during the

year to the poine where

Ic ceased being a problem.

By Ilving hia cover as a crane

lator he was enabladto bulld in atrong self protection when called upon to do some

cranolations for the office of che President of Mexico. Toward the end of the year,

LIONION-I received the coveted status of "Inmigrado" which confera a ¿rent deal of

Inmunity from harrassment by Mexican authorleleo.

The only problen now besetting the project is LIONION-l's excessive work

load. An inúlcated above, an attempt is being made to alleviate chis load.

The operation has no Ilalson connection. LIONION-l's connection

wich the Mexican Presidency is non-operatIonal.

G. Interasense Sectalination. Not appllcable.

H. Plans.

It la planned

to make better use of LIONION-l'a observations and

operactonal los books during the coming year racher than settle for his excellent

photographs alone:

It has been found that he can often supply valuable auditionel

Information decause of his

vation from the LIONION tase.

LIONION"I can read significance into

activlty which

might go unnoticed or be

misinterpreted by observers wich lega expertence.

LIONION-I will also be called upon for assintance In future recruitment operations

as In LIRIYYE.

Several such operations are being conterglated for calendar 1966,

affording an observation post for Station activities involving

direct contact with the target.

These new ubjectives are in

consonance with

Mission Directive for Station Mexico Ciûy.

Changes:

There have been no changes in personnel and none

are conterplated during the coming yoar.

LIONION-l's pay was increased

Intelligence Production: The Project is not designed to

produce disseminable information.

At produced thousands of

excellent photographs during the year which were shared with

Station JNWAVE.

Information on the comings

goings of

target personnel and visitors to the target have

incorporated into many Station files, principally. the

In addition

graphic coverage provided,

LIONION-1, the Principal Agent, has

developed into a first-class asset for other operational duties.

The Project Basehouse

was essential to mounting and monitoring

the Station's attempt at recruitment and subsequent harassment

of a sensitive target exployee.

The Case Officer in charge of

the attempt sat with LIOXION-l for several weeks observing the

movement pattern of the target employee.

LIONION 1 manned one

of the radio dispatch posts used to control the physical

surveillance of the target employee while near the Baschouse.

Without the Baschouse and LIONION-l's export knowledge of the

target personnel and activities,

such an operation could not

have been mounted.

The operation itself. was an attempt to

satisfy

the top priorits requirement

laid on Station Mexico City

by Headquarters

expected that future

similar operations

vill

depend

to a large extent on the facilities provided by

this Project.

Another very effective performance by LIONION-I was his

obtaining, by sharp observation and

quick, intelligent and

secure action,

an apartment in a building directly across

the street from the target.

The Station had been seeking

an apartment in this building for many jears.

Problems:

The only problem currently besetting the Project

is the excessive work load on the Principal Agent.

Cover

for LIONION l has ceased to be a problem.

He has

received his permanent immigrant status and now has a good

deal

of immunity from harassment from Mexican immigration authorities.

He was able to get his translator cover backstopped directly

out of the Office.of. the President of

Mexico and thus has a

strong protective security factor built into it.

F.

Liaison: The Project has no

liaison connection.

LIONION-l'S

cover backstop with the Office of the President of Mexico is non-

operational.

G. Interagency Coordination: Not applicable.

H. Plans: It is planned to make better use of LIONION-]'s

observations and operational logbooks during the coming year

rather than to settle for his excellent photographs alone.

•It bas been found

that he can often supply valuable

additional

information because of his

"feel" for those persons who are

under constant observation from the Basehouse.

He can- read

significance into activity

which might go unnoticed or be

misinterpreted by observers

with less experience.

He will

also be called upon for assistance in future recruitment

operations similar to the case mentioned in paragraph D

MENORANOUM FOR: WIl/EXO

SUBJECT

LIONION Project

1.

LIONION Is a new project which is submitted in the

amount of $10,478.

This is a photographic surveillance opera-

tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Moxico City.

TWO

agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban lawyer in exile,

and LIONION-2, his nother.

The agchts act as observers and

photographers.

LIONION] is also used as a dispatcher for the

LI EMBRACE

surveillance team, from which he is compartmented,

to cover individuals

associated with this target.

These ngents

were previously

used in connection with the unfinteral tele

phone

tap

operation against the Cuban Embassy.

The current

photographic

operntion began in the latter part of 1962,

and was

previously funded under Cuban FI funds.

The operation

has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban

Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of

action and personal associations.

2.

The

security of this operation, particularly the

agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,

appear reasonably sound.

Both agents know that they are

working for AlS, and LIONION-1 was successfully FLUTTERED

in October 1963.

However, LITANIL-T and LITANIL-9, who ae

penetrations of the

Embassy, are aware of this

activity, as they de used to help identify indlvidunls

photographed.

Approval for the LIONION Project is recommended.

It 1s requested

that, in order to assist Headquarters'

evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data

furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.
