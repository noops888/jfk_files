WASHINGTON - The House Assassi-

nations Commiltee is focusing on a small •

group of southySt. Louis segregationists'

- most off them now dead - in its

investigation of the murder of the Rev.

Dr. Martin/ Luther King, committee

sources say.

Committee investigators say the group

may have been the link. between James

Earl Ray, who pleaded guilty of the

murder, and a St. Louis lawyer who may

have wanted King killed.

Crimittee sources, say they consider

this avenue of investigation the most

prymising explanation of a conspiracy

theory in the assassination of the civil

rights leader in Memphis in April 1968:

But they. acknowledge that thus.far they

have little hard evidence to prove it.

The theory revolves around St. Louis

members of the Citizens Council and the

George Wallace for President campaign

of 1968. Investigators have learned that

members of those groups lived and

worked in the vicinity of the former

Grapevine Tavern In the 1900 block of

Arsenal Street. The tavern; which went

out of business in December 1968, was

operated: by. John Larry Ray, a-brother

of James Eari Ray.

Investigators believe that John H.

Sutherland, a St, Louis patent lawyer

and segregationist, contacted a south St.

Louis man involved with him in several

right-wing groups conveying a money

offer for King's murder..At the time the

man was canvassing businesses in the

neighborhood.of the Grapevine for the

wallace campaign.

The committee's theory is that the

man could have mentioned the offer to

John Larry Ray, who could have passed

it on to his brother. John Larry Ray

denied to the Post-Dispatch that any

such proposal was-made. Sutherland and

the other man are dead.

director of the Citizens:Council, has been

Baum, who was active in the work of

the council and the Wallace campaign in

1968, confirmed in an interview that the

committee appears to be scrutinizing

has heard testimony from Russell G.

Byers of Rock Hill that Sutherland and

to arrange for King's murder. Byers said

he turned down the offer.

Investigators believe that Sutherland

then contacted his acquaintance with the

Wallace campaign, who was canvassing

around the Grapevine.

The committee also has learned that a,

woman who was a top official of the

Citizens Council and the Wallace cam-

paign lived in the 2100 block of Arsenal

Street, within 100 yards of the Grape-

vine.

The woman, who also is dead, often

had planning meetings of the two groups

at her home. The Wallace canvasser was

a good friend of hers and together the

two shouldered most of the responsibili-

ties of the Wallace state headquarters.

3.

WASHINGTON Attorney Mark Lane's verbal blasts

at Rep. Louis Stokes '(D.-Ohio) and other members of 602-5097$

the House Select Committee on Assassinations might

lead you to think that Lane really considers his client,

James Earl Ray, 'to be the greatest victim of political

oppression since Anatoly Shcharansky:

But don't be misled by Lane's frequent cries of

"McCarthyism' or his assertions that House members

were heaping onto the confessed killer of Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr. the worst abuses "in the history of

Congress."

'Understand that

Mark Lane's

recent life

has-been devoted to imagining, and writing about, evil

murdered King and into accepting a 99-year term in

person, and that Ray was a pawn in an FBI plot to kill

the noted Black civil rights leader.

There was a stormy suspension of Ray's testimonỹ

partly because,

for all of Lane's voluble interruptions;

he and his client were faring badly.

Lane arrived at the hearings surely feeling that,

millions of Americans, especially the Blacks in

Congress, were predisposed to believe that former

FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was somehow behind

King's killing. After all, hadn't the Rev. Jesse Jackson

just stated publicly that he didn't think Ray pulled the

trigger?

But under intense questioning from Stokes, 'Ray

and his testimony dealt a blow to any notion that he

was an innocent patsy in a government conspiracy tó

kill King.

Ray said he had lied deliberately to newspaper

reporters, TV interviews, book writers and even his

own lawyers. But now he wanted the committee and

the world to believe him when he

But he was given a cold shoulder by police and bank

officials, some of whom called Ray's visit a publicity

stunt. +

Ray. arrived at the Bank of Alton about 10 a.m. and

said he would like bank employees who witnessed the

robbery to see if they could identify him.

"I didn't rob this bank or any other banks," Ray said.

"I have been accused on national television of being a

robber, and I want to clear myself."

PAUL'UTTERBACK, president of the bank, told Ray

the witnesses were.no longer employees of the Bank of

Alton.A

"I'"as very surprised Mr. Ray came to the bank,"

Utterback said. "I really don't know why he did it, or

whache hoped to accomplish."

"The whole thing was a publicity stunt," said another

bank official. "The cameras were rolling, so it was a

perfect stage for him to say what he wanted."

Rayi was implicated in the July 13, 1967 robbery ir

statements made by Rep. Floyd J. Fithian, D-Indiana,

during testimony'by James Earl Ray before the House

Assassinations Committee Thursday. Fithian said the

convicted killer of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

and one of Ray's brothers may have been the two

-stocking-masked men who robbed the bank of s3o,u0u.

The congressman said Jerry and James Earl Ray had

met in Chicago shortly before the holdp, and evidence

fromathe robbery was found 1½ blocks from their

uncle's Alton home.

ACCORDING TO ONE theory, James Earl Ray could

have used the loot to elude authorities for more than a

year That would discredit Ray's contention that he was

paid by a mysterious conspirator named Raoul.

After a brief stop at the bank, Jerry Ray and a

television crew went to the Alton police station to deny

his involvement in the robbery. Alton authorities told

The Globe Democrat Thursday that the Rays were not

• suspects in the holdup.

Ray told Lt. Walter Conrad that he was willing to

waive the expired statute of limitations on the robberf

and submit to a polygraph test. Conrad said that if Ragl

did not intend to admit to the robbery, there was no

need to question him.

Mark Lane, the attorney for Ray

• in a 1977 book titled

"Code Mark

seen Ray at the station at the time

of the assassination.

"This is completely false," Cow-

_RAY, HOWEVER, denied to the

committee that he had made such a

confession while awaiting extradi-

tion to the United States.

"That's probably the most damag-

ing statement that's been made

against me. . . admitting guilt on a

murder charge... It is false," Ray

declared.

His attorney contended that the

allegations by former Inspector Al-

exander Anthony Eist, who is now

retired, are unreliable.

Rep. Samuel L. Devine, R-Ohio,

read aloud a report on a recent

interview of Eist by the committee's

DEVINE QUOTED Eist as saying

that he was one of Ray's guards

during the weeks of his incarcera-

tion in London and that Ray often

confided in him.

Committee investigators asked

Eist, who now, has a pub in Cam-

England, whether. Ray had

admitted killing Dr. King.

"Oh, no, no, no," Eist replied. "He

didn't actually come out with it, but

it was there in the conversation that

he had done it."

At one point, Eist was asked, "Did

he express hatred for blacks?"

"Yes," Eist replied. "There

wasn't any doubt at all... He.said

he was trying to get to Africa to

shoot some more."

EIST SAID Ray's ego was such

that he began describing the assassi

nation of Dr. King.

"He told me about a gun. He sail

he threw it away. He told me he had

left this place (where the shooting of

Dr. King occurred), saw a police:

man, panicked and threw away the

cy — that authorities couldn't prove

that he had fired the weapon that.

killed Dr. King.

The former inspector quoted Ray

as saying that he thought he would

be sentenced to one to 10 years in

prison on a conspiracy charge. Eist

said Ray was happy about this

prospect, and hoped that it would be

concurrent with a 20-year sentence

he had been serving in Missouri.

RAY ESCAPED from the Missouri

State Penitentiary April 23, 1967. He

had been convicted of robbing a St.

Louis supermarkt of $191 in 1959.

Eist-also quoted Ray as saying

that "For him to have shot a black

man of note in. certain paris si

wanted it."

Ray predicted, according to Eist,

ABOUT THAT TIME, Lane re-

turned to the hearing room after

being away briefly and said he had

He said the lawyer described Eist

as corrupt and "a disgrace to the

WASHINGTON (AP) - John Larry Ray, a

brother of convicted assassin James Earl Ray,

has been granted a parole from a federal prison

in Marion, Ill., where he is serving a bank rob

bery sentence, the Justice Department said Fri-

day.

Ray was granted parole effective Sept. 18 by

the U.S. Parole Commission.

He was originally scheduled for parole June

14, but that was rescinded while the commission

looked into a complaint about possible perjured

testimony before the House assassinations com-

mittee.

The complaint was made by the committee,

which is investigating the assassination of civil

rights leader the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

James Earl Ray; who pleaded guilty to the slay-

ing but later recanted, is the key witness in cur-

rent committee hearings.

John Larry Ray was sentenced to 18 years ill

Ray's possible involvement in the

I drew a heated objection from Lane, and

• a quick no from Ray about having a role

in the crime.

Through questioning, Fithian estab-

lished that Ray had been in Alton on July

14, 1967, the day the holdup occurred.

The bank was robbed of $27,000 by two

men, and the case has gone unsolved,.

Fithian said.

Fithian said clothing and several items

used in the robbery were found by

authorities about a block from the house

of a Ray relative living in Alton at the

time. In addition, he said, one of Ray's

_brothers, Jerry, who was then working in

•Chicago, had been off work on the day of

the holdup.

Fithian noted that Jerry Ray and

another brother, John, had been arrested

in 1970 for the robbery of another banli.

• Helsaid John Ray had been involved in

four other bank robberies during 1969

; and 1970.

live on for several months. Fillowing

that line of thought, he then iniroduced

evidence that showed that R&y might

But Ray noted that British authorities

had never charged him with the crimes.

although he said two other charges were

filed at the time of his capture.

""It they had something, why didn't

they charge me with it?" he asked.

Fithian said that authorities were

more concerned about having Ray extra-

dited to the United States to stand trial

for the King killings. And alter his guilty

plea, no reason &xisted to pursue the

nater since he had been given a 99-ycas

Eme as King. Ray said that fact was

only a coincidence.

• Stokes submitted evidence that showed

that Ray had been in Los Angeles,

Selma, Ala., Atlanta and Memphis dur-

ing the same time periods as King.

Lengthy questioning by Stokes attempted

to challenge accounts that Ray has given

• to the-committee under oath and in

newspaper and television interviews

about his visits to those sites.

Stokes, at one point, asked Ray wheth-

er he had planned to go to Atlanta when

he left Los Angeles in February 1968.

Ray had told the committee Wednesday

thit his original destination had 'been

Niw Orleans but.that he changed his.

okins when en route there.

After answering "no" Thursday, Ray

seemed shaken as Stokes introduced into

evidence a change-of-address form filled

out by Ray in Los Angeles and showing

that his mail should be forwarded to

Atlanta general delivery.

The form said the mail should be

forwarded until April 25. It was signed

by an Eric S. Galt. Galt is one of sevefal

allases Ray has said he used during the

ypar he was free after escaping from the

Missouri State Prison in Jefferson City

"Stokes asked Ray whether he had

known that King had been in Los Angeles

while Ray was there. He said that he had

not.

- Persisting, Stokes then asked Ray to

trace his travels after leaving Los

Angeles and Ray said that he had gone

to New Orleans and then to Birmingham

and finally to Atlanta. His statement

says that after leaving Los Angeles he

went to New Orleans, to meet the person

• named Raoul.

Ray said that he arrived late and was

instructed to go to Birmingham. After

meeting Raoul, the pair went to Atlanta,

Ray said.

Stokes, however, pointed out that on

the automobile trip from New Orleans to

Birmingham Ray had spent the night in

a hotel in Selma, Ala. A map offered into

' evidence showed that Selma is not on one

of two direct routes between the two

• cities.

"Stokes then showed newspaper articles

that pointed out King had been in

i Canden, Ala., which is near Selma,

about the same time that Ray was in

• Selina.

Ray said, in response,

that he had

• taken a wrong road after leaving New

Orleans and had decided to spend the

night in Camden-because it was dark.

In perhaps the most damaging evi-

dence offered, Stokes offered testimony

and a cleaner's receipt that indicated

that Ray was in Atlanta at leas until

April 3. The evidence contradicted Ray's

sworn statement that he let: Allanta on

March 28 to drive to Memphis.

One document that Stokes offered was

a statement from the owner of a rooming

house in Atlanta that Ray had given him

a week's rent in advance on March 31. In

addition, Stokes showed the cleaner's

receipt indicating that articles of cloth

ing had been left by an Eric Galt or

April 1.

Ray

"has admitted picking up the

clothes the day after King was assassi-

nated and has said that he fled then to

Canada.

Irying to emphasize the significance of

Ray being in Atlanta in early April,

Stokes read from the transcript of a

television interivew with Ray in which

Ray said that such evidence would be

damaging..

"If I left Los Angeles planning to .

return to the Deep South, then I will take

responsibility for the King assassination

right now," Ray said, in a "60 Minutes"

television interview. Ray told the com-

mittee that he could not recall why he

had made that assessment.

Stokes assailed Ray's statement to the

committee that Raoul had never handled

Ray said he had bought the weapon for

Globe-Democrat Staff Writer

• WASHINGTON = A House investigator

tried to show Thursday that James Earl

Ray's travels for nearly a year after he

escaped from a Missouri prison were not

financed by a mystery man named

Raoul but by a bank robbery in which

Ray and one of his brothers allegediy

were involved.

Rep. Floyd

member of the House assassinations

committee, cited what he called a $27.000

* robbery of a bank in Ray's birthplace,

was in the arca.

diated his guilty plea shortly alter

IN PREVIOUS restimony before the

committee, Ray said he supported him-

self by part-time jobs, by the $1,700

robbery of a pimp in Montreal and on

moncy paid to him by Raoul for the

smuggling of contraband.

Ray has contended that he was framed

for Dr. King's slaying by Raoul.

Fithian and committee staff members

also produced evidence that Ray was

involved in a London area bank robbery

June 4, 1968, a few days before his,

* capture.

THE CONGRESSMAN said a right

Scotland Yard, the FBi and an independ-

ent.firm hired by the assassinations

committee.

"Ray's attorney Mark Lane objected

that such evidence was irrelevant.

Bank of Alton robbery, Lane told Fithiar

"I would add that you shed your

congressional immunity for five minutes

so we might later settle this in court...

that was an outrageous Statement."

AT THIS POINT, acting committee

Fithian replied, "In the course of this

investigation, this committee will pro-

vide substantial evidence of what I just

(in Alton, Capt. John Light, assistant

police chiel, said that after Ray was

implicated in Dr. King's slaying, police!

ants that Ray was involved in the bank

cast is still carried on the records as

Trying to emphasisize the signifi-

" a television interview with Ray in which

Ray said that such evidence would be

Ray said he had bought the weapon

for a man named Raoul in Birmingham,

Ala., for what he thought was a gun-

running scheme. Ray said he and Raoul

had worked together for months, from

Canada to Mexico, in various smuggling

deals.

Ray said that if he had killed King,

his fingerprints never would have been

found on the murder weapon.

"I would have wiped my fingerprints

off the rifle if I knew it was going to be

used in a serious crime," Ray said. He

insisted that even as a petty criminal he

was too smart to leave his prints behind. .

It was suggested that he did not have

Ray said the initial testimony he gave

to,committee staff members at Brushy

based on a thorough review of the case.

"It

truth," Ray said. "I wanted to be as

some small errors in details. Some con-

Ray said in his opening testimony

Wednesday that he never shot King and

that he returned the first rifle to a sporti

said.

Ray's faulty - il not selective 1*

memory was attacked over, and over.

Why had Raoul never been found? Who

could have seen them together? Why

couldn't Ray furnish more descriptive

information about Raoul, such as his

real name?

Ray had no hard answers. "Possibly

a barmaid in Birmingham. Possibly a

waitress in Jim's Grill in Memphis" had

seen him in Raoul's company, he said.

•But he couldn't be sure. And he men-

tioned no one in Montreal, where he al-

fileged he had met the man.

inttee has reviewed every FBI docul.

Ray:

A: If 1 had gone to trial in 1968, he

most likely would have testified against

The proceedings were interrupted

and delayed over and over when Ray's

attorhey, Mark Lane, a longtime postu-

lator of conspiracy theories in the King

Lane repeatedly complained of not

How Roy escaped

Missouri prison

By DENNIS J. MCCARTHS

Globe-Democrat Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - James Eark Ray•

gave details Wednesday about his

1967

escape from the Missouri State Peniten-

tiary and told how he obtained a pistol

from a South St. Louisan known as the

"Cat Man" after the breakout.

In a statement which he read to the

House assassinations committee, Ray

identified the man first as "Jack Gor-

win" but later referred to him as "Jack.

Gowrin."

He said Gorwin got the pistol for $200

from "a fence in East St. Louis."

Ray, the star witness in the commit.

assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin +

escape from the penitentiary in Jefferson i

City: '

•"'SEVERAL DAYS prior to the escripe,

I fashioned a board approximately 3x4

feet which would fit inside a box used to

transport bread outside the príson."

He said that earlier he had used a

hammer and nails to punch holes in the

box.

"On April 23, 1967, I entered the prison

kitchen early - I worked afternoons -

at approximately 8 a.m."

Later, he said, he got into the box and

• covered himself with the board he had

prepared. Then another prisoner filled

the box with bread and the box was

placed on a truck, he said.

Ray said the truck was stopped at the

prison security gate and a guard looked

in the box but "all he would see was

bread."

"AFTER PASSING through the prison

gate, I got out of the box. After the truck

crossed the Missouri River bridge near

te prison farm, it stopped belore

turning into a road leading to the farm.

When the truck stopped, I disembarked."

Ray said he spent the night in a jink

Judge issues order

to protect Roy

From Globe-Democrat

-News Services

• WASHINGTON - A court order to

protect James Earl Ray, the convicted

killer of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,

from prison abuse while he is waiting to

testify at sessions of the House assassi-

nations committee was issued Wednes-

day, his attorney said.

Earlier the attorney, Mark Lane, had

accused guards at the Federal Correc-

tional Institution at Petersburg, Va., of

beating Ray Monday night and putting

him in a tiny punishment cell where

lights burned 24 hours a day.

"The lights will be out in Ray's cell

tonight so he can sleep," Lane said after

won an order from U.S. District

Judge William B. Bryant here for Ray

"to be taken out of the hands of prison

officials and put in the hands of U.s.

marshals." .

LANE SAID government lawyers

had opposed issuance of the order.

U.S. Marshal J. Jerome Bullock, in

charge of holding Ray for the, House

committee testimony, said his under-

standing was that three marshals will

. now have to watch Ray themselves rath-

er than leave him under the care of pris-

on officials.

Bullock said this did not necessarily

mean that Ray would have to be trans-

ferred from the Petersburg prison -

only that marshals must watch him di-

rectly whether he is kept there or some.

where else.

•Ray was taken to the federal prison

from Brushy Mountain State Prison in

Petros, Tenn., where he is serving a 99-

year sentence for the slaying of Dr. King

on April 4, 1959, plus an additional one-

to two year term for escape.

LANE SAID RAY told him that he

was beaten at the Petersburg prison,

where he is being held under the name?

' "Michael Brewer,.

" because he objected ll

to being photographed.

Ray balked at being photographed

§ bécause he was wearing old clothes at

the time and didn't want photos of him to

be "sold to the press," Lane said.

The attorney said that when someone

*tried to take a picture, Ray jumped to

Mark Lane

...Ray's.attorney

his feet and two prison guards grabbed

"One gave him a rabbit punch in the

back of the neck and another ripped his

shirt," Lane said.

The attorney said a federal marshal

pulled both guards away.

Lane quoted Ray as saying he had not

eaten in 24 hours because he feared that

officials would put something in his food

"to deter the function of his mind" in

advance of his public testimony Wednes

day before the House committee.

THE ATTORNEY SAID Ray also

told him that he couldn't sleep because

of the burning lights in his cell and a

headache from being puncled.

Bullock denied that Ray had been

beaten. He said Ray resisted a routine

fingerprinting procedure and marshals

insisted that he must submit to it.

But there was no scuffling or beating

during the incident, Bullock said.

Michael Aun, a spokesman for the

federal Bureau of Prisons, denied that

• Ray had been injured. Aun said an offi-

cer was kicked and another elbowed in

the mouth during a struggle with Ray.

Ray blames guilty plea

on pressure from lawyer

By DENNIS J. McCARTHY

.Globe-Democrat Staff Writer

WASHINGTON - Convicted assassin

James Earl Ray swore Wednesday that

if he had been given a trial, he would

have testified that "I did not shoot

Martin Luther King Jr."

Ray told the House assassinations

committee that he "could have offered

conclusive proof in support of the deni-

al."

He is serving a 99 year prison sentence

in Tennessee for the slaying of Dr. King

Ray's Missouri escape. . .134

April 4, 1968, in Memphis. Three days

after entering a guilty plea in 1969, Ray

recanted - but his statement before the

committee was the first time he had

gutlined his case publicly under oath.

"In respect to the guilty plea... it is

not a difficult matter for an attorney to

maneuver his client into a guilty plea

... especially when the attorney has the

active cooperation of the judge and

prosecutor,

" Ray testified as eight feder-

al marshals stood around him.

The 50 year-old Ray, in a soft Southern

staccato, spent more than an hour

reading a 38-page prepared statement in

which he declared his innocence in the

shooting of Dr. King, but admitted his

guilt in a series of other crimes including

• robberies and smuggling.

HE OFFERED AS conclusive proof of

innecence his oft-repeated declaration

that he was at a service

station in

Memphis, having a tire repaired, at the

time Dr. King was gunned down on a

balcony in front of Room 306 at the

Lorraine Motel.

Ray hinted in his statement that a mai

he identited as "Ravul" may have been

the killer of Dr. King, an allegation hey

has made before.

He said he and Raoul met in a tavern

Didm't Kill King,

Ray Testifies

By GERALD M. BOYD

and PAUL WAGMAN

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

WASHINGTON - Convicted assassin

James Earl Ray

has told a House

committee that he did not kill the Rev.

Dr. Martin Luther King and that he was

the victim of a complicated web involv.

ing a mysterious man who apparently

tramed Ray.

In his first public statement on the

case, Ray today recanted his March 11169

guilty plea at a public hearing of the

Mouse Select Committee on Assassina-

He said he had been pressed into

pieading guilty by two attorneys whil

represented him, including one who said!

that he would not present an adequate

defense if Ray pleaded not guilty.

Following closely a prepared state-

ment for more than an hour, Ray care-

fily laid open a complicated scenaño

Ray had been seen leaving the boarding

house after the shot was fired.

Foreman argued also, Ray said, that

* unless he pleaded guilty, Ray's brother,

Jerry, would be arrested on a conspira-

cy charge, and his father, George, would

have to return to prison. Ray's father,

who Ray said was 70 at the time, had

escaped from an Iowa prison in 1930.

The testimony began in a verbal

exchange between Ray's lawyer, Lane,

and several committee members. Lane

has accused the committee of trying to

present evidence that would show Ray

guilty of the crime in an effort to cover

up involvement by the Federal Bureau

M Investigation.

Lane said that Ray had been beaten

marshals before leaving

Memphis for Washington yesterday. A

committee member, however, said such

charges were out of order and were not

related to Ray's testimony.

During his testimony, Ray said sever-

al times that he thought the FBI had

arranged

King's assassination. He of-

fered no evidence, however.

in another development, Lane, con-

tinued his attacks Tuesday on the HOuse

committee, calling for the disbarment of .

its general counsel, G. Robert Blakey,

and of its deputy counsel, Michael

Eberhardt.

Lane told reporters that Blakey,

Eberhardt and Conrad Baetz, a staff

investigator who is based in Madison.

County, Ill., had "suborned perjury,

The allegations prompted Blakey co

• begin an investigation. Last week, he

announced that the preliminary finding

was that committee staff had done noth-

committee had not checked with the

Fersons making the allegations - Pat-

drson, himsell or Susan Wadsworth, a

Florissant woman who says she partici-

pated with Patterson in some of his ac-

tivities. Therefore, Lane said he was

mystified by the clean bill of health. In

addition, Patterson said Tuesday he had

taken — and passed — a polygraph test

on all his statements. He said he hild

requested the test last week of Chis

From Globe-Democrai

News Services

WASHINGTON - How much does

James Earl Ray really know about the

events leading up to and away from a

moment of violence in Memphis April 4,

1968? And will he talk?

Those are the most tantalizing ques-

tions among many that will be on the

minds

of

congressional investigaters

Wednesday when Ray is scheduled to

testify in public for the first time about

the 10year-old murder of the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr.

IN 1869, RAY pleaded guilty to the

murder and is serving a 99-year term at

the Brushy Mountain Penitentiary in

Tennessee. But he was brought to Wash-

ington under heavy guard for his public

appearance before the House Select

Committee on Assassinations.

It is possible, however, that Ray's

testimony, which is scheduled for three

days, will be cut short. Since his plea of

guilty, Ray has been insisting on his

innocence and has been struggling des.

perately to reopen his case and obtain a

new trial.

Denies Illegal Methods

Were Used In King Inquiry

By GERALD M. BOYD

A Washington Correspondent

of the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON - The staff director of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations has denied a charge

that a committee investigator used illegal methods in

attempting to gain information for the committee's

inquiry into the assassination of the 'Rev. Dr. Martin

Luther King Jr.

But director G. Robert Blakey confirmed that Oliver

Patterson of St. Louis, who made the charge, had

testified to the committee.

"On the strength of a preliminary investigation, the

committee categorically denies each and every allega-

tion of wrongdoing," said Blakey, who is directing the

committee's $4.5 million inquiry into the murders of

King and President John F. Kennedy, at a news

conference Thursday.

Facing criticism from members of Congress con-

cerned about Patterson's charge, Blakey broke a news

blackout that had been in existence since he became the

committee's chief counsel in June 1977. But after issuing

a-four-paragraph- statement, he refused further-com-

ment and declined to answer questions.

At a news conference in St. Louis on Monday,

Patterson accused an investigator of attempting to gain

information about King's assassination by using Patter-

son's friendship with Jerry Ray, brother of James izarl

Flay, in prison for King's death. The charges generated

uigusual attention, because Patterson said he had

worked for the committee for the last. few months and

had once been an informant for the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

Blakey said Patterson had never been an employee of

the committee. He implied that Patterson and Rayis

atiorney,

Mark Lane,

who was

also at the news

conterence Monday, were attempting to discredit the

two-year inquiry.

"The committee is determined that the American

people will not be misled by attempts to discredit the

committee and its investigation," he said.

Patterson, who had not been publicly linked to the

assassination investigation before Monday's news

conference, cited a series of questionable and possible

illegal actions that he said he had performed for the

committee. He said an investigator, Conrad Baetz, had

requested the acts.

Baetz, he said, asked that he illegally record Jerry

Ray's telephone conversations and sift through his

delongings for letters from his jailed brothe:. On

another occasion, he contended, Baetz attempted to

have him arrange a news conference to discredit Lane

sand to offer further eviderce of Ray's guilt.

A dispute could arise, he said, over the points on

which the committee wants Ray to testify and what,

, instead, he might want to tell the committee. Ray's

attorney, Lane, has long contended that King's assassi-

fact and of attempting to use the investigation to

Di King Seemed To Expect

Assassination, Abernathy Says

mate.)

By GERALD M. BOYD

A Washington Correspondent

of the Post-Dispatch

WASHINGTON - The Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King was probably aware

that he would be assassinated and un-

derwent severe periods of depression in

the months preceding his murder, the

Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, his chief lieu-

tenant in the civil rights movement, has

testified.

Abernatny said that, over the last

four months of his life, King showed a

marked change in his mental state,

which seemed to indicate that he knew

that he would be killed.

He said that King had been harassed;

constantly by the Federal Bureau of

investigation and that neither the FBI

nor other police authorities provided

adequate security for King, even though

they had been told that King was con-

stantly receiving death threats.

The charges against the FBI and the

description

of

King's last

months

emerged as the key elements of Aberna-

thy's remarks today at a public hearing

of the House Select Committee on Assas-

sinations.

Under continuous questioning from

the 11-member committee, Abernathy

said he had no evidence to substantiate

his belief that King knew that he would

be killed. But he said that he was certain

that King did know.

the testimony of Abernathy, which

included a moving description of King's

last hours, came at the start of five days

of hearings on the civil rights leader's

death. King was assassinated in Mem-

phis on April 4, 1968. James Earl Ray

was later arrested and confessed to the ?

assassination.

Since his confession, Ray has denied

committing the murder. He has sought ai

new trid and said that he yould tell the

"real" story if a new trial ever was held.

Abernathy is the current head of the

Southern Christian Leadership Confer-

ence — the group King founded. He had

•—t.

Ke was tatally shod was with King wagn

he was fatally shot.

Today's testimony represented in

attempt by several committee members

to determine King's relationship with

the FBI and to determine whether the

agency knew about the assassination

plan in advance or failed to adequately

pursue leads in the case.

One committee member, Rep. Sa-

muel L. Devine, R-Ohio, said he hoped

the committee was not attempting to

dwell on the FBi at the expense of pursu-

ing other angles of the assassination.

Abernathy said that King was reluc-

tant to report death threats to the FBI.

He said that the slain civil rights leader

was aware, as early as 1955, that he was

a target of telephone tapping, electronic

bugging and other surveillance methods

of the FBI and other government agen-

cies.

"The FBI was aware of some of the

- threats," Abernathy said. "We did not

report all of them, because we believed

were quite racist.

put a ba because you dose a change is

heart."

Abernathy said that King was aware

that then FBI director, J. Edgar Hoover,

had called him "the most notorious liar

in America."

On the day before the assassination,

Abernathy said, a plane King was riding

on was delayed for about an hour while

it was searched. Abernathy said he had

no idea who had ordered the precaution,

but that no special security had been

available after King's party reached

Mempnis, either from the FBI or frcm

local police.

Several

committee members

also

questioned Aternathy about a group of

Memphis blacks called the "Invaders."

Abernathy said they had been paid FBI

seemed more concerned about his death.

"His attitude was altogether differ-

troubled, more nervous and a more

worried person."

At one point, he said, the two took a,

trip to Acapulco, Mexico, in an attempt

to get King to relax. But all the time,

Abernathy said, King seemed to be con-

cerned about problems.

During that period, Abernathy said,

King turned over to him more duties as

And King authorized the organization's

bylaws to say that Abernathy should

Lane was in St. Louis on Monday for

he said. "But when it comes to knuckles,

I think mine are going to get slapped."

In a related development, FBI direc

tor William H. Webster said Monday

that the 1974 FBI report containing an

informant's statement about a payoff

made to Ray after King's killing was

neyer turned over to federal investiga

tois because of "simple inadvertance."

*This document came to light last

March, along with an earlier documeri,

which was an FBI report that Byers had

told two lawyers that he had turned

down a $50,000 offer to arrange King's

'death. The FBI here had been checking

into Byers after he had become a prime :

suspect in the two break-ins at the St.

Louis Art Museum. Charges against

Byers were.sibsequently dropped.

The second document quoted an in-

former as saying he was told by Byers

that a Missouri businessman was "the

individual who made

the payoff to

James Earl Ray after the killing" on

April 4, 1968.

Webster said that the second docu-

ment constituted "heresay three times

removed." In New York to address the

American Bar Association's national

convention, Webster said that although

an investigation by his office concluded

that the report's misplacement was a

mistake, it was not overly significant

• because

"it has not yet been verified

lat the informant spoke the truth."

Although the document, as censorec

when it was made public, did not specily

report contained the first allegation that

money was actually paid to Ray.

'Broker named

as conspirator

in FBI memo

WASHINGTON (AP) - An FBI agent was given a

second-hand account by an informant several years

after the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther. King

Jr. that a St. Louis stockbroker was "the individual who

made the payoff of James Earl Ray," according to the

agent's report released Thursday.

The stockbroker and a lawyer who also was impli-

cated in the claimed conspiracy have died. Their wives

deny their husbands had any such involvement.

* THE FBI AGENT, whose name has not been re-

leased, wrote a memo for his own files in March, 1974,

after a wide-ranging interview with an unnamed infor-

mant. Among the criminal matters they discussed was

the informant's claim that he had been told the previous

year by Russell G. Byers, a former St. Louis auto parts

dealer, or a conspiracy by the lawyer and the stockoro.

ker to murder King.

According to the informant, Byers said he originally

was offered $10,000 to $20,000 /by the lawyer, subse

quently identified as John Sutherland, to kill King him-

selt, but that Byers declined.

i Byers said another man, subsequently named as !

Stockbroker John H. Kauffmann, was present when the

k.murder contract.was offered, and that he (Kauffmann)

was the man who later paid Ray an unspecified amount

for the actua]'killing.

Ray is serving a 99-year sentence for King's killing:

He pleaded guilty,-but now says he had no part in the

shooting.

The agent did not forward his report of the interview

to FBI headquarters and it was not discovered until last'

March, during a review of St. Louis bureau files on an

unrelated matter.

THE AGENT'S report was dated March 19, 1974, #

Kauffmann died less than three weeks before; on March

1, 1974.

they immediately forwarded the document to the Jus-

tice Department and the House Select Committee on

Report on King

killing called

only hearsay

NEW YORK (AP) - A 1974 FBI report alleging a

Conspiracy in the murder of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther

King Jr. was filed away for four years instead of being

turned over to federal investigators because of "simple

inadvertence,"' FBI Director William H. Webster said

Monday.

However, Webster downplayed the significance off

the slip-up, saying the report contained "hearsay three

times: removed" and that it was written long after the

original investigation was concluded.

The recently released document quotes an informer

as saying he was told a Missouri businessman was "the

individual who made the payoff to James Earl Ray

after the killing." Ray is serving a 99 year term in

Tennessee for the 1088 murder of the civil rights leader.

The report "would normally have been filed with the

King investigative file. This was not done," Webster

said in an interview.

"It hasn't been verified that the informant spoke the

truth. It hasn't been verified" that the informant was

netiatine of co charent when asked we thet the re

tion.

Particular attention is directed to the interview with

KENNEDY on 8/4/78 as it pertains to dissemination of

information by him, which information is reflected in

serial 5 of St. Louis file 137-16185. In this interview

of 8/4/78, KENNEDY stated that he recalls with reasonable

certainty

that certain information was disseminated by him

to the St. Louis Police Department.

In order to document such dissemination, this is to

record that I personally searched our dissemination control

file, 66-2340, for the months of April through July of 1974

found no record of such dissemination having been made.

It should be noted that the volume of 66-2340 for the

month of March, 1974, and prior months are no longer maintained

as they have been destroyed under the file destruction program.

There is no FD-159 (dissemination form) concerning this

matter contained in 137-16185 or the related file 87-21859.

on July 28, 1978, by SAC ROY B. KLAGER, JR., concerning a

closed St. Louis file 137-16185; more specifically, serial 5

of that file. Mr. KENNEDY recalled having read this serial

in detail. He further recalled earlier discussion on July 28,

1978, concerning a notation appearing on the above serial

which states, "Notify locals of info re killing", and his

earlier reply thät in his recollection this cömment pertained

to a matter appearing on page 2 of the memorandum and unrelated

to the MARTIN LUTHER KING information.

Mr. KENNEDY was asked if he did in fact disseminate the

information in keeping with the above-cited handwritten

notation:

He related that he recalls with reasonable certainty

that he did disseminate the information appearing on page 2

to someone in the St. Louis Police Department whose identity

he does not now recall.

Mr. KENNEDY called further attention to the last paragraph

of page 3 of the memorandum in question which refers to another

killing, unrelated to the MARTIN LUTHER KING matter.

volunteered that this additional unrelated information was also

disseminated, to the best of his recollection, to the st. Louis

Police Department; however, he similarly does not recall to

whom this information was given.

Byers Knew Of Payoff,

FBI Was Told

WASHINGTON - The Federal Bureau

"f Investigation received information in

1973 that Russell G. Byers, a former auto

darts dealer and police character irom

Rock Hill, knew who "made the payoff of

ames Earl Ray" after the assassination

luf the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Byers' accusation, reported by an

informant, is contained in an internal St.

Louis FBI office memorandum made

•ivailable Wednesday to the Post-Dis-

patch under the Freedom of Information

Act.

The memorandum, which went un-

noticed for four years in the wrong file in

st. Louis, does not give the name of the

nan identified by Byers. But it describes

the man as "a short, stocky man who

walked with a limp."

This description, several sources have

told the Post-Dispatch, fits John R.

Kauffmann, a onc-time stockbroker of

Imperial, Mo. Byers has reportedly told

investigators for the House Assassina-

tions Committee that Kauffmann and

John H. Sutherland, both now dead,

asked Byers to arrange King's murder.

However, one source said that at least

one other man fitting the description

could not be ruled out as the person

described in the memorandum. The

second man was described by St. Louis

police sources as an avowed segregation-

ist and an acquaintance of Sutherland's.

Byers refused to comment on the FBI

memo when reached at his Rock Hill

home Wednesday night. He said the

House committee had asked him not to

make public statements.

Byers was keenly interested, however,

in the new disclosures. He carefully

analyzed the copy of the FBI memo

released Wedresday. And, while hum-

ming a tune, he read through a New

York Times story about the memo.

Byers' allegations are currently under

scrutiny by the House Committee on

Assassinations. A committee source told

the Post-Dispatch Wednesday night that

the committee was still trying to assess

the significance of Byers' story.

All names but that of Byers were

deleted from the FBI memorandum by

w s521e o0n

of Information Privacy

Docid: 32989797

Page

90

Acts Branch. But the memorandum

discussed a meeting among Byers and

two men in which Byers said he "had

been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to

kill King."

Sources have told the Post-Dispatch

that Byers told House investigators that

Kauffmann and Sutherland, a patent

lawyer, also from Imperial, asked him to

arrange King's murder.

The memorandum, dated March 19,

1914, was written by a St. Louis agent of

the FBI on the basis of information

supplied by an informant.

*In the fall of 1973," the memorandum

reads, "Beyers) (the name is consistently

misspelled in the memo) talked freely

about himself and his business, and they

later went to (short deletion by FBI)

where Beyers told a story about visiting •

a lawyer in St. Louis County, now

deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill

Martin Luther King. He said that also

present was a short, stock man, who

walked with a limp."

The memorandum then continues with

this sentence, enclosed in parentheses:

"Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers commented that this

man was actually the individual who

made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing.)

Several sources have told the Post-

Dispatch that Kaufmann was short,

overweight and walked with a marked

limp aiter being injured in an automobile

accident several years prior to the

events described by Byers.

The other man fitting that description,

nowever, is known to have testified

before the subcommittee in April. Roy A.

Walther III, an attorney for Byers,

refused to say whether the other man

was implicated in Byers' testimony.

Walther said he had never heard of the

other man until the time of Byers'

testimony before the House committee.

said the man was an avowed segrega-

frequently to speak at segregationist

rallies during the late 1960s. He was also

known to have been acquainted with

Sutherland.

The man is further known to be closely

associated with Ray, who pleaded guilty

'of King's murder in 1969 and is serving a

99-year prison sentence in Petros, Tenn.

Since pleading guilty, however, Ray has

denied full responsibility for the shooting

Missouri

63017, residence telephone number (314) 391-6518.

Mr. BENDER is presently unemployed, having retired from FBI

service on 2/28/77•

Prior to his retirement he was assigned to

the St. Louis Field Division of the FBI from 1953 to the date of

his retirement. Additionally, he served in the capacity of

Field Supervisor in the St. Louis Division of the FBI for approx-

imately nine years prior to and until the date of his retirement.

He supervised general criminal matters.

MX. BENDER was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office, at

which place he voluntarily appeared.

Mr. BENDER was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed

St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter

which was at one time under his supervision and assigned to an

Agent under his supervision by the name of HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD F. O'HARA,

a förmer informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The attention of Mr. BENDER was directed to a memorandum in

this file dated 3/19/74 to the SAC, St. Louis, from Special Agent

HOWARD C. KENNEDY.

This memorandum is identified as serial 5 of

the file. Mr.. BENDER was 'permitted to read this memorandum in

order to refresh his memory concerning its contents. Although

he had no independent recollection of the memorandum or its contents,

after reading it he concluded that the memorandum had crossed his

desk on or about 3/19/74, as attested to by the appearance of his

handwriting on the memorandum. BENDER's attention was further

on the reporanum

airected to paragraph 2, page 3 oI the memorandum, which paragraph

begins, "During the fall of 1973...," and ending with "

... $20,000

to kill KING."

MX. BENDER related that he had no independent recollection of

the paragraph in question; however, upon reviewing the entire

memorandum dated. 3/19/74,

he found no evidence that the informatior

contained in the above-cited paragraph was either acted upon of

disseminated beyond the file in which the memorandum is located.

He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-

writing on page 1 of the memorandum which states, "Notify locals

of info re killing." Upon reading the memorandum in detail,

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did

not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to

an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing

on page 2 of the memorandum.

Mr. BENDER stated that he has absolutely no recollection

as to why the information contained in the above-cited paragraph

on page 3 of the memorandum in question was not disseminated

or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through

inadvertence.

He can make no judgment whatsoever concerning

the credibility of the information as a possible reason for

not acting on it.

BENDER related, however, that because of

his 10ng

association with the FBI

in St. Louis, he does recall

an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as a well-known

thief and fence.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. BENDER stated that in

retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information

concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74

should have been acted upon.

MI. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private

He retired from FBI service

on 2/28/77•

Prior to his retirement he was assigned to the

St. Louis Division of the FBI from 1954 to the date of his

Mr. KENNEDY was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed

other personnel in the office.

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the

information and he is sure that no other information concerning

KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment

with regard to the credibility of the information at this late

date. He does not believe, however, that credibility of either

O'HARA Or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision

with regard to dissemination of the information concerning KING.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service

in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known

fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the

failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph

2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN

LUTHER KING.

He noted that there is nothing written on the

memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action

taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-

written notation on the first page of

the memorandum which

states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies

this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,

ROBERT I.. BENDER.

was KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation

Area Man Allegedly

By J. PULITZER

Of the Post-Dispatch Staff

A 46-year-old Rock Hill man has told

the House Select Committee on Assassi-

nations that he was once offered $50,000

to kill the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

Jr., the New York Times reported today.

Pussell G. Byers, a former auto parts

dealer who was implicated last January

in the theft of several statues trom the

St. Louis Art Museum, said he turned

down the offer in late 1966 or early 1967,

according to the Times. King was Shot to

death on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn.

The Times story said Byers told the

committee that two men from Imperial,

Mo., had offered him the money in

behalf of a group of conservative busi-

y the conservative business group men-

Ản FBI spokesman in Vashington told

the Post-Dispatch that the St. Louis

office of the FBI had received "certain

information" about the King assassina-

tion in 1973, but would not confirm' it

came from Byers.

He said the information was never

investigated and was placed in the wrong

file, and then was turned up by accident

Hast March. The spokesman took pains to

suggest the information may not have

been considered reliable.

A Post-Dispatch reporter who attempt-

ed to interview Byers at his residence in

the 9300 block of Fredric Court was told

that Byers was out of town and was not

available for comment.

The Times account of a three-month

investigation by the House committe®

ridicated that investigators suspected

that word of a contract offer on King's

life had reached the prison through

Spica. But Byers said he had told Spica

of the offer only recently, according to

{the Times.

Records from the State Penitentiary

indicate that Spica and James Earl Ray

shared the same cell block, and for. a

Byers also told the House committee)

that he had told an informer for the

the $50,000 offer to kill King, the Times,

said.

Byers.said the FBI office in St. Louis

had been given details of the offer, but

had never investigated, according to the

Times report.

A source close to the St. Louis FBI,

office told the Post-Dispatch that he had

never heard of the information on thef

alleged approach to Byers.

In Washington, FBI spokesman Homer

Boynton told the Post-Dispatch that

"certain information relating tothe mar-

Contirs Byers Told Of King Offer

By WILLIAM FREIVOGEL

and CARTER STITI

Ci the Post-Dispatch Staff

A reputable. St. Louisan confirms that

Russeil G. Byers told him that he had ,

been offered $50,000 by two Imperial,

Mo., men to arrange the deati of the

Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King.

Byers twice mentioned the piot, first in

generalities shortly after the assassina-

sion in 1963 and later in more detail in

about 1974, the St. Louisan told the Post-

Dispatch. He said that in the latter

conversation Byers told of a stockbroker

"patent lawyer to discuss the plot.

apparently because he feared reprinals

from Byers or other.

The House Assassinations Committee

is conducting an intensive investigation

into Byers' allegations. It held ciosed

hearings on them last week. Byers was

reported to have told the committee that

he turned down the offer from Suther-

land and Kauffmann, which he says was

made in late 1956 or early 1907. Suther

Previous accounts of the alleged assas!

sination plot have said that Byers hag

said that he told two lawyers and other

unidentilied persons about it some years

ago. But this is the first direct confirma-

tion from one of those persons.

In another development, a Clayton

lawyer, who has been questioned by the

House Assassinations Committee staff,

told a reporter he had seen Byers and

Kauffmann meeting several times in the

late 1960s. The lawyer represented both

Byers was particulariy close to Kaufi-

that testimony this spring by Byers, 46,

of the 9300 block of Fredric Court, had

raised

questions among

committe?

members of a conspiracy to kill King.

But Mark Lane, an attorney for Ray,

said Ray had never had any dealings

with Byers and that the Byers' allega-

a conspiracy anc-thus shift attention

from the Federal Bureau of Investiga-l

the King killing.

Ray is serving a 99-year prison sen-

however, Ray has denied résponsiblity

The Post-Dispatch was told that the

Byers had he not become implicated in

July 24, 1978

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Former Special Agent Harold R. Dobson (1941 - 1972) ,

residence: 8831 Bracken Circle, St. Louis, Missouri

63123,

who was St. Louis case Agent on the M. L. King - James Bard Ray

case in 1968, was interviewed, not under oath, by Mr. Michael

Eberharât, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel to the House Select

Committee

on Assassinations, at the offices of that committee,

Room 3386, Second and "D" Streets, Southwest, Washington, D. C.,

from 2:00 P.M. to 2:45 P.M. on the afternoon of June 28, 1978.g

at which time he furnished the following information in response

to direct questions:

Dobson served as a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation from October 20, 1941 to retirement on June 30:

1972, being

assigned to the Boston, Newark, St. Paul, and St.

Louis Divisions.

He was in St. Louis from 1947 until retirement.

He was assigned to the Security Squad from 1948 to retirement,

concerned primarily with investigation of the Communist Party and

its menbers, nationalistic tendency, espionage, sabotage, and

Security Of Government Employee cases.

comparatively

little knowledge or experience regarding New Left, racial and hate

group cases.

He was an alternate supervisor but declined

authorization as supervisor for personal reasons.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of the

Cointel Program in St. Louis, but was unable to recall any

specific activities, objectives, or accomplishments of same.

Dobson was unable to suggest why the case was assigned

to him, except that he had the first st. Louis lead in the case,

to trace the weapon used through officials of Browning Arms

Company, with whom he had continuing liaison, and for the further

reason he had been utilized in an administrative capacity on

virtually every major case of national importance in the St.

Louis Division beginning with the surveillance and apprehension

of St. Louis Communist Party leaders in 1952. Another Special

Agent since retired handled the Ray penitentiary escape-case

prior to the assassination.

Special Agent in Charge Thomas Gearty supervised the

King case in St. Louis.

It was Dobson's responsibility to

coordinate the investigation, handle the resulting "mountain of

paper", see that obvious, logical, reasonable, or merely

desirable leads or avenues of investigation were appropriately

assigned (with Special Agent in Charge approval), promptly and

adequately covered, and properly reported, and to keep the

Special Agent in Charge, Bureau, Memphis, and other interested

offices promptly advised of pertinent developments.

Until the true identity of Ray was established, every

Special Agent in the St. Louis Division was assigned exclusively

to the case.

Twenty-four hour coverage of all leads was

mandatory.

Developments of the day were discussed, and "brain

busting"

sessions were held at nightly conferences

of all

Special Agents, at which most new assignments were made.

All

employees clearly gave of their best efforts.

Dobson was unable to recall specifically what efforts

were made to determine the whereabouts of John. Ray on the day

of the assassination. He suggested the file would be the best

evidence in this regard. He believed the possibility of John

Ray's involvement was undoubtedly recognized and that appropriate

Dobson was unable to recall any surreptitious entries

to Ray's relatives' premises.

St. Louis had no technical

surveillances on relatives.

Requests for authorization for

same may have been made, but if so, were without his knowleäge.

To the extent of his knowledge, the 'St. Louis Division

had never placed a technical surveillance on King.

Toll call records of relatives were obtained in

accordance with a then current Bureau policy subpoena process.

Relative bank accounts were monitored and results set forth in

reports with a statement that the information would only be

available after issuance of a subpoena duces tecum. Coverage of

relatives consisted of this, plus personal interviews and contacts

with informants, sources, neighbors, and associates, ana

available public records.

Relatives were initially uncooperative in varying

degrees, but subsequently became generaily cooperative,

although Dobson never fully trusted any of them. He was unable

to recall any evidence developed that Ray was ever in St. Louis

territory, or in contact with any relatives there, subsequent to

his peritentiary escape.

He doubted financial contributions to

Ray by them, as their combined incomes and assets, in nis

estimation, were insufficient to support the life

style Ray

apparently enjoyed following his escape.

Dobson had no knowledge or any information as to the

source of Ray's income following his escape.

He conjectured

the same would have logically had to result

from successful

criminal activity or be contributed by an unknown persor or

group.

He recognized Ray's record stamped him as

a "loser",

but opined it was not beyond the realm of possibility access

to an excellent prison library and association with convicts

less unsuccessful than himself could have enhanced the quality

of Ray's thought processes to a point where he could have

conceived and carried out a successful supermarket or other

similar robbery.

At least his escape was successful.

considered Ray's technically proper preparation and filing of a

motion for a new trial, which was pending at the time of his

escape, as evidence of

this possibility.

Dobson recalled that,

as a Missouri prosecutor prior to entering the Bureau, he had

uniformly recommended alternative punishment for non-habitual

criminals, as the Missouri Penitentiary, even then, was generally

considered a

"finishing school for criminals"

Supermarkets

offered the possibility of being almost as lucrative as banks,

without the disadvantage of incurring Federal jurisdiction. He

feels sure major police departments in the St. Louis territory

had been contacted to determine if Ray could be a logical

suspect in unsolved supermarket robberies.

He recalled some

indication Ray might have been involved in a bank robbery in

Alton, Illinois and that the Springfield, Illinois Division had

been so advised, but he had no knowledge as to the outcome of

investigation there.

Dobson was generally aware of the existence of white

hate organizations, but was of the opinion members of such

organizations in St. Louis territory lack sufficient organization,

intelligence, and financial capability for significant

involvement in the King killing.

Such organizations, in his

estimation, should have been able to reasonably foresee

King's death would elevate him to the status of a martya,

which would have been counterproductive to their aims and

He was of the further opinion that any intelligent

co-conspirator would undoubtedly have eliminate Ray as a

security measure.

He suggested that, if then current rumors

that King had become a liability to the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference were true, that organization had the most

to gain from King's demise.

All St. Louis informants, potential informants and

sources regarding criminal, security, racial, hate group, or

other matters, were under continuing instructions to immediately

report even the slightest information which they could obtain

or which might come to their attention regarding the King case.

Dobson recalled John Gawron as an elderly, self-

• confessed habitual criminal, who had lived with Ray's mother

several years until her death. He never met, saw, or talked to

Gawron.

"If Gawron was initially carried as a PCI, but later

appeared openly, Dobson was unable to recall why, but suggested

Gawron may have initially indicated some potential for

furnishing information regarding current criminal matters and

was later found incapable of doing so.

Having lived with Ray's

mother, Gawron was undoubtedly able to furnish some factual

personal history and background information as to the family

in the past, but it was Dobson's impression that Gawron was not

fully trusted by them and was capable of furnishing only

conjectural information as to their then current activities.

According to Agents handling Gawron, he would start with a half-

truth or conjecture, and embroider upon it, and therefore was

no, on therefore via e-

considered generally to be unreliabie.

St. Louis Agents contacting released fellow inmates

were instructed to not only obtain all possible information as

to Ray's whereabouts, but all possible information as to thei=

degree of association with him, his sentiments, his plans, the

identities of any associates or friends either in or out of

prison, and the manner of his escape.

Dobson was unable to recall any telephonic.contacts

with the Memphis case agent, although there may have been one

on cago as weant specue gent in cha gentact was handling

the case there, as Jerry Ray made at least one trip to visit

St. Louis relatives.

Dobson never met, saw, or spoke with any Ray relatives,

with the exception of Jerry Ray who contacted him telephonically

on two or three occasions during a visit to St. Louis pursuant

to instructions from the Chicago Division.

Dobson had no idea as to the basis for any friction

which may have existed between Director Hoover and King.

Hoover never confided in Dobson and never sought his advice.

CG 44-1114

Both, of the KLINGEMANs characterized JAMES EARL

RAY as an excelient employee, quiet, attentive, prompt,

polite, a very good worker, but to their knowledge,

had no friends or visitors during the time of his

employment.

They did recall that during the subject's

last week of

amployment, he received three or four phone

calls from a male individual who stated that he was RAY's brother.

They could not recall the individual's name, nor did they

believe that they would recognize this person's voice if they

heard it again.

In conversation with Mr. HUIE, the KLINGEMANS

received the following information on a confidential basis and

advised that they were rather reluctant to divulge it,

but felt that it was their duty as citizens.

They requested

that this information bemintained on a confidential basis within

the FBI.

They advised that they contacted Chief DERNING

because of his reputation and are now following his advice in

furnishing this information to the FBI:

Mr. HUIE sowed the KLINGELIANs letters from RAY in

which RAY listed employment at the Indian Trail Restaurant.

(It should be noted that this restaurant is an old, large,

upper class restaurant, of excellent reputation. Chief

DERNING advised that the KLINGEMANs themselves have an

excellent reputation within the community and that he holds

them in very high regard). HULE told them that RAY had

served seven years of a twenty-year sentence at Jefferson,

Missouri, prison, during which time he had eight visitors,

HUIE did not identif

which one.

a razor, green prison trousers which had been dyed black, and

12 hersey bars in anticipation that he would have to go

without food for, some time.

RAY also had $300 in his shoe.

he escaped in abed truck and walked to Chicago, Illinois,

from Jefferson City,

, Missouri, which took him about eight

days. (The KLINGEMANs do recall that when the subject first

appered at the restaurant, his feet were swollen and that

their sister-in-law gave hin two Ace bandages to use which he

returried three or four days later.. This supposedly was

mentioned in the letter in HUIE's possession).

Thereafter, RAY read the advertisement in the

Tribune wherein the KLINGEMANs had advertised for help in the

restaurant. HUIE said that the subject in the letter

NW 55215 DocId: 32989797 Page

159

---

## Page 160

CG 44-1114

mentioned that the employment at. the Indian Trail Restaurant

was the "high point of his life"

HUIE mentioned that RAY had had only three jobs

in his life, one of which was in a shoe factory outside of

East St. Louis, Illinois, which is prior to his going to

prison the last time.

He also said that during the time RAY

was employed at the restaurant, he was "tapped on the shoulder"

by an individual who recognized him and who threatened to

reveal his identity to the policé and cause RAY's return to

Prison if he, RAY,

did not work for this person. HUIE said

that RAY was given $1,200 during the initial contacts, by. the

alleged conspirators, and was ultimately paid $15,000, but

was due to receive more.

Again, according to HUIE, RAY was told to go to

Canada to investigate the difficulty of crossing the border.

Supposedly RAY made two trips through the Detroit Tunnel into

Canada. He also made a

third trip to Canada, date and

sequence not given, and "was instructed' to obtain a 40-year-

old newspaper, get

the names of the males born that de,

and search the current phone directory for similar names.

He was then to surveil the individuals with similar names to

determine whether or not his physical description was

similar to theirs.

Thereafter, he telephoned persons of his

like description,

utilizing a pretext, and thereby found a mar

who had never applied for a passport. RAY then applied for a

passport in this name.

The KLINGEMANs advised that they were not sure that

they were furnishing this information in its proper

sequence, but that to the best of their recollection, the

information preceding and following was given to them in this.

order by HUIL. Thereafter, RAY was given more money to

purchase a Mustang which was to be driven to Acapulco, Mexico,

for the purpose of obtaining a tourist sticker.

He then.

drove through Mexico to the West Coast and hid out there to

receive further instructions from the other individuals in

the alleged conspiracy. HUIE stated that RAY was flown to

was no action andbe was sent back to California.

Atlanta fron the West Coast, but the time was not fe was also

told to be in Mississippi at a certain time and place.

Supposedly Reverend MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. was at a. Holiday

Inn Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, when RAY

was flown there.

WW 55215 DecId: 32989797 Page 160

## Page 161

CG 44-1114

Subsequently, RAY was given money to obtain binoculars

and a shotgun and was to go to Memphis to be somewhere at

3 p.m. in room 312 or 113. Supposedly there were other

individuals who also came to this room and there was a

Negro male who purportedly called KING out to the balcony.

According to HUIE, the actual murderer of KING was not RAY,

although RAY was present and at a later time (probably the trial)

RAY will identify the murderer. RAY did pick up the rifle, ran

to his car, and sped to a rendezvous in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was supposed to pick up a "bundle of money"

conspirators did not appear.

по 2 k в en

, however,

the

RAY allegedly spent several days

or hours at this apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, awaiting the

arrival of his "fellow conspirators".

According to HUIE, the plan was for RAY to go to

Mexico, but immediately fly

north to throw off pursuit and

to steer all investigation to Mexico. However,

the conspirators did not appear in Atlanta, RAY fled to. Carda

thereafter utilizing his knowledge to obtain a passport and

fled to England.

The KLINGEMANs advised that the rest of HUIE's story

substantially follows the newspaper accounts which appeared

after subject RAY's arrest in England. They did note that

HUTE stated that RAY did rob a bank in London because he

"got real low on money". HUIE at no time identified the

alleged fellow conspirators of RAY. He did swear the KLINGEMANS

to secrecy and told them that he would mail the "Look"

Both Mr. and Mrs.

make these proofs available to

te interviewing Agents for review.

The KLINGEMANs advised that RAY began working for

them as a dishwasher and because of his excellent attitude

was advanced to cook's helper.

During the time he was in

their employ; they did not observe him in a car, nor did they

know him to own an autorobile. He had no visitors, he did

not wear glasses, he had no women friends, nor did he make

any advances toward the female personnel employed at the

restaurang and they noted that his hair was "less bushy" duing

the time he was at the restaurant than shown in the

photographs.

They are not sure how he came to work from his

apartment, but believe height have beenimet at the Eden's

Expressway by WILLIE PERRY and FRED BURNS, who were also

employees at the restaurant.

His conduct was excellent and they cannot recall

him making any comments one way or another about members of

the Negro race and specifically no comments whatsoever con-

cerning MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. RAY made no reference to his

previous employent, but did mention that he

Brimerhaven, Germany, during World War II.

They advised that

when RAY received the phone call's during his last week of

employment he seeined to be disturbed and that his

concentration on his work was not as good as it usually was.

They then recalled that according to HUIE, that when

JAMES HAR RAY left England, he was going to Lisbon

Africa, however, he was unable. to do so which is when he returned

Land, le to ge

to get to

to England and held up a bank receiving about $200 in loot.

They again stated that the information furnished to them by

HUIE came from.letters which RAY had written to his attorney, who

in turn turned them over to the author.

Also Mr. KLINGEMAN

i stated that in one of the letters which he believed was to

the attorney from RAY, while he was in London; England, there

was a drawing identifying a location which appeared to

Diversey Street and Sheffield Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.

At the conclusion of the interview, the Klingemans

again requested that this information be maintained in

confidence and expressed a willingness to co-operate with

the FBI in ay way possible.

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

In the couse of a file review in an unrelated

matter, SL 3167-C, St. Louis File 137-16185, Bureau File

137-36945, was reviewed.

This file contained a contact

memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which contained information

relating to several criminal matters and also contained the

following

paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago,

date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as

to whether they could get together to talk, and they later

did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Mo.. in the area of a

Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled on

business.

Beyers talked freely about himself and his

business, and they later went to informant's house where

Beyers told

. a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis

County, now deceased, not further identified, who had

offered to give him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.

He said that also present was a short, stocky man, who

walked with a limp. (Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Beyers commented that this man was actually

the individual who made the payoff of James Earl Ray after

the killing. Beyers said he had declined to accept this

He did remark that this lawyer had confederate

flags and other items about the house that might indicate

that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also commented that

he had been offered either

: $10,000 or $20,000 to kill King."

Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices

and files failed to reveal this information was

if any way

disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant

file.

an offer to kill Dy. Martin Luther King. The clipping came

in the regular FBI mail and Duncan stated he did not know who

sent it to him.

A few days later, while on the phone to ex-FBI Supervisor

Robert E. Peters in Louisville regarding a social engagement,

Duncan asked him about the clipping and who Clifton Baird was

and what the clipping referred to.

Peters said Baird was a

tall, heavy-set man who was in the Vice Squad for a while and

that Duncan should have known him from seeing hin in the Vice

Squad while Duncan worked with the Detective Bureau in Louis-

ville.

Approximately April 25, 1977, FBI Headquarters sent a

• the present locations of former Special Agent in Charge of

Louisville, Bernard C. Brown; Supervisor Robert I, Peters;

and SA William R. Duncan as

they were named by former Police

Officer Clifton Baird alleging improprieties in the Martin

Luther King assassination case.

SA Duncan initially had no recollection of the incident

and he called former SA Peters at Louisville and asked him if

he knew anything about this.

Peters replied that he had no

idea.

Duncan later called

retired Police Captain John Hampton

of Louisville, a close personal friend, to determine it he

Knew anything about this.

Hampton advised he did not know

but would ask and find out what he could and call Duncan.

later called back and gave the names of some police officers

who had been interviewed and named former Major Priest M. Fry:

former Major Robert Gregory; Lieutenant James Bibb; Sergeant

Brent Hardin and Lieutenant Vernon Austin. Hampton apparently

talked to Austin and advised that he had learned that the event

was supposed to have taken place in the First District offices

sometime in 1964 or 1965.

Duncan called Lieutenant vernon

Austin, whom he had known for 25 years, and asked him about the

matter. Austin related to Duncan who the Committee had asked

about and generally who was supposed to be present when the

alleged offer took place.

Duncan told the investigators that he had no recollection

concernigg this matter and that he had in fact not slept and

walked the floor a number of nights for approximately ten days

to two weeks. At this time he recalled one night that Sergeant

B. C. Brown of the FBI.

Duncan did not Iccall who was there except several

uniformed officers who were coming and going and that there

were several in the area.

There were a number of questions

regarding whether it was a big roll-call area or the Captain's,

Sergeant's, Lieutenant's offices or a hallway. Duncan was

asked whether or not there were three or a dozen people present

and Duncan replied that there could have been betreen three

and twelve people, exact number unrecalled.

Duncan was asked whother Eob Peters was there. Duncan

said ho did not Iccall his being there, otherwise he would

not have made the statement that "if you want to verify the

price on DI. Martin Luther King contact Bob Peters or B. C.

Brown."

Duncan identified one person he thought was there as

Arlie

Blaire (because Duncan had heard that he was supposed to

have been there from the questions asked). Duncan Iccalled a

Duncan was asked about his relationship with Robert Peters

and also with FrY, Hardin, Gregory, Bibb, Austin, Herman

Mitchell, John Mitchell and B. C. Brown of the FBI.

They asked duncan about an attempted bombing of Sergeant Brent

Hardin's car and if Duncan worked on the case. Duncan recalled

a borb being placed on Hardin's car but that it apparently did

assumed he was delivering dope or some

other kind of contraband."

"James is a crook," said Jerry Ray.

"He's been one since he got out of the

Army, to make money without working.

He thinks being a thief is an honorable

profession, but he never wanted to be

known as a murderer."

convicted of assassinating the Rev. Dr.

King, James Earl Ray fears that if he is

state prison recently,

Here is the story Jerry Ray told the

Post-Dispatch of how James Earl Ray

" found himself in Memphis at the time the

Rev. Dr. King was killed:

"After he escaped from the Missouri

Pénitentiary in 1967, he came to Chicago

and called me," said. Jerry Ray. "He

truck as the story goes. He climbed over

the wall on somé pipes, like he did in

"When they found he was missing,

they thought he was hiding inside the

prison as he had done on a previous

attempt. This gave him some valuable

time to walk along the railroad tracks

and get away. They put out the bread

truck story because James was working

in the bakery and they just figured that

stuff, that's a lot of bunk. He's not

violent. When he was arrested on an

armed robbery charge in St. Louis in

1959, he had a gun but didn't use it. Even

the black prisoners in Tennessee think he

trother, "he took a job as a dishwasher

Chicago and I could tell he had some-

thing good. He asked me to come to

' Chicago by-train because he wanted to

give me his car. He said I should get new

license plates because the old ones were

hot. He said he was going to take a bus

to Alabama for 'a good job.' He said

"Raoul told him. to establish residence in

Birmingham and gave him $2000 to buy a

Cat. He bought a Mustang.

- Raoul operated out of New Orleans.

From there he started sending James out

across the country and into Mexico to

deliver cars. All over — Puerta Villarta,

Acapulco, the West Coast, New Orleans.

He was getting paid $1000 or $2000 a trip.

He'figured the cars might be full of dope

but he didn't ask any questions. All he

cared about was that he had a job and

was getting paid good. It was better than

being in Jeff City, he told me. James told

me Raoul never talked politics, either."

•James Earl Ray has said that a gun he

purchased was probably the one used to

kill Dr. King. This is his brother's

asked him to buy a gun in Alabama and

bring it to Memphis. At this point James

thought Raoul might also be in the gun-

He picked it up from James at the new

James was always doing what he was

only been to Memphis once before in his

life. He kept getting lost there. He rented

the room in the name of Willard.

Jerry Ray has been employed since

The evidence supporting the conspir

y theory was considerably more com

pelling just after the break Friday

evening.

It was well known that Ray had spoken

five times.in recent weeks to investiga-

tors of the House Select Committee on

Assassinations, which is investigating

whether others were involved in the

assassination.

* Int addition, the escape itself was

ingenious, some aspects of it initially

defying explanation. How did the con-

victs construct and conceal the make-

shift ladder used to scale the wall? And

how could Ray and the others have

scaled the 14-foot prison wall, avoided

two lengths of electritied barbed wire

and jumped to the other side before ever

drawing a shot from prison guards.

Five of the seven men who tried to

escape already were in the woods put of

sight of guards when the first shots were

fired, wounding the last man trying to

escape. That man was returned to the

prison with minor wounds.

gAnd finally there was the intriguing

or relatives could have got the money to

Ray through the mail, which is uncen-

sored, or during visiting periods.

The officials note also that little else

about the prison break supports the

theory of an elaborate conspiracy, They

note that:

(1) There was nothing elaborate about

Ray's desperate J3-hour attempt to es-

cape by loot from the densely wooded

Tennessee mountains that surround the

i prison. Clever conspirators could have

extricated Ray from the woods, they say,

(2) The curlous occurences that coin-

cided with the escape, such as the loss of

telephone service in the prison town of

Petros, have been explained satisfactor

y. These occurrences fueled speculation

hat the Federal Bureau of Investigation

or the Central Intelligence Agency was

Involved in the escape, just as there nad

been suspicion that one or both of those

agencies was involved in the assassina-

tion of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King

for which Ray was in prison.

(3) Ray was not killed as supporters of

the conspiracy theory had suggested he

would be. it had been suggested that

tactic the FBI or the CIA would use:

perative explained it this way:

Immediately after the escape a huge

steam whistle at the prison sounded the

warning that there had been an escape.

A large number of the town's inhabitants

picked up their telephones to see what

had happened. The circuits were imme-

diately overloaded and the main breaker

in the telephone office opened just as a

circuit breaker opens in a house with an

overload.

The Petros office of the telephone

company is unmanned so there was a

delay while a serviceman from a nearby

town was sent. The serviceman closed

the circuit breaker but it immediately

popped again because the lines still weje

overloaded. At that the seryiceman

arbitrarily: disconnected some of u

telephones in Petros to remove the

overload. Service was restored.

Ray's brother was arrested on a phony

bank robbery charge, Gregory said,

perhaps to keep him quiet.

A young man who overheard a plot to

assassinate King a week before it hap.

pened and talked to the Justice Depart-

ment, was recently given a six-year jail

term. Gregory said a shipment of heroin

had arrived at the young man's house,

indicating somebody wanted the man

discredited and jailed.

GREGORY'S THEORY Is that agents

of the FBI, Justice Department and

possibly the CIA were involved in the

King assassination.

"They thought if King was killed, riots

and killings in 50 or 60 cities would have

resulted. In order to regain

order,

martial law would have been declared

and the Constitution could have been

suspended. Certain forces could have,

tried to overthrow the government under

the guise of protecting the people.".

Gregory believes the King killing has

connections to the assassinations of

President John F. Kennedy and Sen,

Robert F. Kennedy:

"The authorities better keep a close

Ássassinations committee |)

to check on Ray's activities

escaped until he was identified as Dr. King's assassin a

By EDWARD W. O'BRIEN

Globe Democrat Washington Bureau Chiet

WASHINGTON - The House assassinations commit-

tee plans to investigate whether anyone helped James

Earl Ray escape from Missourt State Penitentiary or

elude recapture before he killed Dr. Martin Luther King

The committee also told the House it must ascertain

the source of the money for Ray's spending from the

time of his escape from the Jetferson City prison until

his arrest in Europe 13 months later.

MYSTERY STILL engulfs several such key questions

despite previous investigations by federal, state, and

local agencies, the committee said in a 14-page report to

the House. 296204

The embattled committee; seeking & renewed. House

charter and a $2.8 million appropriation, promised a

"horough, professional investigation" of the assassina-

tins of Dr. King, the civil rights leader, in Memphis on

April 4, 1968, and of President John F. Kennedy in

Dallas on Nov. 22, 2963.

In the report summarizing its findings so far, the

committee claimed to have "new information" in both

investigations. It said it has made contact with

witnesses who were never interviewed or did not testify

previously.

In the King case, the committee recalled that Ray in

his escape from the Missouri prison on April 2u, 190%,

"allegedly concealed himself in a large bread box which

was carried onto a truck from the prison bakery and

driven out of the prison."

«THE COMMITTEE intends to investigate whether

anyone aided Ray in his escape and whether this

assistance was connected to the assassination of Dr.

King," the report went on.

"It should be noted that a fellow Missouri inmate

related that Ray allegedly said while in prison that he

would kill Dr. King 'if the price was right' and that Ray

intended to find a 'businessmen's association' which

allegedly had offered $100,000 for Dr. King's murder.

"Whether Ray ever made contact with such a group

either during or after his imprisonment in Missouri, is a

question which has never been resolved.

The committee intends to resolve it

'The committee must investigate how Ray, whe

fllegedly had made unsuccessful escape attempts in the

past, was able to escape, remain at large more that a

Year, and travel thraughout the United States and four

preign countries.

*"The committed also will investigate what officeal

actions were made to apprehend Ray from the time he

year later, and whether any official agencies deviated

from their normal practices for pursuing a fugitive."

(Indicate page, name of

newspaper, city and state.)

A RECENT JUSTICE Department task force report,

•the House committee said, "relied heavily on state.

ments by Ray's former prison cellmates (at Jefterson.

P4A, St. Louis

City) and acquaintances that he hated blacks generally,

Globe-Democrat,

Dr. King in particular, and intended to collect a bounty

St. Louis, Mo.

for killing him."

"The department report, however, fails to note that

almost every one of these statements points at the same

time to the existence of a conspiracy," the committee

said.

Another "significant" mystery, the committee said, is

the source of the money - estimated at between $5,500

and $1,500 - which Ray spent as a fugitive from the

Missouri prison.

The only known source of cash was the 9684 which Ray

earned as a dishwasher in a Chicago suburb during the

first eight weeks after his escape, the committee said.

The committee "has uncovered evidence that suggests

that Ray, between April 1967 and June 1968 "received

assistance from a person or persons presently un-

known," the House was told.

THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT report said. Ray was

helped as a fugitive by "at least one family member."

Within 15 days of the King murder, the committee

aid the FBI made un its mind that Ray was the kille

thereafter, the committee said, the FBl failed to ched

out every allegation of conspiracy "to the ultimale

degree."

said Jim Demept, a San Antonio

Gonzalez has been unavailable

Gonzalez, as pieced together by

those who know him, is a classic

tale of Capitol Hill.

Gonzalez was elected in 1961 as

a fiery Mexican-American liberal,

a crusader for human rights. But

when he got to Washington, he

never quite lived up to that poten-

Compiled From News Services

WASHINGTON, Feb. 19 — Federal Bureau of Investi-

Kelley expressed great satisfaction that a Justice

Department task force found the FBI had made a cred-

itable and thorough investigation of the King assassina-n

Ition in 1S68.

"There are portions of the report which described

a tempt to "neutralize" the, Rev. Dr. King's role as a

o/vil rights leader.

A Justice Department task force investigating the

eath of the Rev. Dr. King says evidence that Jame

Earl Ray was a lone assassin is convincing, althougl

his motive remains elusive.

In the report made public Friday, the task force

praised the Bl's original investigation of the Rev. Dr.

King's death in 1968, but said the Justice Department

failed to exercise proper supervision over the agency's

work.

The report said also that former FBI Director J.

Edgar Hoover inspired an improper and at times illegal

harassment campaign against the Rev. Dr. King in the

¡last five years of his life. But it recommended against

prosécutions in the campaign because Hoover and his

top aids are dead or retired.

Ray was acting alone on April 4, 1968 when he

gunned King down on a motel balcony in Memphis, the

report concluded. It said that FBI agents checked out -

conspiracy theories but found them groundless.

"The task force is satisfied that the FBI did a credi-

ble and thorough job in attempting to identify any possi-

ble conspiracy. In all the years following the assassina-

tion, the investigation has failed to reveal any connec-!

etion. between any alleged conspirator and James Earl

Ray..

the report said.

Imprisoned in the Missouri State prison until his

escape in 1967, Ray took part in inmate speculation

¡about a bounty on the Rev. Dr. King's head. But the

report found no evidence proving that a bounty pay-

ment was actually offered.

Meanwhile, an attorney for Ray accused the Justice

Department of attempting to whitewash the investiga-

tion. of the killing. Robert I. Livingson of Memphis,

Tenn., also charged the Justice Department with trying

to thwart a planned investigation of the assassination

by a House committee.

Livingston said he knew of two persons willing to

festily before the panel, but that they could not because

the committee was having internal problems. Robert

¡Kennedy, while serving as attorney general, failed

badly by maintaining FBI surveillance on the Rev. Dj-

King, the task force said.

The report found that during Ray's imprisonment in

Missouri he told inmates he "hated Negroes." It said he

vowed on several occasions to kill the Rev. Dr. "if the

price was right.".

Livingston said he never had placed any faith'in the

investigation.

"Since that investigation started, I felt they would

nection with the Dr. King murder. I knew they would

Much of the report focused. on Mis-

souri, through Ray as a prisoner at

Jefferson City, his movements in the

state, and family associations.

Through interviews with cellmates and

...other prisoners, the FBI pieced together

Ray's motive as hatred of blacks.

"It seems clear that Ray

openly

displayed a strong racist attitude toward

blacks," the report said.

"While in prison Ray stated he would

kilt.Dr. King if given the opportunity.

"RAY'S APPARENT hatred for the

givil rights movement, his possible

ycaring for recognition, and a desire for

a potential quick profit may have, as a

whole, provided suflcient impetus for

him to act - and to act alone.".

There were widespread rumors at the

Missouri prison that a group of business-

men had raised $100,000 to $1 million "as

a bounty on King's head," the report

said, and there were also rumors that

"Ray was' supposed to have killed three

black prisoners at the penitentiary."

A major mystery remains to this day.

Neither the FBI nor the Justice team

was able to discover the source of the

"money for Ray's extensive travel after

his prison escape; for purchases of cars,

photo equipment, and dance lessons, and

The lead was not unearthed until after

Ray's arrest, and-the FBI downgraded
