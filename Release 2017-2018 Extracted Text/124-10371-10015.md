Following are highlights of

report for

our representative who met him in Miami:

The Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo (PRP)

has ceased to exist for all practical purposes. According

to Ignacio LEDON,

responsibility for the disintegration of

the

PRP falls on its

leader Antonio SANTIAGO, whom

describes

as a "farsante."

Committee who now lives in Santo Domingo, toldl

it is impossible to organize a political movement in exile

which would be capable of influencing in any way the develop-

ment of events in Cuba. RIVADULLA now believes that there

is no alternative but to await a spontaneous change of

events in Cuba and a possible: overthrow or assassination of

Castro by the military:

attended a meeting of about 15 persons

on 16 August presided over by Rolando MASFERRER, Director

of the weekly "Libertad.". MASFERRER told the participants

that they should begin firing practice on a Florida farm to

prepare themselves for action

against Cuba before November,

because he (MASFERRER). is sure that Castro will be overthrown

by that time. MASFERRER pointed out that U.S. Security and

Intelligence Services are aware of his plans and that he has

no difficulty in their implementation.

Participants at

the meeting were then asked to contribute funds for the

purchass of weapons; the total cash raised exceeded $1,000.00.

commented that it 1s his impression that the funds

raised were intended for MASFERRER's personal use rather

than the purchase of weapons.

D.

discussed with Ramiro de LA FE the

possibility of founding a conspiratorial and secret political

movement to create a mechanism

of penetrating Cuba for the

purpose of contributing to conditions which would result in

a military coup against Castro..

The movement would be

headed "in absentia" by Ernesto de LA FE, who had been

released from prison in Cuba two months ago..

The decision

ment of Ramiro de LA FE. Present at that time,

in addition

to

rand Ramiro de TA FE, were Armando-MEDINA, Manuel

CAVEDAS and Miguel A. ZERQUEIRA (Cubans) and Juan LOPEZ

(naturalized American). The new movement was named-Movimiento

| Independente Radical de Cuba (MIRC) and Ramiro de LA FE

was named its temporary leader until such time as Ernesto

de LA FE can leave Cuba. The MIRC will

seek contact with

Cuban armed forces to launch a coup against Castro and it

will also seek contact with anti-Communist groups in Brazil

and with the government of Chile.

Ramiro de LA FE claimed

already to have contact with Patricia-BERDUGO, a Chilean

supposedly working for the Chilean Intelligence Service in

Miami. During the meeting, Armando MEDINA said that he
