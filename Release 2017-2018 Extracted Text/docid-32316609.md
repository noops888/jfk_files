Re Bureau letter to Miami with copies to Tampa,

dated 6/11/64, under the above caption.

Referenced letter referred to report of SA JOHN

H. MILLER, dated 5/22/64, at Tampa, concerning ROBERT RUTGER

BRAUER, IS - CUBA, wherein on Page Y it is indicated that

TP 139-S advised

on 4/27/64 that during the course of a

picnic on the previous day at Tampa BRAUER made the state-

ment that he bad received a letter from a Colonel MOODY in

Miami, and MOODY allegedly was involved in an invasion of

Cuba with an army of refugees in May or June (presumably

1964.).

Miami indices were found to be negative on any

Colonel MOODY identifiable with Cuban affairs at Miami.

Further, his name had not come to the attention of Agents

working Cuban matters in the Miami Office.

Inquiries made of MM 492-S, MM 635-S, MM 639-S,

MM 873-S, and PSIS JOSE T. MEDINA and ARTURO GONZALEZ

GONZALEZ resulted negatively in learning the identity of

Colonel MOODY.

On July 16, 1964, GERALD PATRICK|HEMMING, 1036

Miami, Florida, a U. S. citizen who

Southwest 5th Street Cuban revolutionary activities since

has been involved in

1959, stated that he had no personal knowledge of a Colonel

of "The Miami Herald," at/Miami, Elorida.

HEMMING stated

that he had no knowledge of MOODY's being involved in

Cuban exile activity at Miami.
