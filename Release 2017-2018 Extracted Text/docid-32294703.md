Re Havana letter dated April 10, 1959.

Concerning FIDEL CASTRO's proposed trip to the United

States, the Embassy has been unable to obtain from the Cuban Foreign

Office a list of individuals who will accompany CASTRO and his com-

plete itinerary.

This office through Embassy sources has been able

to identify the

following persons as some of those who will accompany

CASTRO. This, however, is by no means a complete list as it is

reported that approximately 90 persons will be with CASTRO on his

trip which will be taken via a chartered Cubana "Britannia" airliner.

In addition to PAZOS, BOTTI and LOPEZ, mentioned in relet, the

following will also accompany CASTRO:
