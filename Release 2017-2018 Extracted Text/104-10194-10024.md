Mr. Hunt's quarters allowance is $2,900.

Using

at the Station, the following would be

the figures:

$2,900 + 60% ($1,710) = $4,610

On & 50/50 percent

sharing basis

of the 60 percent, he

would be out-of-pocket $870 if his costs were $4, 610.

On a 75/25 percent sharing basis of the 60 percent, he

would be out-of-pocket $135, 11 his costs were $4, 640.

I would recommend he be authorized the 75/25 per

but not to exceed, 60 percent above his quarters allowance.
