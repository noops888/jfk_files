kotors and other equigment through lundlach. Under the peculiarities.

of Polivian law, It 1a extremely doubtful that theao persons will

be able to recover anything from the Ourdluch firm If they attenpt

to bring suit againat him In Bollyla for the return of funds turned

over to him,

since the allegation of "force majeure" is one which

19 usually accouted by the Bolivian courte.

LIt occurs to the Logation that, la fairness to these persons

who mude their ordora before the inauance of the 21, It might be

posalble to consider the unfreezing of Gundluch fundo representing

opinior that adequate aareguards should be taken.

showing clippings of articles very hostile and even of a calumnious

nature against me that had appeared during the last. five years in said

retaliate, and emphasized the fact that it has bare coincidence

that "La Razon" was a pro-British newspaper, and that if it had been

pro-German my position would have been exactly; the same, l.e., refusing

to have any kind of business relations with 1t.

me every opportunity wherever the case arose to defond myself and
