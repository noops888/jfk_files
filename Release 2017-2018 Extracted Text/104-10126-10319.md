10. (Internal Use Only - CM) LIAISON I advised Terry Lytle,

Chairman Edward M. Kennedy's (D. , Mass.) Senate Judiciary Subcommittee

on Antitrust and Monopoly staff, that we would not be able to declassify

an iter on Japanese government relations with Japanese big business,

which the news media has mentioned. Lytle understood the problem,

though he lamented it and thought it might be a good idea to get a clearance

for himself:

11. (Internal Use Only - CM) LIAISON I left word for Jim

Humphreys, of the staff of Senator Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), to call

me.

The subject is an earlier query from Humphreys about declassification

programs going on in the Agency now.

12. (Unclassified - MG) LIAISON Sent via courier to Senator

Henry M. Jackson (D., Wash.) a note from the Director which forwarded

a copy of the Director's statement on the personnel reductions in the DDO.

13. (Unclassified - RSG) LIAISON Took a call from Mickey

Goldsmith, House Select Committee on Assassinations staff, who

indicated he was scheduled to attend a briefing at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, 28

December, in the C&R Conference Room on the structure of CIA.

Mr. Goldsmith suggested the briefing be postponed until Thursday,

5 January, at the same time. I told him I would get back to him with

confirmation, which I did.
