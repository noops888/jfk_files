NOTE:

During the recent past information was developed

Irom NY 3461-C-TE that there is a 6th "family" in La Cosa

Nostra in the New York area. According to this source, this

additional "family" operates exclusively in New Jersey and is

a small and very tightly knit group.

Newark and New York were

instructed to discreetly attempt to

enlarge on this information

and Delmore was cited as an important La Cosa Nostra leader

who might well figure in the operations of such an additional

group, inasmuch as to date we have not been able to align him

solidly with any of New York's five "families," or with the

New Jersey.

ReNKtel

on DeCarlo concerns a discussion in which it is stated that

Delmore's death now makes Sam DeCavalcante,

La Cosa Nostra member

from Trenton, New Jersey, "boss." It was indicated that Delmore

had made DeCavalcante "underboss" prior to his death. DeCavalcante

himself participated in this discussion and acknowledge that he

i had been made "underboss."
