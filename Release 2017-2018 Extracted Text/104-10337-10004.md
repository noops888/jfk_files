SUBJECT:

Executive Director

Director, Center for the Study of

Intelligence

John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

Appointment of Directorate Focal Points

for JFK Assassination Board Requests (AIUO)

1. Action Requested: It is recommended that you request

the Directorates to appoint focal point officers for purposes of

responding to requests from the (President Kennedy) Assassination

Records Review Board. (AIUO)

2.

Background: President Clinton appointed the Board to

oversee the release of records related to both the assassination

of President Kennedy and the investigations into the assassination.

The Board has forwarded to us the first (attached) of what are

likely to be many requests for additional information from CIA

records.

The Board will not complete its work until late 1997

at the earliest. (AIUO)

The Historical Review Group (HRG) has reviewed more than

400,000

pages of JFK-related records, most of which were contained

in the

"sequestered records" that were collected for the House

Assassination Committee's investigation and in the Oswald 201 file.

Up to now, no new searches have been required. Now that the Board

has begun to generate requests for additional information, the

Agency needs to create a mechanism for processing the requests and

for tasking components to conduct records searches. (AIUO)

3. Recommendation: That you request each Directorate to

appoint a focal point to work with HRG as the principal liaison

with the Board, and that you name someone to perform the same

Attached is a proposed memorandum

for your signature.

the ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act. We will be numbering these requests,

hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn if our requests are insufficiently clear or if

they are unduly burdensome.

relationships of the entities identified below have changed over time. We have listed some
