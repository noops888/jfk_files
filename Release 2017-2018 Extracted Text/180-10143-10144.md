SUMMARY OF FILE REVIEW CONDICTED AT CIA HEADQUARTERS ON 31 OCTOBER 1978.

Response dated 20 August 1978.

"SUBJECT: Response to HSCA Request of 25 July 1978.

1. A thorough review of Agency files containing production from the LILYRIC a

photographic surveillance operation in Mexico City reveals the existence of

nd LILYRIC]logs or production earlier than 3 April 1967.

It appears that

earlier photographs may have been destroyed in a purge of Mexico City Station

files and that the folders for the destroyed material were re-used to

forward more recent photographic material to Headquarters for retention.

2. According to a blind memorandum dated 2 May 1977, subject: Review of

Mexico City Station Files at thel

Records Center, the[LILYRIC

folder which would have contained photographs and logs for the period

23 July through 30 November 1963 had been re-used to store ICALLA photo-

graphs and logs for the period 2 May through 30 June 1967.

memorandum dated 5 May 1977, subject: Photograph Records of the "uniden-

tified Man" who Was in Mexico City during October 1963.)

3. The above information is contained in a soft file entitled: Photograph of

Unidentified Individual in Mexico City. This folder has been reviewed by

the following HSCA staff members:

• 13 March 1978 - Dan Hardway

10 April 1978 - Michael Goldsmith

• Rober Genzman

4 May 1978 - Edwin Lopez.

Review of Soviet Logs: from Log Film 143.

The coverage for 27 September is given as 900 to 1900 but the last sequence of

photographs was taken at 1146.

This does not appear to be too unusual.

on 9/25 the coverage is the same

and the last photos taken at 1137. See following chart.

Barbara gave me a copy of a file entitled "Response to HSCA -28.07.78

Item '5 (Delimitations Agreement)" as a response to request of 7/20/78

for FBI-CIA agreements regarding Mexico.

from|KUFACTOR/KOLITERAL]file

see attatched chart.

Reply to 7/20 request regarding CIA-FBI coordination:

31 July 1978

Memo for Breckinridge

from Shepanek

1. The answer to paragraph 2 of reference is that there are not now, nor

were there any, agreements between the CIA and FBI or other U.S. govern-

ment agencies concerning CIA responsibility to report on contacts fo

U.S. citizens with Communist Embassies or officials. Such reporting would

be expressly forbidden by current legislation.

2: The CIA under operative legislation has a counterintelligence respon-

sibility for counterintelligence cases but this is not a matter of

agreement with other agencies nor does it concern simpl contacts of

Americans abroad with Communist Embassies or officials.

"FI/OPS recommends strongly that the photo coverage be reviewed from the

standpoint of value and usefulness with a view to determinging whether

the LILYRIC activity could not be safely eliminated and the additional

photographic coverage conducted on a more selective basis, without materially

affecting overall usefulness."

C HMMA $14793, 4/8/60 says in para 3:

"WhiletHMMAJ4093 (not located) correctly referred to LIMITED,LILYRIC and

CLICALLAjas 'photographi basehouses,' the Station would like to emphasize

that photographic coverage is only one of their functions (please see

[HMMA312095, 4 February 1959)[ LIMITED]is used as a radio dispatch base for

automobile surveillance teams in addition to physical surveillance of

persons entering the front gate.

Their photography is negligible compared

to their other duties. The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of

persons visiting the front gate, perhaps because the vantage point for

taking the pictures is from the second floor and above the street traffic

which partially blocks LIMITED photographs. ( LILYRIC)also does individual

reports on LIMERICK personnel entering and leaving the main gate. ."

Ref:L HMMWJ8515--not located.

( HMMA323343, 4/30/64, says, in para. 2:

REF BIS A -14793

"The Station feels that it would be helpful to summarize at this time

information previously reported to Headquarters (see paragraph 3, reference

B) concerning the photo basehouses under this project and thereby give

Headquarters an updated frame of reference in which to view the roles of the

various basehouses.

Thi LIMITED and LILYRIC BASEHOUSES provide coverage of front of the

[LIMERICKJinstalllation. Although on the surface it may appear that these

two basehouses. provide duplicate take, this is not the case.

It has been the

Station's experience in running the unilateral LIEMPTY operation that a 0900

to evening workday.

which would be required of a single basehouse in order to

cover theL LIMERICK}target effectively, is just too long for any pair of

agents to remain effective. This is especially true when it is considered

that these basehouse operators are essentially unsupervised during their

workday.

It would also be impossible for a single base-house to provide

the kind of coverage the station needs on the target installation,

especially during the peak hours of activity, namely late morning and early

afternoon. For these reasons, theCLILYRIC basehouse generally operates

trom 0900 to 1400 or 1500 weekdays. LLIMITEDJoperates from 1200 to 1800

dark (as the daily situation dictates) on weekdays, and 0900 to 1400 on 90r

Saturdays. (These hours are subject to change to fit Station néeds.)

Special coverage for Sunday is arranged on a need basis; however, past

experience has shown regular coverage of Saturday afternoons and

Sundays

is not rewarding. This schedule provides for both basehouses to be in

action during the peak activity hours of the LIMERICKtarget.

Although even

this arrangement is not completely airtight, anything less than this would

present unacceptable gaps in the coverage.

It must also be considered that

without two basehouses covering the front of the target installation, any

illness, personal problem or vacation for operators of one basehouse

would terminate Station coverage.... It is the Station's opinion that as

long as theELIMERICKJInstallation

is a prime target of the Station, it will

be necessary to maintain the present three basehouses.

To eliminate any one

of the thee would create a gap in the Station's coverage that would not be

compatible with the emphasis placed on this target.
