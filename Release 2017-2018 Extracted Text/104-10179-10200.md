DATE

:11 March 1961, 1830-2100 houre

PI.ACE : Duke Zelbert's Restaurant

PRESINT

Subject and

lat Ereitheir

1. I acheduled this meetini for the nole purpose of continuing

my quler development of Subject begun in November 1963. The enter

prise was undertaken on a non-specific baals juat to keep in touch with

Subject because of blo relatively pre-eminent position in the exile

community. Before the Instant weeting I had had brief discussiona

with bolken and Anderson, obtainini their concurrence it uy id

that Subject could ponieday be a valuable source of insighta into the

operatione level off

ClI had actually intended at thie meeting to

concentrate on subject'e function in the Plut found that the

diocusnion directed deself almost exclusively to the affairs of AMBANG-I.

Thin face was the direct and accldental result of my opening gambit to

the effect of 'i'bat's new?" in answer to which Subjeck complained that

since our last meetlag in January, Latin America seemed to be on tbe

way to holl in a handcart and about the only two people who seemed to

be doing anything about it wore AMBANG and former Venenuelan

president Balancourt. I ahan't attempt to reproduce the too boure of

feneral conversation but do feel that the Importance of AMBANG

coupled with the nature of Subject's views on him warrant a statement

of what these views are.

2. Subject han known AMBANG for several years and has

admired him through all the varioun seasons of their relationsb'p.

Subject wa» first impresaed with AMBANCe organisine talente at the

aware of thens. These too inciora, the organlaina lalent and le

demonatrable engineering abill are apparently wedded to a firi.

judiclous personality with the senull thas AMMAiC, is an effective and

appealing person lo Cutan exles of various stripe. Througtout the

eveniny Subject reiterated tio conviction that of ail exile leadere who

kare emorged since the take-over al Cuba by Cartro, AA:RANG alone

has the ability and llo profile to pur lugetter and lead a succesíul

resintance enterpriae.

3.

Subject stressed repeatedly his conviction til whoever le to

attempt to cause a serious crack in the ever-thierenin; ring of defenses

on the deland must have the kind of name which will conjure à positive

Image in the imagination of the average Cuban.

This person must mean

something, not only interme of past alfillatione and present malitary

strength but in terma of the immediate and not no inimediate futuro, to"

those persons who, though not committed to the Castro revolution, have

either benefitted alightly or are bo und to ll by virtue of their juos.

subject in certain these persone would not consider AMBANt to be a

menace.

Subject claimed that he is not working with or for AWBANG

mad asserted that he had not conversed ol corresponded with him for

over half a year. Il Indeed Subject was leading me on, attemptiaz to

Bell AMBANG to me, he did so with a subtlety to which i am definitely

nol accuotomed. He expressed os more than one occasion a fear that

AMBANG might, In his real to get something moving, cominit himaelf

Do such a tight timing lhas he would be forced to undertate action at a

moment which was acually diadvantageous to limbell. He stressed

that even AMBANG's capital on the island is limited and that whatever

movement in made to cah la on thie capital must be calculated to save .

Rhe greatest poonible effect.
