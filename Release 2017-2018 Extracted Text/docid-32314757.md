February 12, 1964

Due to the sensitive nature of this Informant,

care should be utilized in thedissemination of this

information.

DE 919-C* advised on December 13, 1963, that

VITO GIACAIONS had been in contact with JOHN SARRA, at

which time GIACALONE stated that he had loaned some money,

approximately $000.00g

to SPIRO (KOPATOS), and that when

he could not pay all the money back, he had left town,

and stated that he could not come back into town until

BILLY GIACALONE told him to.

However, GIACALONE did not

tell SPIRO to leave and SPIRO agreed with him about this,

however, he had been spreading this information about town.

According to the Infornant, this individual

was interviewed by Agents of the FBI

at which time they

asked him about the shylocking business of JOHN SERRA;

however, SPIRO indicated that he did not know SERRA and

had no connection with him.

He stated that the only person

that he owed was GUS at the Grecian Gardens and he owed him

$100.00. SPIRO also, according to the Informant, had told

BILLY GIACALONS that

the FBI was out to get JOHN SERRA.

According to the Informant, VITO GIACALONE told

SERRA that he is being watched and investigatedn and that

he and AYTHONY ZERILLI wanted to make sure that he was not

the arm on anyone and grabbing anyone and hurting them in

order to collect money that is owed them.
