advised that HERBERT BORODKIN has a son, AL, who was the owner

of a TV or movie production company and sometime within thepast

year he sold out to a major production company; that in May,

1963, HERBERT BORODKIN purchased 300 shares of stock in the

Peel-Elder Company and told SCANLIN that his son, AL, had

purchased 10,000 shares of this same stock, and AL was with a

group that included ROCKY MARCIANO, former heavyweight boxer.

Peel-Elder Company is a Canadian corporation whose main interests,

are gold mines and building developments.

According to LA 4268-C, AL BORODKIN was associated

with the Harwyn Publishing Company.

the wall Street Journal, issue of 2/5/62, sets forth that
