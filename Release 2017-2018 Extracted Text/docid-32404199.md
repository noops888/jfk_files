CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

/ 2009

MEMORANDUM FOR:

CSI-0028/95.

30 May 1995

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Fred Wickham

DO Focal Point for

JFK Records Review

John F. Pereira

Chief, Historical Review

Group

Request from the

Assassination

Review Board (ARRB)

1. The ARRB has requested that we determine if the

names in the two attached documents (MEXI 7051 and 7045) are

releasable.

2. The attached Kostikov document (MEXI 7051) was the

subject of discussion at the 18 May meeting of HRG and DO

representatives with the ARRB to discuss Mexico City JFK

review issues.

The document has been "Denied in Full" in

the original

review. MEXI 7045 is a similar document which

was

also denied.

3. The consensus of the Do representatives at the

meeting was that the Kostikov document could be released in

sanitized form.

However, the names in the documents would

have to be checked for operational interest.

4.

These documents are part of the materials being

prepared by the ARRB staff for an upcoming meeting of the

Board on 7 June. At that meeting the Board members will be

reviewing the documents that were subject to discussion at

the 18 May meeting plus additional documents

that the ARRB

staff select as important to the "Mexico City" story.

5. Please provide a response by 2 June.

John F.

Pereira
