a. When the assault forces have been committed to the

Cuban oper? tion,

the strategic Army forces in CONUS wouli

be short the supporting forces for the remaining five divi-

sions.

It 1s estimates that the ry Airborne tia isvision

force foulci be avallable for other operations 15-30 days af-

ter with:raal from Cuba.

Substantial Army forces

from the on-call echelon will relieve the assault forces

and remain on the islans to perform counterguerrilla opera-

tions and conjuct military government activities. This force

will be progressively ithdrawn as the new Cuban government

increases in effectiveness.

(less that deployed with the Sixth Fleet) will be engaged

fully during the initial phase

of the operation. There may

be a requirement for amphibious lift. for rapis redeployment

and counterguerrilla activity until order has been restored.

It is anticipated that most of these ships will be available

for other commitments within approximately 30-45 days. About

40 to 50 per cent of the Pacific amphibious troop lift capa-

bility will be employed in the landings in the eastern end of

Cuba. These ships would be available for other operations in

the Pacifid about 15 days after the withdrawal of the Pacifle

Marines from' Cuba

"In addition to the amphibious troop lift

capability the initial requirements for sealift will include

MSTS ships obtained through the Maritime Administration.
