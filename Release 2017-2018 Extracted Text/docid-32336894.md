"First Step: Take Possession of 'Santa-Maria'

"A scheme was then conceived whose first step

consisted ai taking possession of the Portuguese

santa-Maria."

The latter, once in the

hands of tarilt, was to disembark

its passengers

in Cuba and embark the commandos onto it.

"Thereupon, the steamer was to head for Angola

and conquer this territory. Parallel with this,

instructions were to be given to guerrillas in

Spain to organize a general uprising there.

"A Double Agent

Span

2777700

"In the meantime, MENOYO revealed himself to

be aldouble agent.

on the wayback to cuba, he

contacted, in Madrid, OIIA SKORZENt, the man who

had liberated MUSSOLINI.

No precise details, how-

evere are furnished about this encounter.

"Once in Cuba, MENOYO would wait

for the first

part of the plan,

the seizure of the

¡Santa-Maria,'

to be realized before fleeing to the United States

with nineteen of his companions on board three ship's

boats.: We presume that he was eager to inform the

American authorities as to the position of the steamer

which he, knew and which permitted American authorities

to findpit again.

"Treason

"Leaders of drill' in Havana hastened to

cable tô Captain 'GALVAO, ' informing him of MENOYO's

treason. Simultaneously, orders were issued to the

Spanish guerrillas to abandon their insurrection

plans.

" 'Bohemia, ' which published photocopies of

telegrams, adds that MENOYO and his companions

now interned by American immigration authorities

de State of Texas where an investigation of this

lous laffair is being conducted. -- A.P.P."
