The meeting, held at ALBERT

CROYCOS' home, was a reorganization meeting. The American GI

Forum Dallas

Chapter had not held any meetings regularly for

quite sometime.

Nine persons attended this meeting. The dues

which were $5.00 per annum are now $2.50, informant said.

The dues' reduction, it 1s

hoped, will encourage more people to Join.

The initiation fee

remains 50g. The chapter will have a stand at Pikes Park during

the Cinco de Mayo Mexican Independence Day.

Informant determined that at this meeting, Crystal

City was briefly discussed. Most of the members had vaguely

heard of that city's electione (CIty Council and School Board

elections).

Informant had no additional information.
