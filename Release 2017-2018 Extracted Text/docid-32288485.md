It would be easier to put your line on

one of the other floors and rent an office

on that floor.

They can rent an office in this

building and then where your line runs through

the junction box there they tie a six inch

piece of wire from your cable to their extra

house cable. And that comes right into the

jack like a phone.

So if we find that extra

wire, a six inch wire, from one of these

boxes, then automatically we'll know that's the

floor that their tap is on. So then what we'll

do is put a buzzer on them until the phone

former manner.

It is felt that this situation has in no way hindered

the effectiveness of CG 6576-C#.

It is pointed out that

should MARCY continue to feel that his line is tapped by the

FBI that he will merely refrain from the use of the phone

call for pertinent conversations.

It is felt that this will

work to the advantage of the Chicago Division in that he will

have some of the individuals with whom he would have formerly

conversed on the phone come to his office to discuss their

business. It is pointed out that a very small amount of
