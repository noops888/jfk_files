explaired in substance the Kelly case as follows:

Kelly, (whose real nane is Dimitror), is a 29-year-old Bulgarian and

was the head of a snall political party based in Greece and ostensivaly

working for Bulgarian independence.

kelly was described by

as being young, ambitious, bright (elementary college education), a

sort al a lala horge" typs but a typical Balkan poltician. de-

and as a "protaction", he was placed in custody of the Greek Police

who threw kelly into a Greek prison. Kelly was held in the Greek pri

son for six months until the Greek authorities decided that Kelly was

a nuisance and they tald our people to take him back. Since ou

people vere unable to dispose of Kelly In Greace, they flew hia to

Panama where, through arrangement, he was placed in a U.S. Military

Hospital as a psychopathic patient. Kelly now has been in the U.S..

military hospital for several months and the hospital authorities now

other patients, ete. Kelly is not a psychopathic personality.

explained that they can dispose of Kelly by the simole

process of sending him to a friend of his in Caracas, Venezuela, and

as far as they are concerned, that type of disposal is perfectly ok.

However, because of his confisement in a Greek prison and his stay in

a military hospital, Kelly has become very hostile toward the United

States and our intelligence operations in particular.

Hence, OPC is

•considering an "Artichoke" approach to Kelly to see if it would be

possible to re-orient kelly favorably toward is. This operation, which

will necessarily lavolve the use of drags is being considered by OPC

with a possibllity that Dr

It was agreed between

Comment:

This particular operation was mentioned in general tezms to the

writer by Mr.

approximately thirty days ago on an 1n-

formal basis but no significant details were given at this time.

While the technique that

are considering for use

In this case is not known to the writer,

, the writer beliaves the approach

will be made through tha standard narco-hypnosis techniqua. Re-conditioning

and re orienting an individual, in such a matter, in the opinion of the

writer, cannot be accomplished easily and will require a great deal of

time and the t fact that an interprater is necessary in the case con

plicates it considerably more. It is also believed that with our present i

knowledge, we would have no absolute guarantee that the subject in this

case would maintain a positive friendly attitude toward us even though

there is apparently a successful response to the treatment. The walter

did not suggest to

that perhaps a total amnesia could be created

by a series of electro shocks, but merely indicated that annesias under

drugs treatments were not certain.
