For your information,

Mchair, Sy., is an accountant in a

Miami law firm in which Senator George Smathers of Florida

is an inactive member.

On the night of March 21, 1961, another source,

who has furnished reliable information in the past, reported

that Orlando Bosch, who is a civillan delegate of the

Moviniento Insurrecional de Recuperacion Revolucionaria

in Miami, learned of the seizure by Cuban authoritles of

this group in Cuba.

He identified Marciano Belo, also

known as Guajira; as being among this group.

Bosch confided

the group had been taken by the boat

"Jolly

Roger" to a

point off the coast at Cabanas, Pinar del Rio Province,

where they were transported by skiff to the shore at which

point they were apparently apprehended.

On March 22, 1961, Inspector Willis Smithson

of the United States Border Patrol, Miami, advised that on

March Il, 1961, the "Jolly Roger"

was reported in the

Florida Keys, with Angus K. McNair, Jr., and eight unnamed

reported in the key West, Florida,

area with Elidio C. Surg

"Jolly Roger" arrived at the Lower latacombe Key near Key West

and as of March 22, 1961, it was at this location having

Loaded eight 55-gallon fuel drums on board.

Captain

Enrique Rodriguez Ibanez of the "Jolly Roger" has been

ordered to report to the Immigration and Naturalization

Service at Miant.

On March 21, 1961, the Central Intelligence Agency

advised the captured

group could possibly be an independent

operation of the Frente Revolucionario Democratico, an

anti-Castro unity organization, but that Central Intelligence

Agency had no operational interest in this matter and it

in possession of no knowledge regarding the "Mercury,"

For your additional information, the first source

mentioned in this letter advised that Gilberto Betancourt
