FBI teletype.

=) nature and extent of CIA intorest in the

After consultation with Mr. Jacob Esterline, DC/WH,

Mr®

SOD, and Mr. Lawrence Houston, OGC, the following

reply was

given Mr. Papich:

1.

Tra

"Birminghan widows".

No Individual bearing

the name of Gordon NOVEL had any connection with

Double-chek nor with CIA.

Mr. Lawrence Houston is in constant touch

with the Doputy Assistant Attorney General

Nathaniel Cossack, on this matter, and will

tell him about present developments.

Mr. liouston comments that anyone could

have prepared the letter but it really does

sound like NOVEL's cock-eyed approach rather

NOVEL might have written it. This will probably

make anothor headline for Garrison but we

don't feel it could do the Agency much damage".

On the question of the alleged gunshot fired at NOVEL,

Mr. Papich advised that the FBI is not investigating the matter.

It has not been confirmed as yet that anyone did shoot at NOVEL.
