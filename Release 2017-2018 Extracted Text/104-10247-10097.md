The primary reason for again neeting AMLAS7-1

Havana.

vrozco's capture, 11 he has been captured, presents an

Indirect threat to the security of AYLASH-1 and a more

direct threat to the socurity of ANTRUNK-10 since OrOZCO

in Jan 1964 exfiltrated through the rat line established

by AMICE-14 (Miguelito).

Upon his return to Cuba,

AMLASE-I will check the above with ANTRUNK-10; and, 11

orozco is under the control of the security service, will

decide and communicate with Miami whethor AMLASH-1 and

AMTRUNK-10 bellove it necessary to exfiltrate ANTRUNk-10.

AMLASH-l was briefed to send a letter to UNNATU-g to

ndicate whether Orozco has been arrested or whether he i

still in hiding.

Is the letter to UNSNArUg mentions

that Orozco has been arrested.

Gastro enteritis, water pollution and unsanitary

conditlons.

AMLASI-1 statos there are no real problems,

although the scarcity and lack of a balanced diet do

cause some problems.

The purification of gater has been

a problen which probably has been the cause of some of the

sickness in the country.

AMLASH-I did not believe that Aragones had invited

him to fly back to Havana with him in order to got him

Jack bacause of any serious security matter. AllAS!

ild state that Aragones was concerned that AMASH-I may nol

return to

Cuba.

Since Aragones cleared AMLASH! for hie

trip abroad, he is in a way responsible that AMLASH-I does

not defect

and returna to Cuba.

ANLASH-1 feels Aragones

does not want any problems with

Fidel in case AHLASH I

decides to stay out.

AMLASI-I was unable to provide any information on

the political developments in Cuba in mid-November and

December since he had been out of the country since early

Faure Chomon has been accused of organizing former

according to AMLASH-1, this probably based on the fact that

Chomon always gives jobs in the ministry be heads to DR

Because of this Chomon today controls to a large

degree
