Subsequently, PCI. contacted an acquaintance,

DAVID/SAX, of Chicago, owner or former owner of Saxony Hotel,

Miami,

of puncha, and now a banker in chicago, formerly a manufacturer

He told him of the article and asked

how GIANCANA could be approached.

SAX told the PCI he

knew one of GIANCANA's close business associates and could

arrange a contact.v

Some time later, PCI received telephone call from

one DAVE (LNU) and TEDDY (LNU), who claimed to be GIANCANA's

business associates and desired a meeting to discuss the

matter.U

PCI met DAVE and TEDDY in Miami, Fla., and they

seemed to know considerable about his financial standing,

the fact that his resources were committed and that the

brother of PCI was principal controller of their business

interests. U

At first, DAVE and TEDDY wanted to know something

of PCI's connections to assure themselves he could get

gambling concessions in Puerto Rico and/or another Caribbean

area..

In the presence of DAVE and TEDDY, PCI called

L. 0. PENDLING, a Negro attorney and member of Parliament,

Nassau, Bahamas, with whom PCI had had prior business

associations and made appointment to meet PENDLING in

washington, D.C., in late August, 1903.

PENDLING was unable

to keep the appointment since the March on Washington made

impossible to get hotel reservations. U

On or about 10-19-63 PCI met TEDDY and DAVE at

The Americana Hotel, New York City.

and TEDDY began talking about

"protectionthis meeting, DavE

and ability of GIANCANA

Syndicate to furnish slot machines for gambling operation.

With this turn in the negotiations, based on PCI's original

understanding that GIANCANA desired to invest money, he

insisted on seeing GIANCANA. DAVE and TEDDY gave him no

encouragement along this line and told PCI it was not

necessary to contact them,

but they would contact him

always from a pay phone from wherever they were calling. u
