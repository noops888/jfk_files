at

and both took the

and

were taken before

U. S. District Judge DAVID DYER, where a Special Assistant

attached to the Department of Justice asked that they be

cited for contempt for refusal to answer any questions for

the jury. Judge DYER allegedly ordered the two men to

answer three specific questions for the Grand Jury, namely

where they were born, when they were born and whether they

were citizens of the

United States.

RALPH GEORGE SHEA on 1/23/63, was observed using

a telephone outside Hialean Race Track and was in contact

with another individual driving a dark Oldsmobile bearing

1963 Massachusetts license Pll-G56, who also utilized the

telephone after SHEA departed. SHEA and this individual

were observed to contact with some colored men near the

telephone and the possibility exists that they were obtaining

race results as result of "walk offs" by these colored men.

PCI, on 1/14/63, advised that while

negotiating for the sale of slot machines to HAROLD DERBER.

for use aboard the "Empress of Bahamas" (Miami FTle 45-969)

he heard the rumor that MORRIS LANSBURG, owner of the Deau-

ville and other hotels on Miami Beach and the Flamingo Hotel

and Casino in Las Vegas, had originally been one of the

"Empress of Bahamas." LANSBURG

reportedly invested $125,000 in this venture, taking a first

or second mortgage on a piece of property in Maryland, which

was then owned by HAROLD DERBER and RAY ADIEL.

Since

the Hit.

"Empress of Bahamas" organization went broke and lost the

charter for their vessel, LANSBURG has instituted legal pro-

ceedings to foreclose on this property.
