Connection with the Agency

Memorandum of Conversation, Dan

-Rather/Les Midgley and the

DCI,

Dated 6 September 1975

B::00

fs6 191

The referent memorandum contains two points

which require comments.

The first point concerns

allegations that were made shortly after the assassination

of President Kennedy and that have crept up every so often

since then.

The allegations are totalfy wtfounded.

2. The facts regarding this matter are as follows:

Noyember 1963 I was instructed by

• Mr. R.G. Roccas

my immediate superior at that time, to

make a thorough

check Within the Agency at Headquarters

o determine whethen tee Harvey OSWALD had ever beer

used by the

Agencyfor been connected with it in ans

conceivable way.

He ordered me to make the checks

directly and personally to the degree possible and not

to accept statements of intermediaries.

plained that he was following instructions from Mr. R.

Helms, who was then the DDP and served as one of the

Agency's key contact officials with the warren

Commission.

b. Although I had already checked: the Main Index

of IP (then RID) on the night of the assassination, I

rechecked the Main Index and found no record beyond

that which I had already obtained before (plus: those

items which had been integrated into the records system

since the assassination).

There was nothing in the DO

records which indicated any Agency connection with

specifying allÜthe checks I had made and stating

that the results, showed that Lee Harvey OSWALD

had never had any

connection whatsoever with the

Agency. Eventually a statement to this effect

was comunicated to the Warren Commission.

Similar

checks regarding use or employment

Of OSKAID Kad been requested by the foreign divisions

of their appropriate stations, I was told, and the

results were negative.

I recall very clearly that we

were extremely

concerned at the time that OSWALD, as an American returning

from the USSR, might have been routinely debriefed by

DCD, thus having established contact with the Agendy.

The same point has now, quite understandably been made

by the two CBS newsmen.

Having some knowledge of this

subject I have personally concluded that there is valid

reason for DCD'g lack of interest in OSWALD at that time.

He would surely have been contacted and debriefed by DCD

had he been to the USSR and returned to the US before

1957/1958.

Travel to the Soviet Union by Westerners,

particularly by Americans, before that

of that decade there were so many persons travelling to

should be added that my above-described

search in the Agency file holding produced no record or

indication that any other US Government agency had used

him as a source or had considered him for recruitment.

I just want to be sure that you are satisfied that this Agency

is giving you all the help that we possibly can in connection

with your investigation of the situation, in Dallas. I know

the importance the President places on this investigation

you are making. He asked me personally whether CLA was

giving you full support. I said that they were, but I just

wanted to be sure from you that you felt so.

We have had the very best support that we could possibly

expect from you.

Good. Well you can call on us for anything we have.

We will feel free to do that

I think it is an exceedingly important investigation and report

and 1 am delighted that the President has called on you to

make it.

We are trying to do it as fast as we can so we can dispel various

wild rumors that have been circulating as to whether this man

was the right man etc. that fired the gun. But there is no question

that he is the right man.

There are a lot of aspects that we have

dug up, for instance, with regards to the matter in Mexico City.

We have now found that the: photograph that was ta en was not

that of Oswald.

We do find from our informant dom there that

Oswald did call at the Embassy that day and the informant has

given us the conversation that he had.

He wanted to get a permit

to go back to Russia and the Cuban Embassy couldn't give him

the permit. The Soviet Embassy stated that it waild take three

weeks.

He had, I think, a visitor's permit for about a week or

ten days so that is why he came back to the United States.

Well, all of that ties in importantly into the story and we have

those operational sources down there.

We want to handle them

very carefully. It involves some very high level people down

there. Sam Papich and I have talked about that a couple of times.

who is handling it for the Department

it is our intention when the Bureau finishes the report, he will

of course go over it very carefully because it will be a report

checked with each of the Government agencies that are mentioned

in it.

State Department is involved in regard to the issuing of

the passport to the man to come back to this country and that

has got to be explained why it was done, the law requires it, etc.

all of which of course we are gathering.

The aspects of the

Mexico City thing. It will have to be mentioned.

It is his

intention to check with the agencies, Secret Service, etc. to be

sure that whatever is said in the report is conferred in and it

is agreed to by the various agencies mentioned.

So you will

have that opportunity to go over it and see exactly what is said

and I know he will welcome any suggestion that you care to make.

Well that will be fine. Thank you

Good bye.

that the Director has received a telephone call from RANKIN

The DDP wishes to have from you a

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basit issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life.

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

I raised with Mi. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH/source. I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director' appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction of made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

The DiP state &that he would

Given the schedule, you will

ate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

advised that the Bureau was

Johnson to look into this case, for copies of Bureau materials

supporting or complementing the report already subnitted.

He pro-

vided me with the attached copy of portions of a report passed by

the Legal Attache 1a Mexico CIty dealing with the Sylvia DURAN

aspect in which it would appear rather clear that

some United States

Government agency was tapping telephones in Mexico. Mr. Papich

Inquired as to whether information in this report might be given

to the Commission or whether this Agency desired to establish some

other policy with regard to meeting the needs of the Commission.

The matter was discussed with Mr. Whitten and he subsequently ad

vised that as a result of a conference with Mr. Helms and others

In which he was directed to prepare certain materials to be passed

to the Commission, he was quite sure that it was not the desire of

the Agency to make

available to the Commission at least in this

manner - via the FBI - sensitive information which could relate to

telephone taps.

Mr. Papich again raised the question on 19

December and after

consultation with Mr. Angleton and Mr.

At was agreed with

Mr. Papich that when the Bureau is fac

Also, 1f possible, the FBI should de ermine 1f it was common

practice to stay open later than the normal hours or be open

Once again we asked Anderson to review the Gutierrez

Investigation, which he did. We asked if there were any reports

either being prepared or that had already been sent to

Washington on this matter which we had not yet received. We

were told that there were not. The status of the Cutlerrez

Investigation Is therefore that the surveillance of the Cuban

Embassy will continue Indefinitely in an attempt to pick up the

2. My conclusion is that Oswald visited the Cuban

This seems so because:

a. There is no evidence whatever that he was at the

Cuban Consulate at any time on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday or

Wednesday.

b. We know for sure that Oswald was at the Cuban

Consulate at least once on Friday and at least once on

Saturday, see CIA memorandum, pages 6 through 8.

the argument with Azque took place was Itself different from

and earlier than the visit to the Cuban Consulate during which

Silvia Duran "confirmed" to Oswald that he would have to get

a Russian visa first and during which she gave Oswald a slip

of paper with her name and telephone number; because Azque

telephoned the Russian Consulate after arguing with Oswald,

see paragraph 4 of this memorandum, and Oswald was given

Duran's slip of paper subsequent to this phone call, when he

FROM:

W. David SIP ROHIBITED

Letter to the Central

gence Agency (CIA)

*Posing Certain Questions on their Letter to Us

dated 31 January 1964

I would Include in our letter to the CIA the following

questions:

1.

Were you able to uncover anything about the alleged

meeting between Oswald and the Cuban Ambassador which was

supposed to have taken place in an automate catside the

Cuban Eabassy In Mexico O1ty?

2.

Do you have access to the wire sent by the Soviet

Mexican Embassy to the Soviet Washington Embassy? II you

do, can we find out its contenta?

3. Reference is made to paragraphs 5 and 6 of your

letter.

Would 1t be possible for us to see the full report

•of the Mexican police interrogations of hrs. Duran and her

husbard?.

"that same arternoon, " came back "again" to the cuban,

came back "again"

to the Cuban

Embassy.. Does this mean that he was there trice the same

day, or does it mean that he was there once on the previous

day and once on the same afternoon that Azque telephoned the

Soviet Embassy? Only the latter interpretation of this

sentence seems consistent with the CIA-confirmed Information

found in the subsequent paragraphs. In general, we would

appreciate as much car cation an you can give us on the

Is there any significance

We wonder whether the informant

meant to say that there was something unusual in Mrs. Duran

reporting her instructions to Oswald when he had continued

to remain at the Cuban Consulate.

Reference 1g again made to the 2nd subparagraph of

garagraph 125.

Your letter states that Mrs. Duran told the

Soviet Embassy" that Oswald"knew no one in Cuba", and that

the Soviet official "echoed her statement that the American

was not known.

It Is unclear to us whether this discussion

Involved Oswald's not being known by the Cuban and/or Soviet

officials, or whether It Involved Oswald's not knowing

anyone In the Soviet and/or Cuban Embassies.

agent who is capable of operating in certain circles

in Europe where we have very few assets.

Whether this

is of sufficient worth to continue his services depends

on the determination of how be can

The AustrIan station

He is not being used at the present time.

He is being paid but he is on ice as far as any

operational assignments are concerned.

c. It is recommended that the present Chief of

RABNEY

be consulted by

Headquarters Ior their best recommendations as to

the continued use of QJWIN.

After these recommendations

are received, I suggest that the German and Austrian

stations be consulted for their possible interest in

using him.

If after these discussions a sensible

framework for the operational use of QJHIN can be

established,

I would recommend we continue him.

I would recommend that he be terminated at the

time his present contract expires.

As far as the RIFLE aspects of this operation

security reasons and with which Fletcher M. KNIGHT is fully

REDWOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald.

As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sonetime in Summer 1960 -

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laying

on of interview(s) through KUJÜMP or other suitable channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family....

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck

me from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need,

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3.

I was phasing into my IPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus,

I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's arrival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home".

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen

similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.

Volume V of the SSC Final Report conveys an impression of

limited effort by CIA in the course of the Warren Commission

inquiry. As is noted in other annexes to the present report,

CIA did seek and collect information in support of the efforts

of the Warren Commission. Additionally, it conducted studies and

submitted special

analyses and reports.

The following pages list reports and other papers submitted

to the FBI (which had primary responsibility for the investigation)

and to the Warren Commission. It is felt that this compilation

is appropriate to consideration of the extent of the CIA effort,

to the extent that it reveals something of the results of that

effort.

The lists fall into the following sections:

E.1

Dissemination to the Intelligence Community

E.2 Dissemination of Information to the Warren Commission

E.3 Disseminations to the FBI on Rumors and Allegations

E.4 Memoranda to Warren Commission

DISSEMINATION OF REPORTS TO CI STAFF

Since CI Staff held the Agency's official file on OSWALD,

all cable traffic (theoretically) including disseminations by

cable was sent to the Staff for filing in the official file.

ditionally, cables disseminations were released by CI/Liaison.

Copies were, therefore, available to the Staff.

Since CI Staff released all long-form CSCI's, coordinated

on short-form

CSCI's, and maintained the CSCI log, the CI Staff

received copies of all CSCI's.
