UN REACTIONS TO KENNEDY'S DEATH

22 Now 63 1900

Urgent

For

First reactions in the UN after KENNEDY's assassination:

I A unanimous opinion exists that even in the most! favorable cir-

cumstances, East-West relations will deteriorate in the next few months and

may last until elections.

KENNEDY's assassination will deepen the break in

the Democratic Party between the North and the South. JOHNSON, weak and subject

to influence, will be forced to concentrate on stopping this process. GOLD-

WATER's position will decline which will increase ROCKEFELLER's chances for the

nomination.

The results of the elections for the most part will depend on

the popularity of the Democratic candidates.

Being mentioned are HUMPHREY,

ROBERT [25-50M] and American journalists in talks emphasize JOHNSON's liberal

past (it is said that he was ROOSEVELT's favorite), and his moderate position

in critical periods during KENNEDY's term.

3o It is alarming that anti-Communist hysteria has been turned on.

Radio and television continue to broadcast unconfirmed, reports that held as a

suspect in the assassination is a man who it is said asked for Soviet citizen-

ship two years ago, has a Fussian wife and who recently was an activist in the

n television inat noian wire

(Fair Play for Cuba) pro CASTRO organization.

American extremists having great influences in the propaganda

apparatus here want at all costs to be divorced from responsibilities for

the attempt.
