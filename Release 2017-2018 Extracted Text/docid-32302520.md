MANNARINO, aka.,

SAMUEL MANNARINO; aka.,

on 5/11/61,

1520 Lincoln Ave., New Kensington, Pa.,

(protect per request), advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH; III, as

follows:

Recently, information has come to him from New Kensington

gamblers

that the Marbet Heating Co. Office, 1124 Fifth Ave.,

New Kensington, may be used as a central location for the counting

of illegal

income by the Mannarino organization. Ostensibly ths

company is in the business of selling furnaces,

air conditioners,

siding and other home necessities, but it is believed that this

is merely a front.

This belief is intensified when it is

considered that JOHN FONTANA, long considered KELLY MANNARINO 's

top lieutenant, is the store manager.

This company is in the

process of moving from the above address to 1371 Fourth Ave.,

Arnold, Pa., about three city blocks away, and the company is

Brackenridge, Pa.

to have a warehouse in the 800 block of Sixth Ave.

will be alert for the presence

MANNARINOs and their underlings at this company's office and for

any activity considered inappropriate for the type of business

supposedly being conducted.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS:
