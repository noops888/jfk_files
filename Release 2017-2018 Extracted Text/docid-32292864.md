JAMES M. MC ANDREW to interview KENNETH LATER at his office

at 120 N. 57th Street, New York City. LATER's attorney"

JEROME F. TOBIN, who shares LATER's office, made a call

LATER in order that an interview could be arranged.

TOBIN,

upon contacting LATER, allowed SA MC ANDREW to talk to him

over the phone.

LATER used abusive language and stated he

would not be interviewed concerning himself or anyone else.

Mr.

TOBIN pointed out that LATER had been dealing with some

"pretty rough characters" and probably is afraid.

Mr. TOBIN made available the pre-trial examination

Of FRANK BURD, and he advised that he had written Internal

Revenue Service advising them of BURD's money manipudations.

The New York Office noted that there is no indication

from information developed by their investigations that JOSEPH

STASSI and FRANK BURD printed for TRAFFICANTE.

It was further

noted that the Internal Revenue Service at Brooklyn, New York

has an income tax case on STASSI

and no income tax returns

by him (STASSI) have been located to date.

The New York Office

further noted that the Internal Revenue Service may possibly

desire to secure further information concerning STASSI and BURD.
