RE:

ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO ACTIVITIES

On September 9, 1959, MM T-1, a confidential source

abroad, furnished the following information: (S)

Ciliain

On September 1, 1959, CARL S

STEWART,

a naturalized

Canadian who works as a ship's captain and makes his residence

at Nassau, British West Indies, telephonically requested the

representative of the British government in Nassau to come

Immediately to Miami on a most urgent matter. MM T-1 said

that STEWART was born February 23, 1932, in Budapest, Hungary

and is now in possession of Canadian passport number 4622270

issued at Ottawa, Canada, on September 14, 1956. In about

November, 1958, STEWART made the acquaintance of a pro-FIDEL

CASTRO group in Nassau and furnished information to the British

government in Nassau concerning this group.

On September 1, 1959, pursuant to the telephone

call from STEWART, a representative of the British government

arrived in Miami where STEWART told him that he had been in

touch with two anti-CASTRO Cuban exiles. He named these

individuals as HIVO GONZALEZ, who claimed to be a former

FLET

member of the military intelligence service of the BATISTA

regime and Dr. (FNU) GONZALEZ, father of HIVO GONZALEZ, who-

claimed to have served in the Cuban Treasury Department

during the BATISTA regime.

STEWART reported that through

these individuals he had learned that General PEDRAZA

movement in the Dominican Republic and who is a Cuban

exile, had called a meeting on August 29, 1959, at Ft.

Lauderdale, Florida, to coordinate the activities of

all anti-CASTRO forces in Florida. MM T-l said that

PEDRAZA was apparently supposed to have attended this

meeting in person, along with various leaders of the

anti-CASTRO movement.

MM T-1 said that STEWART was not

present at this alleged meeting.

MM I-1 said that STEWART told the British

representative that on August 31, 1959, he met a Cuban

who was first known to him as "PACO," later identified

to him as Dr. FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ COUCEIRO, who claimed

CUBA

to have been in the CASIRO government up until June,

1959. RODRIGUEZ asked STEWART to form and lead a small.

FLEt

group of about 200 men, to obtain arms for them and to

take them to an unspecified island, probably in the

British West Indies group, for the

purpose of training

them for military action against the CASTRO government

at some designated time within the near future. RODRIGUEZ

told STEWART that he wanted to obtain the tacit approval

of the British government that they

would not interfere

with this training. STEWART agreed to get in touch with

a Zepresentative of the British government on behalf of

RODRIGUEZ.

(9)

When the British official representative from

Nassau arrived in Miami on September 1, 1959, he was met

by STEWART at Miani International Airport and driven to

Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, where he met with several Cubans

at a street address unknown to the British representative.

Present at this meeting were STEWART, DI. GONZALEZ,

FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ, two unidentified men believed to be

Cubans and the British representative. RODRIGUEZ disclosed

that he had been about to depart for New York City to lobby.

At this meeting the discussion included the

following: (5)

(1) Talked about the anti-Communist and

anti-CASTRO aims of the movement. (S)

(2) Alleged support of certain unidentified

U. S. Senators and the fact that the U. S. Government had

given no official recognition to the movement although the

movement was hopeful of eventually obtaining such recognition.

(3) Disclosure concerning an intention to train a

group of Cubans for an invasion of Cuba against the CASTRO

government (5)

(4) The British representative was questioned as

to whether Her Majesty's Government would be willing to turn

a "blind eye" to such a group operation based upon some

uninhabited and isolated island of the Bahama group. Grand

Cayman Island was mentioned as a point for flight refueling.

MM T-1 said that it is his personal opinion that the Cubans

had in mind an island such as Turks Island or Caicos Island.

Also during this meeting, RODRIGUEZ disclosed that

the anti-CASTRO movement would have the support of the

TRUJILLO government of the Dominican

Fruit Company, a U. S. corporation.

MM T-1 said that the British government will not,

under any circumstances, give any consideration whatsoever

to allowing such an operation to be based on any British

island.
