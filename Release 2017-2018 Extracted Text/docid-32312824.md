7: The spectographic analyses were made by FBI Special

Agent John F. Gallagher.

8.. Even though Mr. Gallagher testified in deposition

thereof to the Warren Commission or not, although they were

requested to do so by the Commission (Commission Report, p. XI).

Warren Commission, the Commission in turn did not deposit then in

the National Archives, although all of the rest of its materials

Plaintiff's first formal attempt to get permission

to see and/or copy the spectographic analyses was in a letter to

FBI Director J. Bdgar Hoover, dated May 23, 1966.

(see Exhibit

A appended hereto.)

14.

Plaintiff's request went unanswered.

15. During 1966, 196%, 1968, and 1969 Plaintifi made

numerous requests, both orally and in writing, of the National

Archives (which should have had a ccopy of the analyses, but main-

tains that it does not) and the Department of Justice to examine

and/or copy the analyses.

(see Exhibit B appended hereto.)

16. On April 6, 1970, Plaintiff wrote to the Attorney

General reguesting his review of the denial by the Deputy Attorney

General of his request for access to various materials, including

the spectographic analyses. (See Exhibit C appended hereto.)

17. On May 16, 1970, in a letter addressed to Mr.

Richard Kleindienst, Deputy Attorney General, Plaintiff renewed

his request, accompanying it with a completed form DJ 118 ("RE-

quest for Access to Official Records Under 5 U.S.C, 552(a) and.

28 CFR part 16"), describing the records sought as follows:

*Spectographic analysis of bullet, fragments of

dent Kennedy and wounding of Governor Connally. See

18. On June 4, 1940, the Attorney General replied to

Plaintife's letter of April 6, 1970, denying him access to the

spectographic analyses, stating that they were exempt from public

disclosure under 5 U.S.C. 552 as a part of an "investigatory file

compiled for law enforcement purposes." Accarding to

the Attorney

General, they were exempt from compulsory disclosure under excep

tion No. 7 of that Act....

(See Exhibit E appended hereto.)

19. In a letter dated June 12, 1970, the Deputy Attorney

General took an identical position, denying access under 5 u.s.c.

Vear Mr. Weisberg

This is in response to your letter of April 6, 1970,

requesting my review of the denial by the Deputy Attorney

General of your request under, the Freedom of Information

Act, 5 U.S.C. $ 552, for access to records thought by you

to be in the files of the Department of Justice.

Specifi

cally, you have requested access to "the raw materials" in-

cluding "notes, rough drafts, final panel drafts, individual

reports by any of the panel members or advisors and relevant

correspondence and memoranda, etc." relating to the medical

reports made by the

autopsy surgeons and the advisory panel

to the Attorney General in connection witti the assassination

of President John' F. Kennedy. The Deputy Ättorney General

denied your request on the ground that the "materials de-

scribed in your

letter do not exist in the files of this

Department.

I have made an attempt to ascertain whether the mterials

you seek are in the files of this Department. "It is my con-

clusion, after a full examination of the matter, that documents

of the kind you describe do not exist anywhere in the Depart-

ment. Accordingly, I must deny your request.

In your letter of April 6, you state that you wish to

renew your request for the "spectrographic analyses of the

bullet, fragments of bullet and other items said to have been

. 05.

You point out

that the "bullet in question is Warren Commission Exhibit

No. 399. "

The Department of Justice has received requests

for these documents in the past, and we have taken the posi-

tion that they are part of an "investigatory file compiled

for law enforcement purposes" and are therefore exempt from

the Freedom of Information Act's compulsory disclosure re-

qui rements.

is being itrigated in the federal courts. If the plaintiff

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20530

June 12, 1970

Mr. Harold Weisberg

Coq d'Or Press

Route 8

Frederick, Maryland 21701

Dear Mr. Weisberg:

This will reply to your letters of May 16, 1970

enclosing five separate requests for information under

the Public Information Section of the Administrative

Procedure Act.

The information and materials you

request relate to the assassination of former President

Kennedy.

This letter will respond to each request in the

order they were explained in your letters of May 16.

(1) Spectrographic Analyses: You have asked for

access to the spectrographic analyses conducted

certain bullet evidence involved in the assassination.

I regret that I am unable to grant your request

in that the work notes and raw analytical data on which

the results of the spectrographic tests are based are

part of the investigative files of the FBI and are

specifically exempted from public disclosure as inves-

tigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes.

5 U.S.C. 552(b) (7). The results of the spectrographic

tests are adequately shown in, the report of the Warren

Commission where (Volume 5, pages 67, 69, 73 and 74)

It 1s specifically set forth that the metal fragments

were analyzed spectrographically and found to be similar

in composition.

(2) Documentation Relating to David William Ferrie:

You have described the documents you are seeking, relating

to the late David William Ferrie of New Orleans, as thase

withheld from the Warren Commission and/or withheld from

the National Archives, and those withheld by the National

Archives by order of the Department of Justice.

This will advise you that no documents relating to

David William Ferrie were withheld by the FBI from the

Warren Commission. Also, so far as is known, all records

of the Warren Commission pertaining to David William Ferrie

were turned over to the National Archives by the Warren

Commission, together with all other records of the Warren

Commission.

With respect to those records now in the custody of

the National Archives which have been withheld from public

disclosure, I am unable to grant your request.

investigative reports are withheld pursuant to 5 U.S.C.

552(b) (7). The disclosure of these reports might be a

source of embarrassment to innocent persons, who are the

subject, source,

or apparent source of the material in

question which contains rumor and hearsay and details of

a personal nature having no significant connection with

the assassination of the President.

(3) " Exhibit 60 (Pictures of President Kennedy's

Shirt and Tie: In accordance with your request, enclosed

herewith is a photographic copy of a portion of Exhibit 60

showing the tabs of the President's shirt.

(4) Concerning Receipt of Material Obtained at Autopsy:

You have requested a photograph and all records relating to

the material removed by Commander James Humes, M.C., U.S.N.,

at the time of the autopsy and receipted for by special

Agents Francis X. O'Neill and James W. Siberton November 22,

1963.

This request appears to be based on your inability

to specifically identify the Exhibit in the Commission report

The material referred to in the receipt is identified

as Commission Exhibit 843. A photograph of this Exhibit

was furnished the Commission and was published in "Hearings
