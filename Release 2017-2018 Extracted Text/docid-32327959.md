Date

8/23/62

Mr. ANTHONY JOSEPH BILETTO, 52 West Oakdale Street,

Brentwood, Long Island, New York, was contacted at his residence.

At the outset and continuing throughout the duration of the

interview, BILETTO was extremely hostile and beligerent toward

the contacting agents.

The agents identified themselves at the outset and

stated that they desired to ascertain the address of BILTITO's

daughter, FLORA ANN.

BILEITO stated that he would not furnish

the address and demanded to know the purpose in contacting his

daughter.

He was advised that the matter was confidential

between his daughter and the agents, but if she desired to

advise him following the interview, the agents would not offer

any objection.

BILETTO replied "Nobody talks to my daughter

without talking to me first"

BILETTO was reminded that the agents were representa-

tives of the United States Government and were directed to

contact his daughter on an official matter by the Attorney

General. BILETrO snapped back that he did not care who the

agents

were and they were not going to embarass his daughter

now that she is a married woman.

BILETTO was further reminded that the Government

had gone to considerable expense to have the agents contact him

and it

may be necessary to subpoena him and his daughter before

a Federal Grand Jury.

BILETTO retorted that "he pays the taxes"

and it was his money

that was spent on the investigation.

He

further remarked that he and his daughter were no concerned about

any subpoena.

At the conclusion, BILETTO was questioned as to whether

he and his daughter were acquainted with SOLLY BURNS.

He stated

that they knew BURNS because his daughter used to be an associate

of BURNS' daughter.
