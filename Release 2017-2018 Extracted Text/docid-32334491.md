RE: VALJEAN MATTHEN HALEY

PSI - MINUTEZIEN

On 9/22/65 PSI said he tas Pinally succossful, after

MINUTEIN. PSI said he contacted ALLAN on the pretext that there had

been a conplaint about somoono's shooting through the window of a

business establishuent and noting that Abuti had complained of a

similar incident in the past, wondored if Aluby courd help hie.

PSI said he talked with ALLEN for quite some time and ALLISi gavo no

indiostion of recognition of PSI as a Minutenen menber.

• PSI said he has received no connunication from Minutemen

since the last ones he turned in to writer.

...

It is noted others in the area have recelved Minutemen

Iterature since that time so it would appear Minutemen have decided

thay cannot trust PSI since he is a Deputy Sherlff. Contact will be

maintained with PSI for a reasonable longth of time to see if he le

contacted in any way by Minuteaen and if he la not, he willbe

discontinued as a PsI.
