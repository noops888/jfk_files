Dear Mr. Attorney General:

OFFICE OF THE

RECEIVED

JUN 2 9 1959

ANTORNEY GENERA

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has furnished to us a large

number of reports reflecting interviews by FBI Agents of defendants and

co-conspirators in the Apalachin case.

The material furnished is of the greatest value. Several of the

reports, for example, summarize interviews taken just a few days after

the Apalachin meeting and bear out clearly the pattern of falsehood

which is in the heart of the conspiracy charged.

Much of the material furnished will certainly be affirmative

evidence in support of the Government's case; a good portion of the

balance will be most useful. for purposes of cross-examination and other-

wise.

All of the material reflects the FBI's uniformly excellent

investigative techniques.

I thought you should be informed of the important contribution

that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is making to the success of the

Apalachin case.

Respectfully yours,

Mittondulend

Milton R. Wessel

Special Assistant to the

Attorney General
