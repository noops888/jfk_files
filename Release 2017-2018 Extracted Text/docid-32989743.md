LARRY RAY and his brother, JERRY WILLIAM RAY, who were

in robberies of the Farmers Bank of Liberty, Liberty,

Ill., on 10/17/69 and Farmers and Traders Bank of Meredosia,

Meredosia, Ill., on 1/28/70. Photos of the group of RAY

associates were brought to the bank by Agents from St. Louis

and witnesses from outside the bank the day before the robbery

and witnesses involved in the robbery identified photographs

Of TURLEY and HAYNES. Federal process was obtained. HAYNES

was arrested in St. Louis a day or so after the robbery

and marked money from the robbery was recovered on his

person.

TURLEY was arrested in St. Louis a week or so later

and no money was recovered. A showup was held at St. Louis

PD for witnesses from all three robberies. There witnesses

picked HAYNES as being the person who ran the bank robbery

but were not as positive on TURLEY. One witness from the

Meredosia bank robbery picked the photograph of TURLEY as

being the tall bank robber and HAYNES as being the short

bank robber.

Both subjects TURLEY and HAYNES were being tried

in USDC, St. Louis, during November, 1970. During the trial

HAYNES changed his plea from not guilty to guilty ana

testified for the government. He testified TURLEY was with

him but he would not name the other participants until the

judge directed him to.

He named his associates as JOHN

LARRY RAY, JAMES RUSSELL TURLEY, JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS, and

ERNEST TURLEY. At the end of the trial TURLEY was acquitted.

Audrain County Sheriff HAROLD SULGROVE, now deceased,

had state robbery warrants for both subjects with him.

The

warrants had been issued shortly after the bank robbery.

After the acquittal of TURLEY he called Prosecuting Attorney

THOMAS I. OSBORN at Mexico and asked him if he could bring

TURLEY back for trial.

OSBORN told him to bring him back

but he would discuss the prosecution later.

TURLEY's lawyer called OSBORN and he also talked

to AUSA KENNETH R. HEINEMAN who tried TURLEY in USDC and

OSBORN decided that he would tell the defense attorney that

if TURLEY would take a polygraph examination and pass he

would not try TURLEY, however, if TURLEY would refuse to

take the examination

he would

have to try him.

OSBORN

advised the defense attorney that with TURLEY's record and the

eye witnesses he thought that he owed it to the state to

try TURLEY.

TURLEY appealed the fact that he was being tried

after being acquitted in Federal court to the Missouri Court

I Appeals, U. S. Court of Appeals,

and the U. S. Supreme

'ourt. The Court of Appeals denied his appeal

and the

Supreme Court would not hear the case.

He was later ordered

for trial on a change of venue in Warren County Circuit

Court in Warrenton, Mo.

While out on bond and awaiting the court decisions

Audrain County Sheriff SULGROVE was in one of the St. Louis

City police precincts when TURLEY and his wife were brought

in for some violation. His wife said "I lied for you one

time but I'm not going to lie for you again." During the

subsequent trial in Warren County Circuit Court SULGROVE

remembered this and got the detective to testify who had

this information.

TURLEY was tried, convicted and sentenced to 30

years in the state penitentiary. While awaiting transportation

to the state penitentiary he escaped from the Warren County

Jail and was later apprehended on a UFAP warrant in Florida

by FBI Agents.

On 11/7/78 former Prosecuting Attorney THOMAS I.

OSBORN, Mexico, Mo., advised that he got a telephone call

from a reporter, BILL FREIGOVEL of the St. Louis Post Dispatch

newspaper, saying he was doing a story on the bank robbery

it Laddonia in 1970. He advised that the House Select

Committee on Assassinations investigators had information

from JAMES RUSSELL ROGERS and CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES

that ERNEST TURLEY was not involved in the robbery.

OSBORN was asked a number of questions about the case

and including why witnesses, when interviewed by

SA WILLIAM R. DUNCAN, Resident Agent handling the investigation,

were not too positive

an identification but when thee

went to trial their identification was very positive.

also wanted to know if DUNCAN called OSBORN after TURLEY's

acquittal in St. Louis and requested that he be brought back

for state prosecution. He also asked if it was not DUNCAN

who pushed the state prosecution.

S.L 62-5097

OSBORN told the reporter that the warrants for

TURLEY and HAYNES were outstanding since June, 1970, shortly

after the bank robbery and that Sheriff HAROLD SULGROVE

called him and told him he was bringing TURLEY back on the

warrant and that DUNCAN did not push TURLEY's investigation

and did not push for his trial in state court.

said that he thought that the witnesses probably were not

positive at the time of the bank robbery since the

subjects had on nylon stockings, but after seeing them in

person were positive. He asked

the reporter it he had seen

the good showup photograph that was taken both with the

nylon stockings and without and the reporter advised that he

had not.

OSBORN was asked by the reporter what he thought

about the House Select Committee on Assassinations petition

to the Governor of Missouri for a pardon for TURLEY.

responded that he had not heard of any pardon motion.

On 11/7/78 Mrs. RUBY MAY HAMLETT, Vice President,

* Laddonia State Bank, Laddonia, No., advised that St. Louis

Post Dispatch reporter, BILL FREIGOVEL Called her saying

he was doing an article on the bank robbery of the Laddonia

State Bank in 1970.

Since Mrs. HAMLETT's husband, State

Representative RAY HAMLETT, was running for re-election the

same day,

she asked if this was not political and he advised

that the

story would not be released until after the election.

She was asked by FREIGOVEL to comment on the fact

that when she was interviewed by SA DUNCAN the day of the bank

robbery she said one thing about who took the money and then

when she testified in State court she said something else.

She

advised that the reporter was to call her back but did not.

Both OSBORN and HAMLETT said that the reporter

was allegedly reading from the court transcript of the trial.

For information of the Bureau, SA WILLIAM R. DUNCAN

was interviewed by the House Select Committee on Assassinations

, on 11/21/77 and 11/29/77 and testified before the

subcommittee on 11/30/77 concerning an incident alleged to

have happened at the Louisville, Kentucky PD during September,

1965..

It is noted that the three items of

related correspondence provided by Weisberg represent

correspondence between Weisberg and G. Robert Blakey, Chief

This letter to the Honorable Louis

DR. FIELDS told the PATIERSONS shat they (the PATTERSONS) would not

be treated as the common people artending but that the PATTERSONS would

be invited to all the gala doings and meet all the right people at the

meeting. DR. FIELDS also mentloned that once a month DR. FIELDS drives

Hashington, d.t. 20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

If you taught law students the war you wrote yur lutter of Octoher 24, 1 can

understand the Chief Justice's coument on the Incompetence of lawyers better

than I could before recelving your letter.

If a nonlawyer can presume to give advice to one who insists on being referred

to as professor, then I think the beginning of your convoluted first sentence is

an unwise description of pursuina a Congressional Investigation under the pre-

rext of a legitinate legislative purpose.

une final words to this long sentence are more suitable for use before a jury.

you want to prejudice. While I ani renuired to work when I am too tired and at

a pace I would prefer to be not as ranld. I dost that I ever sald, in my letter

of October 7 or anywhere olse, that I found anything you or the committee have

done to be "of usa to the publie."

If by any renote chance I so misspoke myself,

then this is ay correction of it.

There can be values in some of what you saw no value in. This parhaps axplains

your refusal to provide copies of the public record when I was specific in telling

you I want it for use in court.

Some of what you refuse to provide me you gave to the press. As I told you, 1

heard some of it broadcast, which is a pretty publie use.

Those of your staff who run the xerox auchines are hardly those wino are "curfently

working long hours" on "the final report" and "to prepare for the upcoming public

hearings on the assassination of ii. Martin Luther King, Jr."

(You have saparate

subcommittees, separate staffs, and I asked for JFK public decords, not those on

the King case. Your JFK hearings are not antil Deceaber.)

If elther the House or the camittee rules prevent your providinn me with xerox

copfes of the public record, you fall to say this while contorting yourselt to

Imply it. Without the most radical change in the policy of the Congress since 1

had the responsibility for makine the public record avallable, you do not reflect

1t faithfully and Invoke the Coomittee and House rules in what amounts to false

pretense.

Whit you are really afaald of is any use that could expose what you are doing

prior to your dumping of an Indigestible mass of preconceptions on what will

amount to a captive press because of time pressures. I had no such thing in mind

but saybe I will think about it and find some deans of doing something about it

prior to your coming neus managanent stunt of withholding coples of everything

until you can present a report that nobody can check against its alleged sources.

Which are carefully enough selected in advance in any event.

Deliberate FBI Violation of Stipulations

Hap: y Cointelproing with FUIA

Reguester and

House Somnittee

These are

the subjects of this memorandum. In part they come from the enclosed

cosy of an SBI Et, "ouis record. This is clearly within uy requests and withún the

FBI's own stipulations and as of this moment the FBI continues to withhold it and

other related records. As I have already informed you the FBI was violating its own

Stipulations ucfore they provided a single record under them. In this instance

Departuent counsel only recently gave personal assurances to the Court that the

FuI hed complied with the stipulations. She accomapnied this with sole slurs on

wy counsel, perhaps me also. I'm lot checking the transcript.

As I heve also told you, there is an inevitable relationship between my PA

request and the records still withheld in this case. (As also Ph records are

vitinheid and i filed separate riquests with each field office.)

As Ray's defense investigator I conducted tile habeas corpus investigation.

This required me to go to leavenworth to interview several prisoners there. The

Departmunt was aware of this and made the necessary arrangements. When I was asked to

appear on a St. louis IV show with Jerry fay, whom knew well, J.B.Stoner, whonI'a

nevor net, former Department enployee Laue and Gerold Frank, I accepted the invita.

tion vecaust it frid rost of my costs in getting to leavenworth. Whether or not

Stoner was then still of Ray's counsel, he had bech and there were watters Ix

wanted to discus: with him because of it. The station put us all up in the same

hotel. I haú private meetings with Stoner and l' rank, neither of whom was alone.

I also walked fron the station back to the hotel with Stoner and his companions.

I belicive we also walked to the station together. It now turns out that some of

Stoner's companions vere Fil inforers. To put this another way, the FBI was spyin« on

ti Kay defense and has withheld all such records of this improper activity. Even

when the Stipulations called for their production. ly source on this is one of the

I'BI's finks. Hy concern over these withholdings is magnified when I recall the

various FlI fabrications relating to me, particularly with regard to Stoner.

. In providias you with proofs of the identification of two of the FBI's informers,

those here identifiei, I asked that you please see to it that belated FBI compliance

1s not otalied further so it can engaged in still further Cointelproing. VI me and

of the lourt in particular. (I do not beliéve that Govezurent counsel made up the

false statement about complete FBI compliance with the Stipulations but I guess it

could be said that not for the first time the FBI Cointelproed its own counsel, tolerant

21.) "n order to prevent any new

improper such Fil

exploits, I ask that you seck inmediate and total complince with regard to these

infolners, the St. "ouis and other relevant field offices and that there be an

accompanying first-person affidavit in all cases. I have just sent you proof that

the FBI remained in touch with liver Pattersoz, one of the informers, the one to .

who the enclosed i'll record relates.

The House Comittee Vointelpros easily but.I have no desire for such adventures

to continue. Its hearings are about to resume. The reevant public hearings are not

scheduled to last past the end of lovember. I therefore believe that I should have

these records promptly in order to have them in case of need.

I would appreciate having some assurance of a close date of compliance on

this mutter or I shall ask lir. Lesar to file a liotion to Coupel, if he considers

it proper. By this I mean in time for there ot be a full airing at the coming

status call, which is only three we-ks away.

The attaches records also bear on consistent FuI misrepresentations about its

practise with its inforners. This is perhaps the third or fourth illustration I have

provided. Its clain to withholdiug identification stops at tie edge of its ocean of

Cointclyro possibilities. The Fil therefore Cointelproed the committee by not withhold-

ing Patterson's naine frow it when it provided records tu tie committec, This record

was provided to my source by the com.ittee.

Of course, this also is a isrepresentation to the tourt and one into which

Napartnent counsel, all or nost, have been enticed by the l'bI.

Please notethut one file only is indicated on this Fil record. There apear to

be the curtainty frow this that in the St. louis iD there is an index indication

where other copies are filed. Utherwise, it would be imposcible to retrievc the in-

formation for which the FBI used its infornants. Of course, this may be on a separate

sheet or sheets, also withheld. There hus to be more, like the records of forvardings.

Please note elso that the stipulations, which vere automatically nullified by

non-complience, did not linit inforictions avout the Rays to lUKIll records.

You will obs irve that the sa involved is one of those whos: names I provided

quite sone time ago. I understand he was reassinged to Tampa.

The attuched infornant's report is not complete. It was made incomplete by this

SA in the following manner: Patterson dictated the report to his then wife leslie. The

Sa came, read the repurt and told the Pattersons what to orit. (I am aware that FOIA

covere only existing records.) Under the Sa's direction then lies. Patterson retyped

the report, omitting the kind of information the FBI did not want to have. Like

Jerry "ay's insistence that his brother did not fire the fatal shot and inconsistencies.

overall responsibility in criminal natters, the policy is, unleas some

untisual circumstances militate against it, to notify the victim of the

threat and the local law enforcement agency having jurisdiction. The

above policy was set forth in Mr. Rosen's memorandum to Me. Belmont,

with its attached letter to all Special Agents in Charge, both dated

October 1, 1964, and captloned "Notification to Victims Threatened vith

Bodily Harm." Á copy of each of these documents ie attached.

King - The FBI's policy during 1962-1968 concerning

threats received against Ring was to advise promptly the Atlanta Police

Department, (APD), which covered King's residence. It King was in a

craves status, the police department in the locality involved was also

advised, King was not personally contacted by the FBI and advised of

the thicat.

In situations there the FBI received a threat against King

outside the FBI's jurisdiction, local authorities were advised as

outlined above, Most of these situations were reported in the security

Investigation of King. If the nature of the threat appaared wichin the

investigacive jurisdiction of the FBI, a separate case was initiated.

These cases, which have been referred to by the FISCA as King "death

threat" files, were investigated under a varicty of FBI classifications.

such as Extortion, Racial Matters, Destruction of Aircraft and Motor

Vehicles, and Sombing Matters-

Coples of these files, as well as the

King security file, were processed and delivered to the USCA in response

to previous requests.

The above polley of advlsing local authorities of a threat

against King was restated on numerous occasions in the king security

File.

To document this policy, the ISCA is referred to the following

serials: 100-106670-371, Bureau airtel to Jacksonville, Atlanta, and

New York dated June 9, 19643 100-106670-495, Mr. Smith's memorandum to

W. C. Sullivan dated October I1, 19643 100-106670-594, Bureau letter to

Jackson dated December 10, 1964; 100-106670-1003, Bureau airtel to

King disclosed no specific information as to why King was not personally

contacted and advised that a threat againat hin had been receivad.

an effort to obtain additional information on this point, the Atlasto

Offlea was contacted.

In sumary, recollections of knowledgeable

perconnal of the Atlenta Offico indicated that cavising the APD was

aufficient since close contact was maintained by the APD with King and

members of hia family, Further, the APD provided protective security on

occasions for King+

To advise lins personally of any threats would have

been complicated by his availability and his zofusal to ratura telephone

calla of Special Agenta of the Atlanta office. It chould also be noted

that a number of threats against King vere recolved by King's assoclates

and Southera Christlan Leadership Conference officials, who, in turn,

rolayed the information to the IDI. In these cases it could be assumed

King was already avate of the threat.

RE:

NOTIFICATION TO VICTIMS

THREATENED WITH BODILY HARM

D.

Dear Bir:

Where we possess information that bodily harm is

threatened, such as in cases of extortion, assault, shooting,

bombing and the like, it is realized that the victim in most cases

Is already alerted to the threat of bodily harm by the time the

threat is reported, or has himself received the threat in the first:

Instance. In rare instances, however, the victim is not aware

of the threat.

In line with our over-all responsibility in criminall

matters of seeing that intended victims are actually alerted, you

are reminded that such action should be taken immediately in all

such situations unless some unusual circumstance militates against

It This would also apply to threatened acts which are not handled

Joy the FBI, In the event of any such exceptios, you should immediately

advise the Bureau of the specific details together with your recommen-

dations. It should be clearly understood, of course, that in all

Instances the interested law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction

are to be advised of the threatened act, if such is not already known

to the agency.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

NOTE: Based on previous requests, the HSCA (Chief Counsel only) was

granted access to the files of five former informants of the Memphis

Office. Identities of these informants were excised. The HSCA is

trying to resolve an allegation that paid FBI informants reporting on

the Invaders, a Memphis Youth Gang, acted as "agent provocateurs" and

instigated violence in Memphis during the Sanitation Workers Strike,

which caused King to return to Memphis where he was killed.

After receipt of HSCA request dated 10/17/78, it was agreed

the informant's name should not be disclosed to the HSCA, but in order

to avoid a confrontation with the Committee, informant would be contacted

a second time and asked if he was willing to be interviewed by the HSCA.

The HSCA was requested to submit additional details concerning circumstances

of interview should informant agree to same. These additional details

were set forth in HSCA's letter dated 10/19/78.

The informant in question, ME 338-E, who operated from 1958 to

1976, was contacted by Agents of the Memphis Office on 11/9/78. Informant

agreed to meet with SA George J. Foster, Congressional Inquiry Unit,

Records Management Division, and Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Robert I. Keuch, who had traveled to Memphis in order to be available to

assist in answering informant's questions about the HSCA.

The telephone number of the informant was furnished to Mr. Blakey

by Mr. Foster.

Identity of the informant was not provided. On 12/4/78,

Mr. Keuch provided details concerning his contact with the HSCA on this

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Reference is made to HSCA letters to the Attorney General Fron

G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ISCA, dated October 17,

1978, and October 19, 1978, which, in connection with the ESCA's investigation

into

the assassination of Martin Luther Kings JI, requested the name of

to o artin

a former informant who was associated with the Invaders in Memphis.

Tennessee, during 1968-

This letter is to confirn that the Informant desertbed in

referenced HSCA letters was contacted on Novenber 9, 1978, in Hemphis,

Tennessee, by representatives of the FBI and Deputy Assistant Attorney

General Robert I, Reuch. Informant agreed to interview by officials of

the HSCA. On Movenber 10, 1978, Mr. Reuch advised Mr. Blakey that a

condition under which informant agreed to interview was that his identity

would be made known only to three ESCA members, namely, Chaizman Louis B.

Stokes, Samuel I, Devine, and Walter E. Fauntroy, and four members of

the HSCA staff, Including Mr. Blakey.

Another condition was that Mr. Reuch would have the opportunity

to discuss with members of the tomittee concerns of the informant

relative to disclosure of his identity. This discussion was accomplished

by Mc. Reuch on November 21, 1973.

This letter is also to confirm that on lovember 13, 1973, a

representative of the Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management

Division, FBI headquarters, provided informant's telephone number to

Mr, Blakey.

Subsequent contact with the informant was to be handled

directly by appropriate ISCA staff members.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Reuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Dear MI. Attorney General:

In connection with this Committee's investigation into

the death of DI. Martin Luther Ring, JI., I Write to request

that you make the name of a former Security informant available

to the Committee so that the person night be interviewed in

order that serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the death of DI. Ring may be resolved.

The

Committee has had access to the relevant Bureau personnel and

the Headquarters and Field Office files of the informant, duly

excised to protect the informant's identity; and it also con-

ducted extensive interviews among others who are also the subject

of this aspect of the Committee's investigation. What the Com-

mittee now desires is to determine if the oral testimony of the

witnesses support or refute the written record as well as

information obtained during previous interviews.

The person, whose identity the Committee seeks, was 8580-

ciated with the Invaders, a Black militant group in Memphis,

Tennessee during 1968, who were apparently involved in the

He was an older person, and he had apparently been a

Bureau source since 1958.

As a recognized comnunity leader, he

was able to move about freely within the Black community.

Committee knows independently that in the early months of 1968,

the Invaders were attempting to obtain influence in that same

community, and they initially attempted to do so, in part, by

approaching established organizations. They even went so far

as to invite special agents of the emphis office to meet with

and objectives. If the Bureau sought to shape the actions of

these individuals in ways detrimental to DI. King in connection

with the counterintelligence program being waged against him,

it would appear that this particular informant would have been

a logical vehicle for that effort.

As you know, with respect to the King investigation, the

Committee is, in effect, performing for the death of DI. Ring

the same function that the Warren Commission performed for the

death of President Kennedy.

One of the most freguent criti-

cisms of the Warren Commission is that in attempting to resolve

the issue of whether or not lee Barvey Oswald was an FBI in-

formant, the Commission accepted sworn affadavits from the

Bureau.

The Committee feels, therefore, that it would be

derelict to sely on anything less than an opportunity to examine

and cross-examine relevant witnesses on this crucial issue.

The Committee is not unmindful of the sensitive nature of

its request.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the

Committee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not

until our field interviews with former members of the Invaders

and people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed, (1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and (2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

the do one and t

FBI operatives, that the Committee requested access to any

informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders, King and SCLC substantive files. It had also.

reviewed the Memphis Police Department files, and it had inter-

viewed its undercover operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers

sought could be resolved by reviewing the informants Headquarters

and idele office tiles. Subsequent interviews with current and

former agents revealed, additionally, (1) that the Memphis Field

office had prior knowledge of the impending violence la fact

memoralized in FBI documents) and (2) members of the Invaders

were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and

readying weapons from signposts la fact testified to under oath

by these agents.)

Further, while the Comnittee has insisted that the files

of all five of the informants said by the Department of Justice

to be involved with the Invaders should have been made available

to its staff pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, it

made a good faith effort to work out a compromise proposal that

permitted my exclusive review of the excised files. The

Committee has now reached a point, however, where the balance

between maintaining the integrity of the Bureau's informant

program and the resolution of this critical issue must be struck

in favor of the Committee's receiving the identity of that one

informant. A request is not being made for all five, and absent

new developments, this request should resolve the outstanding

issues.

The burden of the Conmittee's mandate is largely a

reflection of the desire of the American public to learn the

true facts concerning the death of Dr. King. That burden is

perhaps never more apparent than in connection with the issues

that the Committee is now attempting to address here.

The claim

that an FBI/Invader connection resulted in the violence on ApIil

28 and contributed to DI. King's death has now received nation-

wide attention.

It is recounted in existing literature and was

broadcast nationally in a dramatic account of DI. King's life.

The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, close friend and successor of DI. Ring,

testified in public under oath and before Members of the Com-

mittee and the national news media, that he recalled members of

the Invaders acknowledging that they had caused the violence

on March 28, in return for compensation from the FBI. Indeed,

an individual who was a recognized leader of the 1968 Sanitation

Strike and made the invitation to DI. King to come to Memphis,

is a leading exponent of the theory that the FBI, through its

informants, had a direct role in DI. King's assassination.

Finally, the Committee's investigation has revealed that

the Bureau recommended that informants be used with or without

their knowledge to implement counterintelligence proposals

directed against DI. Ring, in 1968.

clear that the Committee has no choice but to satisfy itself

concerning the events which took place in Memphis.

I, would hope that it might be possible to secure the

Identity of this informant, either through his consent or para-

graph I. B. (1) of the Memorandum of Understanding between the

Department and the Committee.

Nevertheless, I an authorized

to inform you that the Committee is prepared to seek this

information through formal process if all other avenues are of

no avail.

Finally, I would note that this issue must be resolved

well before the resumption of the Committee's public hearings

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations into the death of

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., I write to request that

you make the name of the former Security informant

available to the Committee so that the person might

be interviewed by the Committee in order that serious

allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and the death of Dr. King may be resolved. The Committee

has had access to the relevant Bureau files concerning

this informant, but the files were daly excised to pro-

tect the informant's identity. The Committee now desires

to interview this informant to detemine if his oral

testimony would support or refute the written record.

In addition, the Committee would expect to obtain other

information from the informant to corroborate or refute

information the Committee has obtained from its other

•SOLICES.

The Committee is extremely sensitive to your

concerns about preserving the confidentiality of your

informants. In addition, the Committee can certainly

appreciate the desire of most Security informants to

remain unidentified.

Should the Committee learn the

identity of this informant, it will be used at the cur-

rent time solely to have counsel on the staff interview

and

perhaps depose the informant. This would be done in

the Committee's offices in Washington, D.C. and without

the knowledge of any member of the pablic.

Indeed, not

even every member of the Committee staff will become aware.

of the informant's identity.

the Committee is primarily

interested in the information the informant may provide

the committee.

The Committee has no desire to have the

informant's identity needlessly publicly exposed. Absent

extraordinary circumstances, the Committee would not divulge

in its hearing's or its final report the name of the informant.

As you are aware, the Committee has extensively pur-

sued its investigations into the Invaders.

The claim that

an FBI/Invader connection contributed to DI. King's assassi-

nation has received nationwide attention.

We have held

field interviews with many members of the Invaders and Ie-

viewed numerous files on them. In addition, the Committee

has interviewed current and former agents of the Department

and Bureau on this issue.

Our Committee has been mandated •

to conduct a "full and complete" investigation into the

assassination of DI. King.

Talking with this informant is

essential to enable us to fulfill our legislative mandate,

and our responsibilities to the American people. As I indi-

cated to you, I hope it will be possible for us to secure

the identity of the informant through his consent, or pur-

suant to Paragraph I, B. of our Memorandum of Understanding.

Nevertheless, I must

inform you that the Committee is prepared

to seek the information through formal process if all other

avenues fail.

This latter alternative, in the event litigation

ensued and the Committee won, might publically disclose the

identity of the informant:

Indeed, litigation would. only

attract undue attention to this issue, and the participants

involved. I believe if you adequately express to the infor-

mant our sincere desire to avoid unnecessary disclosure or

publicity, he will consent to his identity being disclosed

and an interview with the staff.

PURPOSE:

To request Legal Counsel Division promptly furnish

to the Department a statement indicating I was act-

ing within the scope of my employment in connection with the

Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) and other matters

impacting on the House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA) inquiries into the assassination of Martin Luther

King, JI., and that a copy of the attached memorandum be fur-

nished to Department Attorney John Seibert, Civil Division,

Department of Justice, setting forth my need for private

counsel based on my possibe future appearance before or

contact with the HSCA.

}

Lạ REG38

02-117290-

1373

DETAILS: On 9/28/78, I was advised by a staff member of the

HSCA that in the future I would be requested to

depose

before the Committee relating to my knowledge of the

Martin Luther King, Jr., security investigation and FBI

Cointelpros.

On the same date, I prepared a letter to the

Attorney General requesting I be afforded legal counsel in l/

connection with this deposition and any possible appearance

before

the Committee, and specifying private counsel be

afforded.

I understand this

letter

was furnished by the

Legal Liaison and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel

Division, to Department Attorney John Seibert.

On 10/25/78,

Mr. Seibert appeared in my office and I briefed him in detail

regarding my need for legal representation before the HSEA,

and specifically why it was necessary I be represented by

a private attorney as opposed to a Department attorneyaz DEC 12 1978

Mr. Seibert at that time stated my request would be presented

to the Department "Representation Committee" and that I Would me

be advised in the next few days. On 11/6/78, I telephoned

Mr. Seibert and he advised a letter had been sent to Legal

" Counsel Division dated 11/3/18 requesting it affirm that I

been acting within the scope of my employment in connec-

jon with the King and Cointelpros investigations and also

Memorandum D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett

Re:

House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

62-117290

that details be set forth regarding my need for private coun-

sel as opposed to Department legal representation.

Mr. Seibert

stated if he had this information by 11/9/78, it could

immediately presented to the

be

"Representation Committee."

Legal Counsel Division memorandum dated 11/20/78

advised on 11/17/78 Mr. Seibert advised the Legal Liaison and

Congressional Affairs Unit that prior to submitting my request

for private counsel to the "Representation Committee," I

should put all material facts in a memorandum to be submitted

to Mr. Seibert through Legal Counsel Division.

While at this time it is unknown whether I will be

required to formally depose before the Committee, and it

appears remote that I will be reguired to give public testi-

mony, I still strongly desire the Department authorize my

representation by private counsel in this matter. There have

been some highly significant distortions of information by

the HSCA and a statement attributed to me was cited before

I am considering in the imme-

diate future correcting this misinformation.

RECOMMENDATIONS: 1. That Legal Counsel Division promptly

prepare for Department Attorney Seibert's

use before the "Representation Committee" a statement indi-

cating I was acting within the scope of my employment as

relates to the Martin Luther King, Jr., security investiga-

tion and the FBI Cointelpros.

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Reuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This letter supplements the request of this

Committee by letter of November 6, 1978, for all

information pertaining to Dallas Sebastian Barr, aka

Jerry Miller.

Information has been received by the Committee

which clearly reveals that Dallas Barr was a federal

narcotics informant who subsequently testified at

the trial of John Kauffmann

and others in federal

court, Kansas City, Missouri in approximately 1967.

Barr's role as an informant was obviously disclosed.

Since the Committee is investigating the allegation

that John Kauffmann was the source of an offer to

kill DI. Martin Luther King, JI.

in 1966-1967, it is

significant to determine what, if any, information of

this nature was possessed by Barr and related to law

enforcement authorities.

Therefore, the request of the Committee for all

files of Dallas Barr should result in the provision

of all materials pertaining to him regardless of any

otherwise limiting provision of the Memorandum of

Understanding between the FBI and the Committee.

Sincerely,

GRB: meh

the mail.

Iwo manila envelopes were obtained from the man

described as a white male in his early 30's, 51 o" on 10",

approximately 160 pounds, with light or blonde thinning hair.

One of the envelopes was

addressed to the FBI, the other envelope

was addressed to MARK SPEISAR, Chief Counsel, c/o Atlanta FBI,

would describe this phonetically as something like

I have not mentioned the first name

of the youth from a local Rowell family

as

not. be placed in correspendence on a subject

of this seriousness. The three letters, KKK,

descibed as drawn evidently by him merely

form a reason to believe it much more than

randomly possible that his family could include

members sympathetic

to an organization knowin

otton by those identifying letters.

As to which local family he is a

member of, I do not know and do not

personally have access to school records

which would so indicate being not, at this

House Select Committee on Assassinations

U. S.

House of Representatives (HSCA)

By way of background, the 10/17/78, HSCA request pertains

to a Memphis informant who reported on a Memphis youth gang called

the "Invaders." Deputy Assistant Attorney General Robert L. Keuch

of the Criminal Division and an Agent of this Bureau traveled to

Memphis, Tennessee, to interview this informant to see if he would

be willing to be interviewed by the HSCA. This interview pertained

to an allegation that the FBI had agent provocateurs in the "Invaders"

who incited violence thereby causing Dr. King to return to Memphis

where he was assassinated. The Memphis informant had agreed to

and was interviewed by the HSCA in Memphis and subsequently traveled

to Washington, D. C., where he was again interviewed. The work

pertaining to this request has been completed and there merely remains

written confirmation to the Department.

The 10/19/78, HSCA request also pertains to the above

Memphis informant and will be covered in the response to the 10/17/78,

request.
