CV 157-127

It is to be noted according to info of NY I-2 on

page 28, report of SA JAMES FLYNN, 7/1/63, "LA COSA NOSTRA"

CHARLES CAVALLARO was in PG at this period and CV 344-C

advises he would be known by GUISSEPPI PINDELLI.

CV 344-C stated that following PINDELLI's deportation

to Italy, he slipped back into the United States about two

months later and lived all over the United States with

members of the "organization"

moved to Warren, Ohio,

and about 1941 or 1942 at the beginning

of World War. II when it was necessary for aliens to register

PINDELLI vas arrested by Warren, Ohio PD and held for

INS.

Inasmuch as the U.S. was at war with Italy, It was

impossible

to deport PINDELLI and he was placed

on bond

of $50,000, which was put up by members of the "organization."

When the war ended and it appeared that PINDELLI's arrest was

imminent, the "organization"

indicated to him thathe should

take off

and skip his bond.

He had apparently made satisfactory'

arrangements with them, and he was not making enemies in

skipping the bona.

According to the informant, PINDELLI

then left Warren and traveled with a carnival based on

the west Coast through Calif., Oregon and Washington.

PINDELLI

was later arrested at informant's brother, FRANK's, home

at South Gate, Calif, and deported again to Italy.

PINDELLI

later immigrated legally to Buenos Aires, where his brother

ANTHONY PINDELLI, now deceased, was residing and where

PINDELLI remains

today.

According to Informant, PINDELLI:

has nephews and nieces residing at Buenos and is residing

at 1372 Centenera, Capital 24, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

Re: Pittsburgh "organization"

CV 344-C stated that GUISSEPPI PINDELLI WaS a close

associate of the seven VOLPE brothers in the PG area.

PINDELLI had told him that (FNU) SPINELLI had been one of

about three persons responsible for the murders and fled

to Italy to escape reprisal and was either apprehended

by authorities there or

"they" (the "organization") caught

him and killed him in Italy.

According to informant,

PINDELLI was very, close to the VOLPE brothers and on one

occasion when GUY VOLPE (who later died of pneumonia) was

on the "lam"', he stayed at the PINDELLI home in Scotidale,

Pa.

when GUISSEPPI PINDELLI waS in the pG area, GABRIEL and..

SAMUEL MANNARINO Of New Kensington,' Pa., were just

coming

up In

the racket activities and PINDELLI would know them

and they in turn would know about him.

He stated that

airing the same period, MIKE ACQUARO was a power in the

"organization" but at

the present time he is allegedly

dying.

He stated that although ANDREW

I MANGINI

is a member

of the "organization" he is engaged in racket activities

in the PG area.

He is actually a "nobody" as far as

power in the "organization" is concerned.

that in his opinion he is certain that RIPEPI is the

"boss" and although FRANK VALENTI attended the Apalachir

a representative of RIPEPI.

te stated that from the into he has gatherea.

respected than the Sicilian group in this area.

He stated

enterprises and there is apparently a pact that they and

the Calabrese will not encroach on each others enterprises.

CV 157-127

Regarding the Sicilian group of the "organization"

in Youngstown, CV 344-C stated he could not say if

VINCENT J. DE NIRO, bombing-murder victim, 7/17/61,

was

a member of the "organization" or not, but stated

that

DE NIRO's murders caused groat concern among 221 monters

of the "organization".

He stated that of all of the murders

committed in the Youngstown area, this was she only murder

where members of the

'organization" made active efforts to

determine the persons responsible for same.

He cited inquiry

by PRATO, TRIPODI

of Steubenville and RIPEPI of PG, as

DE NIRO was a big source of income for the group and

was

cooperative.

CV 344-C stated that the "organization" made no

inquiry with him following the bombing-murder of CAVALLARO

and for this reason he believes CAVALLARO was killed for

getting

"Out of JIne"

He stated if he had been killed

without the sanciion of the "organization" they would have

inquired as to wo killad one of their membors.

he stated

that in his opinion AVAiLARO had a portion of da NIro's

operation and apparently tried to "hog" the entire operation

after his cosin.

Regarding JASPER JOSEPH AIELLO, UR., aka "Fats"

the informant advised he is

no longer held in high respect

because he has

"gotten out of line!:

by bad publicity and

by engaging in armed robbery and burglary.

He stated that

AIELLO had formerly been well thought of and in Youngstown

was on about the same level as ANTHONY DELSANTER presently

is in Warren.

Informant stated WILLIAM NAPLES, bombing-murder

victim, 7/1/62, was killed because the

"organization" learned

he was responsible for killing DE NIRO. According to the

informant, the NAPLES brothers were

not part of either

the Calabrese or the Sicilian groups and did not contribute

to either group.

Regarding the killing of DOMINICK MOIO, whose

body was found stuffed in the trunk of his car at Canton,

ohio, 9B/63, informant stated the

"organization"

made no

inquiry about his death which would mean to him that

MOIO had "gotten out of line"

MOIO had somehow obtained

emplcyment with the NAPLES brothers and unquestionably

"set up" BILLY NAPLES for his murder.
