The attached suggested draft to

Mr. De Mohrenischildt was written without

knowledge, gf the flavor of your personal

relationship with him.

The tone may not

be appropriate, but the message boils

down to the fact that neither CIA nor

the FBI appear to have been interested

in Mr

De Mahrenschildt for a number of

years.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

None.

This memorandum is for your information.

We have also

attached at A a suggested draft reply to Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

• addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him

has been

in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings:

3. There is voluminous material on Mr.. de: Mohrenschildt in CIA

files, most.of it dating

from the post-Kennedy assassination period

when he testified before the Warren Commission on his acquaintance

with Mr. and Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald.

(A copy of the de Mohrenschildts'

testimony is attached at B.

The bulk of the material in our files consists of FBI reports,

the most recent of which is dated 1967.

The FBI has informed CIA that

traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files

contain all of its previous material on him.

Mr. Helms' 3 June 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on

the de Mohrenschildts is attached at C. It describes the Agency's

interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a

result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year.

Contact Division (now

Mr. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt at that time. The

to 1961 is also attached at C.

As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested

traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

The trace results lattached at D con-

tained sufficient derogatory information

to preclude further extensive

contact with the de Mohrenschildts.

(An OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

6. Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters addressed

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

1966: This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

vestigations. This included opening and photographing the contents of

some letters

were shared with the FBI.

7.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations. We were asked to respond to a

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is

attached at E.

8. The most recent information we have on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore wno was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company. Both writers questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt. Mr. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

at F.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer

raised serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

Both the FBI and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities by the mid-to-late

We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

tives on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy.

We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

found no indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.

It took time to explore thoroughly the matters you raised.

Let me say

first that I know it must have been difficult for you

to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter.

I believe I

can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic

death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health.

I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances.

In your situation, I can well imagine how the attentions you

described in your letter affect both you and your wife.

However, my

staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your

activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years.

flurry of interest that attended

your testimony before the Warren

Commission has long since subsided.

I can only speculate that you

may have becone "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest

in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may, be attracting the atten-

tion of people in the media.

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,

although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.

Thank you for your good wishes

on my new job. As you can imagine,

I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly yours,

Georgé Bush

The investigation reports as well as the

files of other Federal Arencies reflect the folloring:

Between 1940 and 1942 Subject was considered to be

pro-German and suspected of being a Cerman propagandist and

an espionage agent.

Several informants stated that Subject was in sympathy

with the Communist form of government in Russia but knew of no

advised in 1947 that Subject had definite Communistic tenden

Investigations failed to produce any legal competent

evidence or witnesses to substantiate the raports that Subject

questionable loyalty, reputation, and moral character.

His second wife, Phyllis whom he married on

11 July 1948 .and divorced 29 December 1949, was employed as a

receptionist by a covert project (NCFE) from 1950 to 12 January

1951 when her employment was terminated.

(Reason not given.)

Subject's brother,

Dimitri S. VON MOHRENSCHILDT, was

approved

on Il April 1950 for exploitation as a contact for

foreign intelligence purposes on

a limited basis; not to receive

classified information above confidential.

Mr. J. Walton Moore was employed by CIA in the Contact Division

office in Dallas during the early 1960's. His only contact

with the Oswald case prior to the assassination is recorded in

his 1 May 1964 memorandum to the Acting Chief, Contact

Division, attached at Tab 8 (a typed version of the document

is also attached because of the poor legibility of the

original).

He may have been involved in the Agency's effort to

support the Warren Commission during the Commission's

investi

gations. Mr. Moore has stated that he was never asked by Mr.

de Mohrenschildt for advice. concerning Oswald.

We find nọ

indication that there was ever any contact between Oswald and

Mr. Moore.

Inquiry from Richard Russell of Dial Press-Concerning Dallas Field

Office Association with Lee Harvey Oswald and George deMohrenschildt

16-08-93

-82-71

On the evening of 13 July 1976, at about 2100, Mr. Richard

Russell of the Dial Press and the Dell Publishing Company, came by

my house.

He advised that he was working on a book on the Kennedy

assassination and that he understood I was a friend of George

delihrenschild.

He wanted to know if I had ever met Lee Harvey Oswald

or if devohrenschildt. had

ever suggested that I should see Oswald.

I told him no on both counts and advised that I have not seen or

talked with George delfohrenschildi since the fall of 1961.

Mr. Russell attempted to draw me into discussion of the

Kennedy assassination which I avoided and wanted to know if I could

give him the name of the chief of the CIA office in Mexico City in

1963. I told him I could not, and he said he could probably get the

name from fir. David Phillips.

I do not foresee any adverse publicity

as a result of Mr. Russell's visit but felt that it should be made a

matter of record.

1. On 19 May 1976, Pam Butler,,

a research uriter for leader's Disest,

called on the listed line.

She identified herself as being with the

Reader's Digest and said she was doing research for a book being written

by Harry 'Epstein on the Kennedy assassination.

She asked if I had ever

talked to or met Lee Harvey Oswald.

I told her I had not.. She then asked

if I had talked to George delohrenschildt about Lee Harvey Oswald. After

I told her that I would not discuss the matter, she said that she under-

stood from deMolirenschilde that I had talked to him after he had returned

fxom a trip to Yugoslavia. I neither confirned nor denied this, and I told

her again I would not discuss the subject.

I do not know if Mis. Butler actually talked

to deMohrenschildt

or not since the information she had could have been

acquired from the

Warren Commission Report.

DIRECTOR OF. CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

I do know this man DeMohrenschildt.:

I first men

him in the early. 40'3. He was

an uncle to my Andover

roommate.

Later he surfaced in Dallas- (50's maybe)

He got involved in some controversial

dealings in Haiti.

he surfaced when Oswald shot

prominence. He knew Oswald before the.

assassination of Pres. Kennedy.

• I don't recall his role in all this.

At one time

he had /or spent plenty of

money.

I have

not heard from him for many years until

the attached letter came in.
