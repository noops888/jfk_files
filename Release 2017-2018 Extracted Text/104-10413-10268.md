Headquarters will note from the above that three lines were disconnected in

order to cover three

Yugoslav lines. Two of the lines which were disconnected

were Cuban Embassy lines, both were not in use by the Cubans. One was in

the apartment which had been vacated by Ramon Sinobas and not occupied by

Other Cubans.

The other was a telephone in the Cuban Embassy which was

never answered. The Cubans are trying to get Sinobas' line moved to the

Embassy. They have also asked for the telephone company to repair 14-92-14.

As soon as these lines are working again, coverage of two of the Yugoslav

Embassy lines will be dropped in order to pick up all the Cuban lines which

are presumed to have a much higher priority.

3. Processing of LIENVOY Information

The Station continues to receive full transcripts in Spanish on the

Cuban lines (three), the Soviet Embassy lines (five), and as of 18 and 23

September the Yugoslav lines (three). These transcripts are received each

morning for the day before. During September, the LIENVOY monitors

transcribed 1396 pages in addition to the daily resumen.

The outside translators now working on LIENVOY transcripts are

Orville HORSFALL, staff agent, who is used for almost any backlog which

begins to occur.

David B. SCHLAGETER, field contract agent, who transeribes the

Czech take.

Victor W. OBOLD, career agent, who transcribes the Yugoslav portion

of the Yugoslav take.

Douglas J. FEINGLASS, staff agent, who continues to transcribe the

Russian language portion of the Soviet take.

4. Exploitation of LIENVOY Information
