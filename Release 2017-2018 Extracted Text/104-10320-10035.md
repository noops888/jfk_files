MEMORANDUM FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

SUBJECT

Australian Press Request Regarding:

Anonymous Telephone Calls to United States

Embassy in Canberra, Australia, Relative to

Planned Assassination of President Kennedy

(Warren Commission Document 971)

Background

Mr. Peter Michelmore, an Australian newspaper representative,

has requested that we declassify CD971. This consists of a memoran-

dum from you to Mr. Rankin dated 22 May 1964 and an altachment dated

29 November 1963. Both relate to "crank" calls received by the U.S.

Naval Attache in Canberra on 15 October 1962 and 23 November 1963.

CIA first was told about these calls on 24 November 1963 by the Depart-

ment of the Navy - after the assassination of President Kennedy. A

copy of CD971 is attached for your information.

Recommendation

1. CD971 should not be released at this time. Mr. Goodwin says

he can handle the reply by phone.

2. We will initiate preparatory steps toward releasing CD971. This

entails clearance with U.S. naval intelligence and the Aust-alian security

service (the latter as a matter of courtesy).

3. Upon completion of step 2, we will submit an appropriate rec-

ommendation.

Mr. Richard M. Helms,

•Director

Central Intelligence Agency,

WASHINGTON, D. C. 20505

Dear

Mr. Helms:

This letter is to request the declassification of Warren Com-

mission Document 97, which apparently consists of a memo

written by you and is now sealed in the National Archives.

According to an article by David Wise in the Saturday Evening

Post of April 6, 1968, the description of CD 971 15:

"Anonymous telephone calls to U.S. Embassy in Canberra,

Australia relative to planned assassination of President

Kennedy. "

This material would seem to be of interest to our Australian

newspapers and, bearing in mind that this material will be

made public at

some time, I would Ilke the opportunity to 11-

spect it.

PM/ mh

Yours sincerely,

It dish

Peter Michelmore
