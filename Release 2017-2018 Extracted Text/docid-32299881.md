conversations that if agreements could be reached, 10 of the

machines would be sent to Detroit, 10 to Philadelphia, and

- 10 to Miami. Informant expressed

a desire to deal only with

the Miami area and to eliminate Detroit and Philadelphia.

this time there was no reaction to this request by informant.

the machines

to these areas and that he felt he did not wish

to assume such an expense.

Miami, Florida, was in contact with JoE MANGONE, a vending

distributor in Miami. MANGONE was described by informant as

a "cousin"to ANGELO BRUNO and MANGONE would handle the

Agreements were reached

to eliminate Detroit, as informant

strongly recommended the name of John's

Vending Company, 29th and Mc Kean Streets, Philadelphia, as

the company to handle the distribution of

the machines

in that

the distribution in the Miami area through his

'cousin.

this meeting and after the meeting ended, informant and

During this time GALILEO expressed

his extreme displeasure about meeting such individuals as

BRUNO and COLOMBO in public and indicated that he was strongly

resentful of contacting such individuals, and that this was

the last meeting.
