BACKGROUND

I. On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September. There: can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected, and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordinarily

provocative fashion

(" ... KENNEDY is a cret

" ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message"

was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the middle of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper the Times-Picayune,

on Monday: 9 September page 7, under a three-column head-

line: "CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.S.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba. '

"Bitterly denouncing what he called

be seen with new attacks.

"'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...""

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly, omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed_the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper (9 september 1963, page B-4) and revorded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

litical aspects

- in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDY®

assassination).that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headguarters attention to the AP stary very shortly after

the Dallas killing. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid-

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba.

There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis- There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Me. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat as reported above..

"OSWALD, told DELGADO that he was

this country, which DELGADO at first took

to be 'one of his lies, but later

10. Actually DEIGADO's testimony says a lot more of

possible operational significance than is reflected by the

language of the report, and its implications do not appear

to have been run down or developed by investigation. Thus,

the record of the beginning of OSWALD's relationship with

the Cubans starts with a question mark.

11. The period was one of transition in U.S. - Cuban

relations after CASTRO's takeover. OSWALD, and DELGADO at

the outset, were CASTRO supporters, OSWALD being particu

larly keen about how to get to the island. DELGADO testi-

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and

a half to twa hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States. The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

there reporting from Los Angeles to Washington and Havana

INTERCEPTED: CONVERSATION OF CUBAN EMBASSY EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

1730 Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden-

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

newS.

"Iuisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of course, I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ...

20.

Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Luisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had been

called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coincide with the burial. Finally she

said she planned to move that night into the house of

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

a. "Luisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directörate Genéral of Intelligence (DGI).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headguarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S SUCCeSSOI)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c.

The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness

on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City. Her testimony, however, in its

entirety was taken and presented, solely, by

the

Mexican Governmental authoritias. A direct

confrontation with her was requested by the

Warren Commission staff but rejected by the

Mexican authorities. It is from Silvia DURAN's

statements that it was learned that OSWALD

became engaged in a personal altercation on

27 September with Eusebio AZCUE.

₫. Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez,

alias Marcos, and his DGI assistant,

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February 1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

and facilitation of the training of Nicaraguan

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, "it is estab-

lished, was on post in Mexico City during

OSWALD's stay there 27. September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals

going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first.

He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days. 5

23. There-is no evidence in the OSWALD case file that

Silvia DURÁN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

krong ot confirmed by intercept, with the data held

on the

Cuban DGI, its personalities and methods, in

Mexico City-

Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,

considering the fuss he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the

DGI chief?

Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

fundamental question:

accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VIGA is later fited by

a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware oswALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfaced in the DURAN

Fair Play Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD established

relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

2 November 1963.

There is an overlap between LEE's and

VEGA's travels to Havana during that period:

departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returred

on 13 February 1963.

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia DURAN

testimony already have been suggested above.

(In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,

and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,

because the thrust of the conversation dealt with the ques-

tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about lor been

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN

was reported by a reliable and sensitive

source to have

cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967, 0f

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

security service contral into the case.

28. The ALVARADA story is a particularly acute repre-

sentation of the difficulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose

account did not become public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena CARRO de Paz is a mecurial,

ticulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official-

She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena CARRO's trenchant anti-Communism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1959, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964=

"Elena GARRO [said] that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the Cuban

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing

around together like threa bumps on a

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that "they were just passing

through." She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good lo0k

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos 'without a doubt" at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

In September 1963 after her return from abroad, she went

to a party, accompanied by her daughter, at the home of

in certain particulars significantly modified her earlier

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been interviewed by Embassy officers io whom she claimed

they dia not give a very complete story because the

Embassy officers dia not appear to give much exedence

tO

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been

interviewed by the Legal Attache on 11 and 24 November 1961.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substanttated by inquiries.

The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed

and reatfirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Political Officer,

however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, GARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont.

36. There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about
