Germany,

Dear Mr. Coollek,

Thank you for your acknowledgement of October 31, which arrived

yesterday.

Should you become interested in WHITEWASH: THE REPORT ON THE WARREN REPORT,

for us both 11 you contact my British agent,

St, Martin's Lane, C. ENGLAND, Phones,

Temple Bar 8985/1320. My confidence

In and my relationship with Harbord

are such that

I have empowered him to make any

arrangement he wants for my

without consultation

with me. I tell you this

because this subject 1s opening much more rspidly that the press indtiates or

the recent givernment actions supposedl.

These are fradduèant actions intended to and actually accomplishing further supoross-

10n. Mr. Herbord how had two additional artiches on this subjects and I project a#

least a third as soon as my newest book;

TEWASH II: WHO DID IT! Is published. I

anticipate this will be soon.

The sequel

way duplicate WHITEWASH. The two,

proposed book by MuRold WelsheRs

together, are

parts of my own report on the larren Report. The second, coming largely

ly suppressed documents that have been kept out ofithe record

and until now unpublish-

ed, is in some ways more shocking than the first book. Mr. Harbord has an almost

complete copy of this that he can probably show you if you have a representative in

England. This book is perhaps the strongest indictment, ad self-indictment,

federal police, and intelligence agencies. I have

tually, print à supplement of just these documents and pictures, in lescimile. It

1s an overwhelming thing..

Thank you for your interest.

Sincerely,

Hardelle
