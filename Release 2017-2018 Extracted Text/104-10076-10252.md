TACLO COMMENT BECAUSE OF THE CLOSE PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP

BETWEEN THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION IN PARAGRAPH I AND THE SOURCE

OF THE INFORMATION IN PARAS 2 AND 4, THIS INFORMATION CANNOT GE

CONSIDERED CONFIRMATORY. THERE MAVE BLEN VARIOUS SCAITERED REPORTS

FROM A VARICTY NE SOURCES WHICH HAVE INDICATED DISAGRÉÉMENTS AMONG

THE CUBAN GOVERNMENT HIERARCHY. THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SUPPORT FOR

A THEORY THAT FIDEL CASTRO IS ONCE AGAIN TRYING TO PURGE THE

HIERARCHY OF OLO LINE COMMUNISTS. THE EXPULSION OF JUAN. (MARINELLO"

VIRAURETTA FROM HIS POSITION AS RECTOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HABANA

IS VIEWED IN SOME QUARTERS AS AN INDICATION OF SUCH A PURGES IT MAS

ALSO BEEN INTIMATED THAT FIDEL CASTRO WILL TRY TO GET RID OF SUER PART

STALWARTS AS BLAS ROCA ANO LAZARO PENA IN ACTIONS SIMILAR TO THE

ANDAL ESCALANTE TAURO THERE WAS OND RUMOR TO THE EFFECT

THAT LUEL LADIO HIMSELE HAD KEGENILE MESDILU IME SOVIST UNION,

THIS RUMOR WAS STRENGHTENED BY THE FACT THAT NEITHER FIDEL NOR RAU

ATTENDO THE SOVIET EMBASSI PARTY FOR THE ANNIVERSARY OF THE ORLAT

OCTOBER REVOLUTION, AND THAT FIDEL HAS NOT BEEN MARING ASPEARANCES OR

MEETING PEOPLE, WHERE NORMALLY HE WOULD BE THE GREETER, ONE REPORTING
