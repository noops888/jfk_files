MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Lee Harvey Oswald there.

everyone. He is categorical in saying that neither he nor

his wife

ever saw a photograph of Lee Oswald. While neither

he nor his wife reviewed all the photography (a responsibility

of Anne Goodpasture) he would have seen it had it existed.

He feels that Oswald's appearance was so distinctive that

it would have made an impression on him. He said that in

his meetings with the HSCA he had told them his personal

convictions, which he still holds, that there was "no

conspiracy

at the Station."

He worked the Soviet target

and would more than likely have seen all pictures. In sun,

and wife are convinced that the Station had no

photographs of Oswald; and that the Mexican photo LP

operators are probably alone responsible for not having

taken pictures of Oswald's entries or exists of the Soviet

Embassy.

5. Following the assassination of President Kennedy,

recalls

a number of Agency personnel listening to

radio broadcasts.

When the name of Oswald occurred, his

first reaction was, "My God, that's the man I reported on."

Someone else may have responded similarly but he recalls

that as his reaction. This led to a cable to Headquarters.

6. Speaking in a rather all-inclusive way he said

that there were no photographs of Oswald there then, so

there were none to burn or destroy afterwards.

He repeated that there was no conspiracy and he

told the HSCA people that they were "barking up the wrong

tree."

I said that at the time he testified he did

not know about the statement in Win Scott's memoire so

there was no occasion to comment on it.

He reported later that his wife had nothing addi-

tional to offer.

I told him that I would prepare a draft

memo of

the conversation and show it to him before putting

it into final form, which was done.
