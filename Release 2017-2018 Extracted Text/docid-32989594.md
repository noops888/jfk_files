Taylor is one

of three Los Angeles, California, Black Panther Party members

on trial in the Superior Court in California for attempted

murder of a policeman on September 10, 1971.

Throughout the

trial the defendant has attempted to establish that the FBI's

Counterintelligence Program harassed the defendants and

caused them to commit the crime.

The defense has subpoenaed

and is introducing the oral testimony of Arthur Jefferson who

qualified as an expert witness on the basis of being an investi-

gator or employee of the Senate Select Committee. Mr. Jefferson

is identified in the Select Committee's reports as counsel

and

as one of two principal staff authors of the Select Committee's

report,

"The FBI's Efforts to Disrupt and Neutralize the Black

Panther Party."

In addition to the Los Angeles trial

Former FBI employees have been named as co-defendants in a

civil action captioned,

Honorable Daniel K. Inouye

Rule 7.6 states, "Before the Committee is called upon

or other materials présented to it

to make any disposition with respec the committee members shall

have a reasonable opportunity to examine all pertinent testimony,

papers and other materials that have been obtained by the Com-

mittee staff. No members shall release any such testimony,

papers, or other materials, or any information contained in

any person outside the

majority. vote of the entire Committee, or after the termination

of the Committee, in such manner as may be determined by the

Senate."

Given the above, I question the propriety of

Mr. Jefferson's appearance at the Los Angeles and Chicago

Black Panther Party trials

and qualifying as an expert witness

on the basis of his former employment with Senate Select Com-

mittee.

I also question the propriety of Ms. De Oreo assisting

the plaintiffs' attorney in the Eldridge Cleaver case. I bring

this matter to your attention for whatever action you deem

advisable and for your consideration in drafting guidelines for

employees of-the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.

Sincerely yours,

Clarence M. Kelley

in legal proceedings in Los Angeles and Chicago.

SYNOPSIS: In a state court case in Los Angeles, California,

involving Taylor, a former BPP member on trial for attempted

murder of a policeman in 1971, the defense has tried to

establish that the FBI's Counterintelligence Program (COINTELPRO)

harassed the defendant and caused him to commit the crime.

In its latest action the defense has subpoenaed 65 documents

from our Los Angeles and San Diego offices.

Review of these

documents indicate they

I the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) in Los Angeles

and the Department of Justice in Washington, D. C., are being

testimony of Arthur Jefferson, reportedly an employee or in-

vestigator of the SSC who allegedly authored SSC report on

FBI harassment of BPP, particularly in California.

SSC final

report dated 4/28/76, confirms Jefferson's connection with the

SSC.

In addition, Jefferson is listed as witness for the

plaintiffs in the Iberia Hampton civil suit in Chicago and our

COINTELPRO efforts against the BPP have also been interjected

DETAILS:

Los Angeles Situation

Harold Taylor is one of three Los Angeles BPP

members on trial in the Superior Court in California for

attempted murder of a policeman on 9/10/71. Throughout the

trial the defense has attempted to establish that the FBI's

COINTELPRO harassed the defendants and caused them to •

commit the crime.

On 5/24/76 Los Angeles advised that the defense

attorney in this case, Beth Lizsey has subpoenaed, and is

introducing the oral testimony of Arthur Jefferson. Jefferson

qualified as an expert witness on the basis of being an

investigator or employee of the SSC and reportedly authored

the Committee's report about alleged FBI harassment and

illegal activities against the BPP, particularly in California.

According to the prosecutor in the case, Jefferson's testimony

to date has been before the jury.

On 5/25/76 Los Angeles advised that a subpoena

duces tecum was received on 5/25/76 in the Taylor case and

directed to Custodian of Records, FBI, Los Angeles ano

San Diego Divisions. The subpoena called for production or 25

documents of the Los Angeles office and 40 documents of the .

San Diego office. These documents were specifically identified

according to date and whether they were prepared at FBIHQ or

in the field. The subpoena states the documents are material

to the issue involved and relevant to the defense of Taylor,

a member of the BPP.

In its review of the list of documents Los Angeles

was able to identify 21 of the 25, all of which relate to the

BPP COINTELPRO file. The documents are of general nature

pertaining to the disruptive tactics against the BPP and none

mentioned Taylor. Similarly, San Diego determined all

communications located which were named in the subpoena

were in its COINTELPRO file and none contained any reference

to Taylor.

Los Angeles and San Diego recommended documents

not be made available to the defense and the Intelligence

Division and Legal Counsel Division concur.

AUSA Dominick

Rubalcava, Los Angeles is handling this matter but to date

has been unsuccessful in contacting Departmental Attorney

Gordon Daiger, Washington, D. C., for his opinion regarding

production of the documents.

Rubalcava stated he is making

Daiger, but feels documents subpoenaed should not be made

available unless the entire trial would be

jeopardized.

Rubalcava believes court appearances pertaining to production

of documents will not be scheduled until approximately 6/1/76.

He advised the defense counsel is utilizing expert testimony

of Arthur Jefferson who is testifying concerning FBI actions

undertaken nationwide to disrupt BPP activity.

On 5/26/76 Mr. R. F. Peterson of the Legal Counsel

Division contacted Daiger who stated he has not been in

contact with Rubalcava concerning the matter. Pending dis-

cussion with Rubalcava, Daiger will render an opinion

regarding production of the documents.

Chicago Situation

FBI employees,

former employees and an informant

have been named as co-defendants in the case captioned

Our COINTELPRO has been

interjected into this trial by the plaintiffs to the point

Steven Blackhurst, Assistant Special Counsel on

San Diego has submitted five cartoons containing

caricatures of high BPP officials in which they are portrayed as

exploiting rank and file members. The cartoons indicate that

the US organization, another West Coast black extremist

organization, considers the BPP to be ineffectual and corrupt.

These are clever cartoons which belittle the Panthers and

substantial amounts of money from the local BPP membership,

is also passing information on to local police authorities.

This caricature is aimed at BOBBY SEALE's announced program

For your information, reports concerning the cartoons mailed

in the san Diego are currently being received through San Diego

sources.

They indicate that the cartoons of KARENGA have

caused a great deal of confusion and apprehension,

particularly concerning who could be responsible for the

cartoons.

Several individual BPP members who have defected

to the US organization or who have ties with the white

community have been discussed by active BDP members as

suspects.

The local police department was also mentioned as

suspect but this theory was almost immediately abandoned.

The general, and final consensus of opinion at this time,

is that the US organization is "now ready to move" against

the BPP.

In addition to the mailing of the cartoons to

individual BPP members, two envelopes, each containing

three cartoons, are being mailed to the various BPP headquarters.

Copies are also being mailed to local underground

newspapers in the San Diego and Los Angeles areas..

In the event recipient offices feel additional

members should be on the "mailing list" or if it is felt

inclusion of local underground newspapers would be of benefit,

it is requested that the appropriate names and addresses be

furnished to San Diego.

Caution should be exercises

that the furnishing

of names and addresses of individuals will in no way

jeopardize confidential sources.

of some Panther members.

San Diego requests authority to make an

Tate that Wallace has named Tate as a police informant in order to

take suspicion off himself. This is being authorized. San Diego's

request to place all añonymous telephone call to Sylvester Bell,

another Panther by the name of Baker is about to be arrested, is

being denied. Although San Diego states it will not place its call

Re San Diego letter to the Bureau 2/27/69.

For the information of the Bureau, at the time the

five members of the Black Panther Party (BPP) were arrested in

Los Angeles, California, on information furnished under the

Counterintelligence Program, TOMMY HORNE was among those

taken into custody.

At the

time of the arrest 17 rounds

of ammunition were

found in HORNE's pocket. Located behind

the front seat of the vehicle was a blue steel automatic

Beretta Pietro made in Italy.

Investigation has revealed that the weapon was

purchased by LARRY BAKER, the current Treasurer of the BPP

in San Diego, in the company of WALTER WALLACE On 1/2/69.

As a result, the California State Attorney General's

Office, San Diego, California, is currently attempting to obtair

a felony warrant charging HORNE, who is a convicted felon, of

possession of the weapon and a misdemeanor warrant charging

BAKER with the purchase of the weapon.

On 3/5/69, JOHN HARVEY and SYLVESTER BELL, Who 1s

Lieutenant of Security of the BPP in San Diego, approached

WALTER WALLACE in the presence of several other BPP members

the point of visible shaking and replied, "Well then its Baker."

It is pointed out to the Bureau that a Bureau approved

anonymous telephone call was

placed to SYLVESTER BELI

indicating that WALTER WALLACE was a police agent. It is

felt that the confrontation of WALLACE by BELL and HARVEY

is primarily the result of this anonymous telephone call.

As a result of the anticipated arrest of BAKER on

the above warrant which the California State Attorney General's

Office is attempting to obtain, WALLACE will appear as being

a suspected informant more strongly than ever.

Bureau authority is therefore requested to place

•an anonymous telephone call to ZEKE TATE advising TATE that

WALLACE has named him as a police agent in order to protect

his own hide.

It is also requested that authority be granted to

place another anonymous telephone call to SYLVESTER BILL

on the day that BAKER is arrested asking BELL if he had had

a chance to check the information previously furnished him

concerning WALLACE. In the same call a warning will be issued

to BELL that LARRY BAKER is about to be arrested as a result

of WALLACE informing on him.

If the call is placed the same day or the day

after BAKER is arrested, it will in no way jeopardize the

arrest and will be considered reliable information by BeLL

who will either be aware of the arrest at the time of the call

or will learn of it shortly after the call.

It is not felt that the above will in any way

jeopardize the security or confidential relationship of any

informant.

In view of the pending arrest of BAKER and the

necessity of placing the call, if approvea, at the most

opportune moment,

the Bureau is requested to expedite their

evaluation of the

above requests.

No UFAP process has been issued nor does it appear to be

OPERATIONS BEING EFFECTED

One of the

Bureau approved anonymous

telephone calls

has been placed to Auxiliary Bishop JOHN QUIN protesting the

BPP Breakfast Program and Father CURRAN's participation therein.

This particular call,

originally scheduled to be third in

a series of three calls, was made first due to the fact that

this particular call appears

to be more timely at this time

In order to achieve maximum affect. Tangible results

concerning this activity appear in the next section of this

letter.

The intensive interview program of BPP members is

continuing in the San Diego Division.

The, specific tangible

results thus far observed concerning the interview program

are very difficult to assess.

==.

III.

TANGIBLE RESULTS

The BPP Breakfast Program appears to be floundering

in San Diego due to lack of public support and unfavorable

publicity concerning it. It is noted that it has presently

Been

temporarily suspended.

Therefore, it was felt that

"placing the above mentioned anonymous call to the Bishop at

this particular time might be a significant factor in

The information

fact that one of his Priests

vas deeply involved in utilization of church facilities for

-this purpose.

This matter, of course, will be closely

• followed for further anticipated developments concerning the

"Breakfast Program.

====.

40019=100.

-Although no specific counterintelligence action can be

credited with contributing to this over-all situation, it is

_felt that a substantial amount of the unrest is directly

-attributable to this program.

As mentioned above, the San Diego Police Department

- has been advised that RON FREEMAN is believed to be hiding

The location of specific

-residences which FREEMAN occupied as of two days ago has been

furnished to the police department. It is anticipated that,

if FREEMAN remains in the San Diego area, he will be arrested

in the immediate future. This, of course, is contingent defErAl

upon the specific movements of FREEMAN and whether or not

he will elect to leave his particular hiding place at any

given time.

In the event that FREEMAN should go to the

Los Angeles area, SD 1212-R will be aware of his new location.

This development, if it occurs, will then enable the San Diego

Office to supply FREEMAN'S LOS Angeles address to the

LOS Angeles Police Department with assurance of safety as it

concerns the informant/@u.

Information

concerning the possibility of US

headquarters being bombed on the weekend of 8/30/69, was

furnished to the San Diego Police Department prior to the

actual bombing.

it is felt that the furnishing of this

information mighü have been a major factor in precluding

any injury of innocent persons at the time the actual

bombing took place.

IV.

DEVELOPMENTS OF COUNTERINTELLIGENCE INTEREST

The "gang type" war between the BPP and US

continues at the prosent time.

It also appears there is increased unrest within

the ranks of the BPP in San Diego and reports have been

received concerning very severe punishments being administered

to members who do not perform as

the leaders of the party

believe they should. For example, JEFFERY JENNINGS has

reportedly been severely beaten by BPP officials for failure

time JOHN

SAVAGE

was fatally shot. PEACHES MC INTYRE was "beaten up" for

failure to abide by instructions given her by visiting BPP

members of the Los Angeles area. Other similar incidents have

also been noted, all apparently in an effort to establish

more rigid discipline within the ranks of the party.

On 8/30/69, the new US headquarters building at

4183 Market Street,

San Diego, was bombed through utilization

of a pipe bomb.

The device was made of 1i" pipe, capped at

both ends, and

filled with shotgun powder. No injuries were

sustained

but damage was extensive.

No suspects have been

arrested. However, it is believed

that the BPP is responsible

for the bombing. Efforts are being made to determine how

this situation can be capitalized upon for the benefit of

the Counterintelligence Program and any possibilities will

immediately be submitted for approval by the Bureau.

This connunication is in response to questions

presented in referenced menorandun pertaining to the Sin Diego

questions concerning allegations that West Coast Offices of the

Federal burrau of investigation (FBI), particularly San Diego,

claimed credit for the state of violent curmoil in the black

community.

SECRET ARUX ORCANIZANION

Recent allegations against the FBI relating to the

- SAO have appeared in the Sin Diego, California, 'Union Nevspaper'i

In a nine-part series that began January I1, 1976.

These news articles, allege that the FBI created

and fininced the SAO and controlled the activities of this

group through an informant who vas a leader of this irganisation.

These articles indicate that through this informant the FBI

supplied SAU vith $10,000 to $20,000 worth of weapons and

explosives.

SAO, now defunct, was an anticommunist paramilitary

Organization founded in 1971 by jerry lynn Davis.

Its

objectives vere to concuct intelligence-type operations

and offer training in urban suerrilla warfare to be used

agailst "left-ring groups."

to SAO activities.

The results of our inquiry to date disclose no

information indicating that we were responsible for the

formation, control or financing of the SAl. The former

Informant contacted the San Diego Office January 12, 1976,

and advised that to the best of his knowledge, he did not state

Upon the completion of the Inquiry presently being

conducted into these allegations, you will be advised of

further developnents.

It should be noted that on January 6, 1975, the

American Civil Liberties Union (iCLU) filed a civil action in

the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of California

on behalf of teter Bohmer and aula Tharp. The ACLU alleges

This civil suit, which has been emence, to include George

Katsiaficas and

Shart Whitchead, as plaintiffs, is still in

litigation.

This civil action is presently being hendied by

the Crininal Division, Speciel Litigation Section of your

Department.

In response to the question raised in referenced

menorancum wlich asked if there were other activities of this

sort occurring in other parts of the country, it should be

pointed out that' the FBI has never organized, financed of in

any way utilized an extremist organization to accomplish

illegel activities. Cur policy is to have informants infiltrate

extremist organizations operating within the United States.

Informants are encouraged to advance to & position within the

group there they will have access to policy mking discussions,

they are told to discourage violent acts by the group and are

instructed not so violate the law.. If it is deternined that

an informant is not rellable, his

file is closed and we

solicit no aúditional infornation from him. There are always

inherent risks when one deals with individuals who have agreed

to associate wich groups geared for violence. At this time

we have no informacion indicating activities of this sort

occurred in other parts of the country; however, at a future

time similar allegations nay be made. In that evenc we vill

address ourselves to the allegations and furnish you with the

results of our findings.

The Senate Select Comnittee on Intelligence Activities

(SSC) has furnished certain informacion to menbers of the press

concerning the FBI's Counterintelligence Frogran (COLNTLERO) ,

Including a memorandum from Special Agent in Charge, San Diego,

to the Director dated September 18, 1969.

This memorandum

contains a statement that "Shootings, beatings, and a high

degree oi unrest continues to prevail in the ghetto frea of

southeast San liego, Although no specific COINTELIRO action

cait be credited with contributing to this over-all situation,

It is felt that a substantial amount of the uncest is directly

attributable to the Program, News articles reporting this

statoent have inferred that COINIBLFID actions directed against

the Black Panther Party (Bil) and US, both violence-prone .

block extremist organizations wich chapters in the San Diego

and Los Angeles areas, caused

shootings and other violent acts.

"As you are avere, memorandum prepared at FBI

Headquarters (FBIHQ) outlining the aims and intent of

COINTELIRO actions clearly set forth the fact that the purpose

was to prevent, racher than foster, violence. The fact that chis

was clearly understood by our field offices is apparent considering

that a thorough review of our rocords does not disclose a single

of the paragraph cited above is a poor choice of words and

should have been challenged upon its receipt at FBIRQ as to

what was actually intanded.

In rebuttal to inferences that the FBI encouraged

prevent violence fron occurring in numerous instances.

Re Bureau letter, 1/6/69; Chiçago letter, 12/16/68;

and Chicago airtel and LHil, 1/7/69.

The first two of the above communications were

captioned as above, the latter under the BPP caption.

In the Chicago letter of December 16, 1968, a

suggestion was made that an anonymous mailing be sent JEFF

FORT,

leader of the Blackstone Rangers, advising of BPP efforts

to discredit him, and in eitect to "take over" the pangers.

events have subsequently developed, as set forth in reterenced

Chicago airtel and LuM.

the Rangers and the BPP have not only

• =

not been able to form any alliance, but enmity and distrust have

arisen, to the point where each have been ordered to stay out of

the others territory. The BPP has since decided to conduct no

activity or attempt to do any recruiting in Ranger territory.

It appears therefore that the letter as originally

intended at this point would serve no useful purpose.

The end

In view appears to nave been very quickly arrived at, in great

...

measure by virtue of the inherent inability of two such voatile

and power conscious groups to derogate any of their status or

assumed authority to the other.

From information recently received, it appears, however,

that the BPP has not entirely abandoned all hope of utilizing-

the Rangers for their own purposes.

Some feeling has been evident

that FORT may not continue indefinitely in his position of leader-

ship with the Rangers, most probably a reference to various

criminal charges facing him.

it is clear, nowever, that so

long as he is in this position, any working arrangement between

the

two groups will be on Ranger terms.

The above would be sent to FORT in care of the First

It is believed the above may intensify the degree of

animosity between the two groups and occasion FORT to take

retaliatory action which could disrupt tze BPP. or lead to

reprisals against its leadership.

been given to a similar letter

to the BPP, alleging a Ranger plot against the BPP leadership:

however, it is not felt this would be productive, principally

since the BPP at present is not believed as violence-prone as

the Rangers, to whom violent type activity; shooting, and the

I1ke,

are second nature,

There is also the possibility that

future contact between the two viere to take place, and it

became apparent that both had received such communications,

then an outside interest would be somewhat obvious.

Chicago will take no action regarding the above,

pending Bureau authorization.

In his view, the accusation is supported by the Select Com-

mittee's report which contains FBI documents showing the

Bureau's purpose was to cause murder.

The Bureau's response,

expressed to the. Attorney General in reply to his inquiry

about this same matter, is that the EBl took steps to prevent

violence.

Jut purpose in attempting to cause trouble between

the Panthers and the Blackstone Rangers was to prevent any

cooperative endeavors by the two violence-prone groups. Mate-

rials cited in this memorandum are attached to the original.

The Director objected to Mr. Wills' statements depicting

untrue,

malicious, and insulting Mr. Wills'

statement that law

enforcement agencies have engaged in almost every conceivable

crime, including murder.

The Director wrote that Mr. Wills'

"malicious statement...is not true about the FBI."

The Director

concluded his letter by stating he hoped that in all fairness

his letter would be given the same distribution as Mr. Wills'

CLAIMING SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

REPORI

SHOWS FBI-COINTELPRO-BLACK PANTHER DOCUMENTS

SUPPORT HIS EARLIER ALLEGATIONS

The third from the last paragraph of the May, 1976,

column alleges "that the Senate Committee reported that the

Bureau tried to block its investigative efforts and refused

documents. that were only pried loose by court order."

This

statement is not an accurate anaylsis of what happened.

The FBI did refuse to furnish the Senate Select

Committee documents, but we did so because of a valid court

order. Furnishing the documents would have violated that

court order. A civil suit was instituted in United States

District Court in Chicago, Illinois, by the relatives of

Fred Hampton and Mark Clark.

The defendants were Special

Agents of

the FBI and local law enforcement officers.

The

plaintiffs' theory was that an FBI informant furnished infor-

mation to Special Agents of the FBI who relayed the informa-

tion to local law enforcement officers. Upon receipt of the

information, the local officers raided certain premises in

Illinois.

During the raid Hampton and Clark were killed.

The court issued a protective order prohibiting the parties

Irom disclosing intormation to anyone other than each other

in the course of pretrial discovery.

The Senate Select Committee requested the Department

of Justice to seek a modification of the order to allow the FBI

and the Department of Justice to submit pertinent documents

to the Senate Select Committee.

The Department responded that

its duty was to the Special Agents, and for the Department to

seek a modification of the order on behalf of the Senate Select •

Committee. could create a conflict of interest.

agreed to hire private counsel for the Senate Select Committee

for the purpose of seeking a modification of the order.

This

was done and the judge modified the order so that it would not

prohibit the furnishing of documents to the Senate Select Com-

mittee.

Once the order was modified, the Senate Select Commit-

tee was furnished the documents.

Party,"

and the following observations are made concerning

statements in paragraph three of his article.

In this paragraph Wills advises that the SSC's re-

port details at least three sustained campaigns meant to foment

illegal killings of Black Panthers.

These are: (1) Use of

fake letters to make Black Panthers murder each other;

(2) Pitting the Panthers against Ron Karenga's Black organiza-

tion (US) in California; and (3) Trying to stir trouble be-

tween the Panthers and the Blackstone Rangers in Chicago.

After a review of the three COINTELPRO activities, it

is believed that number one and number two refer to the same

activity. Pages 188, 190, 191, and 192 of the SSC report have

footnotes which refer to a memorandum from FBIHQ to Baltimore

Field Office (and 13 other offices), dated November 25, 1968,

(Tab D) and communications from the San Diego Field Office to

FBIHQ dated February and March, 1969, (Tab E) and September 18,

1969, (Tab F). containing a statement that "Shootings, beatings

and a high degree of unrest continued to prevail in the

area of San Diego.

Although no specific COINTELPRO action can be

credited with contributing to this over-all situation, it is

felt that a substantial amount of the unrest is directly

attributable to the Program."

Wills' article, quoting the

SSC report; infers that COINTELPRO actions directed against

the Black Panthers and US, both violence-prone Black extremist

organizations, caused shootings and other acts of violence.

This COINTELPRO action was explained previously. by

memorandum to the Attorney General dated January 23, 1976,

captioned "San Diego Operations,"

(Tab G.) which was

prepared in

response to a memorandum of the Attorney General dated January 14,

1976. We advised the Attorney General that the FBI took

measures to prevent violence from occurring in numerous in-

stances. In some cases COINTELPRO actions were not approved

if physical violence appeared likely to occur.

In connection

with the BPP/US investigations, the following instances in

which the FBI acted to prevent violence were noted:

GARRY WILLS' COLUMN, MAY 21, 19/0,

CLAIMING SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE REPORT

SHOWS FBI-COINTELRPO-BLACK PANTHER DOCUMENTS

SUPPORT HIS EARLIER ALLEGATIONS

By teletype dated November 4, 1968, Los Angeles

advised that the BPP planned to kill two US members. FBIHQ

responded by teletype November. 5, 1968, instructing that the

Los Angeles Police Department be

alerted and that the two

potential victims also be advised of the threat on their

lives.

On August 30, 1969, information was received con-

cerning the possibility of US Headquarters in San Diego being

bombed. This information was furnished to the San Diego Police

Department and San Diego Sheriff's Office prior to the actual

bombing on August 30, 1969.

The information concerning the

bomb threat had been received from the California Bureau of

Investigation.

The third campaign which Wills mentions, that of

trying to stir trouble between the Black Panther Party and

Blackstone Rangers in Chicago, Illinois, is discussed on page

188 of the SSC report. An anonymous letter was sent to

Jeff Fort, leader of the Blackstone Rangers, a Chicago street

gang, falsely informing him that the Chicago Panthers had

a hit out"

on him.

Authority for mailing this letter was

requested by Chicago letter January 13; 1969, (Tab H). Bureau

authority was granted for Chicago to send this letter on

January. 30, 1969, (Tab I).

The

goals of these COINTELPROs clearly centered

around the Bureau's efforts to prevent and curtail violent

action within the extremist. black nationalist movement.

In

order to achieve this objective, it was readily apparent that

coalitions of violence-prone black extremist groups should be

prevented. It was obvious that violent factions would in-

tensify their strength by joining forces which would have been

the case if the Blackstone Rangers and the Black Panther Party

• had been allowed to form a coalition.

Obviously our objective

here was to insure that these extremist groups did not joir

forces, which if allowed to occur, would have been a danger

to local law enforcement and a threat to the tranquility of

the black community.

REATMEAG SENATE SELECIM, MAY 2E REPORT

CLAIMING SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE

SHOWS FBI-COINTELPRO-BLACK: PANTHER DOCUMENTS

SUPPORT HIS EARLIER ALLEGATIONS

The interpretation of terms used in Chicago letter

of January 13, 1969,

tò intensify.:."animosity, retaliatory

actIon,

and reprisals" is subjective.

Based on the recollec-

tion of Agents at Headquarters and in the field and extensive

file reviews, it may be said that to the best of our knowledge

no violent actions resulted from this letter.

We probably can

assume that the results most likely increased rhetoric between

the groups and prevented a coalition of the two groups.

The following quotations appear in Wills' article:

Paragraph 2: "violent-type activity, shootings and

the like are second nature" to such gangs. This quotation

appears on page 197 of the SSC report and was taken from

Chicago letter January 13, 1969.

Paragraph 4: "A substantial amount of the current

unrest is directly attributable to this (FBI) program."

This

quotation appears on page 192-193 of the SSC report and was

taken from San Diego letter dated September 18, 1969.

Paragraph 4: "threats of murder" were at stake,

J. Edgar Hoover. himself ordered that the FBI "exploit all

avenues of creating further dissension" among Panthers. These

quotations appear on page 188 of the SSC report. Both quota-

tions in paragraph 4

were taken from Bureau letter to Baltimore

and 13 other offices dated November 25, 1968.

Paragraph 5: "and then grant nature the opportunity

to take. her. course.

This quotation appears on page 189 of

the SSC report and was taken from Los Angeles letter dated

May 26, 1970.

PURPOSE: For the information of the Director and other

Bureau officials, this is to advise of reported instances

of Senate Select Committee (SSC) improprieties and other

shortcomings which we have brought to Department's

attention with intention that it advise the SSC, but which

the Department has indicated a refusal to do.

SYNOPSIS: In recent months we have learned of instances

of SSC Staff improprieties or other shortcomings.

Facts

brought to Department's attention so it may advise SSC.

We

have learned that Deputy Attorney General (DAG) decided

to not bring matters to SSC's attention.

Briefly, these

matters concern following (I)SSC-published Hearings on

Huston Plan contained an unexcised Bureau communication

identifying electronic surveillance targets. Elliff of SSC

admitted their error, attributed it to an oversight.

(2) In

the matter concerning former Bureau informant Larr

Grathwohl,

he told us of slanted, biased and less-than-objective

interview of him in July, 1975, by SSC Staff Member Michael

Epstein.

We furnished the Department copy of Grathwohl's

letter of 1/28/76 containing these allegations. (3) When

former Bureau intormant Dougtass

sucham was interviewed

by SSC personnel in May, 1975, they indicated strong desire

to discredit FBI and asked if Durham could "come up with

some dirt on FBI!' because there was strong support "to nail

the FBI to the cross." Durham put his allegations in form

of a letter, a copy of which we furnished to the Department.

(4) Another matter concerned a former Klan informant,

George Porsett, whose identity was disclosed, allegedly by

an unidentified SSC source.

DETALS: In recent months there has come to our attention

a number of instances where reports to us indicate impro-

prieties or other shortcomings on the part of SSC personnel.

We have generally brought these situations to the attention

of the Department with the suggestion or request that an

accompanying memorandum, containing the specific details, be

Furnished to the SSC. The general practice of the Department

in these situations has been to not advise us if it decides

to not forward our memorandum to the SSC, even though we

have, in some instances, specifically requested to be

advised of the Department's final judgment on the matter.

As a result, we have taken positive steps by oral inquiry

of the office.of Mr. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., Special Counsel

for Intelligence Coordination, to determine the Department's

final judgment in several pending situations.

By letter dated 3/30/76 from Mr. Steven Blackhurst,

Assistant to Shaheen, entitled "FBI Memoranda Not Sent To

Senate Select Committee," we were advised that the "Deputy

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

Attorney General has instructed that we not send the

following FBI memoranda to the Senate Select Committee."

There were then listed four situations as follows:

(1) memorandum 3/16/76 regarding failure to get clearance

of Huston Plan materials; (2) memorandum 3/16/76 regarding

"Los Angeles Times" article concerning Senator Henry

Jackson; (3) memorandum 2/20/76 enclosing letter from

former informant Larry Grathwohl; and (4) memoranda 1/19

and 2/13/76 regarding SSC contacts with former informant

Douglass Durham.

Briefly, these situations concern the following:

On 3/8/76, SSC Staff Member John Elliff advised

us that Volume 2 of

the SSC Hearings, which concerned the

Huston Plan and which was released earlier that day by

the SSC, contained information that was not cleared by the

FBI for

publication. He referred specifically to a portion

which set forth the names of individuals and organizations

that were the subjects of 14 electronic surveillances.

According to Elliff, he had given explicit instructions

that this information was to be excised before publication

and could not account for the reason behind its inclusion

other than it being an oversight. He expressed regret but

indicated that nothing further could be done about the

matter because 30 copies had already been distributed to

the press. The document in question also included memoranda

containing the names or initials of FBI personnel below

the rank of Section Chief, which was contrary to agreement

between the SSC and the Bureau that the former would not

publish names of personnel below that rank. By letter to

the

Attorney General (AG) 3/16/76, we furnished copies of

a letterhead memorandum (LHM) of same date so the latter

might be approved and forwarded to the SSC.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re:

Senstudy 75

62-116395

Bureau communications 1/19 and 2/13/76 brought

to the AG's attention reported improprieties by SSC inves

tigators when they interviewed former Bureau informant

Douglass Durham and asked the AG what action should be

taken. The improprieties involved statements made during

the interview of Durham when it was stated to him by the

SSC investigators that they had a strong desire to discredit

the FBI and asked if Durham could "come up with some dirt"

on the FBI because there was strong support to "nail the

FBI to the cross." We not only reported this to the AG

but also sent him a copy of a letter from Durham repeating

his allegations about the SSC investigators. On 3/11/76,

Steven Blackhurst of the Department advised Supervisor

P. V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, that the Department had

considered the two Bureau communications and Durham's letter

and had decided to take no action with the SSC on this

matter.

According to Blackhurst, it was the decision of

his office to not even bring the

Durham matter to the

attention of the DAG because the DAG had previously refused

to send any protest to the SSC concerning the Dorsett case

which involved the disclosure of the identity of former

Bureau Klan intormant George Dorsett, allegedly by an

unidentified SSC source.

We wrote the AG on 12/19/75

asking that a Bureau memorandum be delivered to Senator

Frank Church personally. (This is the matter wherein the

North Carolina press reported statements by Senator Robert

Morgan, SSC Member, suggesting an SSC leak.)

In the matter concerning former Bureau informant

Larry Grathwohl, he told us of slanted, biased and less-

than-objective interview of him in July, 1975, by SSC Staff

Member Michael Epstein.

We furnished the Department a

copy of Grathwohl's letter of 1/28/76 containing these

allegations.

Memorandum to Mr. T. W. Leavitt

Re: Senstudy 75

62-116395

The final situation concerned a "Los Angeles

Times" article concerning Senator Henry Jackson.

furnished the Department a memorandum dated 3/16/76 which

indicated the possibility of the SSC having furnished some

material to newspaper writers. Our letter to the AG

submitting the memorandum observed that the AG might wish

to bring the matter to the attention of Senator Church.

In the single situation relating to the

"Los Angeles Times" article, we can understand a reluctance

on the part of the AG in furnishing the memorandum to the

SSC as there was nothing of a definite nature indicating

impropriety on the part of the SSC. We have no similar

reservation concerning the other situations described above.

OBSERVATIONS: It is most regrettable that the DAG is

assuming a posture of inaction in these matters. He has

not given any reason for his inaction.

We can only speculate

as to the reason but it would be inconclusive.

On larch 31 and Lpril 1, 1976, representatives

of this Eureau ravieved at FBI Headquarters an SSE draft

of its Findings.

The purpose of the review tas to

recognize and bring io the actention of the SSC Staff any

information the IbI believes to be classified or otherise

sensitive io the extent that it should not be made public,

as tell as the identities of any FBI personnel below the

ran': of Section Chief which, by prior agreenent vith the

SSc, would not be included in the report, A number of

instances neeting the above criteria vere noted and vere

infomally brought to the attention of an SSC representacive

on April 2, 1976, subsequently confirmed by en IBI

subnitted to the Departient of justice for

approval and forarding to the SSC.

Inasnuch as only the drait vas made available

for review, and not the underlying docurents which vere

foocnoted, it was not possible to nake an iten-by-iten

revier? for accuracy of the drait. Nonetheloss, a number

of itoms come to notice which this Bureau vould find

objectionable if they appear in the published Findings in

the same manner as in the draft. The primary purpose of

this merorandu, therefore, is to call to attention these

items, as vall as some other observations of a general

nature relating to the draft unich it is believed vould be

of interest to the Departient and the lhite House.

the Findings were in seven parts, each containing

an identifying number,

the following is a summary of the

itens of interest with reference to the SSo's identifying

numbers and concern four of the seven parts; ve have no

conments concerning the renaining three parts.

K2864

Paragraph 1, page 33, contains the statement,

"Significantly, FBI Internal nemoranda with respect to some

of the installations make clear that they were planted in

Dr. Ring's bedrooms for the expressed purpose of obtaining

personal information about hin." (this refers to microphone

susveillances of King.)

The statement as appearing in the draft is slanted,

deceptive and unrecognizing of the practical aspects

relating to the effecting of microphone coverage on an

individual while he is in a travel status. King generally

stayed at hotels or notels.

Sometimes he occupied a room

which, by hotel or notel standards, generally consisted of

a single roon (aside from bathroom facilities) which served

as both a bedroom and a place to meet people. Other times

he occupied a suite consisting of a bedroom, as vell as a

sitting

room or parlor.

of course, in the case of a room,

the main space was the logical place to install a microphone.

If a suite was involved, the installation might be in the

sitting room or both sitting room and bedroom.

The choice of exact site for installation was

usually dictated by technical considerations; that is,

where could the installation be made to avoid detection

and be effective. This was a matter left up to the judgment

of the on-the-scene field personnel and Headquarters took

no part in the decisions made and generally was not even

apprised of such details. Hot to be overlooked is the fact

that, even if a suite vas used, conversations of interest

to us could have taken place in the bedroon as well as the

sitting room. In this respect it should be noted that the

FBI's primary purpose for these installations vas to obtain

information concernlag king's commnist assoclations this

is evidenced in many of the documents which have been

furnished to the SSG in this inquizy.

In this part, a reference is made to former

Attorney Ceneral Robert Kennedy authorizing a wiretap on

King in October, 1963. Referring to Kennedy, a statement

appears"... he requested that an evaluation of the results

be subuitted to him in 30 doys in order to determine whether

or not to naintain the tap, but the evaluation was never

delivered to him and he did not insist on it." By footnote,

this quotation is attributed to an FEI memorandum fron

It. Evans to l'x. Belmont dated October 21, 1963.

the menorancun in question, a copy of thich the

FBI has furnished to the SSC, relates a conversation between

ittorney General Kennedy and

• former FBI Assistant virector

C, d. iVans concerning an FBI menorandum of October 19, 1963,

recommending à technical surveillance on the office of

the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) at stlanta,

Georgia, und note was taken that on the previous weel the

vittorney General had authorized similar coverage ois the

residence of King. the memorandum noted that the attorney

General was apparently still vacillating in his rosition

as to technical coverage on King and the SCLC. However,

according to the memorandum,. the Attorney General advised

that he was approving the October 18, 1963, menorangum but

asked 'that this coverage and that on King's residence be

• evaluated at the end of 30 days in light of the results

secured so that the continuance of these surveillances could

be determined at that time."

that this is merely an interpretation by the SSC of what

the Attorney General intended. Our interpretation is

that the Attorney General intended for us to nake the

evaluation after 30 days and lí ve found the continuance

of the surveillances justified, we could contime then

without further contact with him.

We believe our inter-

pretation to be the correct one for two principal reasons.

First, there Is no Indication in the October 18,

1963, memorandun or elsewhere in IBI files, to the best of

our knowledge, that the ittorney General had specifically

asked that the evaluations after 30 days be subnitted to

hin. Second, the fact that we continued the surveillances

for a considerable period of time without Iccontacting

the ittorney General on the matter of justlying their

continuance, and the Attorney General did not again broach

the subject

to us, indicatesthat our interpretation vas a

correct one.

To illustrate our good faith adherence to that

we interpreted the Attorney General to mean; that is, that

ve internally evaluate the surveillances after 30 days,

the following should be noted:

the telephone survelllances of King's residence

and the SCLO offices in Atlenta, Georgia, were installed

November 8, 1963. The Atlanta Field Office subnitted tro

letters to

• FBI Headquarters, both dated December 12, 1963.

One concerned the residence

surveillance; the other, the

office surveillance.

These letters summarized results of

the surveillances during the first 30 days and reconnended

their continance. At Headquarters, a nenorandun was

prepared dated December 20, 1963.

this memorandum took

cognizance of the desire of the ittorney General that, when

he approved the survelllances, the coverage was to be closely

watched and evaluated in 30 days.

The menorandun summarized

the productivity of the survelllances and concluded wich

the following recommendation: "In accordance wish the

Atcorney General's desire, these installations have been

closely supervised and evaluated. is these sources

provide infornation regarding racial activities, as well

as security natters, that would not otherwise be available,

it is the recommencation of the Ionestic Intelligence

Division that these installations be contimed for an

additional three tonths." The recommendation was approved

by Director Hoover. There also appears a penciled notation

on page l of this menorancum indicating that 30 days later,

on January 21, 1964, the matter vas again reviewed and it

was deemed that the continuance of the surveillances la

itlante, Georgia, was justified. ihis notation bears the

autogroghic initials of a leadquarters Supervisor and a

Headquarters Section Chief.

the telephone surveillance on the New York Gity

office of the SCLC as Installed on üctober 24, 1963, and

our lew York Fiold Office, by letter dated lovember 22, 1963,

subnitted details of the results of the first 30 days of

the installation and recommended its contimuance. this

Has approved at leadquarters in the form of an appended

recommendation by the issistent virector of the lonestic

Intelligence IIvision.

Periodie Internal FBI justifications were nade on

all these surveillances for their duration.

In conclusion,

ve believe it to be unfair for the rindings to contala a

staterent implying it to be fact whereas it is nerely SSC

Interpretation. Also, in doing so, the SSC implies thet the

httorney General had asked us to furnish him sorething which

ve falled to do, this is also unfair, as the full facts

set out above reveal.

On poge 6 appears a statenent, 'the abusive

techniques used by the rul in Cointelpro Fron 1956 to 1971

included violatlons of both federal and state statutes

prohibiting nail fraud, vire fraud, incitement to violence,

sending obscene material through the nail, and extortion."

The draft prejudges, without due process, acts

of individuals based on subjective interpretations of

documents. This statement presures not only that those

interpretations are correct but that they satisty all

elements of the statutes involved, to the extent that those

tro acted can be categorically declared to be guilty of

the crimes charged.

On page 18 appears a discussion of microphone

surveillances on King. & footnote on that page states that

FBI memoranda make clear that these surveillances were one

of the techniques being used to obtain information about

King's private life. is indicated above under the heading

12864, there is no recognition, as there should have been,

that the primary purpose for the microphone surveillance

was to obtain Infornation concerning King's communist

connections.

On page 20 a statement appears, "it abouc the

sane time it mailed the "sanltized' tape, the IDI . ..."

the FBI finds objectionable the allegation that

the FBI had nailed the tupe in question. Ietails of this

objection have been set forth in a prior memorandur

containing our eritique of the SSC's draft report entitled

the above is typical of the distorted character

of the SSC Finding. ilthough it is possible Vir. loore

deposed as above, it is also probable his comments are

cited out of context. The constitutionality and the law

were constantly considered by Headquarters and Field FLI

personnel involved With Cointelpro actions, and this should

be readily evident based on a revier of Cointelpro documents

which were available to the SSC. there aze many instances

vhere proposals vere denied under Cointelpro because they

were considered a technical violation of the law or of

constitutional rights. Special igent lavid yan deposed

before the SSC to the effect that constitutionality of

Cointelpro techniques was considered and was a continuing

consideration, and he cited examples. One example which

appears in Jyan's deposition relates to Cointelpro efforts

to expose and preclude clandestine Communist Party use of

meeting halls.

iyan deposed that Former Assistant to the

Director ilan Il. Belmont had questioned the constitutional

proprieties of such action as possible violations of first

¿mendent rights, and efforts had been made to preclude

such infringerents. In this instance it appears the SSC

Staff has selectively and deliberately ignored Information

available to it furnished by witnesses. (this distortion

has previously been called to the attention of Barbara Banoff

of the SSO by Special igent David kyàn.)

Page 6 of the draft, in counting regarding the

"'Imprecision of the targeting" in Cointelpros, comments

*Mor could anyone at the Durcau define 'How left. "

(Although there is a citation for this statement in the

drait, the page numbers and document are not identified.)

The above distortion also appeared in the draft

report on FBI Colatelpros previously nade avallable for

revie to Pil Headquarters represchtatives on l'arch 2 and 3,

1976. The original draft report on Cointelpros in itself

contradicts this statement by stating 'Some agents defined

"New left' functionally, by connection with protest.

Others defined it philosophically, particularly antiwar

philosophy." the draft report ignores the fect that former

Assistant Director C. D. Brennan, in his public testimony

before the SSC, vas ushed to and did define "sew left."

Additionally, iyan in his deposition indicated to the SSC

he could define "Wew Left'' but did not belleve it pertinent

to his testimony.

Also, documents made available to the

SSC, which have been specifically called to its attention,

define "wew Left" In detail and these documents have been

published by the SSC, (See Exhibit 61 appearing on

page 669 of the report of SSC hearings, volume 6, which

sets forth the contents of an airtel to Sat, ilbany, from

Director,

FBI, dated October 28, 1968, captioned "Hew left

lovement," thich extensively defines "dew left." Also,

Special Agent Ryan has already alerted Banoff to this

distortion which also appeared in the SSC draft report on

Cointelpros.)

On page 9 of the draft, it is indicated"... the

Bureau tried

to "deter or counteract? what it called

"propaganda'-the expression of ideas which it considered

dangerous."

the deposition of the Cointelpro Unit Chief

(ayan) is cited.

the propaganda referred to in the deposition

related to cormnist, black extremist violence and waite

hate. There was no expression in the deposition that these

ideas were "considered dangerous." the propaganda #as

clearly pointed out for what it was. this is another

instance where the SSC has taken a quotation from a deposition

out of context and then added editorializing.

Page 14 of the draft states in a separate

paragraph, "The Bureau also encouraged "gang warfare"

between violent groups." this statement set out by itself

indicates the lack of objectivity of the SSC. the SSC

had available to it and could readily cite from a number

of documents where the Bureau either turned down proposals

because of a possibility of violence or clearly took steps

to prevent violence.

Incouraging "gang farfare"

is

strictly an interpretation of the SSC and not supported

by overall documentation.

Pages 15a and 16 of the SSC draft refer to the

"snitch jacket'' technique, which is described as falsely

delane he teenth ace into man used in trea

jargon but was 'rised by those famillar with the Bureau's

campaign against the Panthers, to describe

In discussions with the staff." On several occasions,

Including on liarch 31, 1976, Special Agent fyan pointed

out to Banoff that to

his knowledge this expression or term

was never used by bureau personal in the conduct of the

Cointelpros or otherwise.

On larch 31, 1976, Banoff

admitted that this tas not a Bureau quote but that

individuals "outside the Burcau' had used the expression.

Ryan objected to the use of a term by the SSC to dramatize

an alleged technique when, in fact, this term is not and

was not ever used by the Bureau.

On page 8 appears a statenent that the Internal

Security Division of the Department of Justice added

The Findings state the Justice lepartment sllowed the Bureau

to continue listing "potentially dangerous' persons' on

a new index and endorsed the FBI's view that the new index

could, contrary to law, be used for detention purposes in

an "energeney."

As indicated by the Findings, a new index was

the following data will serve to clarify and put in its

full and correct perspective the facts relating to this

natter.

Following discontinuance of Title II of the

Internal Security ict of 1950, an Administrative Index (Adex)

was established by the fBI, with the knowledge and approval

of the Department of Justice, to enable the fBI to pinpoint

individuals who exhibited a propensity to perfozm acts

Inimical to national security and who posed a continuing

threat to the safety of the Frosident. Such an index was

believed to ba on essential pari (aininistrative aid) of

the foregoing contains incorrect implications.

The FSI menoranda requesting approval for the wiretaps in

question, and which contain the autographic approval of

Attorney General Kennedy, make no reference Whatsoever to

any evaluations being provided to the littorney General

after 60 days or any other period of time. à nemorandum

written at that time by assistant irector C. d. Ivans to

li. belmont, which has been referred to carlier in this

docunent, does mention the Attorney General's request that

the coverage on King's residence be evaluated at the end

of 30 days.

However, as indicated earlier, there vas no

sequest by the littorney General known to the FBI that he

the SSC has been furnished copies of the pertinent

correspondence referred to above. ihis appears to be

just one additional example of an erroneous and twisted

statement by the SSC in its Findings.

advised of microphone surveillances, but that the memoranda

were submitted after the installations. these memoranda

were dated lay 17, October 19, and Lecember 1, all in 1965.

The implication by the SSC is that the FBI Has

in contradiction to the Attorney General's order requiring

prior authorizations for microphone surveillances. The SSC

unfortunately takes no recognition of the flexibility

present in the Attorney General's order in that, when time

was of the essence, it was permissible for the FBI to

effect a microphone surveillance without prior authorization

fron the Attorney General, provided the Attorney General

was notifled prouptly. In all three instances cited the

situation Has of this nature and in each instance the advice

to the Attorney General was timely. The following facts

are supportive of our contention and illustrate that there

was no FBI defiance of the Attorney General as is suggested

by the manner and wording of the SSC's Finding.

Under date of March 30, 1963, Director lioover

submitted a memorandum to the Attorney General concerning

the matter of microphone surveillances. In that memorandum,

fix. Katzenbach was reminded that lit. Hoover had advised

him that, under the administration of Attorney General Clark,

Ix. Hoover had recommended that all Government agencies

refrain from wiretapping unless there was specifie approval

in each instance by the Attorney General.

The menorandum

of lis. Hoover goes on to state that, in line with

Fix. Katzenbach's suggestion earller that day, lI. Hoover

had already set up the procedure similar to the one for

requesting

authority for telephone taps and that it would

be utilized in requesting authority for microphone surveil-

lances.

the use of microphones and

Ceneral, "It is my understanding that such devices vill

not be used without my authorization, although in emergency

circumstances they may be used subject to my later

emergency situations, a microphone surveillance could be

installed without the prior Attorney General's approval,

provided he was furnished the opportunity for timely

ratification. Although the three nemoranda referred to

above pertained to the King case, it should be noted that

there were mierophone installations made by the fBI under

these circumstances (enérgency situation-installed without

electronic surveillances used during the Convention by

It is recognized that some of the fzuits of these

Enclosed herewith is a memorandum for your approval

and forwarding to the sse which concerns an article contained

in the March 7, 1976, edition of "The Los Angeles Tines." A

copy is also enclosed for your records.

This article alleges that a recommendation by

senator Henzy M. Jackson was the basis tos the NiXon

administration "ordering the FBI to report directly to the

President on contact made with the Soviet Embassy by American

political figures, according to a classified FBI memorandum. "

The article alleges further that the classified FBI memorandun

is now in the possession of the SSC and indicates the

possibility that an see at member has discussed classified

material furnished by the FBl with either or both of the

article's authors, Messrs. Jack Nelson and Ronald J. Ostrow.

The article alleges that the FBI memorandum "quotes

Richard M. Nixon'

s chief of staff, H. R. Haldeman, as stating

that Jackson had made the recommendation in a 1969 meeting

with Nixon.*

The Attorney General

was an FBI memorandum dated February 3, 1975, classified

"Secret" and entitled

"Information Concerning Contacts Between

Representatives of the Soviet Union and Members or Staff

Personnel of the United States Congress Furnished to the

White House at the

Request of the President."

This memorandum

sets forth the FBI's internal inquiry of this matter and the

chronology of facts, according to our records, are as follows:

In 1966, then President Lyndon B. Johnson, instructed

the FBI to use any method or device whatsoever to keep him

advised as to the

identity and purpose of visits paid by

legislators and other prominent U. S. citizens to Iron Curtain

embassies, and asked for a study,

and

continuing up to that time, of all legislators who

at the Soviet Embassy. Such a study was prepared and vas

transmitted to the White House by letter dated March 21, 1966.

The summary transmitted by this letter set forth, in order,

contacts by each Senator,

Representative or staff member who

had contacts with the Soviet Embassy during the period

July 1, 1964, through March 17, 1966.

On March 22, 1966, information was received that the

President was very pleased with the material and instructed

that similar material be prepared bringing this material up

to date every ten days to two weeks.

Biweckly additions, which

detailed actual contacts, were subsequently furnished to

White house; however, dissemination of this material was

terminated In January, 1969, on the instructions of then

Director Hoover.

, advised thai

Ir. Haldeman was interested in receiving from the Burcau any

Soviet nationals and

members of Congress and their staff in the past several years.

Transmitted by letter to Mr. Haldeman, dated July 29, 1970,

were two copies of a communication captioned "Contacts Between

which was classified "Secret.

This document set

Rust in sumary form the number of contacts betveen Senators

Representatives and Stail employees for the years 1967 through

July 28, 1970, as well as the identity of Congressmen who were

more frequent contacts of Soviet officials, the identities of

Gongressional cormittees more frequently the target of Soviet

contacts, the methods used by soviets in initiating contacts

and the fact that the majority of Soviet personnel maintaining

contacts on Capitol Hill were either known to us or suspected

to be connected with the Soviet Intelligence Services.

On August 4, 1970, Mr. Iom C. Huston, Staff Assistant

at the White House, advised FBI Liaison Officer R. H. Haynes

that Mr. Haldeman was most pleased at the receipt of the above-

referred-to information.

Huston further advised confidentially

that this matter had come up as a result of a recent conversation

between Senator Henry M. Jackson and President Nixon.

Huston

stated that Dorothy Fosdick, Staff Director of the Subcommittee

on National Security of the Government Operations Committee,

of which Senator Jackson is chairman, had detected an increase

in contacts by Soviets with her office. Fosdick had kept

records of some of these contacts which she made available to

Senator Jackson wha,

in turn, furnished them to the White House.

The White House requested the FBI contact Fosdick and interview

her in detail concerning the nature and extent of these contacts,

which was subsequently done.

Subsequent to the July 29, 1970, letter to

Mr. Haldenan transmitting information, supra, there is no

indication similar information was sent to the White House.

It is believed that if an individual connected with

the SSC has discussed the FBI memorandum referred to above

without the specific Committee's authorization to do so, this

wauld indicate a definite impropriety, notwithscanding the fact

the information is misstated

and erroneous, insofar as the news

article is concerned, according to our records.

02. But Jack on said he did ivarn Nixon in a 1900 While

Jicuse me ling di stepped-up Sovict intelligence activities

on Capital iull.-

Jackson said he had never heard of the FEl memoran~

iron until he was asted about it hy times reporiers. He.

sid the mcmorandum was "taking license with something

I didn't say."

Haldeman, in Los Angeles, said he could not talk about

a inemorandm he had not seen, adding that. he would

nice comment in any crent except "before a p'oper

soremment foruni"

Jovement courees familiar with the document said it

quoled Flakiemon as directing the FBI to resume a "spe-

cial coverage": bat had been discontinued at the chu of

the Schnson cummistration.

This special coverage consisied of delivering digests of

convciations of congressional trombers and other politi-

cal figures recorded by eicetronic surycillance of the So-

vict timbassy and other foreign intelligence targeis. The

searing of disests to the White louse was haited at the

cud of the Jonnson administrations, but the electronic sur-

reilance continued, according to sources familiar with

the program.

•Jackson says he are not urge re

suming raports io the President:

The digests were resumed alter Haldeman asied the

Tot to proside the coverage early in the first Nixon term.

Inderviewed in lis campaign siation wagon. between

pusic appearances. Jackson said he had noi recommend-

ed resuming special reports to the President or anything

cise in his-1969 aceting with Nixon.

"Not only did I not recommend it, I did not know what

¿ra Johnson administration had done," Jackson said.

éty slatement to the contrary, he said, was "absolutely

jalse. - and made ap out of whole cloth."

Jackcon. irculling his meeting with Nixon, said he had

felt "obliged to inform the executive branch" of the accel-

oraled Surict intelligence activities that he had observed.

He said the pumary purpose of the meeting was "in con-

Mection with sume defcuse appropriations bill."

daciron expinined ahal in 1069 representatives of the

Soviet Eubassy had sharply increased their visits to his

Sonate dice and offices of the subcommittee with rution-

il security responsibilites on which he served.

"I was test pointing out what was going on in the Sei-

me Offee Bustan and in ihe Capitol," Jacison said. "I

felt obliged to let them knows."

dick on said ine had "no recollection of Maldeman's be-

¿ng in the necg. i do recall someone coming in and cut."

He std to vestion was aiso attended by "the four-star

goeral who became head of all military forces at SWATE

(aprone Medequarters Allied Powers Burope)."

The ca-cripton and other details Jackson recalled fit

Gry Andrew J. Goodpaster, who ift his duties i demila

commander of American forces in Vietnam für st weeks

carly in the Nixon administration to work on national sc-

curity mallers at the Whi!e House.

Goodpaster, reached by telephone at his home, in Alex-

anúria, Va., said he was "99%o sure" he had not attendicd

such a meeting "and if I was there, it was only for a ca-

sual moment or so and I don't remember any discussion."

Goowpaster, now retired, said: "I know oi some discus-

sions Nixon auri Sen. Jackson had about the possibilily of

Sen. Jackson being named secretary of dcfense." But

Goodpaster said he had not been present at sich discus-

(Jackson rejccied an oifer by Nixon to appoint him de-

fense secretary in Nixon's first administration.;

Sources familiar with the FBI memorandum pointed out

that it consukuied "hearsay"-an FBI official's reporting

of what Haldeman said had occurred in 3. inseting be-

tween Nixon and Jackson,

These sources raised the possibilily that Haldeman, in

& directing the FBI to provide the special coverage, had

mentioned Jackson in an attempt to show the request was

not parusan.

An FBI official refusca to discuss the memorandum.

"We're in a flat no-comment position," the official said.

The Senate Inteiligence Cominitice spokesman, in stat-

ing that the documents released Monday would not relais

to Haldeman's alleged requesi for political iniormation on

senatore, said that the the committee's final report. to be

issued later this month, would include a footnote from the

E FBI memorandum.

When asked whether the report would mention Jack-

son, the spokesman said: "This is part of the sensitivity.

on the Sovict thing." Fie apparenty was refering to he

committce's desire to avoid any official acknowledgement

that ihe Sovict Erbussy was under constant ciectronic

When asked again if the foolnote would include Jacl.-

son's namc, the spokesman repited that the question "will

take some consideration of the committee" members.

The FBI memorandum was known to have been part of

ê the "official and confidential" files of former FBI Director

J. Edgar Hoover, which were noi discovered until 1w0

jears alter his deati in 1072.

was turner over lo the Senate Intelligence Commiere?

As a member of the Senate's ClA oversight committce

Jackson had special concern with Sovict intelligence acti-

¡ vities and maintained close contacis with the FBI and CIA.

During the House Intelligence Committee's recent in-

vestigation, his collacis win top Cle oficials led to ques-

zions about, winether he nan advised agency cificials on

how to protect themselves in responding to Senate inves-

tigations.

A CLA memorandum cited in the House committee's re-

port, which has been leaked but rot cificially released,

states that Jackson advised the Cia in 1973 on how to

protect itself aguinst a Senate investigation about the

agency's relations with the International Telephone &

Telegranh Co. in Chile. The investigation was conducied

by a suncommittec headed by Sen. Frank Church (D-ida.).

"The memo, dated Feb. 23, 1973, ind cealing with a

inducing Serisen Jackson and then-CIA Directri-James

Pi. Schlesinger, stated: "Sen. Jackson repeatedly "Made

comment that in his view ine Cia oversight co amittee

had the rasponsiblity of protecting the agency in te type

of sitation that wes inherent in the Church subcommit-

• tee."

The New York Times, which first reported the exis-

tence of the CiA inero, quoted Jackson as saying that the

author of the decument had taken "literary license" in de-

scribing the senator's position.

Jackson sairi he recalied advising the CIA on "procedur-

al mattors" in responuing to the investigation but denied

The had advised the agency on how to protect itseif.

The New York, Times, quoting congressional sources,

reported a'so that Jackson hau ravised former CIA Direc-

for lichard lI. Heims on how to resond do questions by

¿he Senate Watergate committee in 1973.

Jackson acknowleriged discussing Helms' scheduled ap-

pearance before the committee, but saic he advised Heims

oniy t "lay out all the facts" for the cominittee.

Elliff specifically referred to Page 270, Volume 2,

of the hearings as setting forth the names of individuals and

organizations that were the subjects of 13 telephone surveil

lances and one microphone surveillance. He further advised

that the publication included memoranda containing the names

or initials of Ibl personnel who had reviewed of approved the

Elliff said that he had given explicit instructions

that this infornation was to be excised before publication and

that he did not know why it was included in the publication.

He said that 30 copies of this volume had already been

distributed to members of the press and it was unlikely they

could be recalled.

He also felt that any attempt to have the

documents returned would draw the attention of the press to the

problen.

Ellitf said he regretted the oversight but did not

think anything further could be done about the disclosures.

We find this action regrettable. SSC Chief Counsel

Further, Schwarz in conversation with a representative

of the *Bl on March 4, 1976, gave his assurance that there

would be no names of Special

Agents below the rank of Section

Chief included in the report.

This agreement also was violated

as there are several instances in Volume 2 in which names and

not excised.

We feel that the action taken by the SSC in this
