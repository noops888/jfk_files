I. Product of the Project

A. Soviet Coverage

Project LIFEAT has not provided coverage of the entire Soviet official

Installation in Mexico City since 22 June 1960 when Project LIENVOY

assuned this responsibility. This freed LIFEAT to provide, with 118

coverage, home phones of selected Soviet officials which

could better sunport not only the Station's CE effort but alse other

Station operations arainst the Soviet target. In this ettort, LIFEAT

covered the homes of four of the more active Soviet Intelligence

Officers stationed in Mexico during the reporting period. Samples

of the operational information provided by LIFEAT follous:

E. American Coumunist Group In Maxico (ACGM).

As noted in past project reviers, most of the targets in this group

have been covered at the request of QiNVY, and the raw take has been

processed by them..

vuring une period July 1962 through May 1963

approximately 390 reels of take vere passed to the local ODENVY for

their processing.

On 23 August 1962 the local ODENVY advised, "This

office feels the coverage mentloned 1s quite valuable and many userul

leads are obtained from this coverage, partlcularly with regard to

travel in and out of Mexico of Anerican Communists who are in contact

wilüh individuals on whon coverage is maintained".

LIFEAT/Soviet: The valuable assistance which LIFEAT rendered Station

efforta in this area sas amig alsplayed in its support of Siación

assets mounting a technical surveillance operation targeted against

the home of a known Sovie: I:ellleonce officer stationed in Mexico

'1ty under officlal cover.

LI:EAI Information provided vital infor

ation which enabled the Stacion to establish a pattern of action,

of both the family of the Seriet officor and his maid.

This infor-

mation nado possible the seiiing of a time for the situal entry into

the target, and continuing corerazo (ineluding livé monitorint of the

target line immediately preceeding the operation) by LIFEAT bade

ossible a degree of security fer this operation which would not hav

een possible without the suppurt of al

• tap operatial.

Further LIFEAT coverage has, in addition to giving information on

the dally actluities and corners of soviet ofticinis, provided an ex

-. cellent check on the contacis of three KUBARK controlled double agent

with their Sovlet Case Offleers. This coverage has enabled the roepor

sible Case Officer to suide his operations with Increased assurance

that his agents continue to be fully cooperative and under his control.

LIFEAT/Cuban: LIFEAT activi:des in this area were concerned primarily

with support to the AMSTRUT operation.

Coverage of rolatives of

AYSTRUT-2 provided an excellen: "indow" Inio the operation which

enabled the responsible Case Ofilcers to nove with more certainty

and security in developing is operation.

The Case Officers involved

considered the LIFEAT coverge an essentlal check on the activities of

the principals in the case atich vas especially saluable during the

Initial stages of the opera:lo, Travel plans of ANSTHUT-2 provided

LIrAT/Migoslav: In addition to the usual Infoma:lon concerning

Bre YugoslAv

offielals and their dally contaces and aotivities,

LIPLAT provided leads which could pay off in Mature operations.

One example

ation, sufficient early warning was Elven by LIVEAT so that the

operation could save been carried out. Another example of this

tyre of lead mae the data avallable from LItrAT coveraço that a

new location maz being sought for the Y'goslav Embassy, and which

apeciflo iocations were under consideration. Armed with tile Informa-

tion the Station his heen able to malo a technioal casing of one of

the prospective sites and obtain Information nocessary for entry into

the other sites.

LIFEAT/Exllo: As noted previously, LIVIAT coverago of the exilo

As noted ill paragraph I. E. above, the local office of ODENVY

considers this coversee

As also nolod in previous

renewala, LIFEAT ability to ilve the Interested case officers a cheok

clans and provides sreater seourity for long term asseta who may have

been in contadt with now terminsted agents.

H. Conclusion

It 1s the opinion of the Mexico City Station tiat the support provided

other Station operations, the chez Information and leads,

and the

ability.of the

| LIFEAT operation to cover sensitive targeta

without revealing Station Interest to the liaison forces, woll justify

Che expenditure of funds, elme, personnol and socurity rink.

As 1t has

been noted in the past, that even with the Stazion's envolvecent in che

the present

could ond KUPARK partiaipation in that L

coverage, must be ivailable to once again undertake coverago of the

official Sovlet and Czech offloial targets in Mexico City.

Therefore,

LIFEAT's present orientation, though toward supporting Station operationa

and CI/CE mission rather than toward targets which would provide positive

intelligenco, leavea 11 reailly avallable for rocall into the Soviet-

Czech coverage.

It 1s the Stazion'a firm opinion that tho LIFEAT

projeot provides a subatantial and vital contribucion in tuifiinone the

several priority oujeotives of the Station's Related Mission Directive.

There la attached a list of the lM's produced from LITAT provided

mnierlal during to period July 1902 through May 1903, as a by-product

of lho projeat's prime reeponsibility of providing support to Station

cperations.

II. Progreas of the Operation

The objeatives of the LifeAt Project are of a continuing, nature and

are therefore not conaldered

time.

Fer this reason percentage fleures an to completion of project

III. Plarning for the Puture

As was indicated at the tine of the last project renewal, LIFEAT hopes

to remain uncommitten to coverages that require the expenditures of

a freat portion of LIPPAT resources but provide coverage of but one

target.. -nuch as Sovie% Pabassy coverage.

It 1e added emphatioally,

however, that mhould the need arise for LIFEAT to akaln assure such

respons1u11141es, 11 18 fully able to do so. Until such time LIFEAT

wili continue to enjoy treater flexibility in tho erployment of lts

assets, ergoclally in the areas in which the Station does not miah

The purpose of this project 1a to provide, unilaterally, dally information

CI/CE coverage receiving the greatest emphasis.

There are no changes in the cover of personnel who have been proviously

employed in the LIrtAr operation.

his LIFEAT salary without difficulty.

b. LIFEUD-26 has natural cover of housewifo (wife of LIFFUD-24) and

nother.

She performs her LIFFAT dutles only in her home (LINEAT

WlraUD-25 has natural cover of the wife of a retired businessma

18, Estimated Costs

The following are the estimated costs for Fiscal Year 1964. All figures

are U.3, dollars per jear (US $1.00 equals 12.50 Marican pesos).

In estimated costs for particular items will be noted. These reflect not

only the continued

inflationary trend in the lexican economy, but also

the LIFEAT operational exphasis of support to Station operations.

Creater expense in installation and removal of tap lines and crosses and

frequent shifting of basehouse sites.

In the agent salary category total expense in contract agent salaries was

Increased somewhat (due to raises granted DRABAND and ZINSMEISTER during

the past year) and reduced considerably in the field agent category (due

to termination of three well paid agents.) Overall funds

requested for FY 1964 total $83,808 compared to $99,000 granted for use

in FY 1963 - a reduntion of $15,192.

A greal part of this reduction was

possible by programing no new equipment purchases for the coning year

(see paragraph 16 above).
