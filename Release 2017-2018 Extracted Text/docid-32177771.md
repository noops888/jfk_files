DECLASS TELED BY.

The regular Friday night S.W.P. Forum was cancelled

and everyone was invited to go to the central Methodist Church

located at Woodward and Adans to beaf aS Wor named Mark Lane

several male and female negro's in the crowd reople.

There was

beginning before Ruby-shot him he would have been acquited of

i MarKbase said that if oswald was deid

the killing or kennedy and he also felt if he had lived and was M

tried today, he would be acquited. Lane also said that had Oswaldul

lived and been tried he could not have gotten a fair trial any

place in the United States as they had him judged guilty before

his trial and this was a mockery of our judicial system which

says a man is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond any

reasonable doubet by a court of law.

Lane then went on to say

that he had checked the records and in his opinion Oswald was

innocent of killing President Kennedy. He said be checked

-76-001

statements of the doctors who worked trying to save Kennedy and

they first stated the fatal shot hit him in the throat and went

down.

If Oswald shot. Kennedy it would have had to be in the

back of the neck as the caravan was beyond the depository building.

A few days later after the F.B.I. talked to the doctors, they

changed their story that the fatal shot entered through

the back

of the skull. The next false-hood that a taxi driver picked up

Oswald and the Dallas Police Dept gave his name which I forget.

Lane said upon checking with the taxi company they never had

anybody work for them by the name given. Lane then went on to

say that the police said it was a german rifle that killed Kenned

but changed it to an italian one like Oswalds.

Lane also said

i was ache echoesui

checked with the manufacturer of the rifle and he said the

rif

could not have done the job. He also said that the F.B.I.

kn

all about Oswalds past and he should have been picked up as

security risk. Instead on the day of the killing the F.B.I. was

busy following and harassing the people in Dallas who believed

in school intergration.

Lane said it was also proved that the chicken

bones found up on the sixth floor were two days old and not as

the police first said he ate the chicken while waiting to kill

the president. The police said when Oswald was picked up in the

exterce

show he was terribly nervous and that he tried to kill a

policeman with a pistol he had but it misfired and the firing

pin left a mark on the bullet. After bullestics checked the

bullet and found it didn't have any marks on it the police

chief didn't refute his statement butsaid so it had no marks

on it and passed it off. As to Oswald being so nervous in

the show this was also a falsehood and he explained why. He

said after the shooting a policeman ran into the bldg and

while Oswald was drinking a pop put his gun in his ribs and

ine.

Oswalds boss said that he told the policeman that Oswald

worked for him and that Oswald was not nervous at the time

but was extremely calm. Lane also said that after the first

shot which one police office thought came from up a hill and

from a different direction the police officer chased two people

but nothing more was said about it. Lane also implied that

there seemed to be a conspiracy between the Dallas Police and

Jack Ruby to do away with Oswald.

Lane said because of the

importance of the case extreme care should have been taken for

Oswald's safety instead of putting him on display for anyone

to kill him. Lane said he was going to go around the country

informing people of what had happened and not what they had

put in the paper.
