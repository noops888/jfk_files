Dear Ing. Montés Bocanegra

I am writing to you about a matter that I believe to be, important to the FBI and to the

United States people

The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act, 44 U:SC. C.§2107(Supp

V: 1994) (the Act) (copy enclosed) was enacted by the United States Congress and signed into law by

President George Bush on October 26, 1992, The purpose of the Act is to preserve and maintain all

United States governmental documents in one area, the National Archives and Records

Administration (Archives), for access to those individuals interested in the history surrounding the

assassination of President John F. Kennedy The Act states that, "[all government records

concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy should carry a presumption of immediate

disclosure,

" and requires all United States government agencies to find all documents related to the

assassination and to review and release the identified documents to the maximum extent possible to

the public The FBI has been working diligently since 1993 to fulfill our responsibilities under the

The purpose of this letter is: (1) to inform you that the FBI's assassination records contain

explain the provisions for your request to protect, your information from disclosure

To achieve maximum disclosure of assassination records, the Act established the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board (the Board). The Board is an' independent Federal agency

charged with overseeing the identification and release of records related to the assassination from the

other Federal agencies. The FBI has assured the Board of our continued dedication of cooperating

with them to meet the objectives of the Act: In that spirit, the FBI would appreciate your agency's

review of the enclosed assassination records and consideration of whether the information can be

-released

(S

If your agency has no objection to the release of its information in the enclosed records, please

notify the FBI so that we may take steps to release the records to the Archives. If your agency

determines that the information cannot be released, please provide an explanation so that the FBI may,

present the evidence to the Board for their approval. The Act requires the FBI to present "clear and

convincing evidence of a harm that would outweigh the need for public disclosure to the Boárd for

any, information that we request to protect from disclosure Such evidence to protect information is

explained in the Act. as, "the public disclosure of the assassination record would compromise the

existence of an understanding of confidentiality currently requiring protection between a Government

agent and a cooperating individual of a foreign government; and public disclosure would be so

harmful that it outweighs the public interest." Upon receiptof your instructions and explanation for

the protection from disclosure, the FBI will provide the information to the Board and request that

they sustain the request for withholding the information from disclosure.

Please be aware that the Act requires that all information in the assassination collection at

Archives (even in the closed section) be released to the public in the year 2017, including information

that the Board agrees to protect. The Act has provisions to extend postponements (protection of

information from disclosure) past 2017 with the certification of the President of the United States that

the information continues to meet the requirements for postponement. The FBI will periodically

review the postponed material for the need of this certification.

As.you know, the FBI: normally/protects information from your agency pursuant to applicable

Executive Orders and the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts exemptions However, the Act is

a unique Federal law that applies only to JFK assassination records Please note, it is our opinion that

release of information in the JFK assassination records should not in the future affect the FBI's

standard policy of protecting your agency's information in other investigations or in other contexts

The FBI is committed to the opening of all information related to the assassination to the

United States public, but appreciates that certain information is sensitive and not proper for release:

Therefore, the FBI requests your consideration and understanding of this matter and the continuance

of your outstanding association with our agency.

Thank you, in advance, for your cooperation Please direct any questions to our Legat Office

representative or to Carol L. Keeley, Acting Unit Chief of the Historical and Executive Review Unit"

of the FBI, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue, N. W., Washington, D.C. 20535, (202) 324-0671
