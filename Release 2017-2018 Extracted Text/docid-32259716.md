April 15, 1963

Report to Director from SAC, Miami

Subject: Agrupacion Montecristi (AM)

AM is part of Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) a union

of anti-Castro organizations.

The CRC receives money

from the CIA and then it is distributed to member

organizations to maintain various groups and engage in

anti-Castro

activities

inside Cuba.

The CIA had an

operational interest in Leslie and George Nobregas, but

it was ended in 1962

after they engaged in an "outlaw"

shelling raid on a suburb of Havana.

Nobregas said it was his personal opinion that if the

U.s. plans to co-exist with Cuba, the AM will leave the

CRC and operate independently to overthrow Castro.
