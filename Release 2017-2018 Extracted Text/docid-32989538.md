On 4/9/64, NY 694-S* made the following observations

with regard to the CP suatus of STANLEY LEVISON:

LEVISON has been an important Party member for

many years and never at any time differed with the party with

respect to the party line.

His only difference with the

Party has been with respect to the fact that in his opinion

the party was not sufficiently "militant" in defending

Negro rights.

In this respect, he has been to the "left"

of the party. LEVISON's differences with the party are merely

"tactical."

He has never criticized the Party, except with

• respect to the party's handling of the Negro question.

fact that he does not accept domination by the party with

regard to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement should not be

construed to mean that he has broken with the party in all

respects. The Party today is as anxious to reestablish friendly

relations with LEVISON as it was in the past.

It should be noted that LEVISON never has been

officially "drummed out" of the party, nor has anyone ever

criticized

him for being opposed to the party's general

principles.

It further should be noted that according to

the CP Constitution, it would require formal expulsion of

LEVISON to state that he is officially out of the party.

LEVISON never has said anything reflecting that

he does not continue to le a CP member.

It should be noted

that it would be in the interests of the MARTIN LUTHER KING

movement, with which he is associated, if he would publicly

repudiate the

Party, which he has never done. It should be

further noted that in an effort to renew friendly relations

with LEVISON, the Party designated BEN DAVIS to contact

LEVISON. LEVISON had always expressed the opinion that

BEN DAVIS was the only CP functionary who had a sufficiently

"militant attitude" as regards CP activities in behalf of

the Negro movement. The fact that DAVIS and LEVISON as yet

have not met should not be construed to mean that LEVISON

has refused to confer with DAVIS.

As NY 694-5* understands

the situation, DAVIS has been awaiting contact by LEVISON,

and LEVISON similarly has been awaiting contact by DAVIS.

Each of these individuals is sufficiently egotistical to

expect that the other would make the first move in an effort

to establish contact.

Ny 694-S* believes that probably the

reason why DAVIS and LEVISON have not met is that arrangements

for their meeting were to be made by LEM HARRIS and

HARRIS has not made the proper efforts to effect a meeting

between LEVISON and DAVIS.

NY 694-s* has never obtained any information re-

flecting that LEVISON has changed his thinking with regard to

Marxism. Even though his present estrangement from the Party

might be construed as reflecting he is no longer a CP member,

there is no reason to come to the conclusion that LEVISON is

no longer an ideological Communist.

JACK talked to LEM HARRIS yesterday who said he

contacted STAN LEVENSON by phone and was given a cordial

hello which was a change from the past when he was cool.

LEM said he had not seen LEVENSON, tried to call him

and would like to see him immediately to which LEVENSON said,

"I would like very much to see you but I don't have the time

now. I'm leaving and packing for a trip. I will be glad t

see you in six weeks."

LEVENSON implied that he was going to Eclador but

LEM doesn't know why. There was no anger shown, ald LEVENSON

will see LEM when he returns in six weeks.

They are severing themselves the LEVISONS

and O'DELL are still Party members, but do not desire to be

openly "linked up"

with the Party. Although they are "dis-

enchanted" with the Party, they are not quitting the Party.

With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they will

act on their own initiative, and will not accept instructions

from the Party.

LEM HARRIS then advised that the Party, however,

still would like to control the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement.

BEN DAVIS has been assigned to be "liaison or intermediary"

with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS O'DELL.

Whether or not

the LEVISONS and O'DELL will maintain liaison regarding

matters concerning the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement is a

matter for them to decide.

• In view of LEVISON's statement

with respect to advising MARTIN LUTHER KING independently

of Party instructions, it would seem that DAVIS may not have

any success in maintaining liaison with the LEVISONS and

HUNTER PITTS O'DELI. The IEVISONS and O'DELL are awale of

the fact that BEN DAVIS has been given this assignmens

by the Party.

NY 100-136585

When Dr. MARTIN LUTHER KING was invited to address

the AFL-CIO convention some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's ad-

vice, first obtained approval to do so from A. PHILLIP RANDOLPH,

negro labor leader, who, If he had not been consulted in the

matter, might have felt

that KING's making a speech at the

aforesaid convention was a blow to RANDOLPH's prestige.

KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at the

AL-CIo convention, and, asa result, received invitations

from numerous labor leaders, including "MC DONALD of Steel,"

to address their respective

unions.

As the outstanding

champion of negro rights in the country, KING is a powerful

political influence, recognized as such

by the higher echelons

of the Democratic Party.

He has access to Attorney General

ROBERT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY, who, politically, need

KING, particularly in the south, where in cities llke Atlanta

and New Orleans the negro vote now constitutes the balance of

power, and where KING controls the negro vote.

JAMES HOFFA, Teamsters Union "boss" appreciates

the political power of KING, particularly the fact that KING

can

influence the 90,000 negro members of the Teamsters

Union. HOFFA invited KING to address the Teamsters Union,

and KING accepted the invitation.

Knowing that KING is being

deferred to by Attorney General KENNEDY, and President KENNEDY,

HOFF'A requested KING to contact the Attorney General in an

effort to influence the latter "to lay off" HOFFA. KING was

inclined to do as HOFFA requested, but LEVISON convinced him

that to do so would be politically unwise, inexpedient, and

likely to be a "boomerang," since the Attorney

General would

never accede to such a request, particularly in the case of .

HOWFA.

LEVISON had to steer KING away from another politi-

cally hazardous situation.

Some months ago OTTO PREMINGER,

Hollywood movie director,

entered into negotiations with a

KING representative for KING to play a part in a picture

which PREMINGER woulddirectifast, easy money" for kIndle

Although PREMINGER's offer was

"tempting," since it meant

organization, LEVISON realized that for KING to accept the

offer would lower the latter's prestige.

After convincing

KING of this fact

telling him that

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HALL tO KnAW

is that "KING is a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied

(Marxism), believes in it, and agrees with 1t, but because

of his being

a minister of religion, does not dare to espouse

it publicly."

GUS HAIL, according to HARRIS, was "elated" to

collection of contributions of the firm to the Party.

During HALL's conference with ROSS, the latter

Secretary, CPUSA, on 9/12/63:

With respect to DAVIS' liaison function as noted above,

STAN LEVISON has not yet met with BEN DAVIS. The CP is not

happy with STAN LEVISON. In the event STAN LEVISON does

contact BEN DAVIS, the following proposition will be put to

SIAN LEVISON by DAVIS:

STAN LEVISON and his brother ROY are to undertake to

open a branch office in Atlanta, Georgia, of Ireedomways, which

branch office is to be headed by HUNTER PITTS O'DELL. The

LEVISONS are to finance this branch office. This office will

be a bona fide branch office of Freedomways, but it will also

be the headquarters for CP work in the South. In the event

STAN LEVISON refuses this undertaking, the Party will then know

Conmunist Influence on the hegro

Movement since Januazy 13 1963

4. Influence of STANLEY and ROY LEVISON and

HUNTER PITIS O'DELL On MARIIN LUTHER KING

and the leite Movement

NY 694-Si recalled that in June, 1963, he had been

inforned of the following by IMENT HARRIS, GPUSA Reserve Fund

functionary, who stated that he had received this inforation

in the course of neetings that had taken place shortly prior

to thet tune between LiMENT HARRIS and STANLEY LIVISON:

The LEVISONS, particularly STANLEY LEVISON, axe still

MARTIN LUTIER KING's "brain-trust"' . more than ever

beforE. At

& meeting between the LEVISONS, HUNTER PITTS O'DELL, MARTIN LUTHER

KING, and the chiet assistant to the Attorney General (identity

unknown to if bya-sy, the latter, pointing to the LEVISONS and

HUN ILE PITIS O'DELL,

said to MARTIN LUTHER KING, "These men are

Party members, watch out for them." KING did not "bat an eyelash"

upon hearing this remark, and after the meeting, LEVISON said to

KING, "I congratulate you on the way you acted regarding his

warning (the Assistant attorney General's); you are a real

Marxist-Leninist. inis 1s how a true Marxist-Leninint acts."

As reported to HARRIS by LOVISON, everything KING does, he first

discusses with SIANLLY LEVISON and accepts the lattur's advice

wholeheartedly. KING also wnoleheartedly accepts the advice of

HUNTER PITTS O'DELL as regards matters within thelatter's juris-

diction.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONS fuel that the

Party has done little, if anything, to assist the fight for civil

rignts for legroes, and further, since they feel that the Party,

as a result of this "do-nothing" attitude, has lost prestige,

The LEVISONS and O'DEll are still Party members, but do not

desire to be openly "linked up" with the Party.

although

they are "disenchanted" with the Party, they are not quitting the

Party.

With respect to the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement, they

will act on their own initiative and will not accept instructions

from the farty.

Inasnuch as the Party would like to continue to control

the MARTIN LUTHER KIG movement, BIN DAVIS has been assigned to

be "liaison or intermediary" with the LiVISONS and HUNTER PITTS

O'DELL.

Whether or not the LEVISONS and O'DEll vill maintain

liaison regarding matters concerning the MARTIN LUTILE KING

movement is a matter for them to decide. In vacw of the LEVISONS'

statenent with respect to advising MARCIN LUTIER KING independently

of Party instructions, it would seem that DaVIS may not have any

success in maintaining liuison with the LEVISONS and HUNTER PITTS

O'DELL. The LEVISONS and O'DELL are aware of the fact that BEN

DAVIS has been given this assigment by the Party.

According to LEM HANRIS, MARTIN LUTHER RING is referred

tọ by such top Party functionaries as GUS HALl, BEN DAVIS, JAMES

JACKSON, and CLAUDE LIGHTFOOT as "a true genuine harsist-Leninist

from the top of his head to the tips of his toes. In the Party,

the report is that MARTIN LUTHER KING is following a Marxist-

Leninist line.

NY 694-S% recalled that he had been informed by GUS HAll,

General Secretary, CPUSA, on 7/9/63 that the Party is no longer

concerned about the fact that STANLEY and ROY LEVISON have severed

in all of the activities of the Negro groups seeking integration.

. He stated that the CP is playing a particularly important and

influential role in arranging the "Negro marches." He said that

never in the history of tize National Association for the Advauce-

ment of Colored People (1440P) has the relationship between

the

Party and the NAACP been so good.. HAll said that the Party's

relations with ROY WILKINS, NAACP Leader, are particularly good.

according to JOHNSON, further stated that similar activity took

place in all the important cities throughout the United States,

Party menbers exerting considerable influence in inducing people

to atcond the March on Washington. According to ARNOLD JOHNSON,

important trade union leaders, such as HARY VAN ARSDALE,

and AUBY DEE, were nembers of a "subcommittee" of the March on

Washington. JOHNSON further advised that before thesctual warch,

there was & mecting of tno entire March on washington committee,

and that the question arose whether one or the other of the March

leaders should eulogize W., E. B. DU BOIS at the senorial service

connected with the March.

According to ARNOLD JOHNSON, ROY WILKINS

insisted that he be permitted to deliver the eulogy. JOHNSON noted

that despite/that

was a publicly known fact that W. B. B. DU BOIS,

before his death, had espoused the Conmunist cause and became a

CPUSA member, there was no reference made to this fact on the part

of the committee when it was being decided who should eulogize

and the Nearo Movement

On 1/4/62, ISADORE WOFSY advised as follows: STANLEY

LEVISON is doing importans work for the GPUSA in his role of

adviser to the Southern legro leader MARTIN LUTIER KING. LEVISON

wrote the speech which KiNG delivezed at the AEL-CIO convention

in Florida. LEVISON is astive in KING's "right-to-vote movement"

in the south, and he was instrumental. in raising $200,000 for

this movement.

In early Februury, 1962, LEM HARRIS stated that shortly

before that time, he, HARRIs, transnitted to GUS HAth a "confidentia)

verbal report" on DI. MARIEN LUTHER KING fumished tO HARRIS by

some time ago, KING, on LEVISON's advice, first obtained approval

to do so from A. PHILIP RANDOLPH, Negro labor leader, who, if he

had not been consulted in the matter, might have felt that KING's

making a speech at this convention was a blow to RANDOLPh's

prestige. KING delivered a remarkably effective speech at this

convention, and, as a result, received invitations from numerous

labor leaders, including 'NO DONALD of Steel," to address their

respective unions.

as the outstanding champion of Negro rights

in the country, KING is & powerful political influence, recognized

as such by the higher echelons of the Democratic Party. Me has

access to Attorney General ROSSRT KENNEDY and President KENNEDY,

who, politically, need KhiS, particularly in the souch, where in

cities like Atlanta and New Orleans the Negro vote now constitutes

the balance of power and where KING controls the legro vote.

JAMES HOFFA, Teamster Union boss, apprcciates the

political power of KING, particularly the fact thut KING can

influence she 90,000 membess of the Teamster Union.

What LEVISON particularly wanted GUS HAil to know is

that "KING is

a wholehearted Marxist, who has studied it (Marxism),

believes in it, and agrees with it, but because of his being a

Minister of religion, does not dare to espouse iù publicly."

JAMES JACKSON, on 3/7/62, remarked that an article in

a recent edition of "The lacion," ostensibly written by MARTIN

LUTHER KING, J., was actually written by HUNIER PITTS O'DELL.

(It is noted that the 3/3/12 issue of "The Nation" contains

an article attributed to MARTIN LUTHER KING., Jr, entitled

"Report on Civil Rights--Funbling on the New Esontier," which

Is a criticism of the KENNUDY Administration's efforts on behale

is still representing the CPUSA and that he is still on the

National Connittee of the CPUSA. HALL further sonarked that

O'DELl is a "brain-truster" for MARTIN LUTHER KIG and is

doing an excellent job.

B. CPUSA Influence through

_W. E. B. Du BOIS

JAMES E. JAGKSON stated on 11/17/61 chat the next

edition of "the Worker" would give considerable space to

reporting that W. E. B. DU BOIS had become & membes of the

CRUSA. DU BOLS waS then chick politicalmentor to LiKRUMAH of

Ghana and KAMAl was arzunging that DU BOIS live in & palace

in Ghana.

ACCOrdiNg tO JACKSON, DU BOIS' joining the CPUSA was

part of an important "political build up" of NKNIAl, who

intended to be the first "social democrat" in Africa to

introduce "socialism as such"' on the African continent. With

DU BOis, an Internationally known Negro, and now a Communist,

as his chief adviser, NKRAl expected

to make is position in

Africa similar to that of castro in Cuba and Sukazne in Indonesia,

both of whom had leading Communists as their chies adviers.

NKRAM, who first secured KHRUSHCHEV's approval to bring DU BOIS

to Ghana in the latter's role of political mentor to NKRUMAH,

expected that people throughout Africa would be greatly impressed

by the fact that an internationally-known Negzo like DU BOIS

had assumed so important a post in Ghana.

"People's Voicel

"People's Voice' was a Negro publication controlled

by the Party to the extent that the Party furnished money for

its maintenance and CP mombors controlled the policy of the

said paper.

NY 694-S*, at the direction of the CPUSA, gave to

MAX YENGAN and ADAM CLAYTON POWELL, who were then in control

of "People's Voice," $150,000 o€ CPUSA funds for the mintenance

of said paper.

The NAACP, in the 1940's, had among its top leadership

III. Informant's Own Views, Opinions, Interpretations

and Evaluations of the Information Fumished Above,

along with an Estimate of How Many Negro Comnunists

• Active Party Menbera as Of October, 1953

With respect to the interpretation that should be

placed upon the fact that the LEVISONS no longer accept Party

discipline as regards their Influence over MARILY LUTHER KING,

the informant advised as follows:

It must be noted that the LEVISONS still want to be

considered members of the CPUSA. There is no intomation available.

reflecting that they do not continue to be ideological Communists.

A distinction must be drawn between control by the UP per se and

othemise. From a practical standpoint, the distinction here is

one morely of tactics. As ideological. Communists, the LEVISONS

presumably will continue to influence the Negro movement in

accordance with set Marxist tenets. It is to be noted that

their disenchantment with the CPUSA is due to the fact that the

CPUSA, in their opinion, has not done enough to influence the

Negro

movement, has not seized the offensive whereby the Party

could assume its vanguard sole with respect to the Negro drive

Eoc civil rights. It should ba kept in mind that the Party is

all agent ottool of Moscow and that not to take instructions from

the agent does not necessarily mean that there will be any

deviation from the policies of the principal,

Wich regard to W. E. B. DU BOIS, NY 694-5* stated that

the fact that a man of DU BOIS' stature in the Legro movement

became a CPUSA member necessarily must have a tremendous influence

on the Mogro population in general. The fact that such an "eldes

statesman" in the Negro Movement had espoused the Communist Party

might well cause Negroes outside the CP to lend a sympathetic ear

to the CPUSA.

NOR SECID

NY 694-s* thinks that the fact that the CPUSA sent

five Negroes to Moscow as members of a 7-member delegation would

create a favorable impression upon the Negro community.

He also considers that the Soviet recognition in

"Pravda" of BEN DAVIS' bixthday likewise would have a very

favorable effect upon the logro community, indicating that

the Soviets are aware of the Negro struggle for civil rights

in the USA and of BEN DAVIS' pre-eminent position in the Negro

movement.

NY 694-s" called accention to the fact that the direct

circulation of "Freedomways" does not necessarily reflect the

actual number of readers uno could be exposed to the ideas set

forth in this publication. It is fair to assume that more

people read this magazine than purchase it.

NY 694-S* stated that it would be futile Eor him to

estimate the number of Negro Communists active as Farty members

as of October, 1963. He stated he has no information in this

regard and suggests that possibly Ce 5824-5%, who attended a

recent NEC meeting in New York where the Negro situation was

under discussion, might possibly have such infomation.

IV, Party Plans for Increasing

Such Activities

NX 694-s' called attention to the proposal to be put

tO SIANLEY LEVISON; namely, that a "Freedomways" branch be

established in Atlanta, Ga., which office could be used as a

headquarters for CP work in the South.

NY 694-Si also noted that possibly CG 5324-st is in

possession of current intormation regarding Party plans fox

infiltration of the Negro movement inasnuch as there was

discussion in this regard at the recent NEC meeting held in NYC.

on 4/7/64, NY 694-s* made the following comments

regarding STANLEY LEVISON'S

status with the CP, USA:

What the Party thinks of LEVISON's:

I#VISON has criticized the Party for not being

militant enough in the civil rights struggle and that the Party

had played no role in the civil rights struggle. This criticism

was conveyed to the Party thru LEM HARRIs.

This was many

months ago.

HALL, JAMES JACKSON, BEN DAVIS and LEM HARRIS

discussed this.

In the criticism LEVISON mentioned that not

only the Party did nothing but the "Daily Worker" did nothing

and the only one he respects in the Party for having conducted

some token fight for civil rights was BEN DAVIS. It was

decided that BEN DAVIS be in contact with LEVISON's and in

all that time they never made any attempt to contact DAVIS;

made no attempt to contact HALL Or WOFSY or anyone else in

Party.

HALL's opinion is that LEVISON's are oppo-tunists

who, now that they have milked the Party dry (have no further

opportunity to make money on the larty have no use for it.

They are opportunists in the sense of being ultra leftwingers

who disagree with the Party line on the question of civil

rights.

They are opportunists in the sense that tiney want to

control and keep MARTIN LUTHER KING, using him poiitically for

their own personal gain.

HALL is convinced these people are

no good.

There is very little, in his opinion, which would

convince them to come back but

the door has been eft open

thru DAVIS. But they didn't contact DAVIS and nothing was done.

HALL has discussed this with NY 694-5* about four times when

opinion they absconded with building on 73rd St. which HALL

throughr belonged to the CP; with money after WINER died. They

enriched themselves first and gave the crumbs over to the Party

but should they come baci: HALL would accept them providing

DAVIS is in contact with them. DAVIS has made no contact.

ca 5824-S* is also of same opinion as he knew them at one time

and dealt with them both politically and financlally and was

inscontact with them during the underground days before WINER
