may have regarding gambling at the

above location.

ADMINISTRATIVE

On June 3, 1964, CG 6036-C advised SA JAMES

To mano

W. GERBLICK that MAX NETTLER is the owner of Mister

T's, a north side night club, and NETTLER lives in

the same building in which it is located. NETTLER is

engaged

in gambling in the Chicago area, and is

in some manner associated with LEONARD PATRICK in

gambling.

NETTLER is in Mister T's on Monday nights, and

he has not in the past met BENNY GOLDBERG, and others

who are gamblers and bookmakers, and it is possible

that these Monday night meetings are held to settle the

previous week's gambling proceeds.

Informant advised

that LEONARD PATRICK may also be meeting MAX NETTLER

at Mister T's on Monday nights.

Informant advised

that on Tuesday nights other hoodlums in the Chicago

area had been observed meeting at Mister T's.

CG 6036-C further advised that the address

948 West Eastwood is a card club which operates 24

hours a day.

No money or chips are used, but each

a fee such as $1.50 to the house, and they

then play private card games. The amounts won or

lost are designated by using playing cards with different

colors meaning different amounts.

This system is also

used at the card club called the Sherman Bridge Club.

The informant advised on July 9, 1964, that

-five people share in profits from the gambling room

at 948 West Eastwood which was operated for over 20

individuals are LEONARD PATRICK, DAVI

YAIRS, FELIX/ALDERISIO, ALBERT FRABOTTA, and MAX

NETTLER.

Informant advised that by way

of history,

the pangini game at this address was originally

started by PATRICK and YARdS, and it was fronted by

NETTLER and ALDERISIO.

On September 3, 1964, the above informant

advised that on the 31st

of August LEONARD PATRICK was

at Mister T's where he met numerous gamblers.

Informant

advised that apparently this meeting was called for

the purpose of splitting the gambling profits for the

month of August.

Informant advised that a similar

meeting is held each month, but not always at the same

place.

On June 10, 1964, CG 6722-C-TE advised SA

DENNIS W. SHANAHAN that MAX NETTLER, who is the true

owner of

Mister T's, possibly has an, interest in a

gambling room on Eastwood Avenue where a game called

pangini is played.

On May 27, 1964, CG 6443-C advised SA JOSEPH

G. SHEA that a certain kind of game called pangini is

played at the card room at 948 West Eastwood.

This

game is played at one table for 50 cents to $1.00;

at a second table a $2 to $4 game is played; and at a third

table a game amounting to $6 or $8 or

even higher is

played. Informant described pangini as being a form

of rummy which is played with eight decks of

cards; a dealer turns over the cards, and betting

is carried on either by the number or the color of the

card.

In order to participate in this game chips

for 50 cents or $1.00 must be purchased from the

dealer, but after a player wins or loses he cashes

in his chips through a floor man, and in through the

dealer.

Informant advised that the pangini game,

which he has described above, has been operating

at this location for 25 years, and LEONARD PATRICK

owns 40 per cent interest in the game.

Informant

advised that this card room is the only place out-

side of Las Vegas where pangini is played.
