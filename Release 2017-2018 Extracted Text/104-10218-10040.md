C. Background

UHUFF (Identity A) was founded in 1953 under the auspices of a

group af Mexican bankers, industrialists, and merchants to spread the

principles of free enterprise and private initiative. Since its founding,

the goup bas arranged a number of meetings and congresses designed

to esgiore the dangers of Communism (particularly in its economic

aspers) and byper-nationalism. It has also financed the publication of

paralets, bulletins on economic matters, and books. The director of

this gIOLE (LIHUFF -2) received support from LIHUFF-I and the business

firm which LIHUEF-1 headed in Mexico until 31 December 1962 when this

company decided to give up its franchise in Mexico.

In June 1960 LIHUFF-] visited the ODACID Political Counselor and

regrested an ODACID contact with LIHUFF-2's organization. Subsequently,

Chie, ODACID Mexico, asked the COS, KUBARK Mexico, to explore the

possibility af giving financial help to the group headed by LIHUFE-2. In

mic-August 1962 (HMMS-2530 RYBAT), Oliver G. GALBOND advised the

Mexico Station that the group had been receiving partial financial aid

from ai group of PBPRIME business corporations (solicited by Mr. Heury

Holland, now deceased) and that KUBARK Headquarters had also provided

some financial assistance through this channel. After the death of

Mr. Holland, it was recommended that the funding be handled through

the Mexico Station, Specifically, this was to help pay for the publication

(Identity B). The local ODACID Chief was consulted. He replied that he

thought LIHUFF? was one of the few economists in Mexico fighting

Coinmunism. The ODACID Chief also said that everything possible

should be done to support the LIHUFF publication (HMMT-3023 RYBAT

1926, 30 August 1962).

The LIHUFF organization has its offices in Mexico City, with

associated offices

and working contacts in

the provinces of Mexico and in several capital cities of Latin America.

LIHUFF devotes its efforts to selling the free enterprise system as

an economic way of life and in defending at every turn individual liberty

or freedom.

In Mexico this type of organization is rather unique, as the

trend in Mexico is towards more government intervention.

LIHUFF maintains an excellent library of source materiale on

economics and free enterprise, which is open to interested researchers.

LIHUFF publishes regularly a considerable amount of materials.

including the monthly publication (Identity B). See Enclosure 5 for

samples of LIHUFF publications.

The group is extremely active in the student field, in the provinces

as well as in the capital. It supports student publications; has organized

a national student group (Identity C); and engages in militant student

political action.

LIHUFF also prepares and sends out to provincial newspapers

editorials featuring anti-Communist themes. In the last four years

LIHUFF has collected ó5 loose-leaf binders filled with editorial clips

authored in the LIHUFF office. LIHUFF also sponsors a training course

at which interested groups (of 15 to 20 persons) are indoctrinated.

LIHUFF-2, Director of LIHUFF, has shown completed dedication

to his program. The merbers of LIHUFF, especially the students,

have demonstrated courage and competence in a variety of operations.

cut-out and operational adviser to LIHUFF-2, the Director of the group.

LIHUFF 1 worked for KUBARK in Panama from 1947 until April 1949

when he returned to Mexico. He was in contact socially with membere

of the Mexico Station and in November 1962 was hired for the above

work. Biographical data is being forwarded via separate dispatch. He

is contacted by Willard C. CURTIS or Michael C. CHOADEN. Training

is not required since LIHUFF -1 has been in intelligence work from his

service with PBPRIME military intelligence during WWII. He was

engaged to work for PBPRIME military intelligence in Mexico until

recently. He knowe that he is working for KUBARK. HMMW-11040 of

25 October 19u2 granted OA for LIHUFF -1.

LIHUFF -2 is a 46 year old Mexican lawyer. He is also a well known

economist who directs an economic research organization in Mexico and

other Latin American countries. He is met by LIHUFF.I. LIHUFF-2

probably suspects that funds may come to him from ODYOKE; however,

cover used is that the money is from private basiness groups. He was

granted an OA on 26 October 1962 (HMMW-11089 of 9 November 1962).

2. Mechanisme.

a. The principal officers of the Identity A group are listed in

Appendix I (separate cover enclosure No. 3). Other details of the

organization are included in C. Background above.

b. The LIHUFF organization frequently and regularly makes

press placements in all of Mexico City's leading newspapers. Its

editorial features are also regularly accepted by provincial publications.

Radio and television placement is on an irregular basis.

(1) General propaganda and political actions of LIHUFF

will be influenced and guidedby the Station for its benefit.

(2) LIHUFF student operations have already been

utilized (often in coordination with other Station student assets).

(3) The LIHUFF editorial service for provincial news-

papers has been used by the Station.

4) The press-placement capabilities of LIHUFF i

pital city newspapers, which is considerable, has been used. Th

(5) LIHUFF's international connections, especially his

associated offices in

will be exploited.
