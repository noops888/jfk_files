Mrs. Marguerite Oswald, mother of Lee Harvey Oswald,

knows Dobkins and was in contact

with him in November, 1966.

She claims that he is very similar to her late son and that

some of the travel activity attributed to her son might have

actually applied to Dobkins.

Cuban Embassy or has attempted to use their Consular facilities

to arrange travel to the Soviet Union. Additional descriptive

data concerning him will be furnished to you when available.
