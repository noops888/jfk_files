Title: ASSASSINATION MATERIAL DISCLOSURE ACT

Synopsis: JFK Task Force returning file(s) to WFO.

Details: Re WFO EC dated 03/24/1999, one box of

records are

being returned.

The originals removed from these files

and, in some

cases, replaced with duplicate copies of the original were

accessioned to the National Archives and Records Administration

(NARA)

pursuant to the JFK Records Collection Act of 1992.

Provision of the JFK Act allowed for certain information to be

postponed from public release until the year 2017; therefore, the

pages have NOT necessarily been released for public review in

their

entirety.

Under the JFK Act, originals to all material deemed

assassination records must be accessioned to NARA regardless of

whether the material is open in full or released with information

postponed.

Therefore, any documents or pages from FBI files

accessioned to NARA pursuant to the JFK Act are no longer

considered the possession of the FBI. The duplicate pages have

the he

been inserted strictly for research purposes.

The copies contained within the previously mentioned

file(s) do not necessarily show the most up-to-date

classification.
