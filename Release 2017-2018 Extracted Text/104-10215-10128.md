stated that he had recently contacted Segundo Sevallot, the of the

Pop offictala of the Rational Bank, In connection with obtaining approval

for sona of the company'o US technicians to take their furniture and

appliances out of Cube.

Cevsllos asid, "I don't want those technicians

to leste.

He need then." At this, the rubber company official stated

toat it was too late and that the technicions had already gone.

Cevallos then made the statement that he was very mch concerned about

the flight of technielans of all kinds from Cuba.

Hs said that the

revolution had beenfought to give Cuba a more highly devaloped industry.

but that the technicians were leaving and industry sas being serioualy

effected.

Coralles then said,

Cevallos in a man of about 60-63 yeare, and has a very important position,

In that he 1a in charge of granting foreign exchange. My friend said

thas Cevallos 1a a very pleasant individual but seems to be a theorist,

a professorial type uho obvioualy has had little or no buninose experience.

He ban a background as a viiter and philosopher, and apparently 1a

extremely naive as evidenced by his comment that he would talk to "Che"

Guevara about hou the revolution had gotten off the trael.

As' of Aug 60 the three usjor refineries conflocated by the Castro rogles

are operating in fairly good sbape. Their principal problem ia that

the Soviet crude being supplled is very light and they cannot run as

ample, bus a capacity of 36 thouand bbla per day on heavy crudo, but

26 thousand bbls per dsy la the beat they have been abie to do on the

Sortet erudi, ind 1t la been realag at a rate of only 20 chousand bble

per day since 20 Jul 60.

The Soviet crude armilable to dsta han been compatible with the refinertes

and will not damage then, but in addition to not being able to get aa

ends.. Thie 18 true of all thres jor refineries.

The refinerts vere designed for 26 gravity erude which te fairly beavy.

The Sovlet erude 18 33 gravity, and has crused an imbalance in that

they are now producing more gasoline than in needed. As a consequence,

Cibe ln searchirg desperately for foel o1l. The USSR has said that it

1s not to a pooltion to supply fuel oll and so Cuba bas turned toward

Mexico, even to the extent of attempting to arrange douls whereby they

WIll trade gasoline for fuel o1l.

BATES

The tabalance of gasoline la lodicated by the fact that the Cabalguan

refiemy was shut down recently becauze its gasoline storage was completely

fulled.

Cuba will resch a critical potat abcut 1 Sep 60. The Base refinery slowed

down fron 26 thousand bble per day to 20 thousand bble per day because

1t had only 10-day espply of crude. The supply on hand was sufficient

to last coly until 14 Asg, but around 11 Aug the refinery was supposed
