CRET

This source was temporarily discontinued on

April 19, 1962, after receipt of information from the

source on April 18, 1962, reflecting that shortly there-

after an extensive

remodeling job was to be undertaken at

the location of the source.

The remodeling process was

undertaken during the latter part of April, 1962, and was

completed during late June, 1962.

In July, 1962, means of

was obtained and on July 10,

1962, an attempt was made for re-entry,.

however, was not

accomplished due to security reasons. U)

On July 12, 1962, during the early morning hours

entry was made into the Armory Lounge and a survey was

conducted whereby it was noted that this establishment had

undergone

a complete face lifting and the prior location of

the "Mite" unit was now being utilized apparently as a storage

area and contained linen shelves, deep freezes, and a walk-in

meat locker.

It was apparent that this room was not to be

utilized as in the past as a private dining room as it was

still possible that this room could be utilized for private

discussions.

At the north wall of the main dining room it

was noted that a long leatherette covered booth extending

the entire width of the wall was located and several jacks

for extensions were placed along this booth. A telephone

was noted on the booth.

A doorway reaching

into the storage

area described above is located directly to the rear of this

booth.

It was felt that any meetings in the establishment

would

now in all probability take place in or near the vicinity

of this booth described above.

For that reason then, one

"Mite" was installed in the north wall partition, between

this main dining room and back storage room.

The "Mite"

unit is directly

above the aforementioned booth in the wall

area.

The "Mite" lines were concealed under the leatherette

covering which extends along the upper portion of the wall

in the back storage room.

The lines were strapped down in

the old protector block which is located in the same back

room on the west extension of the wall partition between the

dining room and the storage room underneath the aforementioned

leatherette wall covering. (U)

It was ascertained that during this installation

that the telephone lines previously utilized in this establish-

ment no longer enter into this protector block. A complete

rewiring had been undertaken by the telephone company installer.

An outside survey was conducted of the area where the telephone

drop lines enter the Armory Lounge. Photographs were made

of this area so a close examination could be conducted to

ascertain the exact point of

entry of the new lines made by

the telephone installer when rewiring.

Work was discontinued

at this point due to the time element for security reasons. (U).

On July 24, 1962, an attempt to re-enter the location

of the source was made, however, again numerous top level

hoodlums ite were observed entering and leaving this establish-

ment immediately prior to and after the time set for re-entry.

A twenty-four hour surveillance was conducted on this establish-

ment from July 25 through July 26, 1962, and on July 27, 1962,

re-entry was made at which time the existing lines were

traced

throughout the building with particular emphasis on the basement

area. (U)

It is noted that on July 27, 1962, photographs of

the interior were obtained through utilization of infra-red

photography.

work was discontinued at this point due to the

time element for security reasons. (V)

On August 1, 1962, re-entry was made at which time

it was determined the pay telephone service going into the

building had four lines,

going from the protector block

located on the west outside wall of the building where the

The private line business phone was

connected to the protector block with a quad JKT station wire,

and a yellow and black pair was connected to the spare drop

line located inside the protector block. The quad JKT wire

referred to above initially terminated in a 42-A connecting

block located in the kitchen in a baseboard on the north wall,

of the kitchen. A second 42-A block was installed in the

floor joists in the basement directly under the above-mentioned

existing 42-A block.

down to the new 42-A block in the basement.

The quad

station wire continued southward along the

floor joists

to a point under the south end of the kitchen where it goes

upward into the wall. At that point it was necessary to make

arrangements for further entry into the establishment. (V)

this posat due to:

the time element

On August 6, 1962, re-entry was again made at which

time holes were drilled utilizing a carbon drilling bit

with extension.

These holes were made between the wall below

the old protector block.

This hole is concealed at the

floor between the wall partition dividing the dining room

and the rear store room of the building.

It leads to an area

in an open space below the floor.

It was determined this space

is in a sealed basement area under the dining room. Efforts

were made to snare the wire drop from this hole through the

sealed area to a crawl space located in the basement.

Work

was discontinued at this point due to the time element for

security reasons. (U)

On August 16, 1962, entry was again made and lines

were strung by fishing

the "Mite" lines through the sealed

basement area mentioned above. These lines were strung to the

42-A connecting block and strapped down to the yellow and

black lines at this point.

It was determined that the microphone

was in satisfactory working order upon completion of the work

at this point and measures of security in securing all points

where lines were made. (V)

It is to be noted that the basement area consists

of a portion of the basement which is regular height for

walking and has a concrete floor.

This portion is approximately

one-third of the length of the building and is in the south

portion of the building.

It is used for storage space. Following

this portion of the basement approximately one-third in length

of the building which is also the middle section of the basement

consists of a crawl space. At the end of this area is a

concrete block partition extending from the floor section into

the ground.

The north one-third of the basement area is

a sealed portion of concrete block construction. It has a

concrete block wall which extends directly under the wall

partition dividing the rear storage room and the dining

room of the lounge.
