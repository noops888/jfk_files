Re: LA COSA NOSTRA

AR (DL 92-383)

On 9/25/63, BuAgents were in contact with JOE

CAMPISI and during the discussion,

CAMPISI made reference

to the "recent publicity in connection with captioned matter.

CAMPISI's father, CARLO, is a native of Sicily and the

entire family speaks with a Sicilian dialect among themselves

and among other Italian friends.

(CAMPISI is married

al woman of Irish descent and there has been no information

developed that he is a member of captioned organization).

CAMPISI was asked to give a translation of "La Cosa Nostra"

and he stated that the way the newspapers and TV commentators

are using it is an error.

He explained that actually

the

term is

"Cosa de Nostra"

(Co' -sa dã No'-stra).

He stated

that if a group of people were sitting around

talking

about any matter and they wanted what they said kept to

themselves they would refer to it as Cosa de Nostra,

meaning that it was their business and their information

only.

Above is being furnished for informational purposes.
