burnishing information on a current

basis regarding ALEX.

CG 16218-C, CG 2951-0, CG 6036-C,

and CG 6i32-C have furnished information regarding ALEX

in the past.

It is noted that in this regard that ALEX

has not been known to

be in Chicago since May 17, 1958,

and, therefore,

there is little? chance. for informants in

Chicago to furnish current information regarding him.

PCIs

furnished

information concerning

him in the past.

THOMAS MC GANN, elevator

operator

ALEXIS

residence, häs been developed

as a source of

I dermation

but has not seen ALEX since May 17, 1958.

Is noted

that two other elevator operators who had been under.

development as PCIs, were fired by the management of

ASEX's

residence building;

one as a result of refusing to perform

additional work and the other due to the fact that he

became intoxicated and did not report to work for two weeks.

At the residence of ALEX's mother, in Evergreen

which ALEX visits regularly when in town;

regular contact has been maintained with Sergeant MICHAEL

A. SERRITELLA of the Evergreen Park Police Department who

grew up in the same neighborhood as "ALEX in Chicago, and

who is, therefore,

well acquainted with ALEX.

Sergeant

SERRITELLA resides two blocks from ALEX's mother's residence

and has been of assistance in reporting activities at her

residence.

Contact has also been established with two

neighbors

who live across the street from Mrs. ALEX in

Evergreen Park, namely Mr. and Mrs. JOSEPH (ELEANOR) VINCENT,:

at 9336 South Spaulding,

and HENRY
