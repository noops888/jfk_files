Informant is now in contact with associates of

MASTERROR and expects to meet with MASFERRER and work with

his group la the near future. XM

Miami Office considers MASFERRER as one of the most

important and active persons in Anti-CASTRO activities in

Miami®

Informant stated that frequently he has to make

decisions as situations present themselves. Most of the

time there is no opportunity to call the contacting agent

because time is of the essence and he is with Cuban

Revolutionists.

Informant stated he considered himself

experienced in Cuban Revolutionary activities, personally

acquainted with different individuals involved, knows their

way of thinking, and is familiar with their scheming,

approaches, and

methods. # h)

Informant said that Anti-CASTRO activity is much

more "fluid" then was Anti-BATISTA activities. He said the

Anti-CASTRO groups have many defected persons from the

former Cuban Revolutionary groups. There is much more contact

between former BATISTA officials and former supporters. of

FIDEL CASTRO then prior to January 1, 1959. S/M)

Many of the exiles in Miami from the BATISTA

government were away from Cuba a long time. When they went

back to Cuba and subsequently defected from the CASTRO

movement, they again returned to Miami.. Many of them are

experienced revolutionists and are still in a revolutionary

spirit and

ready to cooperate with the Anti-CASTRO activities

of the Batistaians. AM)

Miami Agents who have contacted MM 639-S, state

that his knowledge of the Bureau's jurisdictions and

interests are excellent. He knows what is expected of him
