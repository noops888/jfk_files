CENTER for the STUDY of INTELLIGENCE

22 August 1995

Mr. David G. Marwell

Executive Director

Assassination Records

Review Board

600 E Street, NW

Washington, DC 20530

Dear David:

This is to acknowledge your letter of 16 August 1995

to Director of Central Intelligence Deutch describing the

Assassination Records Review Board's most recent formal

determinations with respect to CIA records.

The appropriate Agency components have again reviewed

the 37 documents which the Board has decided to release,

either fully or with some information postponed.

Please

advise the Board that the Agency does not plan to appeal

to the President for additional postponements with respect

to the documents listed in your letter.

We understand that further review will be needed by

December 1995 to determine if additional information in a

number of the documents can be released. We would be pleased

to discuss with the Board and your staff any issues that may

arise with regard to declassifying and releasing CIA-originated

information.

Sincerely,

John Parcina

John

F. Pereira
