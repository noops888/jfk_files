Informant also. advised that COLSTON had been in

Dallas, and about two weeks ago, was to have gone to Lake

rahoe, Nevada, with informant's wife.

When his wife was

ready to leave, COLSTON could not be located and informant

has no idea where she might have gone or where she is currently

located.

Informant stated he has removed himself from the

previous proposition in Oklahoma City wherein he and RITTER

were to go into partnership in a restaurant. He

said RITTER

wanted to put a poker game in the back room and informant said

he would not agree to this. Informant stated that, so far

as he knows, RITTER is going ahead on the restaurant deal alone.

On March 4, 1968, PCI

advised

SA STEPHEN S. TRAVIS, Oklahoma City, that while playing bridge

at the Boomer Bridge Club in Oklahoma City, JACK RITTER told

him there was so much heat on bookmaking in Oklahoma City

and he had lost so much money in bad odds betting, that he

had closed his book for the present time.

On March 6, 1968, OC 548-PC advised that JACK RITTER

met FRANCES COLSTON in approximately, January, 1964, wher

RITTER was working at the Canadian Country Club, Canadiar

County,

Oklahoma.

COLSTON eventually became RITTER's mistress

and in

1965, RITTER began to hold weekly poker games in COLSTON's

apartment. Each Monday night, RITTER and eight or ten others

would meet at this apartment and hold poker

games which each

player had

to "buy in" with at least $300.

Later In the same year, RITTER and Oklahoma City

bookmaker, KENNETH FbANERY, were

booking out of the Capitol

Arms Apartments in Oklahoma City. - In 1966, RITTER's

mistress obtained a job as assistant manager of the Normandie

Apartments in Oklahoma City, and RITTER obtained an apartment

in that building and booked

from it during the football

season. In 1967, RITTER again obtained an apartment at the

Normandie Apartments after booking in COLSTON's apartment

for three or four days.

Informant has seen RITTER accepting bets and

calling other local Oklahoma City bookies, but to informant's

knowledge, RITTER has never made or accepted any out-of-state

telephone calls. Informant has heard RITTER and Dallas,

bookie, JOHNNY STONE, discuss another Dallas bookie,

R. D. MATHEWS aS

about MATHEWS. Informant has never known RITTER to

contact MATHEWS. _RITTER told informant be intends to, resume

bookmaking during the 1968 football season with BRUCE COUCH,

Oklahoma City bookie, at the After Hours Club, Logan County,

"Oklahoma.

On March 11, 1968, OC 549-PC advised SA HOWARD CECIL

that he was to play poker that night with RITTER and others

at the apartment of JIM WEHBA, apartment 301, Belle Isle

Apartments, Oklahoma City.

amount of money booking during the past year and among

others, owes Oklahoma City bookies KENNETH FLANERY and TRACY

POE, as well as, Dallas, Texas bookie JOHNNY STONE.

On March 15, 1968, OC 548-PC advised SA HOWARD -

CECIL that RITTER's weekly poker game for the night of

March 1l, 1968, was supposed to be held at the apartment of

JIM WEHBA at the Belle Isle apartments; however, WEHBA

had to go out of town and the game was changed to the apartment

of FRED MONSOUR at the Spanish Village Apartments, Oklahoma

City.

Because of the snow storm, RITTER and MONSOUR were

the only players who showed up.

RITTER's wife has gone to Hot Springs, Arkansas

for two weeks to attend the horse races.

She goes there

each year where she meets with a man with whom she is having

an affair.

RITTER is unaware of this. RITTER's wife is

reported to be a former prostitute.

RITTER obtained his football schedules during the past

football season from Oklahoma City bookie BRUCE COUCH. RITTER

then mailed the blank scheddles out to his bettors who had

to call RITTER for the "line". RITTER would meet with his

bettors on each Monday at the DeVille Motel to settle up.

RITTER had a

poor season and is in bad financial shape.

On March 22, 1968, OC 548-PC advised SA HOWARD CECIL

that RITTER left at 10:30 A.M. that date for Wichita Falls,

l'exas, to attend a bridge tournament. He intends to returr

in Oklahoma City.

This informant advised at 8:30 P.M. On March 25,

1968, that RITTER and Oklahoma City bookmaker JOE VAN SCOY

en route to the poker game.
