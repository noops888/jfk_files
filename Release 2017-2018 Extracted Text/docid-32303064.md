fines while GIORDANO was sentenced to three years imprisonment

but was not fined.

on 3/24/60, the defendants appealed their convictions to

the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, Philadelphia, Pa.

ruling has been handed down to date.

Recently, Intelligence Division, IRS, Pittsburgh, transmittec

information from one of its informants to the effect that.

the Empire Treasury lottery ticket is being printed in

New Kensington and clipped and bound in Johnstown, Pa.

Inasmuch as all illegal activity of an organized nature in

New Kensington area is controlled directly or indirectly

by the MANNARINOs, it 1s logical to assume they have some

Interest in this operation.

PG 615-C has advised that

the Empire Treasury lottery ticket can be purchased in

New Kensington and in Youngstown, Ohio.

A new case has

been opened and is being vigorously investigated by the

Pittsburgh Division.

2.

As regards to vulnerable areas of possible violations

with the Bureau's jurisdiction, the following should be

considered:

The MANNARINOs in the past have had gambling interests in

Cuba, and NORMAN ROTHMAN, who has indicated he is the

MANNARINOs ' Cuban contact man, has boasted of his closeness

to and influence with former Cuban dictator FULGENIO BATTISTA

and, to a lesser degree, the current dictator FIDEL CASTRO.

Inasmuch as there are reportedly numerous MANNARINO slot

machines in Cuba today, especially in Camaguey Province,

it is possible that there will be a Neutrality Matter violation.

In numerous instances, information has been received that

various items are for

sale in New Kensington, the price

of which would indicate them to be stolen.

There has been

nothing to

link the MANNARINOs with any TFIS violations

under the "Receiving" portion.

There has been no information to tie in the MANNARINOS

directly with WSTA matters. However, there Is some prostitution

activity in the New Kensington area, and further investigation

may at least involve MANNARINO henchmen and underlings.
