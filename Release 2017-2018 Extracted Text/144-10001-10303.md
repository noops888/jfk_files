DE GAULLE'S ATTITUDE AI TIME OF KENNEDY'S DEATH IMPRESSES MANY

27 Nov 63

Most Immediate

[2-part message complete]

A religious service in memory of

President KENNEDY was held

yesterday afternoon in the church in Accra:

A particularly large

crowd, mostly Africans, literally, overflowed the Porticoes.

Contrary to the practice of Presidént NKRUMAH, who never

participates in religious ceremonies, several members of the

government and the President of the Supreme Court of Justice were

present.

Except for the Cuban and Chinese ambassadors,: the chiefs

of the diplomatic missions were in attendance.

President NKRUMAH broadcast a'message to the nation exalting

the personality of the late President "who will be extolled in the

annals of humanity for his action against racism and his efforts

in favor of peace and human rights."

President DE GAULLE's act of attending the funeral in person

the wording of his two messages to Mrs. KENNEDY and to the

new President of the United' States impressed many of my colleagues

and members of the governmént, who praised the human and political

aspects of out President's attitude.
