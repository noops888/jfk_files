OSWALD, beause of his Irritablo charaoter, beoame annoyed with ARCUC

In halping his case, that his wife was & sor citizong that ho was &

OSWALD told the

The Soy Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case l1ke this

would take from three to four months.

Ceollin says it 1s absurd that

they let him enter (Ruby entering ja1l where OSWALD vas). Juliets tys

he (Ruby) was there from the first day, that he began to mix with th

police and newspepermen.

It was perfeotly planned, indeed some of the

pollo probably are of the same orgenization because Ruby mutckhan

Ceoilla agrees, the ploture is evidence of that became the polive

Julieta hopes they will

continue the investigation, at least Kennedy's brother bas sent a special

agent. Cecilia says everything about it is strange as the puper stated

they found this charzoter (Ruby) drinking Coca Cole on the second floor

and they jut left him there.

Julieta adds that from the I very firat

overything was absurd, that he was a Communist.

Cecilia says this type

(OSWALD) could not be nuts' because the whole thing was so perfectly

planned and that is evident since the bullet was aimad at Kennedy.

Juliots believes

'that this: 1s all done by extreme rightists planned

'rom!

very high up' and that is why they had to kill OSWALD so he couldn't

talk.

Julieta adds; that she hopes they will wake up a little with this business

and pay attention to what has happened because it is evident it 1s aii

conspiracy of rightist groups and military men.

She adds that in i Very

obvious way this individual (OSWALD) pretended he was & Communiss to

prepare the groundwork.

Cecilia believes that he even purposely married

the Russian girl!

Julleta' comments that all was very well prepared,

step by,step to blama the Communists, but that now with this (OSWALD's

death) everything is more complicated and they couldn't continue (the

Investigation) and even the Dallas police said that with the death of

OSWALD. the case was closed, but the FBI answered immediately that It vas

not closed, that lon the contrary, they had to open an investigation und

also thé Senate will name a commission to investigate, and Julleta hopes

they won't be slurmed at whatever may be turned up.

She adds that cuch

trying to join an anti-Castro organization end later poke his nose into

now she thinks it is sonathing more thin thats it is a national thing

•well planned and that oshauD was not just aoting spontaneously. Cecilia

agroes, indeed it was a perfect shot with exact caloulation and could nos

have been done spontaneously. Julieta says that his (OSWALD's) death

was evidently to shut him up

and they had better not say now that Ruby

was at the moment emotional (when he shot OSWALD) because, Ruby is the

typo who could never be piotured isa great patriot since he has a

orimiral record.

Cocille bolieves that Johnson (Pres.) and all those

people are paying attention to the strengach in this.

Julieta is sure

of this and adds that the news (press) wes redloulous in ruspect to.

OSWALD In that he want to marry a Russian, lator was photographed with the

Dally Workers with the Communist newspapor in one hand and a Iroskyiat

one In the other hands thus everythingiwas very well prepared to blame

the loftists, Indeed this has alvays ben the way they have done it,

commit the terrorist acts and then try to make It appear that the aots

wore done by the Communists, that has always been the taotic and only

the paople that have no idea about politice can swallow those things.

She adds that this is very dangerous, Indeed when they are able to assassinate.

MEXI 7101 (pars 121 above)

SLCKET

MEXI 7104 | Amb Mann asks that following be passed to Sec. Rusk.

He presumes KUBARK und

ODENVY will be advised. ¡Sinos my cable of yesterday (MEXI 7072 - para 97 above) there have

been three principal developments; 1). Amb HERNANDEZ Armas at 1839 hrs last evening vulled

DORTICOS of Cube. In this conversatiop, which like the firat is taged, DORTICOS expressed

continued concern over possibility that Mexi police had interrogated Silvia about morey.

ALVARADO, the Nio, was questioned by CAS officer until two a.m. this morning.

This

officer was impressed by, ALVARADO who has offered make himself available as a vitness onu

who 1s now hiding in place provided by CAS.! We cannot guarentee ALVARADO's safety.

Wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities Involved with OSWALD 1n Cub Eib

1s striking, 3) At 1215 hrs Next time 27 Nov. CAS| offloer was adwised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA! that he had rearrested Silvia today because he learned she wes attemptine to

leave Mex1 for Habana. | However, Echeverrie later told LEGAT that he had decided to rearrest

silvie to void any possibility she might escapt to Cuba and later be unavailable as i

Witness.

since we had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem. (MEXI 7072 - par.. !! above)

we have not requested Mexi gov to takelg any aotion against Silvia except to maintain

Increased survelllance of her activities.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he lad any

specifio concrete evidence that she was about to leaye for Cuba.

We do not now know which

Echeverria statements are accurate.

It is quite possible, and even probable, that contro

diotory statements made by Echeverria are explained by desire of GOM to play down, Importance

of osAL viait here,

Mexi line still is that OSWALD visit related solely to visa question.

Consistent with this Echeverria statedito LEGAI that DORIICOS only interested in finding

out whether Mexi authoritles tried to pay a story from silvia.

This is obviously incrorrect

Interpretation.| Neither| LOPDZ Mateor nor Echeverria Know of ALVARADO's story.

Pls rote

that according Echeverria Silvia is being taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press has easy access.

Possiblity of habeds corpus cannot be discounted.

4) 12

have as yet found no trace of the ired headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for him. 5)

In addition to questions raised in yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Mexi authorities to arrest

for Interrogations Europle AZCUEl LUiSe CALDERON and Alfredo MIRABAL,: The two men are

Cuban nationals and Cuban consular officers, Luisa CALDERON 19 a dr seCretary in CulIn

consulate here. In this connection arciole II of Consular Convention between U.S, und Mexi

exempts from arrest

"Consular officors, national of the state by which they are aprointed,:

and not angaged in any private occupation for gain" except "when charged with the connission

LECAT

had FBI Laboratory check handwriting of hotel registry of OSWALD with true signatur and

was found idéntical. / List of names and residences, room numbers ind dates of ocqupancy

of those registered at hotel during time OSWALD was there. / GARCIA Luna received USWALD

at Hotel del Comercio at between 1000 and 1100; OSWALD's room No. 18 was 16.00 pesos daily

with bath, that the registry book indicates OSWALD stayed at hotel night of 1-a Oct and

departed during the day of 2 Ost 63, CARCIA Luna could not recall circumstances of OSWALD's

departure nor the hour. He belleved OSWALD neither spoke nor understood any Spanishi. He

had not observed OSWALD in the hotel during the day and he was never accompanied by any

person.

He jecalled that OswAlD carried a medium-size, brown handbug, which had a zipper

and was either of Naugahyde or canvas material.

He did not remember that' OSWALD had ever

worn & cost and believed he usually appeared in: a short-sleeved shirt of a knit variety.

Matilde GARNICA, maidlat the hotel del Comerclo, recognized photo of OSWALD us being the

young American who had occupied room No. 18 for almost a veek durinu the latter purt of

last year,, She arrives at work between 0900 and 1000 and leaves at 2100.

OSWALD, as few Americans stay at the hotel, 'He had few personal effécts, carried ir a !

-manorI, brown, "alppered handbag cerves or linstation leathel material.

She had seen OSWALD

the day of his arrival and the following Saturday as he s st1ll was in his room when she

checked to determine which rooms were available for cleaning.

When she saw him In the room

on Saturday he said "good morning" in English, and a short time later left the hotel.

Sebastian PIREZ Fèrnandez, desk clerk and assistant to the oner of the Hotel del Comercio,

had not conversed with OSWALD but remembered him clearly because, few Americans, stay at the

hotel. He said OSWALD left the hotel each morning and did not return until evening, possibly

after PERiZ fernandez had completed his yorking day and left the hotel.

OSWALD was alone

and usually vore & knit, short-sleeved sport abirt and no coat or Jacket. He did not remember

Time discrepancy??

OSWALD and romembers that on the date of the latter's departure from the hotel and on the

basis of sign language and the word "taxi" which he understood that OSWALD wanted a taxicab,

RODRIGUEZ walked around the corner from the hotel where he obtalned a taxicab. He believed

OSWALD left the hötel between 0630 and 0700 since it was getting light when ho went in

search of the taxicab.. He could not be nore precise conceraing the time. He believed

OSWALD gave him a small tip of one or two pesos.

OSWAUD caried his lown luggage downstairs

and walted in front of the hotel with the luggage unt1l RODRIGUEZ returned with the taxicab.

RODrIcuez commented that while he had little difficulty obtaining a taxi at the early hour,

It beoomes vory difficult to secure taxi transportation between 0730 and 0830 because of the

heavy traffid at that time,

RODRIGUEZ related that OSWALD always arrived at the hotel late

without wearing a coat???

at hight, "midnight or thereafter", but he never noticed any indication that OSWALD had been

drinking.

:/ Guillermo GARCIA Luna said of Pedro RODRIGUAZ Ledesma that RODRIGUEZ 18

MENO TO FBI frOM WOFACI An untested source recently furiched us vita tho foli into he

allegedly received fron a veil known Cuban solentlat and aoqualntance on 23 Noy 63, but which

he had forgotton to report.

"the release of the Warren Com Report rominded him of the inel-

dent. / The soientist said he had been at the flavaha alrport on afternoon of 22 Nov, 63 waGn

at 1700 hrs an airoraft with Moxi markings landed and parked at far side of the fleld.

Two men, whom he tooognized as Cuban & "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance

administration blde and disappeared without going through normal customs proceduros.

His

curlosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived fron

Dallas, Texas, vid IlJuana and Mexi City. The plane had been forced to lard at| IIjuana due

to engine troublo

By combining the date, the origin of the flight, and the known reputation

of the two men, ho theorized that tho two men must have beon invblved in essassination..

He speculated that OSwAlD lad acted in the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubans had been

n pallas to organize or oversed the operation. He told the source that he had bech greatly

listrossed by what he had jeen and heard and had to telll someone about it. Hò theh cautione
