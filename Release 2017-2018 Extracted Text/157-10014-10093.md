TESTIMONY OF RICHARD N. BISSELL

Mr. Baron, Mr. Bissell, since we have talked with you

last about the subject of the Congo we have taken testimony

from a number of witnesses.

The first that we would like to

turn to is Bronson Tweedy, who in 1960 and 1961, as I am

sure you will recall, was the Chief of the African Division.

He indicated to us in his testimony that he had a number of

talks with you, probably in the summer or fall of 1960,

where the prospect of assassinating Lumumba war raised.

What can you tell us about those discussiong?

MI. Bissell.

I am afraid I can't tell you anything.

I don't remember the specific discussions with him.

It seeng

to me, however, entirely to be expected that such conversa-

tions took place. I think I testified previously, but in any

case, I remember assigning Justin O'Donnell to study

the possibilities and to make plans for the assassination or

elimination of Lumumba.

And since that wag in the Africa

area, I think 'It most unlikely that I would have done that

without saying something to the Divigion Chief about it.

Mr. Baron. MI. Tweedy's testimony was to the effect

that he was in fact not being informed of some on-going

operation or some instruction that was contemplated, but

rather that you and he were discussing the feasibility of

assassinating Lumumba.

Did such discussions take place?

MI. Bissell, I don't happen to remember them, but

it seems to me entirely probable that they did. And if he

said so I would certainly accept that.

Mi. Baron.

And would you assume that if such dig-

cussions took place they would have taken place in the summer

or fall of 19607

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron.

Would such discussions have involved planning

for an actual asgassination mission?

MI. Bissell. Yes, planning for, but not necessarily

any authorization to take specific steps to implement such

a plan.

Mr.. Baron.

Would planning discusgions in the sense

that you are using the term included sending instruments of

assassination to the Congo?

Mr. Bissell. They might have, although again I

don't happen to remember that.

I am aware, I think, that

there is a record that something was said, but I had no

recollection that things went that far. But that still could

have been included in what I mean by the term "planning and

preparing".

MI. Baron. Did you give MI. Tweedy any specific

instruction as to steps he was 'to take to further a plan

to aggassinate Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I may have. I don't remember them.

only clear recollection I have is of what I think was

the initial discussion on this matter that I had with Justin

O'Donnell. And I belleve that he and I had that alone, in

other words, that MI. Tweedy was not present in the dis

cussion I had with O'Donnell.

Mr, Baron.

We will turn later to filling out the

details of your conversation with Justin O'Donnell.

For the moment, sticking with Mr. Tweedy's testimony,

he also testified that during this same period of time he

composed cables that went to the Chief of Station in Leopold-

ville inquiring at to if. the Chief of Station could gain access

to Lumumba for the purpose of assassinating him.

Did you send such cable?

MI. Bissell.

I would think the record would show

whether they were

gent.

If they were went the record would

presumably also show if I signed them. And I expect that

if they were sent I would have signed them. But I don't

happen at this distance in time to remember the specific

cables.

MI. Wides.

If you had sent cables of that kind,

Mr. Bissell, would they have gone in the normal channels out

from the African Division, or might they more likely have

gone on a restricted basis from yourself to the Station

Chief without --

have been the latter, although given the fact of conversations

with the Division Chief, presumably ha would have been on the

distribution for these cables.

But probably it would have

bean restricted to the Director or the Deputy Director or

the Diviaion Chief, and probably Mr. Helma 'Deputy,

Mr. Baron.

It was Mr. Iweedy's testimony that although

he composed such cables, they went out, as far as he could

recall, under your signature or from your office.

Mr. Bissell. That would be a very normal procedure.

Mr. Baron. Do you recall discussing with Mr. Tweedy

the fact that he should write such cables, whether or not you

recall the specific cables?

Mr. Bissell. I really don't.

Mr. Baron.

Mr. Tweedy also testified that the cable

traffic that he was

sending to the Congo was part of a back and

forth communication in which he was receiving information from

the Chief of Station in Leopoldville about the kind of

access that he could gain to Lumumba.

Did you read such cables from the Chief of station in

Leopoldville?

MI. Bissell. I am sure I did. I don't remember it

specifically.

Mr. Wides. Do you recall the question of access

being one part of the exploration that you were doing?

MI. Bissell. Yes, that indeed would have been a key

part of it.

MI. Wides, Do you recall that being so?

MI. Bissell, I don't specifically recall it. But

since I am clear that at least in the case of O'Donnell, and

I now presume in the case of Mr. Tweedy, I authorized and

indeed directed this planning and preparatory activity. A

major part of this would have been a search for ways in

which access could be gained.

Mr. Baron. And what kind of access were you looking

for at that time?

MI. Bissell. Obviously I would say the access of an

individual who for one reason or another could get close to

Lumumba.

MI. Baron.

In the sunner and very early fall of 1960

this would have been access to Lumumba for the purpose of

assassinating him rather than snatching him from U.N. custody?;

MI. Bissell. Well, it could have been for the pur-

pose really of eliminating him from his thempolitical acti-

vities. And that could have been assassination, or it

could have involved some form of incapacitation, or it could

possibly have been, in your words, snatching him

So

that he could be put into the custody of what we regarded

as friendly authoritles.

Mr. Baron. Would you have sought information from

the Chief of Station on whether he could gain access to

Lumumba for the purpose of poisoning Lumumba.

MI. Bissell. It could very well have. That was one

nethod of elimination, and that was obviously thought about

at the time as part of the planning, and almost certainly

we would have been in touch with the Chief of station to see

If he could gain access for that purpose.

Mr. Baron.

Were you also in touch with the Chief of

Station to seek access for the shooting Lumumba?

Mr. Blasell. I would guess that really the questions

to the Chief of Station would have had to do with gaining access

for whatever method - an access that could be used for

whatever method of eliminating Lunumba might be simple,

practical and

workable. And I doubt if the question would

have been a different one, depending on the device or weapon

to be used.

MI. Baron. Io retrace something you said a moment

ago, it Mr. Iweedy had authored cables seeking information

from the Chief of Station in Leopoldville about gaining

accesg to bumumba, you would have approved

such cables?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, I would most certainly have.

Excuse me. Let me elaborate on that.

Given the procedures and relationships in effect,. I

think Ms. Iweedy, on the basis of an oral authorization from

me, would have had the authority to send such a cable without

my signing off on it. But in a matter of this sensitivity

or the very first days in September, he received a cable from

CIA headguarters to the effect that a mensenger will come

to the congo who you will recognize, and who will bring in

structions which you are to carry out.

Did you send such a cable to the Chief of station?

Mr. Bissell. I could have.

But I have perhaps a peculiar reason for questioning

whether in this particular case I did. And my reason is

the following.

You will notice that the cable you have just shown me

that was sent out by the Director of Central Intelligence

in

late August, the cable was released by his initials.

And

it bears the notification that the only other distribution

was to be to Mr. Helms, who was then, you will remember,

Deputy - my deputy.

Now, it is virtually inconceivable to me, given my

knowledge of and involvement in this operation, that the

Director would have sent

a cable, denied circulation to me

and had it circulated to Mr. Helms, if I had been in

Washington. And I suspect that we could

establish on the

record that I was on vacation when the message you have

shown

me was sent.

Mr. Wides. That was in early August?

Mr. Baron. Let's introduce as Exhibit No. l for

this session the document that you are referring to, which

is a cable dated August 26, 1960, from Allen W. Dulles to

Leopoldville. And this cable includes the paragraph:

"In high quarters here it is the clear-cut conclusion

that 1f ILI, continues to hold high office inevitable result

will at best be chaos and at worst pave the way for Communist

takeover of the Congo with disastrous consequences for the

prestige of the U.N. and for the interest of the free world

should be a high priority of our covert action!"

Mr. Baron. MI. Bissell, Would ILL refer to Lumumba

In this cable?

MI. Bissell. I believe so.

MI. Baron.

And isn't it unusual thae this cable

bears the designation Allen W. Dulles as opposed to Director?

Mr. Bissell. That 1a unusual.

Mi. Baron. What does

that signify?

Mr. Blasell. I believe this cable was drafted by the

Director himself. That would be my inference from the format.

MI. Baron. And does this appear to be Mr. Dulles' initials

which are blurred in the copy we have?

Mr. Bissell. They may be there, but in any event, the

releasing signiature is definitely his.

If I may complete the answer to your question, for the

reason I have given you, my surmise is that I was

not

In Washington, and probably on vacation, when this was

sent. I suspect that I might be able to dig out calendars

and establish that if it became very germane.

If that is the case, it is quite possible that the

cable you asked me about stating that a messenger would

soon arrive in Leopoldville was

sent also in my absence.

MI. Baron. If such a cable was sent in your absence

would you be apprised of it upon your return to headquarters?

MI. Bissell. I suspect so, yes. In this case I would

be almost certain that I would.

Explicitly it refera, as you quoted, or characterized it, to

Mr. Baron. And who was that messenger to be?

MI. Bissell. I have no idea without digging back into tha

traffic.

Mr. Baron. And were those instructions related to

the assassination of Lumumba?

MI. Bissell. It certainly sounds as lf they were

related to his elimination in one way or another.

Mr. Wides. Why is that, Mr. Biggell?

Mr. Bissell, Just because the method of transmission

is peculiar, and suggests.high sensitivity. But it seens

to me, on the basis of what you hue told me of the message,

it can be only inference.

MI. Baron. And one means of eliminating Lumumba con-

templated at CIA headguarters at this time would have been

an assassination?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

MI. Baron. In the testimony of the Chief of Station

who was in Leopoldville at that time, he made the representa-

tion -- let me back track for a moment.

not say that. Assuming that he had assumed the position

possible weapons or other means to use. When

with the Technical Services Division, the person who had

been a member of it.

Did you have any óther kinds of discussiona

with

about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. BiBBell.

None that I remember.

Mr. Baron, Did you discuss with

your

conversationg with Justin O'Donnell?

Mr. Blasell.

I just have no recollection of that.

Mr. Baron. Did

come to you and report to

you on his conversations with Justin O'Donnell about the

assasgination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell.

Again, I an sorry, I just have no

recollection one way or the other.

Mr. Baron. Did

make you aware that he had

in his shop, or he knew how to obtain the means to assassin-

ate Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Well, I certainly was aware in a general

way that various

Services Division, I don't know whether I obtained that

information specifically from.

but probably I

did obtain some of it through him.

MI. Baron.

But however you obtained this information,

you were aware that the means were available to assassinate

Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. I think you put it too specifically.

I was aware that as part of it is on-going activity. The

Technical Services Division did a lot of work in the develop-

September he received a visit from

would these trips be involved with

highly sensitive operations as distinct from scientific

evaluation?

MI. Bissell. I belleve that for the most part they

would not have been involved with highly sensitive specific

operations, but rather would have involved consultation with

people in the field on the effectiveness of devices, tech-

niques, procedures, underdevelopment in the Technical

Services Division.

Mr. Wides. And given the unusual of hia going to the

Congo if he did in connection with clandestine operations

there, you would have no recollection of that today?

MI. Bissell. I don't have any recollection of that

today, no. This is the first time I realized, since many

years ago, that he had made such a trip.

Mr. Baron. Would he also have been aware that he

had made such a trip?

Mr. Bissell. Well, the Chief of Station obviously,

Bronson Iweedy, obviously. Quite probably the Director,

but not certainly, And several others.: I assume that Mr.

MI. Biesell. I belleve so, speclally in the light

of the fact that apparently this possibility had been dis

cussed with Bronson Tweedy more than once.

MI, Baron.

Is it possible that Bronson Tweedy would

have been cut out of the actual mounting of an assassination

operation despite the fact that the feasibility of an

assassination had been discussed with him?

MI. Bissell, Yes, it is possible.

Mr. Baron.

Was that the case?

guess, I think I would - I think my guessing would come down

slightly on the side of his having been cut out rather than

knowledgeable.

Mr. Baron. Why would that be?

Mr. Bissell. Well, I repeat, I am guessing about this,

and the reasoning that leads me to make that remark 1s that

my recollection is that my assignment to O'Donnell was very

narrowly held. And I do not remember discussing that assign-

ment with Bronson Tweedy, And so I think there is a real

possibility -- and 1t is a guess, trying as best I can to recon-

struct what was going on at the time, but not based on any

recollection of actual discussions -- but my guess, as I say,

would come down very slightly on the side that O'Donnell's

assignment was not known

to Bronston Tweedy, and that he, there-

fore, was cut out of this phase.

MI. Baron.

And would have been cut out of knowledge

of

visit to the Congo?

Mr. Bissell. Could have been, although that is

more unlikely. It seems to me that if he was being cut out

of knowledge of the specific operation, that he would have

had to be knowledgeable of the visit, and would have been

given an explanation of the visit other than the postulated

true explanation.

Mr. Baron. In the light of that, Mr.Bissell, is it

likely that the cable traffic that MI. Tweedy describes going

in the Congo concerning galning acceas to Lumumba could have

unbeknownst to him related to gaining acceas to Lumumba for

the purpose of an assassination plot that was further along

the line than MI. Tweedy knew?

Mr. Bissell. It could have. I would put it another

way. It seems to me that the information gleaned in that

Interchange was probably an

input to the planning - the prep

atory activity that identify with O'Donnell.

Mr. Baron.

To repeat for a moment,

visit to the congo would have been known to

the Chief of Sta-

tion, yourself and Director of Central Intelligence, and

possibly Bronson Tweedy?

Mr. Bissell.

I think probably Bronson Tweedy, and

almost certainly a few other people.

I repeat, I think

would have known of it. I think Richard

Helms would have knwon of it, and I think several others.

I am making a distinction between those who would have known

of the visit, an event that would not be easy to keep secret

from a number of people in the Agency, and knowledge of the

true purpose of that visit, if indeed its true purpose were,

I bellove I::did not wich Mr. Helma.

Mr. BaIon.

You paused for a moment there. Has there

some discussion that you were thinking about that could have

related to Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

I think what came into my mind was a later and

subgequent conversation with Mr. Helms sometime after.

And this had to do with O'Donnell, and I seem to remember

Mr. Helms making a remark that he was a somewhat -- on

occasion a somewhat unsable person. And at that point the sub

ject may have come up with Mr. Helms.

But my impression is

that any such conversation with Mr. Helms was a good deal

later.

Mr. Wides. Mr. O'Donnell indicated that after he spoke

to you and told you that he would not participate in the

assassination effort, that he went essentially nextdoor to

your office, to MI. Helms' office, and recounted his dis-

cussion with you to Mr. Helms.

Do you recall any discussion about that time that

Helms might have come back to you to find out about?

MI. Bissell.

Let me explain, the dim recollection

that I have just voiced of a conversation with Helms after

the termination of O'Donnell's assignment, and Helms comment

on it. But I still belleve that MI.Helms did not know of

this until after what I would refer to as the termination of

O'Donnell's involvement, which was the occasion you have just

Mr. Wides. It wag.not described by Ms. O'Donnell as

the termination of an assignment.

MI. Blasell. All right, that is my phrase, but as I

have already testified, my recollection - and it is recollec-

tion -- 1s that MI. O'Donnell came in to me -= I thought it

was a matter probably of at least several weeks, but I

could be wrong on the timing - after I had originally

given him the assignment, and expressed both his personal

reluctance to attempt to carry it out, and his bellef that

it was the wrong way to proceed.

Whether he so stated

to Mi.

O'Donnell, It certainly was my decision at that time that it

be dropped. And to the best of my knowledge and bellef,

no further action was taken.

MI. Schwarz. By "it" in that example do you mean the

assassination of Lumumba, or l'Donnell's involvement in the

assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Dissell.

At any rate, D'Donnell's involvement,

the project that he had been asked to plan

and prepare for,

that that would not be continued.

MI. Baron. And that was the assassination of Lumumba?

MI. Bissell.

Yes.

MI. Schwarz. You mean one officer comes in and gives

you a negative, and then you decided to turn off something

that you had been looking into for weeks because one

officer says he wouldn't do 1t?

MI. Biasell. To turn it off, or at least if it be

continued, to change not only the people connected with it, but

probably the whole modus operandi. And the reason for that

decision, insofar as I can recollect it, 18, my grave concern

that, given O'Donnell's reaction, there was a risk that the

planning of such an operation would be blown.

Mr. Schwarz. You mean if it was done he would expose

the conversation?

MI. Bissell. Something of that kind could happen,

yes.

Mr. Dawson. Who were you worried about O'Donnell in

that case exposing it to? Certainly not the press.

MI. Bissell. I can't recally answer that, except by

surmise, but I do remember that this had been in my mind

a very sensitive

assignment to him, limited -- with the

knowledge of it to be limited very narrowly even within the

Agency. And it is difficult to separate recollection from

Inference on occasion. But I seem

to recollect

that after

this conversation with him I wanted this pus very much on

the back burner

and inactivated for quite some time.

Now, that doesn't rule out the possibility that some

action through completely different channels might have gone

forward. But the best of my recollection is, I viewed this

not only as terminating the assignment for him, but also

Mr. Schwarz, Who had knowledge within the Agency of your

assignment to O'Donnell and its true purpose.

Mr. Bissell.

I would guess that -

Mr. Schwarz. Not guess, who did?

Mr. Bissell: I don't know. What I was going to say is

that I think the Director did.

Mr. Schwart.

Guess, think, don't know. You have got to

have a basis, MI. Dissell, for testifying to

something.

MI. Bissell. All right.

The basis is, as has been in so much of my testimony,

how business was conducted within the Agency at that time.

There had been, as the

Exhibit I cable suggests, there had

already been consideration at high levels in the Agency and

elsewhere of the elimination of Lumumba: Obviously I had

been involved in conversationg with the Director on that sub-

ject. Given the way business was conducted, I would infer that

I would have told the Director of my assignment to O'Donnell.

Mr. diGenova. Mi. Bissell, you are telling us that

you don't remember this, is that correct?

MI. Bissell. That 1s right.

"In high quarters here it is the clearcut conclusion

that if LLl continues to hold high office inevitable result

And then it goes on and says:

"Consequently we conclude that his removal must be an

urgent prime objective and that under existing conditions

this could be a high priority covert action".

That is dated August 26, 1960, signed, according to your

identification of his signature, by Mr. Dulles personally.

And it follows by one day a meeting in the White louse of the

Special Group attended by the President of the U.S., where

Dulles said he would proceed -

MI. Baron. I don't think this meeting was attended by

the President.

Mr. diGenova.

Excuse me, attended by Mr. Dulles -

where he said he would proceed as vigorously as the situation

permitted. And it was agreed that the planning for the

Congo would not necessarily rule out consideration of any

particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting

rid of Lumumba.

Does that in any way refresh your recollection about

what was happening at that time?

Do you remember anything independently of what Mr.

Dulles was talking to you about? we had trouble areas in the

world, including Cuba, and the African Continent

Mr. Bissell.

Well, my recollection, I think, ia

pretty clear about the atmosphere at the time. And I think

It lo quite eloquently described in the cable which you

have just quoted. And I have already said that I think

probably, from the evidence of the format of that document,

I was absent from Washington at the time when it was

sent.

But I certainly would have seen that when I returned, and

It certainly would have been the subject of conversation

between Dulles and myself. It is for that reason that I

draw the inference

that Justin O'Donnell's agsignment would

have been reported by me to Allen Dulles.

Mr. diGenova.

But you personally don't remember

discussing this with Mr. Dulles?

MI. Bissell. No.

Mr. diGenova. You conclude now that you must have be-

cause of the physical evidence?

Mr. Bissell. Could I just

interrupt for a moment to

say, I used to see MI. Dulles almost daily during these years.

It was rare that we would meet without touching on perhaps

severt on-going operations ot

plans or prospects. And this,

over

a period of séveral years. It is not, I think surpris-

ing that rarely have I been able in the course of my testi-

mony to say, I specifically remember a particular meeting, and

Mr. diGenova.

Mr. Bissell, that ia somewhat Important,

obviously, because the idea is to try, if possible, to estab-

ligh what the precise facts were.

Now, I am sure you don't mean to say that the assassina-

tion of a foreign leader blurs into the everyday activity of

the Agency because it was so commonplace - or is that what

you mean to say?

Mr. Bissell. No, I don't. But I do mean to say

that, the Agency had put a top priority, probably, on a range

of different methods of getting rid of Lumumba in the sense

of either destroying him physically, incapacitating

him, or

eliminating his political influence. And a conversation

about this particular facet of what was a many-sided attack

on

the problem doesn't stand out in my mind.

Mr. diGenova. What you are saying, then, is the de-

tails of any specific day or meeting or cable you don't

recollect, but you don't have any trouble recollecting the

fact that the assassination of Lumumba, among others,

was part of a strategy at that time, if needed?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

Mr. Baron. And that was part of a strategy at the

level of the National Security Council as well as within the

Mr. Schwarz. Did you attend any meeting of the National

MI. Bissell. I don't remember any on this subject,

and I don't think I did.

I very rarely attended the NSC

as such, or its so-called planning committee. Robert Amory

was the agency representative on that, and I have already

said -- well, I did not by any means always, I would say not

more than half the time, attended Special Group meetings.

And since I also think I las out of town when that was

sent, it seems to me highly unlikely that I was at the Special

Group mecting the day before that cable was

sent.

MI. Baron. I think we should introduce for the record

as Exhibit 2 the memorandum for the record of that

Special Group meeting of August 25, 1960, which

records Mr.

Dulles being present, and does not list yourself as one of

the participants.

And it contains a paragraph substantially

as MI, diGenova related it where Gordon Gray, who was

at

that time Special Assistant to the President for National

Security Affairs, commented that his associates . and we have

testimony by Thomas Parrott, the Secretary who took these

minutes, that Mr. Gray's associate was a euphemism to refer to

the President.

marked Bissell Exhibit No. 2 for

basis of the documente.

Mr. Baron.

Do you assume that assassination was one

of the means of removing Lumumba from the scene that is

contemplated within the language of Mr. Dulles' cable?

Mr. Bissell. Correct - and also the language reported

in the minutes of the Special Group.

Mr. Baron. And that would be in essence language--

Mr. Blasell. Could I just interrupt to say in

elaboration of that point, you may remember that I perhaps un-

fortunately used the word "circumlocutioug" in earlier testimody

to describe the way this kind of topic was discussed. This

1s a prime example of it. When you use the language that

no particular means were ruled out, that is obviously what it

meant, and it meant that to everybody in the room.

Mr. Wides, Meant what?

Mr. Bissell. Meant that if it had to be assassination,

that that was a permissible means.

Mr. Baron.

And that this was permissible in the eyes

of the President, whose sentiments -- who was being repre-

sented at the meeting by Gordon Gray?

Mr. Bissell. At least permissible by his representativer

sitting in the room.

You don't use language of that kind

except to mean in effect, the Director is being told, get

rid of the guy, and if you have to use extreme neans up

to and including agsassination, go ahead.

Eisenhower wanted Lumumba killed?

was this a thing that was clearly under-

stood here by everyone? What was that in your experince with

the Agency that had prepared you to understand this kind of

coded dialogue, if you will?

Was assassination

something

that was discussed fairly often?

Mr. Bissell. No, I would say really very infrequently,

very infrequently even

discussed, let alone attempted.

But I submit that the language just quoted from the minutes

of the Special Group was not language internal to the Agency,

it was language from a Cabinet level committee.

You may remember another document that was offered earlier

in my testimony which was again minutes of a Special Group

meeting, and it quoted Livingston Merchant, the State Depart-

ment representative, again asking if there was no way to get

rid of the Castro leadership in that case. I am sure you

remember that document.

Now, when senior political officers meet in a Cabinet

Committee, especially when some kind of a record is being

kept, thay do talk around a subject of that kind.

But it

doesn't mean that it in obscure or not understood by anyone

there. I belleve in both of these caecg it is perfectly

clear - in the first Livingston Merchant case it is clear that

he was raising a question at to whether physically getting

rid of these people was possible, and in the second case, the

one just quoted here, it seems to me

that -- if you like to

call it that -- the

consensus of the Special Group was that

"no means should be excluded in the effort to get rid of

Lumumba".

And that, I repeat, is not CIA language.

If it is

gobbledegook it is on a good high level.

Mr. Dawson.

Is Mr, Gray in this cable or memorandum

for the Special Group on August 25, 1960, conveying the feeling

of his associate, which we have identified clearly as

President Eisenhower?

Mr. Baron. Moving back now to the testimony of the

Chief of Station who was in Leopoldville in 1960, he said

that shortly after he received this cable that a messenger

would come whom he would recognize

and who would give him

instructions to carry out.

He received a visit from Mr.

And we have discussed that visit. He then goes

on to testily that

gave to him, or told him that

he would very shortly thereafter recelve, some lethal biologi-

cal substances, and the tools for administering those sub-

stances, namely, a syringe, gauze maska, and rubber gloves.

Were such lethal biological substances sent down to the

Congo?

Mr. Bissell. I don't know.

I assume the record shows

one way or the other. I don't have a recollection of that.

I was really rather surprised on the occasion of

the earlier testimony to have it reported that they had been

sent.

Mr. Baron.

would you assume now, hearing this testimony,

that indeed such subatances were sent to the Congo?

MI. Bissell. I think what you have told me, repeating

the evidence of the Station Chief, that

told

him to expect that, is that correct?

Mr. Wides.

The testimony is that the materials were

brought by

or essentially arrived while he was

there, and that he went over their use with the Station Chief.

That doesn't refresh your recollection at all with regard --

Mr. Bissell. No, it doesn't. But I am sure if the

Station Chief so testified it is correct, there is nothing

in mind that I remember that would be in conflict with that.

at that point for the AGency to have proceeded to the point

Mr. Bissell.

No, it would not.

MI. Wides. You draw a distinction before between what

you called the planning stage and the implementing stage. I

take it it was not common to send lethal means by the use of

such a highly unusual messenger to a foreign country and

turn them over to a Station Chief as distinct from experi-

menting in the laboratory

in Washington?

Mr. Bissell.

The phrase I used, or tried to use,

most of the time was the phrase of planning and preparation

versus the phrase

of implementation.

MI. Wides.

By implementation do you mean simply the

actual commencement of -

MI. Biggell.

Of an active assassination, yes.

kill Lumumba?

presumably so that if and when an individual with suitable

access and other appropriate circumstances materialized and

authorization was given, if it was still required, the

operation could proceed.

Ma. Baron.

Let me see if I can refresh your recollec-

tion on that one point, whether authorization had been given.

The Chief of Station testified that when

gave him poison or

instructions in the use of poison, he

also made it very clear that these were for the purpose of

assassinating Lumumba, and that he should proceed to carry

out the assaggination of Lumumba if it were possible, that thei

use of poison was not a sine qua non to the assassination,

if he could find another way to do 1t, that would be fine,

but that it was clear that he was to proceed with an

assassin-

ation operation if he could find a way to do it successfully.

Mr. Bissell. Accepting that testimony, then, the

authorization was given.

Mr. Schwaiz. But we are dealing with your testimony,

Ms. Bissell. WE have his testimony, and your comments on his

testimony doesn't add much to the record.

Mr. Bissell. I am afraid, as far as recollection is

concerned, that my mind is a blank on that subject. I know

the Committee doesn't find inference particularly helpful,

but I would strongly infer in this case that such an author-

ization did pass through me, as it were, if

source would it have passed?

MI. Dissell.

From the Director. As I would recon

ing and the cable in late August, made it clear that this was

to go forward -- to me that this was to go forward if and

when feasible circumstances permitted it, and it was on that

basis.that I would have authorized

to deliver by

word of mouth such instructions from the Station Chief.

That 15 a highly unusual procedure, even in a sensitive

matter of this sort.

MI. Schwarz.

What 1s unusual about it?

MI. Bissell. That the authorization should have been

by word of mouth rather than by cable. I don't mean a cable

The Chief of Station, to be fair to his

testimony, indicated that he was greatly surprised when he

received such instructions, and he was doubtful about the

practicality of pulling off such an operation, at the

least he was convinced it would be difficult.

If, It la any help for me to say, this

sounds highly likely as an account if it is established, as

evidence seems to have established, that

brought

such instructions, I would expect the Station to seek con-

firmation. And I would expect, given the background, that

that confirmation would have been forthcoming. And I would

also be almost certain that I would have

signed off on such

a cable, or signed such a cable, initialled it, even if it

about the assassination of Lumumba?

Mr. Bissell.

Yes,

Mr. Baron.

So at that point an assassination mission

had in effect been mounted in the Congo?

Mr. Bissell. Right.

did you send a cable to Leopoldville to stand down the

assassination mission?

on the source of the authorization, and said -

something to the effect, who authorized this mission.

The answer was, it came from the top, or something to

was, something to

I will read you from Mr. Hedgman's testi-

of Station in the Congo at that point, testifying under the

alias of Hedgman, the Chief of Station said:

"In essence I must have -- and again I am guessing

as to what my wording was -- must have pointed out that this

was not a common or usual Agency tactic, and I may have

probably said that I had never heard of it being done -- which

I had not, never in my

training or previous work in the

Agency had I ever heard any reference to such, in my recollec-

tion at least, such

methods.

And it is my recollection, I

asked

on whose authority these instructions were issued.

"Mr. Wides.

And what did

Ieply?

"Mr. Hedgman. It is my recollection that he identified

dent' or 'President Eisenhower'?

whether he said the President of whether he said President

But it was one of those two, ia your

best recollection?

Further down the page MI. Hedgman continues:

"I have tried to go back in my mind on that, and I

think, I believe -- but

again now this one is pretty loose in

my mind - it was something to the effect that the President

had instructed the Director".

And then on page 33 MI. Dawson gays:

"You are not the least unclear whether or not you

came away with a very clear impression that the President's

name had been invoked in some fashion?

"Mr. lledgman.

Yes, I came - certainly that is my

Is there any doubt that you would have undertaken -

I think it is probably unlikely that Allen Dulles would have

I think he would have said, this is authorized in the highest

what you regarded as the planning stage, this meaning if 1t

occurred,

taking the poison to the Congo, that

you would

not have taken that step without the approval of

the Director, was that your testimony?

Mr. Bissell.

What I will: now say at any rate is that

the mere act of taking the kit to the Congo I would classify

as still in the planning stage. But if it be taken as es-

tablished that

_took specific instructiong "to

implement", I would say that we had then passed into an im-

plementation phase.

MI. Wides.

Let me read to you from your testimony

on

June ll, and then ask you a question based on that.

On page 54 Mr. Schwarz said:

"Who authorized you to tell Mr. O'Donnell to take steps

to move toward assassinating

Mr. Lumumba?"

And you said: "No one".

And then Mr. Schwarz:

"Did you inform the White House of that?"

"No. "

"To the best of your knowledge did anybody inform the

White House of that?"

"Mr.. Bissell.

To the best of my knowledge, no.

"Mr. Schwarz. Why did you seek to assassinate Mr.

Lum mba?

"Mi. Bissell.

I didn't seek to assassinate him. I

and develop the capability so to do if it were approved and

ordered."

Now, in regard to your answer that no one had told you

to tell Mr. O'Donnell to take steps to move

toward assagginat-

ing Mr. Lunumba, I take It that reading that now in the

context of other information we have, that answer was not

intended to mean that - page 54 - you were not then testi-

fying affirmatively that no one had spoken to you at a higher

level about trying to assassinate Lumumba, but merely in

regard to your discussion with O'Donnell, which you did recall?

MI. Bissell.

My recollection - and this I will des-

cribe as a recollection, it may be faulty -- is that it was

my own idea to give O'Donnell this assignment.

He had, I

believe, recently completed

some other, or there was a change

of position of some kind, and he was available. And given

the background which has here been established this afternoon,

I believe it was my notion to give him this assignment

in

parallel to any other things that were still going forward.

It would have been. unusual to have advised anybody

outside the Agency of a specific assignment to an individual

of that sort.

Mr. Wides.

And the implication of the lack of authori

zation from above yourself, or discussion with anyone above

yourself, was confined simply to the giving of the asignment

to Mr. O'Donnell?

MI. Bissell. That is correct.

And 1t 1s my recollection, as I have testified in

part earlier this afternoon, that when O'Donnell came later

and declined the assignment and expressed the view that this

was not the way to solve the problem, that I shut off the

O'Donnell operation completely.

MI. Wides, Let me go back to that if I can. Mr.

O'Donnell's testimony, which I believe we went over with you

when you testified, we might ask you to see now if you have

any different recollection.

In essence it is the following:

that you called

him in and asked him to go to the Congo for the purposes

of trying to see if Lumumba could be assassinated, that

very evening you asked him, right at that moment, and it was

toward the end of the day, as he recalled it, you asked him

to

see

that he expressed

reservation about

assassination, but did go down to see

And

discussed with him several lethal means, and he

immediately came back to your office and

said, I won't

do it, and raised legal questions, moral questions --

MI. Dawson. I don't think he testified that he imme-

diately came back.

Mr. Schwarz. The same day.

This 1s Mr. O'Donnell's testimony.

MI. O'Donnell further testified that he told you he

would be willing to go to the congo to explore the possibility

of neutralizing him in other ways, and that shortly thereafter

in the space of a few days went to the Congo. And I believe

the record suggests that he was there from October through

December, and that while he was looking into the possibility

of trying to get Lumumba out of the property away from effect-

ive custody of the U.N. with the thought that if the

Central Congolese Government obtain control of him, they might

try him for capital crimes, and this might result in his

physical removal.

And this was mooted by Lumumba's escape and

recapture and death, and he then came back:

Is it still your recollection that there was a period

of several weeks between the time you broached the subject

of an assassination and

the time that Mr. O'Donnell

expressed his opposition to it?

Mr. Bigsell. I shouldn't be firm on the several weeks.

But my recollection of the course of events differs in, I

think, only one -- or is inconsistent with his recollection

as you reported it in only the one respect, that the impres-

sion I carried away was that at a minimum some days -- and

I had thought a period of

ar

least a week elapsed between

my giving him the assignnent and his coming back to decline

What

you further quote from his testimony I had not remembered, but

it does now seem to me that I do remember -- part of my

original recollection was that when he came back to me I have

several times used the phrase, this was not the way to deal

with the problem of Lumumba.

And that is wholly consistent

with his having proposed other means of neutralizing Lumumba

short of using physical violence on him directly. I do seem

to recollect that.

And although I had not remembered it, I do now seem to

recollect that he went out there and with the assignment,

most of it in his recollection rather than mine, of looking

at other ways of neutralizing Lumumba.

But my recollection

simply differs from his on the matters of the timing and how

soon he came

back.

MI. Wides. Do you recall when you proposed to Mr.

Harvey, in what I think we concluded was most probably very

early 1961, that he explore executive action capability,

and that two people who had been cut in in some way on carlier

considerations or explorations of assassination, and tho

people whom therefore he might discuss this with, were Mr.

Mr. Bissell.

that. But especially with respect. to

Well, I amisorry to have to retreat

yes.

in the Congo and was sent there by Aruela Silver who had

Mr. Bissell.

Well, there was an agent

who was used againgt the humumba faction in the

55

Congo.

. Now, the agent I have in mind, he was extremely success-

ful.

This agent was ob-

viously engaged in an extremely hazardous business, because

If his cover had been blown he certainly would have been,

I think, killed.

Now, this may be the agent in question.

I do not

remember that agent ever being put under O'Donnell's contiol.

But if

O'Donnell was given the assignment to find ways of

neutralizing Lumumba, given that assignment to O'Donnell

when he went out there, it is very possible that this

agent would have been put in touch with him.

Mr. Schwarz.

why did you pick O'Donnell, incidentally,

for the initial assignment, the part that was killing him,

as opposed to other methods of neutralizing him?

Mr. Bissell. My recollection is that I regarded him

as highly competent in the craft, I think correctly. I

regarded him, I think incorrectly as the

events

turned out,

as a very tough guy

in the sense this guy Harvey had, that

such reputation, and I think with hindsight deserved it.

where he continued in the same kind of

But he had a much closer connection with espionage

operations and counter espionage in the field. When I brought

him back his mission

was to find ways and means - to concentrate on technical ways

special attention to the interconnections between

the

technical people in TSD and the operators in the rest of the

requirements that TSD was striving to meet were appropriate,

in other words, did they really know what the operators needed:

TSD had available. It was that kind of a thing.

given the way my mind works, I probably did think I had

authority.

But it is also very unlikely.

There

are two parts of your answer which

were at war with each other. On the one hand you say, based

upon having seen

some Special Group minutes and a cable,

both of which say in effect that killing should not be ruled

out as a matter of consideration -

Mr. Blasell. Right.

Mr. Schwarz. May I see that?

After talking about extremely strong feelings, straight-

forward action, and Dulles commenting on taking this ser-

lously, proceeding vigorously, the agreement 1s:

"It was finally agreed that planning for the Congo

would not necessarily rule out 'consideration' of any

particular kind of activity which might contribute to

getting rid of lumumba".

Now, the first point, you read that to mean not

-uling out killing?

Mr. Bissell. Correct,

Mr. Schwarz. Now, was it just your testimony that

you believe that the agreement that planning for the Congo

would not necessarily rule out possible consideration of

drafted by Allen Dulles that he regarded the action of the

Special Group as authorizing implementation if favorable

circumstances presented themalves, if it could be done

covertly.

He speaks of targets of opportunity. He authorized,

as I remember the words of the cable "even more aggressive

action".

• And the tone of the cable clearly gives the Station

Chief a lot of latitude and conveys a sense of very great

urgency.

Mr. Schwarz. And whether of not that is a proper con-

struction of the Special Group is not really something we need

to discuss.

Finish the Congo, then.

Mr. Baron. I have one more question on

visist. And that is, in the light of the entire atmosphere

at the Agency and the policy at the Agency at that time,

representation to the Chief of Station that

the President had instructed the DCI to carry out this

mission would not have been beyond the pale of

authority at that point?

Mr. Bissell. No, it would not.

Ms . Baron.

For the sake of the record,. let's intro-

duce as an exhibit the memo that I referred to earlier as

November 1960. And I will ask you one question

about it.

This is a memo going from the Chief of KUTUBE/D.

Mr. Baron. This is a cable that we reviewed, Mr.

Biseell, before we began your testimony today. And I will

turn your attention to the paragraph that says:

"It is still difficult to determine whether Mobutu

had sufficient control army to enforce decisions announced

night 14 September. Station advised" -

And then there is a sanitized paragraph -

"Station advised two moderate Congolese politicians

'try work with key Congolese contact' in effort eliminate.

Lumumba. Fear UN protection will give Lumumba opportunity

organization counterattack.

Only solution is remove him

from

scene soonest".

Now, the night of september 14 was the night of a coup

in the congo where Mobutu took power, is that correct?

Mr. Bissell.

Correct.

Mr. Baron. And does this cable refresh your recollec-

tion as to the attitude at the Agency toward Lumumba even

after he was in U.N. custody?

MI. Bissell. Yes. It seems to say rather clearly

that it was still desirable to eliminate him.

Mr. Baron. WAs it still your recollection, then, that

there was a continued

sense of urgency about eliminating

Lumumba after he was in U.N. custody?

Mr. Bissell.

Yes.

Mr. Baron. And this would account in part for the fact

Mr. Baron, You are. not listed as a participant iat the

meeting, although Mr. Dulles la present, and the following

paragraph relates a remark of Me. Dulles:

"Nobutu appeared to be the effective power in the

congo for the moment, but Lumumba was not yet disposed of

and remained a grave danger as long as he was not disposed of"

Does that accord with your understanding of the policy

of the National Security Council toward Lumumba even after

he was in U.N. custody?

Mr. Bissell. It does.

Mr. Baron. And the language "disposed of" would contem-

plate assassination at least as one means of disposing of

him?

Mr. Bissell. As one means, as one possible means, if

necessary.

MI. Baron. I have one further exhibit which

we

will mark Exhibit 6, that is, a cable dated December 17, 1960

sent to the Director from Leopoldville.

MI. Baron. And this cable deals with an incident where

an asset of the Chief of Station who was. knownby the cryptonym

HIROGUE made an approach to agent QJWIN. And the cable says:

"QJWIN, who resides same hotel as WIROGUE, reported that

he had lived Alaska, Japan, South America, Germany and other

paits Europe. QJWIN said, WIROGUE smells as though he in

intel business. Station denies any info on WIROGUE. 14

December QJWIN reported WIROGUE had offered him $300 per

month to participate in intel net and be member execution

squad. When QJWIN said he not interested, WIROGUE added

there would be bonuses for special jobs.

Under OJWIN

questioning, WIROGUE later said he worked for P:B. PRIME

Service".

Do you recall this incident?

Mr. Bissell.

I don't, no.

MI. Baron. Does P.B. Prime Service refer to the

American Intelligence Service?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, it does.

Mr, Baron,

Namely, the CIA?

Mr Bissell. Yes.

MI. Baron.

Do you recall anything about the formation

of an execution squad in the congo during this period?

Mr. Bissell. I take that to be a phrase used by an

agent.

Mr. Baron. And this is a cable sent from headquarters

to the Havana Station dated July 21, 1960.

The first

sentence of the cable reada:

"Possible removal top three leaders is receiving

serious consideration at headquarters".

The cable is signed by

by direction Tracy

Barnes for DDP, and about

by direction J.C. King,

Chief, Western Hemisphere Division as authenticating officer.

Relseasing officer was Tracy Barnes.

Do you have any independent recollection of that, cable

and what surrounded itsissuance at headquarters?

Mr. Bissell. I don't remember it until you mentioned it

to me in the telephone conversation to which you have alluded.

Mr. diGenova.

Having had some time to think about it

since we spoke on August 6, does it ring any bell at this

juncture?

Mr. Bissell. It does not, I am afraid.

MI. diGenova.

It is apparent that this cable was

sent out at a time when

you were

having conversations in the

summer or the fall of 1960 with Mr. Iweedy and Mr. O'Donnell

concerning MI. Lumumba, is that correct?

Mr. Bissell.

Correct.

Mr. diGenova. Did Me. Dulles at any time during this

period or prior to it or subsequent to it ever issue a directive

assigning assassination as an agency

action?

stated that the possible renoval of the top three

leaders in

Cuba was receiving serious consideration at headquarters?

Mr. Bissell. I don't have knowledge of that, no.

You yourself quoted internal evidence from the cable and!

the one that was sent, a followup the following day, suggesting

that he may have ordered it countermanded.

Mr. diGenova.

The duty officer at that particular time,

that evening, indicated that he had sent this cable, and that

he had been instructed, as he recalled it by MI. Barnes, to

send this cable, and that the wording came from Mr. Barnes.

Now, the duty officer also said that the next day when

he came in there was a cable, which we have, and we

will mark that

as Exhibit No. 8, which in toto said:

"Do not pursue reference, would like to drop

matter."

And that was signed singly by Tracy Barnes.

Mr. diGenova. Now; the duty officer who had issued the

knowledge, but he had heard that Mr. Dulles had countermanded

the original cable, talking about the possible removal,

and authorizing the approach': to the asset, the Cuban pilot,

who actually attempted the crash of the plane which would

carry Raol Castro from Prague to Havana.

Do you have any personal knowledge as to why Mr. Dulles

would have countermanded, assuming

that he did?

Mr. Bissell. I don't have any recollection. I could

surmise lots of things.

Mr. diGenova.

What I want to ask you is this: do

you have an independent recollection that any assassination

efforts against the Cuban leaders which were being considered

contmmplated simultaneous action against

all three, other

wise it would be useless action?

Mr. Bissell. The only evidence I know of, hard evidence;

is the Special Group minute to which I referred earlier,

which was an exhibit in earlier testimony.

Mr. diGenova. You are referring to the Merchant cable

exchange of November 3, 1960?

Mr. Bissell. That is correct.

MI. diGenova.

Now, MI.

know -- for example, Mr. Dulles cable to the Congo personally

authorizing, apparently, the assassination of MI. Lumumba,

and

to do it - is it inconsistent to your way of

thinking that he would have authorized that

assassination and

would have rescinded this cable that would have apparently

authorized the assassination of Ragi Castro.

Mr. Bissell. Not Inconsistent at all. I think it may

well have embodied a judgment on Mr. Dulles part that this

effort concerning Ragf Castro was altogether too risky, and

technically not sufficiently likely of success.

MI. diGenova. During our initial telephone conversa-

tion on August 6 you speculated, and you clearly identified it

as mere speculation, that one of the reasons that Mi. Dulles,

assuming he did, ordered that

initial cable countermanded was,

first, too many innocent persons on the plane would have

been killed, and second, that it was so risky because there

had been just an initial approach of the asset and

it wasn't

known whether or not he was a double agent, and thirdly, it

appeared that the contemplation of all three, the assassina-

tion of all three was being considered, and, therefore, since

only Raol would be on this plane that it would have resulted

in the dilemma that they sought

to avoid, that is, if

he had been killed there would

have been two left over, and

there may have been a reason that he ordered the countermand.

Would you take by that as a form of speculation at this

point as one of the reasong that he would have countermanded

that cable?

Mr. Bissell. I would.

Mr. Schwarz. Could I follow up on the Congo, Exhibit

2, the Dulles cable

to Leopoldville.

Now, we apparently read to you when I was out of the

room the first paragraph at least, which talks about the clear-

cut conclusion:

"If he continues to hold high office the inevitable

result would be chaos and at worst pave the way for Communist

takeover. Consequently, we conclude that his removal. must

be an urgent and prime objective, and under existing conditions

this must be a high priority of your

covert action".

And you have read that language as meaning killing, right?

Mr. Bissell.

Yes.

MI. Schwaiz.

I want to ask you if you continue to

read it as killing in the light of the third paragraph of

the cable which reads as follows:

"To the extent that Ambassador may desire to be con-

sulted you should seek his concurrence. If in any particular:

case he does

not wish to be consulted you can act on your

own authority where time does not permit reference here.

"Pazagraph 4, this message has been seen and approved

at competent level of the Department of State".

to discuss the matter with the Ambassador that assassination

was Involved?

MI. Bissell.

Yes, especially since there is evidence

here that it was discussed with and.: approved at State, and

in the light of the background in this Special Group.

Mr. Schwarz.

You don't think this is referring to

a coup?

MI. Bissell. I don't think so.

But I can't be

perfectly certain.

But I think it refers to more than that.

I think actually it is saying, his removal by some means or

other is the very high priority objective. I would infer

from this that what we know was discussed at least in the

Special Group, and that is that removal might be by the means

of assassination, although obviously others would be preferred.:

Could I add one word in answer to that question. I am

almost certain

am correct, that the then Ambassador to

the Congo was Edward Gullion.

Mr. Baron. I believe it was Timberlake.

MI. Bissell. I think Gullion had arrived by this

time. But certainly in Gullion's regime there was extremely

close collaboration between the Ambassador and the Chief of

Station. And the Ambassador was

an individual who would have

been quite prepared to contemplate this kind of action.

represented to you that at the time thamwas traffic between

channels regarding U.s. efforts to influence President

Kasavubu and others to dismiss Lumumba from political power

aS

premier, and also trafile relating to a takeover of the real

power by certain military figures such as MI. Mobutu, would

your reading of that cable still be that it suggests authori

zation of assassination as opposed to possibly discussing

only authorization of removal of him from political power?

Mr+ Bissell.

I think it authorizes removal. And I

think that probably Mr. Dulles would have sald, if you

can possibly really remove him through political power, that

is obviously the preferred course of action.

But I think this authorizes the whole tone of it very

strong measures indeed.

I say in support of that, there had been

a record

established that even after Lumumba had been removed

from

political power and had taken refuge in the U.N. he was

still widely regarded

as a menace.

Mr. Dawson,

I would like to follow very briefly on

this. I would like to ask you about this agent that you did

have a firm recollection of being President of the congo. He i

was described as being a well-placed of a very good agent,

was he not?

also he made an effective penetration of Lumumba's supporters

both in the congo, and as it were, in the line of funding

and supply in Europe.

Mr. Dawson.

So, he was in place, so to speak?

Mr. Bissell. Yes.

In other words, he was a dual agent.

Mr. Dawson. Did he have access

directly to Lunumba?

MI. Bissell. I think he did, yes.

Mr. Dawson.

Do you remember having been told that he

sometime in November or December went to Stanleyville?

MI. Bissell. I don't remember the specific case, but

It fits the pattern very well. What I do remember is one

operation.

But he knew of,he was close enough to -- he

was used as a courier from Lumumba, I think, first in the

capitol, and then later from Stanleyville to Europe.. And

on one occasion, because he had penetrated so effectively, he

was aware that a large amount of cash was being taken by two

other couriers down to the Congo, and

as a result of his

awareness of that, and all the details of that trip, that

shipment was intercepted.

Mr. Dawson.

The Chief of Station testified about

having an agent that had access.

Would this have been the agent that he believed he

would have access

t0?

Mr. Bissell.

I believe he would have, yes.

to

testify.

Looking back on things,

now, -- and I hate to use the

word get rid of, but let me --do you think the Ü.S. should get!

rid of assassination as a tool?

Mr. Bissell. I think in today's atmosphere the answer

is yes.

Mr. Wides.

Why do you think that?

Mr. Bissell. I think that to use means for the

advancement of policy of such a sort that in the pre-

vailing climate these days would be almost certainly dis-

approved of by a large majority of the legislative arm, and

the public at large, and everybody else, is unwise unless

Now, that circumstance doesn't obtain today, it never

has, but it certainly doesn't today. And I think the climate

1s as I have described. And I, therefore, would eliminate. this

method.

MI. diGenova, I just have one question.

I apologize

for

jumping around, but part of this is to get you out of here.

When the phrase"receiving serious consideration" in

headquarters was used in that cable that we alluded to in

regard to the attempt to kill Raol Castro, what does that mean

to you when Tracy Barnes authorized that sort of language

to be used in a cable?

Mr. Bissell.

It means that he had fought and talked

about this, and almost certainly that I have. And it

may refer to considerations with Allen Dulles. I can't

tell how wide ranging they would be. They would probably

have involved J.C. King, the head of that division.

Mr. Schwarz.

Did Barnes work for you?

Mr. Bissell. Yes, he did.

MI. Schwarz. He is now dead, isn't he?

MI. Bissell. Yes.

Mi. diGenova.

But that was not light language when

it was sent to a station?

Mr. Bissell. No.

It was

sent to encourage careful planning.
