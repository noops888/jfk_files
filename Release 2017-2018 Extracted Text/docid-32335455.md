On February 13, 1973, SA ANDREW J. HOFFMAN,

Intelligence Unit, Customs Agency Service, Bureau of

Customs, Miami, advised that during the past several

years, STELZ has

furnished information to Customs

concerning matters within their jurisdiction. While

this information as furnished was plausible, none of

it ever developed into anything prosecutable. HOFFMAN

has had no dontact with STELZ in about a year. HOFFMAN

said that STELZ could be described as a source of

information for Customs, but no continuous contact is

made with him, and past contact was not sufficient to

make a judgment as to whether STELZ can be considered

reliable.

In fact, HOFFMAN regarded STELZ as somewhat

of a "wheeler-dealer."

SA CHARLES LUTZ of the Customs Agency Service

also advised that the Buffalo Office of Customs, ig

investigating the possible illegal shipment of arms

by the Bonray Financial Corporation, Ltd., 80 Richmond

Street West, Toronto, Canada, and this company has

been in contact with

STELZ within the past year. LUTZ

requested that a copy of the FBI investigation of

STELZ be made available to Customs.

Concerning the STANLEY LIGHT identified in

this LHM, NY 4729-C-TE furnished information in June,

1972, that SAM GIARRUSSO, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, an

associate of known LCN members, was in contact with

STANLEY LIGHT, who allegedly was in possession of a

large aquantity of automatic weapons, especially machine

guns.

Agent JOHN WURTLEY, ATF, Department of the Treasury,

Miami, was furnished with the information about LIGHT

on November 10, 1972.
