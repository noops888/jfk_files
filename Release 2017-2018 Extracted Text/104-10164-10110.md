him as a

"promoter",

rather than a Jusinessman, who endeavers

to attract United States "venture"/captal for variou

Initian protects and then becomen a partner br virtue of

the promotion.

Biographica Regiater has a very high opinion

of this Source, who

is the State Department's Halt! Desk

officer.

During a debriefing on CHARLKS, In February 1963,

this same source stated tha: CHARLES 1a a confidant of

Prosident Duvalier and that he han|emerged as an notive

businessman by virtue of his priviledged position with the

President.

LUCKNER CAMBRONNE, MINISTER OF PUSLIG WORKS. EACH. OF THEM

HAVE THEIR SUPPORTERS WITHIN THE GOH OR DUVALIER POWER

NO SIGNS THAT THEY INTEND TO TRY TO OVERTHROW DUVALIER

THEMSELVES• THEY ARE PRESENTLY JOCKEYING. FOR SUPPORT FOR

THE IR BID FOR POVER WHEN DUVALIER LEAVES THE PRESIDENCY.

POWERFUL. HE MAS THE SUPPORT UF COLONEL JACQUES LAROCHE,

A RUTHLESS AND UNSCRUPULOUS SEEKER OF POWER. (SOURCE

EMBASSY. THE HOUSE OF CAMBRONNE'S MISTRESS, NEE LAFOREST,

WHO IS THE SISTER OF MRS BEAUVOIR, WAS PILLAGED BY THE

MILITIA ALONG WITH THE HOUSE OF BEAUVOIR, AND THIS IS.

INTERPRETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS AN INDICATION OF CAMBRONNE"S

LACK OF INFLUENCE WITHIN THE COM HIERARCHY. WITHIN THE PALACE

IT IS RUMORED THAT CAMBRUNNE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO KEEP HIS DEPUTY'S
