FAIR PLAY FOR CUBA COMMITTEE

The April 6, 1960, edition of "The New York Times"

newspaper contained

full-page advertisement captioned

"What Is Really Happening In Cuba," placed by the Fair Play

for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

This advertisement announced

the formation of the FPCC in New York City and declared the

FPCC intended to promulgate "the truth about revolutionary

Cuba" to neutralize the distorted American press.

"The New York Times" edition of January 11, 1961,

reported that at a hearing conducted before the United States

Senate Internal Security Subcommittee on January 10, 1961,

-DI. Charles A. Santos-Buch identified himself and Robert

Taber as organizers of the FPCC.

He also testified he and

Taber obtained funds from the Cuban Government which were

applied toward the cost of the aforementioned advertisement.

On May 16, 1963, a source advised that during the

first two years of the FPCC's existence there was a struggle

between Communist Party (CP) and Socialist Workers Party (SHP)

elements to exert their power within the FPCC and thereby

influence FPCC policy.

This source added that during the

past year there had been a successful effort by FPCC leadership

to minimize the role of these and other organizations in the

FPCC so that their influence as of May, 1963, was negligible.

The SWP has been designated pursuant to Executive

Order 10450.

On May 20, 1963, a second source advised that

intention of permitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization.

This source stated that Lee belleved

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of Cubans to manage their revolution

without interference from other nations.

Lee did not

advocate supporting the cuban revolution per se.

the Castro network in the Unlted States."

It is to be noted

that senator Dodd was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on

the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York

Forld Telegram and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro

iped was seeking to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its liietime had been sponsorship of pro-

castro street ralties and mass picket lines.

direction of an active propaganda mill highiighting illegal

its comparatively brief span of

opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed

FPCC Iinancing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and

ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received fron

disclosure

of activities on its behalf by suspected

presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964,.

the previously nentioned

second source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, & third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC

activity in many months and

that the iCe had been dissolved.

currently engaged in a campaign of disseminating to FBI Offices. Federal

cations apparently authored by her. These communications relate to the

assassination of President John Fitzgerald Kennedy and are critical oi the

FBI. She reportedly is conducting her own investigation oi the assassination

which has included telephonic and personal interviews of principals con-

nected with this investigation.

Mrs. Martin has been previously interviewed and exhibited an

insulting, argumentative and antagonistic attitude toward the FBI and its

personnel. She recenily contacted one of our Southwest offices by telephone

and although identifying herself. endeavored to elicit information pertinent

to the assassination by using the pretest of belonging to a ladies garden

club. Two days later this office received a communication which in effect

(F) TRAVEL MATTERS - CUBA -- Recently a Cuban alien who had

entered the United States as the holder of a visitor's visa volunteered

to us information concerning his recruitment in Cuba for an intelligence

mission in the United States. A visitor's visa had been issued to him

and his mother in a Caribbean country. They had been permitted to

leave Cuba to seek medical assistance for the mother.

Our procedures to detect intelligence agents among Cuban

refugees who enter this country under provisions of the United States

Government's Cuban Refugee Program (CRP) (SAC Letters 67-8 (F)

and 67-52: (I) are not applicable to Cuban aliens with visitors' visas as

they do not come within the purview of CRP.

To assure prompt notification to us of such Cuban aliens;

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) is instructing its offices

to notify the nearest FBI Office on a daily basis as to the admittance

(and departure when known) of all nonimmigrant Cuban nationals except

crewmen.

In order to neutralize the possible intelligence assignment

in the United States of such Cuban aliens, investigation of them is to be

conducted in accordance with provisions of Section 105E3b (4), Manual

of Instructions, relating to nonofficial visitors from the USSR. Manual

changes are being prepared.

(A) MULTIPLE FINGERPRINTING - IDENTIFICATION MATTER - SAC

Letter 61-16 dated March 28. 1961, pointed out the substantial duplication

in submissions of arrest and applicant prints by local agencies and the

necessity for all Agents in their daily contacts with such agencies to detect

instances of multiple submissions and emphasize the need for eliminating

this expensive practice. Specific suggestions were furnished each office

concerning individual records in the months that followed and much

improvement resulted after agencies involved were contacted.

The work of the Identification Division has increased

tremendously since 1961; fingerprint receipts alone are up 31.46 per

cent.

Bureau desires that renewed emphasis be placed on the undesirability

of multiple fingerprint submissions. Emphasize this at Police Schools, law

enforcement conferences and in daily contacts with law enforcement and

governmental agencies in your territory.

We know that some jurisdictions require fingerprinting

incidental to an arrest or incarceration even though prints have been taken

by another agency for the same offense. Our program to curtail duplicate

fingerprint submissions is not intended to conflict with such requirements.

We are merely asking that law enforcement agencies in the same area

work together to insure that only one set of fingerprints for each arrest or

incarceration is forwarded for search by our Identification Division.

Encourage the initial fingerprinting agency to use the "send copy to"

block on the reverse side of the fingerprint card to indicate interested

agencies that should receive a copy of our reply thus eliminating lingerprint

submissions by those agencies. Another

• procedure sometimes followed is

to have the first agency submitting prints request multiple copies of our

reply for dissemination locally when received.

(D) COMMUNIST PARTY, USA - STRATEGY IN INDUSTRY - Prior to 1961,

Communist Party, USA, Strategy in Industry was a subfile of the Party file

and, as such, activities in this field were reported in the Communist Party,

USA, quarterly report. By letter dated October 10, 1960, you were instructed

to open and assign a separate case on the subject of Strategy in Industry, and

submit quarterly reports with the same due dates as the reports in the

Communist Party, USA, case. This instruction is being rescinded and all

activities concerning Communist Party, USA, Strategy in Industry will now

be reported in the Communist Party, USA, quarterly report under a section

captioned "Strategy in Industry." If your division has no activities to report

concerning this matter, you should set this out in the cover pages of the

Communist Party, USA, quarterly report or letter submitted in lieu of such

report.

This administrative change in our reporting should in no way

be construed by you to mean that less emphasis is to be placed on the

investigation of the strategy, tactics and infiltration activities by the

Communist Party, USA, directed against the industrial and labor field with

particular emphasis on basic,

and vital industries. You should continue an

enthusiastic program of vigilance and vigorously investigate this important

phase of Communist Party activity.

Manual changes will follow.

SAC LETTER 67-14

(E) VISIT OF CUBAN PRESIDENT OSVALDO DORTICOS OR PRIME

MINISTER FIDEL CASTRO TO CANADA IN JULY, 1967 - The Royal Canadian

Mounted Police (RCMP) has advised that either President Osvaldo Dorticos or

Prime Minister Fidel Castro will visit Canada during 1967. The visit is

scheduled to coincide with Cuban National Day at Expo 67, an international

exhibition to be held in Montreal, Canada. The tentative itinerary is as

follows: July 24 - Ottawa; July 25 - Ottawa and Montreal; and July 26 - Expo

67, Montreal.

The possibility exists that other cities will be visited. In view

of the tentative nature of the itinerary, be alert to possible changes which may

be announced in the press or may become available through other sources.

RCMP has requested we furnish any data which could be of

assistance in planning security arrangements. Of particular interest is any

information concerning plans to cause bodily harm, to demonstrate, or

embarrass the individual concerned as well as information concerning the

travel of any anti-Castro suspects to Canada. Since anti-Castro Cuban exiles

in this country in the past have travelled to Canada to attack Cuban

establishments there, we can expect that they will plan various militant

anti-Castro activities to be carried out in connection with this visit.

Each office alert logical sources and informants and advise the

Bureau of any pertinent information received by the most expeditious means

warranted so it can promptly be referred to the RCMP. Submit data under

caption of "Visit of Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticos or Prime Minister

Fidel Castro to Canada in July, 1967, Internal Security - Cuba."

It is noted that when President Dorticos came to the U. S. in

1962 to attend a United Nations session he was accompanied by an individual

who was subsequently arrested in this country for conspiracy to commit

sabotage in New York City. We can expect that such individuals will accompany

Dorticos or Castro on the proposed visit. In adaition, the visit and Expo 67

afford the Cuban Intelligence Service an excellent opportunity to send personnel

to Canada where they could direct intelligence activities against the U. S.;

meet with intelligence agents from the U. S.; or attempt to infiltrate agents

into this country. Keep Bureau currently advised of any pertinent information

received along these lines under an appropriate caption.
