the bulletin edited by the Repatriation Conmittoe of East Boriln.

"RODINA", (LA PATRIE), which is distributed in various languagos

and 1s mailed in sealed envelopes, has been forbidden distribution

in France, (See attached thermofax.)

Security files reflect that in April 1957 the FBI advised that

Victor Petrovich KAMKIN, Elena Andreevna KAMKIN and Nina SAPELKIN

as of 1951 and thats

"Thare is no derogatory data of a subversive

It should be noted, however, that Victor

Petrovich KAMKIN is currently of investigative interest to thie

Bureau and, accordingly, it is requested that any contact of him

She came to the United States in 1951 and lived in Tennessee for

a time with the KAMKINs. The SAPELKINs reportedly renounced

Soviet eitizenship in Shanghai in September or October 1948.

The KAMKINs also wore born in Russia and KANKIN attended

The KANKINs came to

the United States in 1949 arriving in San Francisco in Marche

As CI 1957 KANKIN was being used on an unclassified basis by

the CIA Llbrary asa publications procurement channel.

It is, of

course, possible that Subject's interest in "RODINA" is on behalf

of thie Agency.

Desk were the well known Conmunist "Four Continents Book Store"g

(M3-2000), "Imported Publications and Producta" (NS-2001-I) and

with Verdanin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN, an alloged Soviot agent at

the IRO Camp at Samar, P. I. As reported above, Mrs. KANKIN'S

sister Nina and her husband Semen SAPELKIN were evacuated to Sanais

P. I., from Shanghei under IRO auspices in April 2949.

Ventanin Vasilievitch SAPELKIN's friend ORIOFF, according to

a report of 8 April 1950, was alloged to have influenced a district

leader of the IRO Camp at Samar with pro-Soviet propaganda, and to

have worked with a number of other pro-Soviet interroes in the camp

to sovietize the Russian refugeas interned there. According to a

report dated 5 May 1950, ORLOFF allegedly was bolieved to be a

Soviet agent. (The report noted that this information originated

In the IRO Camp In Samar; that much information originating there

had proven unrellable; and that the reliability of this particular

information had not been determined.)

However this may be, it appears that there could be much truth

in the allegations•

Information in Security files reflects that

ORLOFF very posalbly is identical with & "Count ORIOFF of the

Fussian Committor", (apparently a committee of 1K0), Who assisted

the Commercial Counselor for the Bulgarian Legation In securing

IRO employment for one Bogdana OTTAI, a possible Soviet agent in

Paria who was living with and was engaged to marry Kiril VASSIlEV,

who was belleved to be an agent of the Bulgarian Military Intelligence

Service.

"Count ORIOFF" also helped arrange OTTAI's entrance into

the United States. Alexander S. ORIOFF and "Count ORIOFF" may well

be Identical with Alexander ORIOFT, DI-2881, a highly suspect

Individual of Fussian birth, and a former AtTORG employee tho was

security disapproved by OSS in 1943. This latter individual, per

a 1943 OSS investigation, was known as "The Count".

A December 1954 Staff C memorandum regarding KAMKIN, reported

that unevaluated intormation dated 1 June 1940 indicated that one

KAMKIN was involved in a money printing transaction with

the Japanese, In which he used the machinery of the Chihli Press

in Tient'sin to facilitate the counterfitting. The source of this

information had pointed out the possibility that Victor N. KAMKIN

migat be identified in some way with a V. P. KAMKIN who was named

as a character reference by one Vladimir Vasily IVASHKOFF. (IVASHKOFF

was not identifiod.) The memorandum advised that according to a

report dated 1 June 1948 frcm a U. S. Naval Attache, Nanking, to

the American Ambassador, Nanking, V. Ne KAMKIN was a printer and

publisher in shanghai and later was in charge of the Russian

Publishing House/ known as Nashe ZANIE. He wae closely associated

with Bernard so locall of the chint press, who in turn was

associated with alloged Soviet espionage agent Olga NAKVASIN•

According to the Staff C memorandum, a report from the FBI

dated I4 August 1953 indicated that a scurce of unknown reliability

stated that one Victor KAMKIN, who operated a book store as a

possible covers tents this seted ass pald intormer of

the Japanese during World War II; and was a paid Informer oi lo Se

Army Intelligence after the War.

With the assistance of the

americen Military Goverment in Tsingtao, China, he became Chairma

¿ the Russian Immigrant Society in Tsingtao in 1948. There seem:

small doubt that this Victor KAMKIN is identical with Victor Ne

KAMKIN, and with Subject, Victor P. KAMKIN who was fomerly head

of the

Russian Imnigrant Association in Isingtao, Chine, accord

ing to his friend SAPELKINg as reported in Hong Kong Dispatd

#402. Noto that Victor N. KANKIN was in charge of a Russian

ublishing House in China known as Nashe Zanie; and that th

ranch store Subject intended to open in San Francisco (and ma

hate opened) was also to be called Znanie (this work in Fussian

means "Knowlodge").
