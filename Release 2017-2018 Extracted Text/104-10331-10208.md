Response to Jeremy Gunn

The EXDIR asks that CSI draft for his signature a response to Assassination Records Review Board Executive Director T. Jeremy Gunn's

28 October 1997 letter to David Carey requesting accelerated review and declassification of CIA records. The EXDIR wants to recieve

this response by COB 21 November.

The EXDIR has not yet made a decision regarding CS!'s request for additional funding contained in the 31 October memorandum "Request

for Additional Funds for the JFK Assassination Records Review Project" (which you faxed to me on 7 November).
