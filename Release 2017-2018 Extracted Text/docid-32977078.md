OPERATION MONGOOSE

Main Pointe to Conalder

26 October 1962

1.

What le the Polisy Objective? We need a sharp focus on

exactly what we hope to got frera Mongoose now. This will determine

how beat to employ these unique U.S. resouzces -- either to support

U.S. military operations or dizectly to commit against the Communles

rogime Immediataly,

le the and objective the removal of the Castro/Communiat

regire or to bring it to its knees? Should Mongoose help generate

a popalar sevolt with the probable need for overt U.S. milltary help

a the regime moves la to crush it? Or, is the aim that of maximum

harassment, to make Caba a maximum burden for the Bloc?

Undoubtedly, most people ln the world now expect us to move

towards removlag the Castzo/Cemmuniet regime. Certataly the

Cuban in extle and taside Cuba, who are the mala covert assets of

CLA, sow expect thie policy goal ae the price of risklag their lives.
