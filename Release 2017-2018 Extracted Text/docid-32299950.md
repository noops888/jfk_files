VERA was provided a copy of a letter directed to

United Press International at Puerto Rico from a group known

as M-7 but alleged no knowledge of M-7.

He did stated that

M-7 possibly meant Movimiento Revolucionario de Julio

(Revolutionary Movement of July), July being the seventh month.

San Juan is of the opinion that M-7 may possibly

be the sub-group of CU referred to by VERA but is unable to

pursue this matter further with VERA a the present time to

protect the identity of MM 1337-S.

San Juan anticipates continued contact with VERA

regarding bombing matters.

VERA admitted having received

training in making bombs while in Cuba during the Cuban

revolution but denied any involvement or knowledge of persons

involved in the bombings of the consulates of Venezuela,

peru and Argentina at San Juan, Puerto Rico.

LEAD:

MIAMI

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

Contact logical sources regarding CU in an effort

to determine present membership, current goals and activities

and determine if sub-group of CU organized 8/4-9/74 is M-7:
