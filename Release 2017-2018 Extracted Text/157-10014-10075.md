PROCERDINGS

Tha Chairman. I am going to ask Fritz Schwars le he would

giva us a short rundown on what it 18 we Intend to focus on

in the questionina today, what we expect to cover, what ne hor

to get, and anything, I suppose, Mr. Smothers, that you would

like to add, just to give us a sense of direction in connection

with the proceedings this morning.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. Heims was Disall's Deputy during the

parlod that the Day of Plas was planned. lie apparently was

Kapt pratty much out of that, that is both consistant with what

he sald yesterday and with what the wiltter racord appearn to

show.

He took over as Daputy Director of Plans ln the Winter u

1962 and remalned in that position essentially until he bocame

the haad of the Agency in 1956.

The flrst thing that I think that we should cover with

him is to go through his parapactive on what was happaning

with respact to cuba generally without getting to the assassiri

tos: question. On that ho's noin to say, I ballove, based o:

intorvisian him yesterday and what he sali to the Rockefellas

Cornission, that there was contisuing laterso proasure in de

something about castro or get rid of Castro or ovarthrow the

Communist government in Cuba.

i think he will say that in that cornection, in difect.

other day, there were not any limitations. But It's going to

bu worth a little bit exploring with him and understanding wha:

he means. Does ho mean that the CIA could have dropped bombs.

could have blown up ships in the harbor? What dous he mean bu

anything goss and what does he mean by there wara no limita

tions?

Whan we come to the subject of assagrination, I think.

you will see his tastimony kind of bounce hack and forth. Or.

the one hand, he la going to be saying, well, anything goes.

and that in something. On the other hand. he's goinn to be

But 1 bullove you'll find the tastimony, baßesi

on what he said to the Rockafuller Commission and what he said

yesterday, quite vague on that subject.

He will turn on that sublect bafore too long to the lor

memo which is the most complete description of the avarts in

I think he will say the memo 1s accurato. No will discuss

what he did after the mano was written telling paople to destrcy

him through the parts of the mano which say he decided or ha

agreed with llarvey's decision not to brief McCone. But that is

stated on thren occasions in the memo. I think he will tertily

yesterday and what he said to the Rockefeller Commission.

You will recall also, because I think we must pue in this

concept of mounting a guerrilla operation againat the laland

came into being, but by the time the execution of the operation

vas to taxe place.. President Kennedy had come into office.

Therafore this project had boun at work under two Presidente.

It has been sald since -- I don't know se this is

ralavant to our discussion this morning -- that one of che

ruasons for this misfortune was that Premident Kennedy had boar.

1n office such a short time that he had harily har a chance to

yet ahold of the government apparatus before this shing vas

presented to him and mounted and off. it went. In this was

pretty tourh on him and pretty tough on everybody lavolved.

Subsoquent to the sav of pigs, obviously there was a

licking of wounds and a sort of renrouping, and then as I

You say that in the fall of '61 after the segrouping and

the licking of wounds, the Agency received Instructions to gat

Now junt from whom did these instructions come and that

Director for Plans. In othor words, it was a number two job.

Mr. Helms. Yes.

that one would have approached the AMLASIl thing as an

assassination plot against Castro. I think that one would havo

approached that as an extension of our efforte to set up some

kind of opposition group to Castro inaide Cuba of which Cubola

was. I queas, our prime opportunity, and that the pressures,

an I recall it. for guns and things of that kind all came from

an effort made to figure out who might have done this, and

I think it may well be that this 1a one of the reasons I have

got these names up in the top of those handwritton notes of

be Roselli, It might be Mahou, or Garrison, who was out in

an we know them I think that they, too, are incomplete.

Maybe some of the other witnesses cantlosh out some

of that for you. But let's, for example, say Roselll informed

Harvey prenumably on the basis of Information from Verona that

a team of three men was inside Cuba. That was never demonstrated

and I can only say that basod on Vorona's track record and

Romelli's track socord, those aro not very good witnesses.

General's staft sald with respect to that, summarizing their

the pilla were sent in during Phase I. and again in Phaso Il.

for the purpose of assassinating Castro, and pilla were

that they falled to do it or may not have carried through is

quite a different question.

Mr. Helma. I undorstand.

Mr. Schwars. Lot's look at the other item under

It was unrelated, or not?

MI. llelms. I just don't know anymore. But there is no

reason for me to question the documents, and 18 tho documones

Do I understand from the tenor of these remarke that

IRRIFLE coally wasn't a big thing in the agency, in your

Mr. Holma. No.

An a matter of fact, it was a tiny little thing and I

noticod, Sonator Baker, in one of the pagos here that Mr. Har-

voy said that ho got this involvod in Ali mind with some of tha

things ho was trying to do on Cuba.. I havo no recollaction ol

to handle the ZRRIFIE project on a apocial basia?

Mr. IIclms.

I quoss Imust havo. But may I oxplain

what I think undoubtedly was involvod?

in the clandestine services we had a very careful

bookkeeping system that all monies had to be allocated again

specific projects and by proper authority because, as. you

Senators will remember, that when the Agency was set up under

the National Security Act of 1947, and then later Central

Intelligence Agency Act of 1949, thore were authoritios given

to the Director of Central Intelligenco for uso of unvouchered

sunda and certification to the use of those funds had to come

from the Diroctor by law. And so every Director as far as l knon.

ful bookkooping and auditing systom inaide the Agoncy to be.

Tho point on thaphyaical lines of

people or was it done by cash as a rule, or how did that

voucher follow-up occur undor physical control?

Mr. Helms. We did it variously.

Somctimos actual

cash was passed to a sensitivo agent.

For examplo, you might pay him in Indian rupoes, then els

man who passed the money would sign in the office a certifi-

apparently no such communication with the special Group on an

the best of circumstances and indeed turned out to be one.

Frankly, as the time it didn't loom large and that 1a

when you engaged cloments of tho Malla to porform and operation

that you didn't bring it to the attention of Mr. MeCono

that he had any

Well, It's an interesting point you make,

bocause theoratically this would not be tho case, but there

was d situation in which he got himsolf very much on the othor

question of whether there were missilas In Cuba or not. or

I havo liatened to the testimony from this morning and

this of this aftarnoon and in all faliness l cannot agree that

that 1s what the witness said this morning. He has repeatedly

this altarnoon disavowed any personal knovledge of what the

purpose, or that thare were any pilla dellvared, or to whom.

And I think that among us attorneys the best avidance of what is

on the record is the document itsell.

If ho has no personal knowladge, I don't think we ahould

subject tho Ambassador to trying to authanticate a document

about which he has and profassas no personal knowledge. I think

we put him in a position that is untonable in this rejaid.

I think that he has mado lt as clear as he could thir

that 1f MI. Harvey said so, ho belloves that Mi. Harvey probably

told the truth at that time.

there was something wrong about that, about the document, or

Mr. Holma. I am not at all lamiliar any longar wich what

causes this confusion, I hope that Mr. Harvey can straighten

it out when you talk to him, but I am not able to tall you

whather this oparation was ongoing, whether it had really been

stopped, whether it had been falrly stopped, whother there was

fun and games going on between the officars involved as to, we

w1l1 create a fiction that it stopped or go ahead with it.

I just don't recall any of those thinga at all, I am sorry to

say, and I think anything I say would be unhelpful.

HI. Schwarz. All right.

At any point aftar you became Daputy Director of Plans

and up to the point that you left that job to assume your

highar job, did you instruct the Agency to in effect stand down

from ongoing afforts to assassinate Mi. Castro?

Mi. Helmg. I don't recall whether there was any time at

which anything specific like that was sald.. As the oparation

I was toduced in intensity and reduced in scopo, my recollaction is

that we were continuing with a certain few oparations of which

this gangater business was not one of them. I realized that

Harvey was in touch with Roselll for some time, but I do not

have any impression any longer that after the first few months

there was any roal substance to this.

As a matter of fact, I have toothis day wondared if there's

any

substance to it from the very beginning.

Mr. Sewharz. Well, let's leave out the Mafia question.

kinds, I think there wore efforts made to provide lay down

caches in Cuba. This

1s an ongoing prooccupation of providing

caches of arms and explosives and so forth to various groups

that we though might have some possibility of mounting an

operation.

I wouldn't question that he had asked for guns and maybe

that he was there an a rupertative of Robert Kennedy that--

In other words. I do not recall that we would have thoughs

that he was reporting to Castro on his connections with U.s.

agents in Paris.

Senator Morges- Che other polet.

He at one tine was arrested and confessed?

of the files and telegrams and so forth at the time, but 1t

meena to me that what Cubela subsequently admitted to when he

vas try vas the latter phass of the operation. I don'e know

that he really went back to the beginning of the operation and

covered all of thess things. So that thia particular contact

might not necessarily have bean in his confession, I balleve.

Now 18 I'm wrong, would ond of you strainhten me out?

Mr. Schwarz, Nell, I think one thing is worth saying.

•According to the reports that the CIA got, Mr. Cubele

confused to an effort to assassinate Castro, but according to

the reports thoy got, ho did

not confees to the involvement o!

tha Central Intelligence Agency.

Senator Morgan. Mr. Chairman, one point I was trying to

make for future reference was that if ho was in fact double

agant, then we did lead Castro to bellave that lt was a plot.

that the kennedys knew of 'it, whether thoy did of not. That is

the point I wanted for the record.

Senator Baker. I think you might also, for future retarence.

point out that according to nowspaper accountis, at least, Castro

claims to have known and claims to be in a position to supply

u8

information

about it.

Now, did you know about that?

Mr. Helms, I can't ranambar. I have trled, and the reason

say this, that I cannot remember, is that when I saw it in the

report, I thought, that's odd, I don't recall any such thing.

So I'm sorry, I Just cannot be halpful about it.

The only thing that I did check up on was that he never

took the pen. I've done this within the last forty-eight hours.

The record was not particularly clear on thia, le didn't seem

Mr. Schwarz. Who was that person?

Mr. Helms. A man named Samuel Halperin.

10

Mr. Helms, if in fact Castro did know of these plots, and

11

It's hard lor mo to understand that he did not, given all the

facts that we have seen, might this not have procipitated a

climate hounded by the Bay of Pige that really fostered the

to got aven with us? Is not that a real possibility, that i:

16

In fact we did know of our attempte to kill him?

MI. Helms. Yes, but -- I had alwaya understood that the

Cuban miasile crisis was something that was generated by the

1's. Soviats and their dasires and that they approached Castro to

2:

do this. Maybe his willingness to go along might have been

affected by it, but there cannot bo the slightest doubt that

22

Castro, when ha came to power, must have been keenly aware that

he had pre-existing authorization to indicate that the

Cubola was the type of person that whon Flezgerald --

Senator Hart of Michigan. Dealing with respect to what?

A change in government, or assasaination?

MI. Helma. A change in government, Senator Hait. This

If I may point out --

by murder or killing was not part of our desiras at all. This

was going to ruin our whole plan, if he inalsted on this. And

I think you'll find if you get all of the telegrans, you'll

find

that there was an anormous amount of temporizing with thin

tallow to keep him on the toan, to koop him working away at the

Job, but to try and parsuade him that this was not the way to

go about it.

I think this has to show in the racord, hecause Cubela

And the shall, this was a cock-ayed idea from the outsat.

Thia was the highly intensive imagination of a fallow who

thought, well why wouldn't this be a groat Ides, but a totally

impractical thing. I mean, I cannot call that a plot.

Senator Bakei. Dut there are others, let's not call it a

plot, call 1t playing with fire, 1l you want to, but it's sort

of a dangerous thing to do evan, just to contemplate with any

official sanction of an organization, killing someone also.

It doesn't make any diffarance really how far lt went.

The point i'm trying to maka is, it seams to me a long jump

from nine plans to kill Fidol Castro by assassination to saying

that we gave the poison pon to a fellow not to kill him, but it

to placate him.

MI. Helmg. Well, naybe I read these words wrong, and maybe

my recollection at the time is imperfect. But I thought that

this operation was really designed to not only get information

:.

through Major Cubela, but to try and organize a political

of his case officers, or those paopla in the chain behind,.

to usa him to assassinato Castro. These ideas came from him

Could you give us any advice on where we might lind those

Mr. Halms. I don't any longer know under whose degle those

are. Those ware, I think, at one time National Security work

Security Council files or the Agency files, I don't know.

MI. Holmo. This 1a not very clear to me at this atago.

A lot of the samo officara were serving Presidant Johnson as

they servod Prosident Kennedy, and I don'e -- l can't recall

anymore whether there was any specific lasue about whether this

was taken up with President Johnson at any meeting or any

sassion. It it had bean, I would have thought there would have

been cacords someplace.

Mr. Schwarz. And you have no recollection of Premident

Johnson either being advisad or authorizing continuing afforts.

'1s that right?

Mr. Helms. But you see, the speclal froup would have

continued to consider these mattars, and I would have assumed

that whoever was chairing the Special Group would have in

turn reported to the President, which was the usual practico.

on not only dissidents but penetrations of foreign intelli-

gence services and activitios of foreign intelligence ner-

vices, and no forth. I don't say that other thinge aren't

covorod in the report but my recollection

of what the whole

puspose of the exerciao was to try to improve covorago in the

domestic field.

Mr. Schwarz. And in that connoction to toll the Prest-

dent whether there were certain rostrictions on the ability

of the intelligence agencies to oporate chat might bo lifeed:

1s that right?

Mr. Helms. Yes, it strikes me that what he had asked

for originally was for a wide-ranging report on all of the

things that got in the way of improving this domestic

coverage from the FBI and NSA and

so forth so he could consi

der what these various obstacles were or were considered to

be, such as laws and traditions and things of that kind.

Mr. Schwarz. One of the techniques which the Committee,

including yourself focussed on, was the one callod mall

coverage: is that right?

MI, Iclms, I assume so. Yes, we have a heading hore

Mr. Helma. You see, what I don't know hore, sir, i

wouldn't knowingly have signed something that I didn't

bolleve to be true, and I don't know whether this was referring

to covert coverage by the FBI or somebody else. At least the

it stuck out so I can only assume in the context of working

level meetings which produced this report this must apply to

something the FBI had been doing or planning to do.

that we are talking about an fBI effort here.

that coverage had been discontinued?

I didn't -- what I am trying to say in that I am trying vosy

hard at thia late date to place Mr. Lumumba in his propar

political nicho: I an relativaly certain that he represented

something that the United States Governmant didn't like but

I can't romember any more what it was.

Has he a rightist or leftiat?

Senator Schwelker. Whatever it was ho was marked for

assasination.

Senator Mathias. The curlous thing I remembor, drawing

purely on personal recollection, we actually had him come to

Washington as a guest of the U.S. Governmant and he stayed

at Blair House and was wined and dined as our greatest friend

ac, one point, shortly after his accession to power.

Senator last of Michigan. I think Fidel Castro came

after he came to power.

That was the only time Congress

took an early fall recess because they didn't want to stay

around here and have to have a joint session. They quit

for the year.

Senator Baker. Whep are we getting back?

• Mr. Schwarz. Do you know a man named Justin O'Donnell?

MI. Helms. Yes, sir.

MI. Schwarz. A CIA agent?

Mr. Helms. He used to be an officor in the CIA, yos, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Were you awaro that there was a plan to

assassinate Mi. Lumumba?

about these thinga subsequently because & obvlously read that

report that was made in 1967 at the timo so I was conscious

later on that therewas, but I have no contemporaneous

recollection of this business about Lumunha.

Mr. Snothers. Were you at all involved in that?

Mr. Helms. I don't recall having been and i think i

might vory well have but I juat don't recall thia buadness

about Lumumba.

Actually what was wrong with bumumbo, why didn'e we

like him?

Senator Schwelker. That le the tragedy of the whole

thing. Nobody knows why we wanted to got rid of somebody.

Mr. Smothers.

Do you have any recollection beyond

MI. Helma. No, I don't.

As a matter of fact, interestingly enough, when was

Malcolm X alive? He died but when was it?

In any event, it is not important about the dates but

I remember that in a particular era when he was aldve à loc

Mi. Schwarz. Mr. Biasell has tostifled that there was

at least a plan to assasainate Lumumba. Did you chock with

him whan you made that check?

Mr, llelma. No, he left the

agency by that time.

Mr. Schwarz. Mr. O'Donnell testifled that he was asked

by Mr. Bissell-to actually assassinate MI. Lumumba and upon

hearing that request he went to see a man called robilleb. i

Mr. Helms. ISidney Gottliab?

Yes.

but that he wasn't going to do it, and you said you agreed

he shouldn't do it?

Mr. Helms. I don't remember the conversation at all

MI. Schwars. Do you recall his maying anything apo-

cifically about Trujillo, why Irujillo was included?

Mt. Hoims, I think he was just trying to check on

various reports that he had heard about how these people had

come to die. You know there were ansartions around that,

and I have forgotten any more whether they were newspaper

assertions of just things sort of mentioned by the back of the

hand, but he wanted to know whother the Agency had been respon-

•ible for those deaths and that was why l asked to have this

work done.

ME. Schwarz. All right, now, on Diem. I think you cold

us yesterday afternoon that ha, Prosident Johnson, had a

particular theory about the death of Mr. Diem.

Would you recount that for the committee?

Mr. Helma. He once said to me that he just wondered

whether President Kennedy hadn't died because he had caused

the death of Pregident Diem of Vietnam, and I remember him

having said this to me because it struck me hard

at the

time. I thought this was a pocullar conception, but that is

all I know about it and the conversation never went any

further.

Mr. Schwarz. You had the report done on Trujillo and

you reported back to Preaident Johnson about all three matters,

Castro, Trujillo and Diem?

Mr. Helms, Yes, sit.

Ms. Schwarz. When you reported on Trujillo, based upon

the '67 roport, did you say that the Agency had or had not

had anything to do with the death of Mr. Truj11lo?

Mr. Halma. I gave him the controversy an I recald it chae

pointad in the direction of the Agency not being responsible

for his death.

senator Schwelker. On the Diam polnt, in your cIA

work with South Vietnam was thero any link that comes to your

mind as to why Preaident jonson might havo said that?

Any connoction at all botwoen Diem and kennedy that comes to

CIA 's attontion?

MI. Helms. No, that was what struck me, Sonator

Schweiker. I probablywouldn't have remembered somothing

like this if it hadn't seced to be an odd bellet to have.

My recollection 1a he said this to me not terribly lon

after President Kennedy's assassination and that it

Mr. Helma. Not long ago, Senator Schwelker, I forget,

I guess 1t must have been on one of my trips back here, I

don't remember which one, but I was watching a news report

one night and it seemed to me that Walter Kronkite had

some kind of a clip in the news report.

Sonator Schweiker.

Of an intorview?

Mr. Helme. An Interview with President Johnson In which

this was generally advertod to. I don't remember the

exact words, But Preaident Johnson aort of ended up saying you

know I am not entirely sure or somothing and sort of tralled

off.

MI. Schwarz. Was that the occasion on. which President

Johnson sald wa had at some points been running a burder, Inc.

in the Caribbean?

MI. Helms. No, that language waan't used. This was an

interview after he ceased to be President. It was part of

the long series Kronkite made at the ranch sometime after he

left office.

Senator Mathias. Was this statement hy President Johnson:

sort of amoral, was he drawing a moral conclusion?

Mr. Helms. It seemed to me to have a heavy overtone ol

that.

Senator Mathias, Rather than a factual historical

deduction?

Bissell's deputy then?

MI. Helms. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you have anything to do with the

passage of weapons from the United States to dissidents in

this was handled largely by MI. Biasell and the Chief of

the westorn lemisphere Division at that time, Colonal King, ind

that I got into it and as the record ahows that I got into it

at one point when Bisgell must have ben away somethere.

In other words, this authorizing some document or other.

The question has come up. about whether or not weapons were

passed in the pouch, the official pouch to the Dominican

Republic, and I was suggesting, as you remember yesterday

alternoon, I don't know whather those records exist any more,

but I was really seriously. wondering whethar the actual

State Dopartmant pouch had ever been used for such a purpose

because I had put a watch dog on the pouch for the simple

reason that we were using State Department facilities, that

they had certain regulations about the kind of things that

should go in the pouch, and I wanted to be cortain that year-in

and your-out there were not abuses of the pouch priviloge

becauso of the terrible temptation on the lowest lovel for

employees to want to send

perfume and other

customs lteng

through the pouch to avoid paying duties and so forth, and

that also there are all kinda of abuses that one can make

over a pouch that can't be opened by foreigners or domestios.

So, I had the widow of a foreign service officer

periodically on this job to be sure there weren'e violations

of the pouch, and if it should come

to

me

there should be

record whether anybody made an excoption, whether

I or any*

body else in the geney for sending guns through the pouch.

there should be something there to indicate that exception

was

made.

In other words, this is not something that somebody

could do Just by saying send thia package in the pouch.

Mr. Schwarz. The record shows some weapons were sent

through the pouch, the record being the report made to you

1n '67.

Dut I asked you, I think, whether you know in

1960 or 1961 that the U.S. Government had supplied weapons

to dissidents in the Domincan Republic.

Mr. Helma.

I am sorry, Mr Schwarz, I don't remember.

I mean I could have known. I don't think I knew. s don't think

I was involved in that part of the oporation. But, on the

other hand, with all of the thinga that havo gone on :

through

th cycars it could have been that I have been cold about this.

Mr. Schwaiz. Then I take it also follows you can't

add anything as to whether of not the Agency had autholty to

supply guns at all, number one; had suchority to supply

guns for the purpose of assasgination, number two?

MI. Helms. I thought that when I was reading this I.G.

report that there was a voluminous amount of telegraphic

correspondence and memoranda and so forth about every move

in this whole thing being cleared with the State Department

and so forth.

Are these things not covered in that record?

Mr. Schwarz. There was a great deal of discussion of

clearance with the State

Departnent, Indeed, there is a man

called Deerborn who is in the State Dopartment who appears

to be a motivating force.

MI. Helma, Yes, alI. These exotic phrases are

ouphemiams that are used to doscribe these purposes, none

of them were indulged in with my parmission and I don't

believe they were indulged in at all. I just simply did

not belleve in this method of taking care of one's embarrass-

ments, if you want to call it that, and I never authorized

any cuch actions at any time.

As I explainod this morning, 1t 1a not only the moral

question involved but in our form of country and with our

philosophy and, if you like, theology, it aimply lan'e an

acceptable way to do business and, therefore, other methods

have to be found.

I know in the ditcrature of espionage and secret wars and

so forth, particularly British, French, German, Ruaslan, and

so forth, there are references to the fact when an agent,

secret agent becomes an embarrassment he was eliminated, he

was gotten rid of. But i just don't belleve that this was a

viable system, either morally or any other way, for us to

conduct purselves with people who had gone sour and we just

tried to find other methods of taking care of the problem.

Senator Schweiker. In

the carlier daya, before your

tenure as Director, was this always our policy, or maybe

carlier in the cra of the CIA this was not as flrmly estab

lished or left to local option.

the likellhood of exposure, and so forth, and undesirable or .

unacceptable to our socioty, right?

Mr. Icing. Yes, that 1s right.

Mr. Schwarz.

Now, you also have said that, focussing

on the Castro operation, there the pressure to get rid of Castro

of to overthrow the Castro government constituted an author-

Ization, at least an implicit authorization to kill him, to

assassinate him.

Is that right?

MI. Helms. Yes, I think that ia generally in accurate

phrasing of it.

nizing further that it la your attitude or it la your testimony

that you thought that was unacceptable for both practical

and moral reasons, did you take any stepa to lasue an instruc-

tion to prevent such activity from occurring again?

Mr. Helms. Well, I do know that, and I don't recall now

the means that this manifested itsolf in, but I certainly

made it clear to my senior associates when I was Director.

I simply didn't want this to go on, and I think if you will

differently through the years might have avolded these varlous

things.

I have looked at the law, the atatute. I think there

be tightened up in certain respecta, but i am also mindful of

the fact that as long as one 1a dealing with himan beingo.

I would hope that in the future what is called oversight over

intelligence activities been given a fuller opportunity,.

hecause I honestly believe that part of the problem through

the years has been that those people who had oversight over

intelligence activities, or particularly the activities of the

CIA, were senior officials both in the Executive and in Congres

who were so busy and so preoccuplied about ocher matters that

rather short shrift has been given to this activity, and if

there are better oversight or better opportunities to

have

extended conversations with menbers of the congreas, for

example, I think some of these things could be headed off

simply by an indication from a chairman of a committee or

something that this didn't seem to be desirable, or from sui

other senators.

For example, let me just take a specific inatance.

The Senate Foreign Relationa Committee, when I was leaving,

had a hearing about

something having to do with police

departments. It was the sense of the committee that this was

an undeairable activity for the Agency to be helping police

departmenta directly, so they made a statement to the effect

this should stop. So I belleve it was stopped that very day.

There don't any desire of these people to go bayond what they

have been told not to do, But if you can't got ahold of your

oversight committee or thoy don't have mentings and you aro

busy you go

ahead doing as best you can, and I honestly

believe, you know, as I look back in history that Mr. Dulles

would have been very pleased if he would have had a couple

of senators by the hand when he went into the Bay of pigs.

Senator Schwelker. I think you are perfectly right about

oversight. I couldn't agree with you more. And I think here

congress itself has been derellot. 'I agree with that. I

think that is a very serious weakness of Congress on the over-

sight committees. The other

aspect I think is important, too.

and I concede the first point is in many cases when some

oversight was tried to be exercised, and let me say very litt:

was.

I don't think the intelligence agencies leveled wich th

Congress per se, too, and I think that that is a very serivur

problem from those who want to say they want to do a good jos

when you don't have that leveliny or credibility or whatever

you want to call it, how do ve instill that in a system?

Mt. Helms, I thought that the Agency's record of lovel-

ing was pretty good when given the opportunity.

Senator Schweiker, I don't recall ever being before one

of the oversight committoos set up by Congress and not

absolutely honestly and fairly answering any question I was

asked.

senator Schwelker. Now, how about the war in Laos? i

sat on the House and Senate Armed Sarvices Committees, Mr.

Ambassador, and I think I was on there for eight years, all

during the war, before CIA owned up to conducting a war in

Laos. And I think stu Symington, who sat on the Select or on

the Committee on Superviaion of CIA made the discovery.

I can't agree with you on laos because I sat on the

llouse and Senate Armed Service Committees when you folks camu

a number of times and testified and we had to stumblo into

it backwards. I think senator Symingion really did it thraugh

Foreign Relations contacts, even

though he was on thr oversight

Committee of the Armed Services. I think there is a case where

I won't agree with you, even though I agree with what you said

about oversight.

MI. Helms. I am under oath. Would you mind if I ducked

this?

I can give you no answer except to tell the truth and

I would rather not set into it now, if you don't mind, unless

it is important to you.

Schator Mathias. Ambassador, You, I think explained

very fully and lucidly the way in which you felt you had

authority to act in the very situations , which was a kind ot

a blanket authority without restriction, and that once this

was determined, as illustrated by the case of Attorney

Genoral Robert Kennedy, you didn't feel it was necessary in!

Senator Mathias.

There was an exchange of, if not words,

an axchange of ideas and feelings that kept the situation

curront and continually kept you reassured that there was no

lack, there had been no change of direction at the highest

lovels?

MI, llelms. Yes alr.

Senator Mathias. That was truo as far as the Castro

situation was concerned?

In other situations was there an oxchange of ideas in

this same level of intensity?

MI. llelms. I don't recall except on Vietnam as many

regular exchanges on any subject as there were on Cuba.. And

to get the attention of the top members of the Government on

a continuing basis on one theme really takes a great deal of

attention to that theme on the part of the White House in

order to generate the fact that the Secretary of State should

attend that meeting rather than that meeting on a specifie dry.

The power of the President flows into these matters

in a strang

way and if the Secretary of State appears at an inter-Govorn-

mental mecting it is because he is pretty clear in his mind

that is where he ought to be that day rather than making

Sanator Mathias. How did you manage then undor these

difficult circumstances -- I understand exactly what you are

saying = manago to bo. sure that, say, in the Lumumba situation.

oI Trujillo situation that there was this same kind of cor

tinuing policy, or there hadn't been any change in polley?

Mr. Holms. I don't know the Lumumbs altuation, I don't

know whore the idea came from or what the poldey was any longer

at all, and the trujillo situation I think that the record

shows an on-going back and forthing between the Agency and

the State

Department about the sicuation in the dominican

Republic.

lere it soems to me we had a situation In which it

stayed in CIA rather than inter-agency committed formally

established dealing with this matter, I know in there, for

example, Assistant Secretary Rubottom's name keeps coming

up again and again so I assume the Agency people ware dealing

on a continuing basis.

Senator Mathias. Now, after November 22, 1963, when

President Johnson came in, I think your cestimony is that you

continued to deal with Attorney General Kennedy?

Mr, Helms. I think for a time we did as long as he was

Attorney General. I foryet how long he stayed there. But !

me at chis moment but I do recall asking him that question.

Senator Machias, And you continued to deal on these

matters with him although he didn't atand in quite the same

relationship with President Johnson as he obviously had to

Preaident Kennedy?

• Mr. Helms. I think on the matter of the Castro business.

it would have been with that Special Group rather than him

parcicularly, because by this time that thing had wound down

somewhat. But I think that he was atill Involved. I think

that 1a right.

Senator Mathias. So there is a kind of fluidity about

the whole relationship in all of these matters that is very

difficult to

MI. Helms. Would it be helpful to you if I were to say

over this period of 25 years it has been a very fluid thing,

this busoness of getting clearances and approvals and how

close you are piped in and how close you are not piped in and

overgight and all of these things do change through the years.

It is one of the

reasons I think that the establishment of thi

Select Committee 25 years later to look at the intelligence

community is a very baluable, wize thing for our country. I

think a lot of things have

to be brought up to date, I chini:

the experiances of 25 years ought to be used to tighten this.

thinga up in the right places. The intelligence community

so-called has kind of grown like Topsy over the years. Here

was an agency and there was another agency and then you add a

third and then you add a fourth and then tou find some way to

relate them and find some way to try and coordinate them and

find some way to get Congressional oversight of them and if you

wore to start from absolute scratch and one day say let'a set

up an intelligence community you might sot the thing up

entiraly differently and mayho more effoctively. So the 25

years later I think it is juat fine that this Committe has

seized thia problem. It is very difficult one and I don't

believe by circling you are going to find many easy answers

but it is cortainly an effort worth making on behalf of our

country. After all, two things. Intelllyence is the first

line of defense hy good effective intelligence organizations,

but it has to be good, there la no sense in having an intelli-

gence organization like the German one during world War Il,

which was no good. That does you more harm than good. I

don't mear to keep saying that word. The other thing is that

in the arranging of the intelligence community, the ostablish-

ment of some kind of an organization which was set up after

Pearl llarbor and designated the CIA to get material from all

the hands of the self-servers there wouldn't be enough money ini

the world to support our military establinhment.

Senator Mathias. I think that in a very helpful and

useful comment.

I think we understand that by whatever means, by whatever

form of human communication was involved that original

authorizations were given even at various times

for given

projecta. The projecta may have altored. I think thu

testimony, not only your costimony but Mr. Diasell's and othera

has been that a project undertaken to ramove somebody in a

political sense might become later a project to remove that

same person in a physical sense. So the projects did alter.

But, all pursuant to the original authorization, do you

think that there was adequate political control as this kind

of undulation took place, that a Prosident or a President's

designee, for example, aufficiently aware of the undulations

and had an opportunity to voto the action at some point, at

gone critical point?

MI. Helms. I think that the basic thruat of what you ar

saying is quite accurate. As a long

time, I might put it thin

way, bureaucrat, it seems to me one of the great problems of

Government is that one starts sonething it takos on a life of

its own, then le gets turned off far too late, and l have bori

had the CIA, to your knowledge, ever used Peace Corps or Peace

Corps members as either direct assistante in any way to our

overseas intelligence activities?

MI. llelms. No sir. I say no air emphatically because

I remember in this case specifically writing a paper making.

it clear to everybody that was involved in the clandestine

side of the CIA the Peace Corps was not to be used because

and charged that we more wiing th

those instructions and I am relatively cortain they were com-

plied with through the years.

Senator Schwalker. Can you shed any light -- I think our

Peace Corps people were thrown out of Caylon with the allegation

that thoy were helping the CIA?

Mr. Helme This was a KGD political or psychological war-

fare rather. At that time for years, even very shortly after

the Peace Corps began, that the soviet propaganda kept

asscrting that it was CiA that was under the Peace Corps, iº

was CIA, that was in the Arab press and Asiatic press and

African press, and I would assume the Coylonese pross. It wi

exactly the same, It was Communist propaganda.

Senator Schweiker. There is a wiitten memorandum or

wIitten order that is still in effect on this point?

Mr. Helms. It goes back to the early days of the found-

ing of the Peace Corps.

Senator Schwiker. I wonder if we could get that for the

record?

That is all.

Would you supply for us

now or later in one

of your subsequent

appearances some indication of how the CIA interacted or
