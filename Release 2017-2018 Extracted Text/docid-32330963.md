MRP.

He ascertained that GOODWIN has authorized furnishing all

material and financial assistance to the MRP and after GOODWIN'S

conversation with GODOY, ARAGON told GOODWIN that this was what

the Revolutionary Council complained about, namely, that people

within the United States were dealing with varlous organizations

yand among the Cubans there was no central authority and since this

was the situation, he saw no reason why the MRP or any other anti-

CASTRO group should join the Revolutionary Council.

that GOODWIN told him that this was an operation which had been

started more than a month ago and could not be stopped at this time

as it pertained to underground activity in Cuba.
