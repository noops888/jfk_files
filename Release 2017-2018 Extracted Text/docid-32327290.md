Four copies of this cover letter are being desig

nated for the Bureau instead of two as it is felt the

Bureau may desire to furnish the Legat at Havana and Mexico

city copies of same. l

Copies of this report have been designated for

information purposes only, for Newark and San Juas, in

view of their present and possible future interest in this

matter. l

Special Enployee JOHN W. SULLIVAN, Washington Fredd

Office, checked INs records on January 13, 1958, relative to

JORGE SOTUS ROMERO. M

It is to be noted that this report is submitted as

& joint investigation

of the cases on CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS,

Et Abos

and the case on July 26 Revolutionary Movement, Miami,

b√©cause they purportedly combined their activities for the

purpose of launching a joint expedition. As investigation

reflects, however, that it is unlikely that they will continue

to work jointly, future reports will again be carried

seperately in the cases pertaining to PRIO and the July

26 Revolutionary Movement, respectively. U
