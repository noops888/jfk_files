MEMORANDUM FOR THE FILE

SUBJECT: Lea Harvey OSWALD

SueS:

Reguns 'y FRT RE THE POI

SCAPE

CE ROJAS VILLANUEVA

ASSASSINITE SA PRES KENNEDY

The matter of the request of the FBI, through

Mr. Papich, that we polygraph Rojas VILLANUEVA, a Mexican

subject with whom the Bureau has had contact in Mexico, to

resolve the allegations he has made concerning involvement

in the assassination of President Kennedy,.

was discussed with

Mr. Papich on 10 February 1964, at which

time he was advised

by me and Mr. Whitten that this Agency did not desire to

suoject Roja VILLANUEVA to a polygraph examination in Mexico

and felt that the matter should be resolved in some other way.

He was advised that the case of ALVARADO was different because

we knew that ALVARADO would be sent promptly back to Nicaragua.

Nr. Papich was advised that this Agency would consider poly-

graphing Rojas VILLANUEVA in Texas if this was the desire of

the Bureau, but to do so we would of course necessarily have

to obtain the permission of the Director.

Nr. Papich was

subsequently informed that we were in

a position to polygraph the Subject in Texas

at the Bureau's

request;

the Director's permission having been obtained,

should

this be

the desire of

the bureau.

Mr. Papich

advised, nowever,

on 20 February that the Bureau was not requesting at this time

that he be polygraphed in Texas and the Bureau's present plans

are to endeavor to resoive the matter some way in Mexico.
