to Miami with HORMEL. He stated that BLANCO had returned

to cuba subsequently, and had been killed while participating

In the fighting on the side of the Cuban rebel forses.

MENENDEZ said that he had never used the name

BLANCO, but In view of the fact

that he understands no

English, It was possible that the name ELANCO might have

entered the conversation and been confused with his name

during the interrogation which took place at Cayman Island.

A comparison of the photograph of the ALBERTO BLANCO

mentioned in the "Diario Las Americas" article of June ?,

1957, with MENENDEZ reflected that BLANCO was not identical

with MENENDEZ.

MENENDEL, suring his interview, described the

DR as a Cuban revolutionary organization

which was formed

for the purpose of combating the regime of PULENCIO BATISTA,

with fighting forces under the command of FAURE CHOMON in

Cuba.

On December 30, 1958, LUIS FOBERTO BLANCA FERNANDEZ

voluntarily advised SA THOMA3 H. ERRION at Miami, Florida,

that he was the Delegate Abroad of the DR, and the person

He stated that ALBERTO BLANCO, who had gore to Grand Caymen
