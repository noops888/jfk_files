about Guadalajara, about some intallations. I don't

give it to the Ambaasador. I'll show li to you also.

The problem in that if 'they' (Comment: TELEX)

made a mistake in passing this meseage to our

Embassy instead of to the (PEPRIME) Embassy,

they aleo might paas our thinge to the wrong address.'

SLOWAKIEWICZ:

"Please show me the relegram. It could be very

intereating."
