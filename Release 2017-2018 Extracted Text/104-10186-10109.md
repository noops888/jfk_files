Introduction

The Cuban

foreigr intelligence service, the General Directorate of

Intelligence (Direccion General de Intelicencia - DGI),

in dis

charging its functior of protecting Cabar

interests and securit

and

promoting the polegaes of the Cuban Government, employs agents

of many nationalities.

Although it's activities extend to Europe

and Afriod, Its principal agent strength is in Latin America.

Agents have in general two types of assignments:

Information on the local government and the local situation, and

promotion of reveluttorary activity, including guerrilla warfare.

Ali bol agents abrcad are therefore

gorles according to furction: intelligence agents charged with

collection of triormarion and penetration of local governments and

organizations, who are truly clandestine.

In addition,

both dur

taken to the Escambray Mountains in Las Villas Province to put

their training into practice and to learn to live off the country.

They are integrated into regular Cuban army units for short

Guerrilla students are required to meet a standard of complete

familiarity with all the information and material forming part of

Examinations are given regularly; students

who fail them are required to repeat the instruction. A student

may have to repeat the entire course if he cannot pass the neces

(foreigners visiting or resident in Cuba, contacts of DGI agents

or organizations abroad, or guerrilla trainees selected for

superior abilities), come under the Dol Illegal Department, which

is responsible for their recruitment, training, and subsequent

Both Cubans and foreigners are

to that time the DGI has only advance notice of his selection and

knows little about him.

the trainee's knowledge.

On one occasion in early 1964 a case

officer arranged to meet a new trainee in a Havana restaurant for

the preliminary interview.: The case officer provided himself with

in good order.

When he started to record the interview, however,

he discovered that he had either lorgotten to adjust the mechan

the record button; the restaurart was suddenly electrifled by a

voice saying:

biographical questionnaire covering all aspects of the agent's

family situation, political viows, background and education,

the document forms the basis of the agent's DGI personal file.

In addition, the agent is required to write a complete report on

the operational situation in his country, including types and

Final Briefings

27.

When guerrilla agents have completed their training, the IN

Department case officer briefs the group on its mission In its

home area, which 1s usually support of local revolutionary

activities.

The briefing Includes assignment of tasks, explana

tion of what support the group my expect and how it is to be

supplied, directions for reporting to the sponsoring group,

advice on security and self-protection, and the travel route to

be followed

In addition, the group leader recelves a special

briefing on means of communication with DGI headquarters, special

arrangements for supplying the group or its sponsoring organiza-

tion, and perhaps the transportation to its home area of propa

ganda or sabotage materials from Cuba.

Although agents are

allowed to take notes during their training, they are not permitted

to carry any compromising material on thelr

Actually, •however, guerrilla agents do not always observe

security precautions about materials.

One Salvadorian guerrilla

agent succeeded in hiding in his luggage a copy of the Manual of

Guerrilla Warfare he had used in his

course, even though

the case officer inspected the luggage whilo it was being packed.

The case officer commented that unless another inspection was

made at the time the agent left his quarters to depart the

country or at the airport just before boarding the plane, it was

especially into the Central Am rican area and to the north const

of South America. Since

1962, however,

the practice of sending

agents home as crewmen has materially declined and in 1964 was

used only occasionally.

Effectiveness of Training

36.

The capabilittes of both guerrilla and illegal agents trained by

the Dol vary greatly because of differences in background, native

capacity, and adjustment to discipline.

The DGl has successfully

trained a few highly efficient agonts,

but some of its trainees

have not come up to expectations.

One agent with an excollent

training record, of whom the case officer had high hopes, was

arrested for participation in illegal activities after only a

short period of oporation following his return home.

Soveral

agents who were considered promising proved disappointing when

released from training supervision; one who was given funds to

purchase a radio spont the morey on himself and was in trouble

with the group with which he was affiliated because of his lack

of discipline; another was accused of having misused funds en-

trusted to him for arms procur-ment and was also distrusted by

his group as cowardly and spiritless.

As noted above, instruc-

tion in secret writing has not always been productive

of readable.

The main difficulty

appears le lie not with the quality

of the trainine but with the lack of discipline and loyalty of

the trained agent.
