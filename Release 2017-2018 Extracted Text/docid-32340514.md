possibility that they may have at some time been contacted

by the FBI could not be precluded based on the limited

identifying data supplied by Mr. Jaffe and the expeditious

nature of

the file reviews conducted in accordance with

Mr. Jaffe's request.

On September 1, 1976, Mr. Charles Jaffe, SUPRA,

telephonically recontacted Supervisor Pomerantz and advised

that he, in addition to the information already furnished,

needed to know the details of any interviews conducted by

the FBI with any of the above-listed individuals and also

needed copies of the records of these interviews.

Mr. Jaffe stated that the trial judge would inspect

these documents in camera and

make a determination as to

whether these documents would be furnished to the defense.

Mr. Jaffe explained that this would have to be accomplished

expeditiously as possible according to the judge's

instructions. Mr. Jaffe further advised that the Werbell

trial involved allegations on the part of the defense of

Government wrongdoing.
