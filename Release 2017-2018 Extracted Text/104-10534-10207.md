I han to do with the treatment of the updating of weapons inventories

We do not no thie as a signiticant deficiency. The sapply

There ure, however. a number of intances in which the guidance.

latoas are not absolutely binding at all times and in all sitnatioa..

Las the Remulations Be Circumnated Without Rink of Dotuction:

Our inclination le 8o give a far "no" to this question. but

there in 1 possibility-nithough a very alight one--lat a dinhonent

employee could acguire a unall quantity of wenpons for unnathorited

ane without too much rink of his being unsociated with them. The

examples we cite in our detulled report are quite far-fetched, aud

F'allacious Allorations of CIA Involvement in Illegal Arms Deais

We examined a number of instances la which CLA has been

falsely accused of mifiliation with an illegal arms transacties. We

have on occasion provided certifications that an individaal had no

connection with CIA, but in mans triale of people some of who may

have had prior CIA affiliation we prefer not to do this. We are

likely always to be plagued by incidente like iC

there often in little we can do other than be unhappy over the

allegations:

How Important Are the Regulations:

Of course the regulations are important -indipeasable, in

fact--and it would be foolinh of un to suggest otherwine. We nok

that operates perhaps eves more electively than do the controle

We found a universal awarenes that firearms, while treated an
