pretext call to LOUIS WHISPELL, an alleged Marxist, whose views are so

extreme that even CP members avoid him.

be working again then.

An effort was made to contact CHARLES B. MAXEY, proprietor of the Maxey :

Buy kite Grocery, 4601 N. Williams Ave., Portland, on the evening of 11/22/63.

Hospital

Portland. MAXEY is an established Source on racial matters used by
