Ms. Long.

On 6/26/95, appropriate FBIHQ record checks were

conducted on Ms. Long by a representative of the

Industrial/Facility Security Unit (I/FSU), SCMS; no derogatory

information was disclosed.

on 6/20/95, a representative of the SCMS verified that

Ms. Long has

the appropriate clearance, term certified for a

period of one year, to be granted unescorted access to FBIHQ and

to be granted access to classified material up to and including

It should be noted, barring additional changes,

Ms. Long's clearance certification will expire 6/19/96, prior to

which time it will have to be recertified for her to continue to

have unescorted access to FBIHQ.

It is requested that Ms. Keeley return Ms. Long's badge

to the Security Unit,

completion of her assignment.

Ms. Keeley should also notify

MS. F. Brice, I/FSU, SCMS, Extension 6875, when Ms. Long no

can be updated accordingly.
