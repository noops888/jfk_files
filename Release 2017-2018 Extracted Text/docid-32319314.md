BUDED: 6/24/94

Re Bureau teletype to Miami, dated 6/14/94.

For the information of FBIHQ, a search of the

indices to the central records system as maintained by the

Miami Division located no additional documents related to the

JFK Assassination, filed since the last submission of such

documents by Miami to FBIHQ on 5/11/94. Furthermore, the

Miami Division does not maintain a file under UCFN 89A-DL-

60165, captioned "ASSASSINATION OF PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY,"

or any other UCFN bearing this caption.

The fact that all relevant files have been

submitted to FBIHQ by the Miami Division can be verified by

Special Agent WILLIAM G. DOLDE, Principal Legal Advisor,

and/or Miscellaneous Documents Examiner DEBORAH A. ROBERTSON.
