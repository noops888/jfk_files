Evans the publicity being given remarks made by Robert Kennedy concerning

alleged offers of political support for Senator John Kennedy if Robert Kennedy

would "go easy" on certain witnesses before the McClellan Committee.

O'Donnell advised that Robert Kennedy stated the press had unduly enlarged

on his remarks, and O'Donnell said he did not believe the Kennedy's have the

facts necessary to back up Robert Kennedy's reported statements.

Kenneth O'Donnell also advised Inspector Evans in March, 1959,

that he had been informed that Cardinal Cushing was extremely displeased at

the reaction of some Catholic Church publications to statements made by

Senator Kennedy regarding the separation of church and state. O'Donnell

said that Senator Kennedy's position that no public tax money should be used

for parochial schools was the position of the Church and that Cardinal Cushing

felt the critical remarks of the Church publications regarding Kennedy's

statements were unwarranted. (94-37374-17)

John Kennedy is acquainted with former SA J. Philip O'Brien,

whose resignation (with prejudice) was accepted at Oklahoma City in May,

1960, following personal misconduct. In this regard, O'Brien wrote the

Director in June, 1960, to request reinstatement and/or acceptance of his

resignation without prejudice. In his letter to the Director, O'Brien stated

that Senator Kennedy had written him (O'Brien) as recently as 11-2-59 to

state, "Dear Phil.. I am certainly glad to hear that you are doing so well

in Oklahoma...."

(67-301566-83)

ROBERT KENNEDY: ADVOCATE OF FEDERAL CRIME COMMISSION:

Robert Kennedy, the Senator's 34-year-old brother, has

seen the Director on a number of occasions in recent years. In September,

1959, he called upon the Director to advise that he was resigning as Chief

Counsel of the McClellan Committee and to express appreciation for the

excellent cooperation which the Bureau had extended him. He specifically

mentioned the help of Inspector Courtney Evans. The Director addresses

him as "Dear Bob." (77-51387-36)

Early this year, Robert Kennedy published a book, "The

Enemy Within, " dealing with graft, corruption and criminal influences in

the labor movement--particularly James Hoffa's Teamsters Union. In this

book, Kennedy makes special mention of the advice and assistance given

him by the Director.
