How did this happon:

B. ( (Lon: pauso)) The fact that BURGI was on instructor at Yale

Untversity -- an associate professor, a tencler; I do not remember

wether ho uns in litcrature or sonething else but there was something

connected with Russian history or liternture.

I do not renenber.

The fnct that... this fact Itself mates him of interest -- becauso

he teaches students who study Russian history and Ilterature and who

perhaps will work in rovernment service when they have finished school

л. Ок.

B. This fact indicates

that this man is of interest and can "spot"

someone or students:.

students, and so forth and so forth -- and for that renson was of

What cise:

What other facts indicated that he would be of interest.

There are many professors....

There must be still other facts indicating that he is of interest.
