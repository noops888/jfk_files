NOTE:

Subject is U.S. citizen, who is acting Executive Secretary

of the pro-Castro organization Fair Play for Cuba Committee (FPCC).

legarding letter 7/16/62, which CIA believes was written by subject, @

the writer of this letter indicates he desires to be contacted by

CIA and suggested a contact in New York, followed by a meeting

possibly in Montreal. The writer of the letter indicated that

he was in a very difficult situation and indicated he knew he

could be of extreme value to GIA.

Writer Indicated It was a matter

of life or

death. If this letter

was written by Gibson, his "dire

situation" is not apparent to us.

when reply is received from WrO

and NYO, a memorandum will be prepared setting forth recommendations

pro or con re interview of Gibson under suitable pretext.

Basis for investigation of Reiss! father in 1954 was former

membership in the Industrial Workers of the World, which has been

designatedby the Attorney General under Brecutive Order 10450.

A reference of Reiss' father, who was a former CP member, reconnended

Reiss" father and stated Reiss! father worked against communist

sympathizers while in Anerican Newspaper Guild, 1938-42. Results of

SCE investigation were furnished to Civil Service Commission, and

we were advised on 1/21/55 that Reiss' father had been retained in

his employment with Department of Connerce.
