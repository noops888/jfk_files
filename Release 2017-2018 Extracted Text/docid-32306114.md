SUBJECT:

LA COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

ReRomlet December 8, 196%.

Dr. NINO MENDOLIA, Chief, Squadra Mobile (Flying

Squad), Police Headquarters, Palermo,

sicily, Italy,

advised

on January 5, 1968, that Instructional Judge.

of the Palermo Tribunal has decided against the issuance of

additional warrants at this time.

According to Dr. MENDOLIA,

as the situation

stands now, the trial of those individuals

in custody will be held "sometime this year." He said he

did not know if this means before the summer recess or after,

but in his opinion the trial most likely will not be held

before the fall of 1968.

For the Bureau's additional information, Legat has

ascertained that the Italian Government has requested the

extradition of RAFFAELE QUASARANO to Italy and is preparing

the necessary papers to request theextradition of JOE, BONANNO

and SANTO SORGE. As the Bureau knows, all were charged in

Italy with aggravated criminal conspiracy, a crime not

included in the extradition treaty in effect between Italy

and the United States.

According to Legat's police sources,

most likely the Italian Judiciary, which is handling the

matter of extradition with the Italian Ministry of Foreign

Affairs, will link QUASARANO, BONANNO and SORGE with other

crimes, such as murder, which are included in the treaty.

For the Bureau's additional information, on

October 23, 1967, a trial was commenced in Reggio Calabria,

Italy, against 115 defendants, all of whom are charged with

being

members of the MAFIA and with aggravated criminal

conspiracy.

The trial is a culmination of an investigation
