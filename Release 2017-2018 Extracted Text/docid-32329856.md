MISCELIA NEOUS

The Wall Street Journal, Pacific Coast edition, reported in Sep-

tember, 1953, that Las

Vegas, Nevada 'is one of the nation's top boom towns.

The report states that the whirl of the roulette wheels, the clatter of slot

machines, and the pop of champagne corks are playing, a medley of booming busi-

ness. for this ganbling necca in the Nevada desert.,

A representative of the Boulder Club reports that there was ‹

500% increase over their 1948 level. JARS KOZIOFF of the Golden Nugget reported

that the volume, is up 25% over last year and has doubled since 1948. KOZLOFT

reported that 40,000 persons visited the Golden Nusset on Decoration Day, 1953;

as compared with 24,000 the same day in 1949. AL

The journal further reported that the famed "strip" is the newest

and most, flamboyant addition to the city, and that the El Rancho Vegas Hotel

is planning to build a new swimming pool

twice the size of its present one,

and will also add 300 rooms, and will build "a new play house", total cost

$1,000,000.00.

WILBUR CLARK of the desert Inn is quoted as having stated that

they plan to build a 135-room 5-story 'Brazilian type addition to the Desert Inn.

Parking and housing have become severe problems. A strip hotel owner was quoted

as saying "Iet's face it.. Sure, we've got the desert air, nice weather,

rainfall of only l1.34 inches;. Hoover Dan is nearby, the mountains only 35 miles

away for winter skiing, but if we didn't have legal gambling, this town would

not be in business".
