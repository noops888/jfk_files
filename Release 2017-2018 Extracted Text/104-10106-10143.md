information requested covers an era and an organization which

was not a part of this Directorate.

As a result much of the

corporate memory is no longer available and research of the

files by current personnel is time consuming and requires

almost a learning process.

We have depended a great deal

on the written History of

the U-2 Project for leads to files

and for information contained in this memorandum.

2.

(U) The primary interest of reference refers to

the U-2 Project, Detachment C, while stationed in Atsugi,

Japan.

Attached are replies keyed to the six areas in the

HSCA letter.

3. (U) We realize that the information supplied by

this memorandum does not fully respond to all the areas

requested. Because of the broad and encompassing nature

of some of the requests in the HSCA letter

and the fact

that our files are not organized to readily respond to

such broad

General Background: Detachment C advance party of

security and communication personnel departed the U.S.

for Atsugi, Japan, on 20 February 1957, the second echelon

of administrative

personnel departed 4

March, and the main

body of the detachment with

two U-2 aircraft and equipment

began deployment on 15 March.

On 29 March Headquarters was

notified that all personnel and equipment were on base.

Operational readiness

was

forecast for the week of 8 April.

Operating procedures and liaison had been accomplished with

the following major U.S. components:

Far East Air Force

Far East Command and 3-3

Theater Commander

Agency's|

Tand local support unit

54th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron

Atsugi Naval Air Station

Details or specific operating agreements or procedures

with the above components have not been located.

By mid-May 1957 the Detachment had flown 30 sorties.

All of these operations were preparations for the primary

mission of the Detachment. The first primary mission of the

Detachment,

a flight over part of the USSR, occurred on

20 June 1957, however, this mission did not originate or

recover at Atsugi.

The first overflight of the USSR from Atsugi occurred

on 1 March 1958 and this flight was the only and last flight.

was tracked, as other previous flights by other Detachments,

by Russian radar, even though the U-2 aircraft

had anti-radar applications, and a Soviet protest was made

on 5 March 1958 by the Soviet Ambassador to Washington,

Mikhail Menshikov.

Attached are copies of the Soviet

Aide Memoires of 5 March and 21 April 1958 (Tab A).

The Detachment continued to perform non-USSR missions

in the Far East area until the Powers flight of 1 May 1960.

Redeployment of the Detachment began in early July, the

last U-2 aircraft departed Japan on 9 July and all personnel

and other equipment cleared the base and

turned the facilities

back to the Navy on 19 August 1960.

EMBASSY OF THE UNION OF

SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS

AIDE MEMOIRE

According to precisely established data, on March 2, 1958, at

4:05 hours Moscow time, an American military jet aircraft, having

appeared from the direction of the Sea of Japan, violated the state

border of the Soviet Union in the area of the settlement of Velikaya

Kema and penetrated into the airspace of the Soviet Union, remain-

ing over its territory for a considerable period of time. Thereafter,

the aircraft left in the direction of the Sea of Japan in the area south

of the Olga Bay.

The information on this violation has been carefully checked

and there is no doubt as to its authenticity. The military representa-

tives of the United States, who in this case acted possibly without the

knowledge of the Government of the United States, will perhaps deny

the said violation, as has happened in the past. However, such a

denial cannot eliminate the fact of violation itself. In any case, the

Soviet side would have no interest in commenting on this incident if

it had not actually taken place.

A the present time, when negotiations are being conducted

on the holding of a summit meeting which could contribute to an im-

provement of relations and to strengthening trust between states,

the violation of the Soviet border by an American military aircraft

may be evaluated as an attempt to undermine the efforts aimed at

convening such a meeting and to aggravate the international situation.

From the messages of the President of the USA and his con-

versations with the Soviet Ambassador, as well as from statements

by other government officials of the USA, it is known to the Soviet

Government that the Government of the USA desires a rapprochement

between our governments and improvement in the relations between

them. There can hardly be any doubt that such facts of violation of

the borders of the USSR can have only one result--that of hindering

this cause and upsetting Soviet-American relations.

---

## Page 8

14-00000

The attention of the Government of the USA is invited to

the fact that in the present situation the violation of the airspace of

the USSR by an American military aircraft takes on a particularly

dangerous character since, as has been repeatedly reported, Ameri-

can military planes make flights around the clock over many countries

of the world carrying thermonuclear bombs. The Government of the

USA cannot fail to be aware of what genuinely catastrophic consequences

for the cause of peace will ensue when an American plane with such a

load will find itself shot down.

The attention of the Government of the USA has already been

previously directed to cases of violation of the state boundaries of

the Soviet Union by American military aircraft. However, as proven

by the case cited, the authorities of the USA have not taken the necessary

measures to prevent such violations.

It is absolutely obvious that it is the duty of the governments of

the USSR and the USA to do everything possible to prevent any acts

capable of complicating the situation and the relations between the

Soviet Union and the USA.

The Soviet Government cannot but protest against the violations

of Soviet frontiers by an American military aircraft and it expects that

the Government of the United States will punish severely those guilty

of the violation of the airspace of the USSR which has taken place and

tha: it will take steps to prevent such violations in the future.

Taking into account the present situation, where a summit con-

ference is being prepared, and also the spirit and purpose of the nego-

tiations being conducted between our governments, the Soviet Government

would not like to make this matter public or subject it to discussion in

the UN.

The hope is expressed that this matter will be settled satisfac-

torily between the governments of the USSR and the USA and that there

will be no need for the Soviet Government to resort to other means for

its settlement.

EMBASSY OF THE UNION OF

SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS

Note No. 9

The Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics

presents its compliments to the Department of State of the United

States of America and, referring to the Aide-Memoire of the Depart

ment of State dated March 31, 1958 and containing a reply of the

Government of the United States of America to the Aide-Memoire of

the Soviet Government dated March 5 concerning a violation of the

Soviet state border in the Far East by an American military jet air-.

craft, has the honor to communicate the following:

In the reply Aide-Memoire of the Department of State an

attempt is made to deny the fact of an American military aircraft:

having violated the Soviet border.

As has already been communicated, the Soviet Government has

at its disposal carefully verified data on this violation, the reliability

of which leaves no room for doubt. According to these data, on March 2,

1958, at 4:05 a.m. Moscow time, an American military reconnaissance

aircraft of the Lockheed U-2 type, having appeared from the direction

of the Sea of Japan, violated the state border of the Soviet Union in the

area of the settlement Velikaya Kema, 32 kilometers south of that

settlement. Then the violating aircraft deeply penetrated the airspace

of the USSR and, after remaining over its territory for a considerable

period of time, passed beyond the limits of the Soviet territory 45 kilo-

meters south

of the Olga Bay at 8:11 a.m.

In the light of the established facts the reply of the Government

of the United States of America can in no way be recognized as satis-

factory. Naturally, the question arises as to how to explain such a

reply of the American Government: whether it was misled deliberately

by its military representatives in the Far East or whether it considered

it possible to proteci such persons subordinate to it, who, without re-

gard to the possible consequences, sanction violation of Soviet borders,

thus creating a threat of international complications.

---

## Page 10

...........

Such a reply of the Government of the United States of America

to the communication of the Soviet Government cannot fail to cause

serious concern, the more so since the new case of violation of Soviet

airspace took place after warnings on the part of the Government of

the USSR to the effect that American authorities should take the

necessary steps to prevent such violations.

In connection with the foregoing the Soviet Government expects

that the Government of the United States of America will undertake

further investigation of this act of violation of the airspace of the

USSR by an American military aircraft and will punish severely those

guilty of this violation.

The Soviet Government also expects that the Government of

the United States of America will take the necessary Steps to prevent

violations of Soviet airspace by American aircraft in the future and

states that in the event of new violations full responsibility for their

consequences will rest with the Government of the United States.

of tke purpose of the missions and were taking counter action.

One positive action was the standdown of civil flights while the

mission aircraft was over the USSR, and a second action wich is

Note No. 23

The Embassy of the Union of the Soviet Socialist.

Republics presents its compliments to the Department of

State of the United States of America and, acting on in-

structions from the Soviet Government, has the honor to

state the following:

According to precisely verified data, on July 4 of

chis year, at 8:10 a.m. Moscow time, a twin-engined medium

bomber of the United

American Zone of Occupation in Western Germany and flew over

the territory of the German

Democratic Republic,

entering

the air space of the Soviet Union from the direction of the

Polish People's Republic at 9:35 in the area of Grodno. The

aircraft which violated the air space of the Soviet Union

flew on the route Minsk, Vilnyus,

Kaunas and Kaliningrad,

penetrating territory of the Soviet Union to the depth of

320 kilometers and remaining over such

territory for one

hour and 32 minutes.

On July 5 of this year, at 7:41 Moscow Time, a twin-

engine medium bomber of the

United States Air Force, coming

from the American Zone of Occupation in Western Germany,

flew over

the territory of the German Democratic Republic;

and at 8:54 penetrated

the air space of the Soviet Union in

the area of Brest, coming from the direction of the Polish

People's Republic. The aircraft violating the air frontier

of the Soviet Union flew along the route Brest; Pinsk Bara-

novichi, Kaunas, and Kaliningrad, having penetrated Soviet

territory to a depth of 150 kilometers and having remained

one hour and 20 minutes over such territory.

invaded the air space of the Soviet Union and penetrated

to a significant depth over Soviet territory.

On July 9 there took place new flights of United

States aircraft into the Soviet air space.

The above-mentioned violation of the air frontiers

of the Soviet Union by American aircraft cannot be inter-

preted as other than intentional and conducted

for purp

oses of reconnaissance.

It must be underscored

that these gross violations of

the air space of the Soviet Union took place at a time

when, as a result of the efforts of the Soviet Union and

other peace-loving governments, a definite lessening of

international tensions has been achieved, when relations

between governments are improving, and when mutual confi-

dence between them is growing.

countries who are vitally interested in

ave a try

Such a development of inter-

strengthening peace-

One cannot, however, fail to recognize that reactionary

circles hostile

to the cause of peace in a number of coun

tries are vorried by the relaxation of international tension

which has taken place.

These circles do everything possible

to interfere with

further improvement of relations between

countries and the creation of mutual trust among them.

Among such

attempts is the said gross violation by the

American Air Force of the air space of the Soviet Union,

consistently carries out a policy of strengthening

peace and broadening businesslike cooperation with all

countries, including the United States of America.

In this connection, the fact attracts attention that

the said violations of

the air frontier of the Soviet Union

by American aircraft coincided with the stay of General

Twining, U. S. Air Force Chief of Staff, in the Federal

Republic of Germany.

The Soviet Government energetically protests to the

Government of the United

States

against such gross viola-

tion of the air space of the Soviet Union by American mili

tary aircraft and considers this violation as an intentional

act of certain circles in the United States, planned to ag-

gravate relations between the Soviet Union and the United

States of America.

Calling the attention of the Government of the United

air space of the Soviet Union by American aircraft,

the

Soviet Government states that all responsibility for possible

consequences of such violations rests with the Government of

the United States.

The Soviet Government expects that steps will be taken

by the Government of the United States to punish those

guilty for the said violations and to prevent such viola-

tions in the future.
