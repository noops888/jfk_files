COMMENTS OF REVIEWING OFFICIAL

Although this employee is a fine intelligence officer and has worked

very hard for the Chief of Station, Mexico City,

I consider the rating

of Outstanding in all specific duties and for over-all perfornance to be

excessively high.

Reporting on the activities she supervises hes been

as good as that fron other Mexico City operations but is still noù up

to DDP standards.

While most of the projecis shei

is concerned with are

handled with proper cost consciousness, at least one of them,

the LITEMPO

Project, is not.

The agents are paid too much and their activities are

not sdequately reported.. This has been called to the station's attention.
