Attention: Steve Skancke

Dear Mrs. Davis:

During a recent visit to the Lyndon B. Johnson Library, Dan

Layer and Michael Epstein, staff members of the Senate Select

committee on Intelligence Activities, conducted research

among certain classified records and requested copies of

selected documents. The documente have been transmitted to

uy oftice by courier service and aré enclosed herein for

revlew by the NSC staff before presentation to the select

comnittee.

This is a procedure agreed to by Stave Skancke

In a telephone conversation with me on May 12, 1976.

Among these documents is a record of conversation with

J. Edgar Hoover dated November 24, 1963.

While this

document is not presently classified, I believe that 1t

should be reviewed by the NSC staif as probably containing

classified information.

The select committee staff has expressed a sense of urgency

and has requested that these documents be reviewed and con-

veyed to the comittee as soon as possible. Would you plence

advise me of the outcome of your review.

Sincerely,

RICHARD A. JACOBS

Deputy Assistant Archivist
