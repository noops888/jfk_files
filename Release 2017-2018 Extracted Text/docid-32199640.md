While associating with GULLON and the Puerto Rican,

he criticized the United States and posed as being sympathetic

toward communism in order to ascertain information

advised that if any information is ever

obtained about his being sympathetic toward communism, that

this should be discounted because he has spent most of his

life and especially the last five years doing everything

possible to fight communism.

that FIDEL CASTRO is now inducing individuals who are in

favor of communism and who are in the United States to go to

Cuba for special training creating a "Fifth Column" to

return to the major cities in the United States.

period to have enough

"Fifth Column" trainees to take over

the United States.

explained that he had gone into the Miami

Office some

time

back and presented some information

regarding the passing out of pro-CASTRO propaganda and that

at that time he had asked for Bureau backing if he should

infiltrate into pro-CASTRO ranks.

He was told then that he

could not consider himself to be

a Bureau employee and

advised that he could not understand how anyone could assist

the United States with such a policy.

He considers that the

Bureau would back anyone fully who would volunteer to fight

FIDEL CASTRO and communism. •

Istated that he was disgusted with CIA and

Its policy because he was involved in the Bay of Pigs

invasion and he met representatives of CIA in Guatemale who

could not speak Spanish and actually what they instructed

with regard to espionage and sabotage was archaic. He

digressed at length to explain how when he tried to open some

ammunition boxes during the invasion that he found bricks in

the boxes and he was certain that there had been a

"double-cross"

, all the way on this invasion.

people toward CASTRO and he warned of the dangerousness of

CASTRO.

that CASTRO is an egotist who will stop at nothing.

was critical because he cannot understand why the infred

States allows Cuba to maintain a bastion of arms just 95

miles

allowed to furnish monies to aid Cuba without their being

prosecuted. He identified Cuba as the enemy and any

keeping the entire Western Hemisphere free from conmunism.

He considers their struggle to be a losing battle because

he understands that CASTRO could now cause a revolution for

communism in almost every country in South America but that

Russia is not in accord because Russia fears that CASTRO

would take over and cut Russia out of the material gains.

was not pressed for the identity of this group because

1t was

apparent that at this time he would not identify

them.

TORRES advised that it is a mockery to not allow

the report of the FBI concerning the assassination of

President JOHN F. KENNEDY to be made public.

TORRES advised

that it is a nown fact that LEEXOSWALD was connected with

the fair Play for cuba and to not alert the American nation

to this as well as to the distortion of OSWALD's mind is to

be "lulled into a false

state of complacency."

advised that Americans have l1ttle if any

the diabolical ambitions of CASTRO or even

much understanding of communism. He related at length how

he personally attempted to alert the U. S. Embassy at Havana

about FIDEL CASTRO being a communist and how many Americans

in Cuba and the U. S. were first sympathetic toward CASTRO.

understand that it was BATISTA himself who started communism

1tself in Cuba.

It was BATISTA who allowed members of the

Communist Party to be sitting on his own cabinet. BATISTA

allowed communism to get its first stronghold in Cuba.

future date all that he knows about communism in Cuba.

He

described CARLOS PRIO SOCCARAS as a farce, a phony, who has

a following of people who do not know him to be la cardboard
