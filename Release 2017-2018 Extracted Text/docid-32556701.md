GUS ALEX, aka

AR

Reurletters 9-17 and 10-19-65.

Enclosed for your assistance in connection with the

question of Swiss authorities concerning the identity of Gus.

Alex, is a copy of a letterhead memorandum and two photographs

submitted by the Chicago Office containing information establish-

ing that Chicago hoodium Gus Alex is identical with the person

against whom the Swiss have issued

an entry ban.

One of the

photographs is of Gus Alex taken in Los Angeles in 1959 at the

time of his arrest there and the other is a photograph of Alex

and Suzanne Fueger taken in Switzerland in 1963.

In handling this matter with the Swiss, you should

continue precaution to assure the Bureau is not disclosed as

the source of any information concerning Alex in order to

preclude possibility of Bureau becoming involved later in court

or other legal proceeding in connection with this matter.

In addition to this material, a comparison is being

made of various specimens of the handwriting of Alex and you

will be advised of the results within the near future.

NOTE: Chicago hoodlum Gus Alex and his paramour visit Switzerland

each winter on vacation and Legat Bern has established appropriate

coverage in past years through Swiss authorities.

Following last

visit of Alex during past winter Swiss authorities issued a

prohibition against Alex's re-entry into this country on the basis

that he was an undesirable.

Alex has appealed and Swiss police

how advise they feel there is some question of identity as to

whether there are two persons

by the name of Gus Alex involved

and have requested further verification concerning this.
