MM 105-1598

Confidenttal

U. S. Border Patrol and U. S. Customs immediately

instituted physical surveillances at Polk City and North

Perry Airports.

Miami Office immediately contacted MM 639-S,

who is in touch with STURGIS, and MM 635-S, who is in

contact with DIAZ LANZ. Both informants advised infor-

mation received by Border Patrol highly unlikely in that

STURGIS and LANZ at the present time have no such plans.

On 7/28/63, Border Patrol stated nothing had

developed, apparently the information was false, no

Bellanca airplane ever appeared or was identified, this

might have been a publicity stunt by STURGIS and the

surveillance would be discontinued at midnight.

On 7/29/63, Border Patrol advised that as of

12:01 AM the surveillance was discontinued, the infor-

mation was obviously false and they were taking no

further action in this matter.

The above information is not being set' forth

in form suitable for dissemination inasmuch as it appears

that Border Patrol had received false information, Miami

Officedid not participate and Miami informants immediately

advised that the allegation was highly unlikely and no

such plans

existed.
