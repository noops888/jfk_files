$1,000 for the night action (trotters), and the remaining $2,000

see that things ran smoothly.

Informant stated he was present

when ANGELO SICA, One Of DOLASCO's men, turned in $3, 200 for

one day's take.

a tape recording machine setup which would operate like a

telephone-answering service for their bookmaking activities,

which would record everything by time so that they could not

get beat at or about post time.

NK T-3 stated that they were planning on having the

machine controlled by a person several houses away from the

machine who would monitor the action and erase same fromithe

tape in case of a raid.

pay up.
