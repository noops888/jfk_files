CG Tw43 related that STERN was objecting to the

fact that since he had purchased Century Distributing

corporation, CG T-43 had moved into 11 of his locations

where STERN

had record playing machines and CG T-43 had

persuaded the owners of the establishments to do business

with a new jukebod firm owned by the informant.

STERN. was

objecting because

at the time he purchased Century Distributing

Company these spots were part of the agreement.

STERN

attempted to intimidate informant into returning the spots

to him.

STERN stated that he had a "clout"' meaning influence

in Chicago that extended over into Lake County®

STERN

claimed that his "clout! was SAM MOONY GIANCANA.

CG T-43

professed ignorance as to the identity of GIANCANA and told

STERN that he did not care what type of a "clout" that STERN

had.

Informant. told STERN that he did not intend to move his

jukeboxes fron the ll establishments he had taken away from

STERN.

CG T-43 told STERN that he had approximately

$28,000 invested In Jukeboxes and could not afford to give

up any of the stops since these were his livellhood.

• Informant

continued that he had verbally ordered 30 jukebon machines,

1961 models,

froM A. M. I.

in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Informant pointed out that actually he has

only purchased

13 of the 1961 A.M.I. models, however, has verbally agreed

to attempt to

order

30 machines in order to get a special

price.

By way of background, cG T-43 pointed out that he

and his brother entered

they had learned that ANTHONY PINELLI had sold the Century

trip to California to see his uncle, TONY PINELLI and had

not returned until the night of September 9, 1961.

11 jukebox stops he had taken away from JOEL STERN and to

return the stops to STERN.

until informant returned the ll jukebox stops he had taken

an offer to buy informant out.

CG T-43 told GRUTTADURO that

he had too much money invested in the jukeboxes at the present

time and that it was his livellhood.

He also pointed out to

GRUTTADURO that It was GRUTTADURO who gave him the idea to

go into the jukebox business after informant learned that PINELLI

had sold out to STERN.

that GRUTTADURO had

previously Informed him that PINELLI

had obtained all of the money due him for the sale of the

company and informant entered the jukebox business assuming

that PINELLI had been pald in full and had ne further interest

in Century Distributing Company.
