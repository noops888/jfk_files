arrived at BALCASCEL's home at 2000 hours on the cor, and found FALCAPCEL about

BALCARCEL requested that LIPFEEL? tare him to & garage where his

car was being repaired, which LIREPEL-2 did. Since BALCARCEL's car was not ready,

BALCARCEL asked LIREBEL-2 to drive him to a meeting which he had scheduled for

2100 hours with his "Soviet contact."

Gote: BArCiRCEL had previously told

LIREBEL-2 that Valery KOSTIKOV was his contact in the Soviet

Entessy.) LIREBEL-2

and BAICARCEL drove to the

"Parque Escondido," also ¿nown as the

"Farque lindito, "

lorated on Insurgentes Sur between Gorez carlas ard Millet Streets.

LIREPEI-2

parked and BALCARCEl held his meeting with his "soriet contact"

standing on the

sidewalk of Gomez Farios Street bordering on the park. The reeting lasted for

2.

BALCARCRI, commented after re-joining LIREBEL-2 that his "Soviet contect"

had been very upset about a long distance telephone call which he had received

from a Guatemalan student.

The student kad asked io talk to the Soviet by true

name and asked his for some information on the Soriet national soccer team, which

1s scheduled to play some games in Guatemala.

The Soviet told BALCARCEL that he

had told the student that he could not provide any current infor ation on this

subject, and that the student should try to get tris information from El Salvador,

where the team was to plaj some games prior to their arrival in Piaterala..

BALCARCEL said that the Soviet was angry that this student had asked for him by

true name, and he speculated that the University Students Association (AEU) leader

who was recently in lexico (see Reference B) may have been indiscreet in giving

• his name out to unauthorized persons.

continued to ask questions about 201-810981's work,

to the point

where 201-810981 realized that more than a fila club for

As long as preia

c. LIRCCKLT-I:

1) LIROCKET-1 is net nonthly, tine and place arranged

at the previous meeting.

During those nectings

on his twice-weekly tenching cessions at the lIARSh Enbassy.

His regular &tudent has been the Subject of 201-022975, and he

has had occasional doalings with other wrinkolers, particularly

AESEASICK.

The ncelings with 201-029068 have not

particular interesü, and

ve had bech waiting impatiently for

the latter's replacchent to arrive, so that LIROCKET. would

have a better target to work on.

It was LIROCKET. who

came up with the first local conflination of the identity of

this roplaceuent (MEXICO CITY 1105, 2 August 1969).

with ALSCASICK have been concerned

with attempts by tho

director of the school where LIlCCKEll teaches to borrow

sociological tilns from the MHliSHl fila olfico.

It now appears, however, that LIROCKET-1 has

teached the end of the line.

For some tire he has been involved

in a rather messy divorce action, and in August LIROCKET-1

roported that his wife had denounced him to Mexican authorities

as an EVRoCk agent (a few months previously,

she had denounced

bin as an MHARSH agent.

LIKOCKET 1 was not inclined to tale

she presumably repeated her accusation.

and if one arrives) wanted to rehiro him.

He was told,

however, to check in regularly, and he was giveng'as usual,

LIROCHET-1 has not spoken

with 201-028975 since his wife's visit all dealings have been

through AEPOLYP, who has for sore time been the paymaster for

LIROCKET-1.

3)

even after the case officer,

without telling him that ve

of the visit, brought LIROCKET-l around to the conclusion that

she might have done this, he still does not think that she

spilled the beans to 201-023975.

(It 1s apparent that the

MHHARSHerS, whethor or not they belleve lirs. LIROCKET-l'S

story, have concluded that LIROCKET-I represents a security.

SOVIET REBASSY IN MEXICO HAS LARGE

STAFF WHICH DOES LITTLE WORK

by Carlos tontiel

Source:

La Prensa Libre (Free Press), 6 Hay 1969, San Jose,

Costa Rica

Mexico City - In a letter addressed to our editorial

department Peruvian. newsmen informed me that, being acquainted.

with my article "Ahora Peru" (low Perul, they asked that country's

chancellor, Edgardo Jarrin, whether the arrival of a Soviet trade

mission in Peru would be only the prelude to another more important

mission, that of Soviet diplomatic representation.

In that article I observed that members of the Soviet

embassy in Mexico City had predicted in that city's social

circles that in less than 2 weeks Peru would estaolish diplomatic:

relations with the Krenlin at the embassy level.

According to the letter, barely 3 days later the Lima daily

La Prensa confired with prominent play the report that I had made

in El Universal Grafico whose substance I had obtained thanks to

the indiscretion of Soviet diplomats included in the "cocktail

circuit" organized here among the ambassadors and trade representatives

of foreign countries.

1-

## Page 68

I recall that also in El Universal Grafico my colleague,

Alonso Fonseca G., published a note entitled "Alegres Diplomaticos"

,es,

(Tipsy Diplonats) recounting the entertaining story of the "binge

of Vladislav Korozovshkin and Valery Kostikov, attache and second

secretary respectivaly Of the Soviet embassy in l'exico. These

officials began their spree "between glasses of expensive sines

in the "red' district of liexico City but had to bring their

adventure to a close at Ciudad Victoria amidst the abuse they

hurled at lexico under the diplomatic immunity which they enjoyed."

Apparently, the Soviet diplomats not only have given up decent beha

but are also demonstrating their incompetence.

The Peruvian chancellor, Mercado, Jarrin, who announced the

arrival of the Soviet trade mission, answered the newsmen's question

with a laconic conment that "at the appropriate time you will learn

whether the government has decided to take that step" lof establish-

ing diplomatic relations with the USSR). Before the Lima government

"decides to take that step," we would like to reproduce these tho

paragraphs which the journalist Bernardo, Escalante published in an

ima article entitled "La Embajada Histcriosa" (The Mysterious Eabassy)

in the newspaper El Sol de lexico.

"The strange thing is that the Soviet embassy is onè af

those with the largest staff but with the least to do.. Tiose

branches that have contact with the public - consular section,

cultural section, tourist agency -- work only 4 hours a wees. Che

can count the number of Méxicans applying for a Russian visa on the

fingers of one hand. Trade between lexico and the USSR is practically

nil. The "cultural relations,' as everyone hows, consist simly.

## Page 69

In making propaganda "fron one place to another! inasnuch as

in the land of Brezhner and Kosygin they do not even have a

remote idea of nat lexico is like.

"What is this plethora of Soviet personnel used for

then in that embassy where not even a single lexican citizen is

employed, where the donestics themselves are Soviet, in that

huge mansion that could serve as a den of vampires? The mystery

deepens if one considers that the Mexican embassy staff in koscow

barely numbers six or seven employees whereas the USSR has more

than a hundred in Mexico. Why does the Soviet Union have such a

large erbassy staff in our country if it does what ours does in

Moscow?"

1.

On 1 April 1909 the Station received a memorandum tron

lOCAl INERGO concerning the latest meeting AKBURBLE had with bla

Boviet Case O111cerE®

This memorandum 1s lorwarded under separate

cover as Attachment #l.

The meeting took place in lexico City on

3 and 4 February

196y.

The Sovlet case otiicers were Aleksandr

Aleksandrovich NIKITIN (201-/8491%) and Valeriy Vladiairovich

KOSTIKOV (201305052).

2.

On & April 1909 we answered LNERGO's memorandum with commente

concerning NIKITIN's and KOSTIKOV's whereabouts on 3 and 4 February

1069, the possible meeting place on & February lYoy, and the carg

uned. Recent photographs of NIKITIN and KUSTIKOV were forwarded

to local LNERGO a1s0.

This Station memorandum 1s forwarded under

separate cover as Attachmont #2.

It is interesting to note that the 1969 Volkswagen with

toxico City plates 18% TW.

assigned to Stanislav Vasilyevica SYCHEV

(201-320963).was used, as the vehicle to drive AEBURBLE to the seeting

Bite on 4 February 1y0y. The use oi SYCHEV's vehicle, wnich 1a one

of two Soviet vehicles which du not have diplomatic license plates,

strengthens our suspicion that SYCHIV i8 & KGB ottIcer.

TIPSY DIPLOIA?S

This 1s the amusing story of a "spree" which began in

the trosty dawn of 12 December among tubbles of expensive

wines in the "red lipht" district of Nexico City and reached

Its conclusion very far off, at Ciudad Victoria. What are

involved are two Narxist-Leninists fron the Soviet Union who,

on breaking the chains of disgraceful tyranny weighing on

respecrable diplomats, "tanked up" in tourgeols bars, not in

order to cheer up and forget

some sorrowful episode or other

that gnawed at their hearts but rather to fire a broadside of

abuse and insults at Mexico and Mexicans under the pretext

'Chat when ore 19 "tipsy" everything thet he does is absolved.

The diplomats of the Russian embassy in Mexico, Valery

fostikov, second secretary, and Vladislav Koromovshirin, attache,

not only forgot anong hippies the socialist ethics in order to

Indulre In a "small drink anong those wo are in the limelight"

but, in the midst of a biz "binge" made possible by hateful

capiralist brandy and whiskey, tiey decided to accompany for.

eurincers of PEMEX (Petro eos Mexicanos; l'exican Petroleur) in

• an old autorobile to Ciudad Mante. On the way, after the

custorary excesses that alcoholic fumes provoke, the "wine"

drove the Hussians to the worst extremes of crudeness excioic

without.any of the "acadenic bearing" that the Frierdship

University of loscow notes as the najor assets acquired by the

prorressive men of Leninism. Accordingly, abuse rained on

the Mexicans.

The four PEMiX engineers, as any well-born sons would

have done, defended their country with firmness. Thereupon,

the Mussians suddenly became transformed into diplorat-gunmen;

brandishin, their weapons at the engineers. However, no jous:

because Russians are better at getting ready to handle remote

controlled spaceships directed at the moon than in the skillful

discharge of prosaic pistols, they found themselves disarmed 1-

short order by the Mexicans.

On reaching, Cludad Victoria the PEEX engineers handed

the Russian attaches and their guns over to the local authoritles.

Despite the unanimous desire of all those present to see the

Soviet represertatives get their comeupparce the latter, with

insulciar, arrogance, insisted that their diplomatic inunity be

respected.

Let us compare the aperersive stance of both Muscovites

with the Chirese governsent of leo Ise-tur? so insistent er

Forwarded herewith Is a characterization of Subject prepared by. Douglas

J. FEINGLASS. The SPR On Subject has been prepared and will be forwarded as

soon as typed.

2. It ls Interesting to no:e that LICOWL-l descrlbes KOSTIKOV as follows:

He Is a man who would do anything to anybody. He Is without morals, education

or manners. He uses foul language and has no respect for others. When

KOSTIKOV drinks at his (LICOWL-l's) establishment, with Sovler women present,

KOSTIKOV will run his hand over the legs of the wives of other Soviet employees,

whlle ther husbands are present, and thinkno:hing of it. According to LIOOWL-l,

the husbands say nothing when KOSTIKOV does this. (Comment: However, from

a recent LICOWL-l tape, li appears that Yurly AleksandrovIch ANDRIANOV,

GRU chauffeur, was complaining to Viktor Petrovich KALININ, administrative

employee, that his wife was running around with KOSTIKOV and he (ANDRIANOV)

was going to say something to KOSTIKOV - someday - but had no. said a word to

him as yet.)

Valerly VladimIrovIch KOSTIKOV

Valerky ViadimIrovich KOSTIKOV is approximately 35 years of age,

corpulent and paunchy, with a rouad somewhat fleshy face that sports a

5 o'clock shadow, and wears oversized tinted glasses In dark heavy frames,

which partlally obscure a palr of small, but plercing eyes. His heavy Jowla

thin lips, wide nosirils and dark halr add to an impression that his features

are more of a Semliic, or a Near-Eastern type than that of a Slav. A

shapeless dark sult coat, carelessly put over a whire shirt, with unbuttoned

collar, through which protrudes a suft of dark hair complete a photograph of

Valerly Viad mirovich KOSTIKOV, Attache ot the Consular Office and

Ident liled member of the KCB.

KOSTIKOV arrived In Mexico In December 196l and assumed his dutles

as an attache at the USSR Consulate at the Sovlet Embassy In Mexico City.

Owing to his extrovert nature and propensity for drinking, he soon acquired

several "buddles" of simllar background and with simllar tastes. Among

these Individuals, his closest associates have been, of silll are, the following:

Virally BorisovIch SHUBIN, Attache and Ident fled member of the KGB, who

left for the USSR la July 1964; Ivan Gavrilovich ALFERIYEV, Pravda Corres-

pondent and KGB officer, who left for the USSR in October 1964; and Oleg

MaksImovich NECHIPORENKO, VIce-Consul and Idearifled member of the KGB,

who is stull in Mexico, and who has accep:ed KOSTIKOV into his circle of

Intimate friends,

GEN I tO tiAMA 2551 l

However, l was mostly with SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV that KOSTIKOV

felt entirely at ease. Many a time KOSTIKOV would talk to elther one of

them en the phone and indulge in a friendly exchange of obscenities, where-

as he has never spoken to NECHIPORENKO In a like manner, even though.

KOSTIKOY has been a frequent guest at NECHIPORENKO's house. KOSTIKOV

developed an exceedingly close relat lonship with SHUBIN. They used to

travel together to varlous parte of the country and to spend time together

with thelr familles at the Casino de la Selva, a hoiel In Cuernavaca. But

it was ALFERIYEV's wife Roza, who became the prime target of KOSTIKOV*s

attentions. An emblttered acrimonious woman, Roza, who despised her

husband and had a flerce hatred for NECHIPORENKO, was transformed Into

a different human being when KOSTIKOV talked to her on the phone in his

best unctuous and Ingratiatloil manner. It is impossible ro say whether they

had sexual relatlons, but the obvlous and strong sexual overtones in Roza"s

volce led one to presume that she had more than just a friendly Interest in

KOSTIKOV, who on the other hand, was probably using Roza as a larger for

his amorous or Illicit asplrations. *

It seems that KOSTIKOV Is quite preoccupled with matters of sex and lI

given an opportunity would turn into a veritable profilgare. Apparently ble

## Page 153

its carefretirin

wlie Roza has a tolerant.atrirude towards KOSTIKOV's probable Incur-

sions into the domain of maltal Infidelity, strice, on one occasion,

when KOSTIKOY had been Invited to a supposed stag party at ALFERIYEV's

home, and Roza KOSTIKOV had phoned to caution KOSTIKOV aga lnst

drinking too mush, a woman answered the call and then called KOSTIKOV

hamed ignore

to the phone. When Roza talked to KOSTIKOV li sounded that she was more

peeved at the fact that she had not been Invited to the party rather than that.

other women were present there at the time.

"When KOSTIKOV started talking to his wlie on this particular call, he

already had had a few drinks and in disgulsed volce spoke to her In Spanish,

French and English, possibly to Impress those who were present. His

Spanish !s quite good and fluent, his French Is rather tolerable, but his

English Is somewhat stilted and of a school-room type. Possibly, he studled

these languages as the Moscow Institute of Languages.

This fluency in Spanish affords KOSTIKOV a great latirude for making

friends among Mexicans and his easy going earthy approach is presumably

of considerable help to him in developing contacis. Since his consular

dules are quite negligible, he can easily engage in this sort of activity.

In fact, this neglect of official duties promped a heated argument between

NECHIPORENKO and the visi ing Sovles correspondent Timir GAYDAR,

who declared tha: ostensibly the consular stat' does not preform any useful

function, but just loafs around. H's assertion has been confirmed In part

by the attitude of this particular group of Soviet Embassy employees, who

quite often seek somc diversion of a non-intellectual type. Thus, on one

occasion, when a group of Soviet touristhas a brlef stay In Mexio, one of

them - a woman, complained during a phone call to the Embassy that

KOSTIKOV and Leonld Vasilyevich NIKIFOROV, Intourls: representarive

In Mexico, had taken the group leaders to NIKIPOROV's apartment In

order to have a few drinks, leaving the rest of the tourlats without any

Information about their next move and letting them shift for themselves.

Since the departure of SHUBIN and ALFERIYEV, KOSTIKOV has startod

to "cultivate" NIKIFOROV, presumably as a potentlal drinking compantos,..

and has been talking to him on the phone a number of times recently in quie

a famillar tone of volce. It seems that NIKIFOROV, a younger man, Is

being Influenced by KOSTIKOV to a certain degree.

KOSTIKOY's family life does no: appear to be a siormy one; because bis

wife Roza A. sounds easy-going and friendly. She Is In charge of the Embassy"s

dining-room, Her co-workers treat her with a good-humored tolerance and

a slight contemp:. KOSTIKOV's daughter Svetlana, born in 1959, seems to

be an average child, who does not present any outstanding problems to her

parents.

---

## Page 155

To sum:arlze KOSTIKOV's character traits and abilitles: KOSTIKOV

Is well trusted to take trips around the country In the company of another

Sovlet Embassy employee on varlous matters of Importance and, on

occasions, he acts as an interpreter for visiting Soviet officials. His

known physical defect Is weak eyes.

Sometime ago KOSTIKOV called up

an eye-speciallst for an appointment, because his eyes were troubling him

and that is probably the reason for his wearing tInted glasses.. Somerlmes

Mexicans refer to him 38 the man with glasses. It Is quite possible that an

auto accident KOSTIKOV had In Vera_cruz may have been caused by his

somewhat defective vision and was not the result of carelessness. However,

when KOSTIKOV was excusing himseif for it, GARMASHEY, to whom

he spoke on the phone, told him dryly that li was about time KOSTIKOV

learned to drive.

Owing to this shortcoming of having weak eyes and his physical make

up, KOSTIKOV does not participate In varlous indoor or outdoor sporta as

much as do other members of the Soviet Embassy. In seems that billlarde

are about the most strenuous execise that he undertakes. However; it must

not be surmised that he is a weak Individual in a physical sense and will

probably give a good account of himself if a situation will demand It.

Mazy of his intimate collaborators call him "Kopchenyy" or "Smoked"

---

## Page 156

which in Russian slang may mean an indivldual with a dark skin, or may

refer to the fact of his wearing tinted glasses, or it may signify that he went

through a school of hard knoc ka

It Is guite certain that KOSTIKOY and ALFERIYEV belong to the same

group of former hooligans, who by dint of sheer disregárd for moral

standards forged ahead and became "somebodles".

KOSTIKOV seems to be quite unsrupulous, ready to perform any sort

of task set before him, not in a cold and methodical way, but with a cer-

ta in zest and bravado. It appears that he has no moral, religlous, or

any other type of scruples. He ls vulgar, untidy and lecherous, with a

penchant for using lewd and obscene expressions in conversation with

his "buddles", with whom be drinks quite a lot, circumstances permitting.

In addition, It must be noted that he is a shrewd and resourceful Individual

unqueat lonably loyal to the Communist system.
