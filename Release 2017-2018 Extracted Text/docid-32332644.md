but that she has suffered from extreme mental cruelty.

advised that the home purchased and fur-

nished by SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA for the couple in the

North Hills section of Pittsburgh, which is located on

Guenevere Drive, has been sold by

LA ROCCA, and that this

sale ostensibly included some of the furniture and fixtures

In the home in addition to the carpeting and drapes.

He

understands that the adopted son of LA ROCCA 1s endeavoring

to transfer his junior college credits to a bona fide four

year educational

institution, and has applied at such places

as the University of Miami, Duquesne university, the Univer

sity of Pittsburgh, and California State Teachers College

in California, Pa.

He has no idea what he wants to do in

ally belleves that the boy is not intelligent enough to..

satisfactorily pass his grades in this regara JFK Act 6 (4)

further advised that his daughter 1s

ment in the reception field so that she may be able to

further support her young son and the elder FESSLERS with

whom she plans to live.

He has gained the impression that she has been

completely brainwashed by the LA ROCCA family and that she

no longer has any respect for law enforcement authorities

and the FBI in particular.

He does not believe she would

furnish any information whatsoever concerning her relation-

ship with the adopted son of LA ROCCA or with any of the

members of the LA ROCCA family.

He pointed out that she

has been extremely evasive in answering questions that he

has asked her and he believes an interview by the FBI would

have a similar effect. He added

that the elder LA ROCCA

has given his blessing to the divorce and feels that 1t 1s

probably better for all concerned.

He understands that LA ROCCA has advised his

adopted

son to remarry as soon as he locates another girl

who 1s to his Ilking and that he will finance any obliga-

tions

brought about by his son's involvement with other

women:
