It would appear Miami has®

nee courses of action open at

1.

Advise the Federal Parole Board of subject's

travel out of state under a false name, which travel can

be attested to by FBI Agents, for purpose of having suo-

ject's parole revoked.

2.

Reinterview subject and confront him with

ROMERO is from Candelaria,

Pinar del Rio Province, Cuba, and

is married to HILDA,

shooting incident with United States Customs off the

Florida coast.

The incident occurred during the last of

a number of unauthorized

boat trips to Cuba by ROMERO over

the past few years.'

According to the source, ROMERO stated he

hoped to be paid by both the Cuban and United States

rovernments at the same time and to thus soive his

financial problems. &HM)

According to the source,

ROMERO stated he had

already discussed

this plan with JOSE BENITO CLARK SANCHEZ

and although he did not mention having talked with ADOLFO

BORGES, the source assumed he had also discussed details

of the plan with BORGES since they

are extremely close

friends and reside together. (* CarRa)

take him,

ROMERO,

order that he could obtain these documents and initiate

this plan.

Although the source agreed to do so, he sub

sequently left for Cuba within a few

days without ROMERO

to Miami in mid December, 1967.

During a

later contact

with ROMaNO, the source

explained to him

that he had not taken him

because ROMERO was on parole

The

conversation with one MANUEL CHAMISO, 435 Southwest 4th

recently worked, he had determined that ROVERO had made

two trips to New York City in November and December,

1967.

According to CHAMISO, ROMERO bad
