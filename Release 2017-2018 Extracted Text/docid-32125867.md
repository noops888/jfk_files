Memorandum Baumgardner to Sullivan

RE:

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES

KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

157-5

The source further advised that Robert Scoggins, Grand Dragon

for the state of South Carolina, had been notified by the Veterans

Administration that his disability pension has been reduced,

Shelton

feels that this was a retalatory neasure taken by the Committee and the

Veterans

Therefore, the Klan is

American Legion and the Disabled American

Veterans.

Shelton stated that when Raymond Anderson, the Grand Dragon

for the State of Tennessee, appears to testify before the Committee,

Shelton and members of the press would accompany Anderson to

Administration to inquire 11 Anderson's disability pension will alsterans

reduced. "

It is noted that Anderson is a Bureau informant, who while

serving in the Armed Forces during the Korean Conflict lost his left

arm.. This loss entitled him to a disability pension.

Observations:

Chairman Willis is being contacted by Assistant Director

DeLoach concerning the information furnished to him by Chalmers regarding

Oswald and to advise Willis that the information is not factual. It

appears that Shelton is circulating the story in order to possibly.

aiscredit Venable, who. he feels has furnished information to the

Committee concerning Shelton and Shelton's Klan organization. Although

Venable did testify in executive session, a review of the testimony

indicates that he furnished little or no information of value, and

The information regarding Shelton's proposed visit to the

Veterans Administration is known only to a limited number of individuals

including the source and Anderson, who is also a Bureau informant.

In

the event we advise the Veterans Administration of this matter, it could

possibly result in the loss of iwo valuable sources since the Veterans

Administration may reveal that they had advance knowledge of this visit.

It is not believed that any real harm will be caused by this action or

the part oi shelton and, therefore, it is felt that the Veterans

Administration should

not be advised.

We have previously advised the White House and the Attorney

General regarding Wiltis?

actions with regard to Sheriff Lowe.'

ACTION:

For information.
