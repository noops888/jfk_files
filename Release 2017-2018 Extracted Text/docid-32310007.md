Our Chicago Office has received information that

miri

Vito Marzullo, an Alderman in the city of, chicago, was

scheduled to replace Congressman Roland Libonatig who

leader casey callon into Alofaror with Chicago undervorla

Glancana

According to this information, Marzullo reportedly

has been able to convince Glancana he is more valuable as an

Alderman and he supposedly will sonin in that office and

another person will be designated to replace Libonati, who

continues in disfavor with Glancana.

The Chicago Office has also learned that John

D'Arco, former Alderman of the First Ward in Chicago, who

was deposed by Giancana in the last election, has been able

to re-establish himself in the good graces of Giancana and

will retain his position as Democratic Committeeman of the

First Vard. V
