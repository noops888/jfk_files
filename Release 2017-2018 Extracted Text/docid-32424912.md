MEMORANDUM FOR THE SPECIAL GROUP (AUGMENTED)

From: Brig. Gen. Lansdale SL

Subject: Policy Questions, Operation Mongoose

The Deparment or State nas no objection to the

As Operation Mongoose goes into the approved activities of Phase I,

a number of policy questions bave started to arise. Current problems,

needing resolution, are listed below. It is requested that the Special

Group (Augmented) provide guidance, as a matter of some urgency.

Use of U.S. military installations. CIA desires to train small

groups vi Cuban nationals on the U.S. Air Force Bombing Range, Avon

Park, Florida, immediately. Defense reports that the proposed area

is adequate for this training, but that such training of covert agents

who will be introduced ultimately into Cuba represents a security problem

and a departure from past security procedures, due to the fact that U.S.

Government sponsorship will be apparent to trainees. Capture and

interrogation of any of these covert agents could result in exposure

(in international news media) of U.S. official involvement in efforts to

unseat the present Communist Cuban regime. A policy determination

is needed as to whether or not agents to be infil

trated into Cuba should

be trained on U.S. Government installations.

There are other U.S. military installations and properties, in

the Southeastern U.S. and Caribbean areas, which CIA would like to use

for similar training and operational purposes in the future.

policy determination could cover all uses of identifiable U.S. Government

properties for training and deployment of Cuban nationals for covert

infiltration into Cuba.

logical that the number of requests will increase as the operation

proceeds. There is a need for clearly defining the limits of arming

guerrillas (for self-defense, for training, for purposes short of

open actions in revolt), to permit operational judgment to be used

by designated operations officers, in Phase I.

3. Use of U.S. military personnel and eguipment. CIA has

equested Defense assistance in air and sea capabilities, including

supplying equipment and supplying U.S. military crews to operate

the equipment. Included in these requests are 2 LSD's (or similar

ships) to lie off the coast in support of CIA maritime operations, with

U.S. Navy crews of 200-300 depending upon the missions, 3 USAF

cargo aircrait with "sheep-dipped" USAF crews for air re-supply,

2 amphibious aircraft with "sheep-dipped'' USAF crews, and 2 sub-

marines for black broadcast operations. (This is in addition to CIA

requests for 6 PT type boats, 3 Helio aircraft, 2 82-foot Coast

Guard cutters, and arms, communications equipment, etc.). Again,

where U.S. military personnel and equipment are involved in Phase

there is need for a policy determination which will permit operational

judgment to be used by designated

operations officers, as well as a

need for rules of engagement.
