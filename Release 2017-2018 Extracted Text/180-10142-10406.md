which had been carried out in Key West, Florida. The report

stated that Lopez's

counsin, Guillermo Serpa Rodriguez, told the

FBI

that Lopez came to the United Stated for the first time some

time after Castro first came to power. 27/ He stayed approximately

one year and then returned to Cuba. 28/ Rodriguez stated that

Lopez returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed

his family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

In Cuba. 29!

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito was

a member of the Cuban militia at that time. 30/ Another

brother, Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been

sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,

according to Rodriguez. 31/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez returned to the United

States in 1960 or 1961 because he was afraid he would be draited

into the Cuban militia if he remained

in Cuba. 32/

The FBI learned that Lopez married an American woman in Key

West in August, 1962. 33/ According to Lopez's wife, he worked

for a time with the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962 and at the Molina

and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was owned by cousins. 34/

She said that he also worked for a construction company in

Tampa in June, 1963. 35/

Lopez's wife told the FBI that Lopez began suffering from

recurrent attacks of epilepsy and had to be confined at Jackson

State Hospital in Key West in early 1963. 36/ She stated that

he was treated by doctors from Coral Gables and Key West for the

epilepsy. 37/ She stated that she did not believe he had a

history of epilepsy before coming to the United States. 38/

She believed his convulsions were brought on by nervous tension

and worry over his family in Cuba and may have been a reason

for his return to Cuba in 1963. 39/.

The wife said that in approximately November, 1963,

she received a letter from Lopez saying he had returned to

Cuba. 40/ The wife stated that she was surprised he had returned

but that he had mentioned he was going back to Cuba when he

left for Tampa in November, 1963. 41/

The wife gave her opinion

that he returned because of his close relationship with his

parents. 42/ The wife stated that she received another letter

from him later from Cuba. 43/ According to the letter, he was

working as an elevator operator in Havana. 44/ In that letter

Lopez said he had received some kind of financial assistance

for the trip from an organization in Tampa. 45/ According to the

wife,. Lopez did not have sufficient personal funds to pay the

expenses to Mexico and Cuba. 46/ She said that he had never had

contact with Cuban refugee organizations to her knowledge. 47/

Rodriguez told the FBI that Lopez left Key West

in late. 1963 to go to Tampa with the hope of being

able

to return to Cuba. 48/ Rodriguez said he believed Lopez wanted

to return to Cuba because he was afraid of being drafted into

the U.s. military. 49/ Rodriguez said Lopez was not involved

in any pro-Castro activity while living in Key west, but that

Lopez was "definitely" pro-Castro. 50/ Rodriguez recounted that

in one instance he and Lopez actually had a fist-fight over

Lopez's pro-Castro sympathies. 51/

In a report in March 1963, the FBI reported that Lopez

had attended a meeting of the Tampa Fair Play for Cuba Committee

on November 20, 1978. 52/ The report also stated that at a

meeting of the group on November 17, 1963, Lopez stated that he

had

been

refused travel back to Cuba. He said at that time

that he was

waiting for a phone call from Cuba to get word on

his departure to Cuba. 53/

According to that report in March, 1964, a member of the

Tampa FPCC stated that she called a friend in Cuba on December 8,

1963 and was told that Lopez had arrived safely. 54/ The member

had attempted to locate Lopez in Cuba through friends there becausé

Lopez had not delivered gifts to persons in Cuba from people

in Florida as he had promised to do. 55/ The member stated

also that the Tampa chapter of the FPCC had given Lopez

approximately $190 for the return trip to Cuba. 56/ The member

said that Lopez had gone to Cuba by way of Mexico because he did

not have a passport. 57/

The March 1964 FBI report listed Lopez's passport as

#310162, which had been issued in January, 1960, and his

Mexican tourist card as "M8-24553, issued November 20, 1963

in Tampa. 58/ It stated that Lopez entered Mexico by private

auto at Nuevo Laredo on November 23, 1963 and departed for

Havana

on November 27 as the only passenger on a Cubana flight,

carrying a Cuban courtesy visa. 59/

According to the FBI file, Lopez's mother, Esperanza

Rodriguez, was

born in Key West, Florida. 60/. The file

listed three cousins and four uncles who resided and worked in

the Key West area with their families. 61/

Lopez's FBI file contains a memo from the Tampa office

dated October 26, 1964 which states:

It is felt that information developed

regarding the subject is not sufficient

to merit consideration for the Security

Index: 62/

The only information transmitted by the FBI to the Warren

Commission on Lopez concerned a check at the Passport Office. 63/

The information the Bureau did send to the Commission a bout the

Tampa chapter of the FPCC did not include any information on

Lopez's activities. 64/ The CIA apparently did not provide

any information on Lopez to the warren Commission. As pointed

out in the Senate report, this omission is made more egregious

---

## Page 5

Cuban- Anerican. -page 11

by

the fact that sources had reported within a few days of

Lopez's departure for Havana and of the assassination that the

circumstances surrounding his travel seemed "suspicious" and .

that in March, 1964, while the Warren Commission was well

underway into its work into the investigation of the

assassination, Lopez had reportedly been involved in the

Kennedy assassination.

In the 1977 report of the Inspector General of the

CIA, the Agency attempted to refute several "inaccuracies"

in the Senate report regarding the reporting on Lopez's

travel. That is apparently the only follow-up by the

Agency on the lead after the Senate report appeared.

In the first place, the Inspector General's report

corrected the statement in the Senate report that sources

reported that Lopez appeared "suspicious" when he was

surveilled in Mexico. 65/ The IG report explained that the

internal CIA document of December 5, 1963 which characterized

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic

rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic

activity or final conclusions. " 66/

The report stated additionally that the March 19,

1964 cable from the

which recounted the

information on Lopez from the contact of the Mexican police

and claimed Lopez was involved in the assassination was

---

## Page 6

Cuban-American... page 12

MiDstas

incorrect on several points: Lopez's name was misspelled

"Lopes"; it stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when

the CIA repeated the FBI's conclusion that he had traveled

by auto; it gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport

number; it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was

issued

in Nuevo Laredo and not Tampa; and it reported that he

stayed at

the Cuban Embassy. 67/ Based on these inaccuracies,

the Inspector General concluded that "the source patently

was extensively misinformed." 68/ Based on that observation,

the Inspector General completely discounted the cable

by the Deputy Chief of Station in Mexico City on March 20,

1964 that the Mexican police source information "jibed"

with what had earlier been reported by the CIA's source. 69/

Presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the

Inspector General are meant to explain the

fact that the

CIA did not take more aggressive investigative steps to

ascertain whether there might have been some connection

between Lopez and the assassination.

In that regard, the

1977 Inspector General report explains that the Agency

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal

and had

carried the lead as far as it was able by

questioning a Cuban defector about Lopez. While the fact

: of the CIA's lack of access to further information about

---

## Page 7

Cuban-American.. • page 13

Lopez may well be the case, that fact does not explain either

the failure of the CIA to take more seriously the suspicions

of the sources, or most importantly, to report whatever

information it had to the Warren Commission.

In that

regard, the attempts of the Inspector General to denigrate

the value of the information provided on Lopez do not

diminish the apparent negligence of the Ayency in seriously

pursuing the information as it was received. The Agency is

not to be faulted for the strength of its intelligence

gathering, but rather for the judgment which kept that

intelligence from the governmental body, the warren

Commission, which was mandated to pass on the strength of

exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the FBI, there

appear to be well-explained reasons both for Lopez's

desire to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of a

local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in Florida

appear on their face to be innocent and nonpolitical and not

in any way

connected with the assassination. Despite the

suggestion by the Senate report of suspicion in the fact

that Oswald "may" have been in touch with that same FPCC

chapter,

no evidence

appears to suggest that Oswald

was

actually in touch with the Tampa FPCC, or that Lopez was

connected in any way with Oswald or Dallas.

---

## Page 8

Cuban-Anerican.. •page 14

Despite what is now known about Lopez, the Warren

Commission may well have wanted

to lay to rest

suspicions which would remain about Lopez, and satisfy

itself

that these circumstances

in no way indicate

foreign

involvement in the assassination. The CIA has contributed

to those suspicions by not airing the matter and explaining

circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister

appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the CIA

decided to forego passing information to the Warren Commission

out of a desire to not lay bare extremely sensitive sources

and methods of intelligence. The [LIFTRE pperation

certainly falls within that category

and as soon as the CIA

began receiving

information that ELFIRE las the source of

the

information about Lopez's travel, the cabies and

messages reflected the desire to not reveal that method.

It also seems plausible that the FBI likewise chose not to

divulge what it had learned about Lopez because in doing

so, it would have had

to reveal the sensitive CIA operation

which generated the initial information on Lopez's travel to Cuba

on November 27.

A chronology of the activities of the FBI and CIA

on this lead amplifies the information which was in the

possession & the two agencies.

CIA Investigation

The

first information on the travel of the Cuban-

American appeared on December 3, 1963. At that time the

Mexico City Station of the CIA sent a classified message

to CIA headquarters

that a source identified as LITEMPO/4 had

requested of the Mexico City Chief of Station at 1300 hours

on that date "urgent traces on U.S. citizen Gilberto P.

Lopez." 3/ The source said Lopez arrived in Mexico on

November 23 en route to Havana and that Lopez had

disappeared with no record of his trip to Havana. According

to the message, Lopez had a tourist card, carrying number

24553, which he obtained in Tampa on November 20, 1963 and

his passport number was 310162. The message stated that Lopez

•left Mexico for Havana on November 27 via Cubana (Airlines).

The classified message listed the cryptony lettRijas the

source

of information on Lopez's travel. It indicated the Mexico

City Station had no traces on him. 4/

In another classified message dated December 3, 1963 from

the Mexico City Station to CIA headquarters, the station

reported also that the FBI office in Mexico City had been

advised by Mexican authorities that Lopez entered Mexico on

November 27 at Nuevo Laredo. 5/

## Page 15

Cuban- American... page 3

In another classified message dated December 4, 1963

to the Mexico City Station from CIA headquarters, the Agency

reported that the State Department check on Lopez had produced nothin

yet because of the difficulty in tracing records using only

a name and passport number. 6/

The message contained this

paragraph:

we assume you have not tola [LITEMpo

that Lopez flew to Cuba on 27 November

because you do not want to blow the

LIFIRE operation. This problem is up

to you.

The LIFIRE operation referred to in the classified message

to the Mexico city station involved cooperation between the

CIA and

Mexican federal officials who participated in a

plan of photographing passengers of flights departing for Havana

and obtaining the passenger lists of the Cubana flights.

Mexican officials also had their own program to photograph the

passports of the passengers arriving from Havana. 8/

On December 5, 1963 the Mexico. City Station reported

that the ITEMPO/s source had stated that cilberto lopez had

crossed the Mexican border at Laredo, Texas on November

Lopez is shown wearing dark glasses and the background in

the photograph is dark and indistinguishable.

In a dispatch dated December 5, 1963 from the Chief of

photograph of Lopez were attached and the dispatch stated

that the photograph was taken on the night of November 27,

1963 at the Mexico City airport by Mexican authorities as

Lopez was

boarding a Cubana flight. 1l/ The dispatch gave

the

previously reported information of the numbers of Lopez's

passport and

tourist card and his entry

into

and departure from Mexico. The dispatch contained the

additional information that Lopez was listed as the only

passenger on Cubana flight #465 on November 27, 1963 to Havana;

the flight contained a crew of nine Cubans. It said he used

a U.S. passport and a Cuban courtesy visa. 12/ The dispatch

had the following message:

"Source states the timing and

circumstances surrounding subject's travel through mexico and

departure for Havana are suspicious. " 13/ The dispatch

said also that the source "urgently" requested all available

data on the individual.

CUBAN-AMERICAN (CONT.)

F.B.1. Investigation

In a report dated August 26, 1964, the F.B.I. docu-

mented the results of its investigation on Gilberto

Policarpo Lopez which had been carried out in Key West,

Florida. The report stated that Lopez's cousin, Guillermo

Serpa Rodriguez, told the F.B.I. that Lopez came to the

United States for the first time some time after Castro

first came to power. He stayed approximately one year

28/

and then returned to Cuba. Rodriguez stated that Lopez

returned to Cuba because he was homesick and missed his

family; he had parents and four brothers who still resided

in Cuba.

29

Rodriguez stated also that Lopez's brother Selito

301

was a member of the Cuban militia at that time. Another

brother,

Raimundo Policarpo Lopez, had reportedly been

sent to the Soviet Union to study by the Cuban government,

according to Rodriguez.

Rodriguez told the F.B.I. that Lopez returned to

the United States in 1960 or 196l because he was afraid he

would be drafted into the Cuban militia if he remained in

3Z

Cuba.

The F.B.I. learned that Lopez married an American

331

woman in Key West in August, 1962. According to Lopez's

wife, he worked for a time with the Pepsi Cola Co. in 1962

and at the Maina

Mona and Murgia Bakery in Key West, which was

34

owned by cousins.

She said that he also worked for a construction

company in Kasabase in June, 1963.35/

for the epilepsy. She stated that

she did not believe he had a history of epilepsy before comint

to the United States. She believed his convulsions were

brought on by nervous tension and worry over his family in

Cuba and may have been a reason for his return to Cubain 1963. 3V

organizations to her knowledge.

## Page 27

In the 1977 report of the Inspector General of the

C.I..., the Agency attempted to refute several "inaccuracies"

in the Senate report regarding the reporting on Lopez's

travel. That is apparently the only follow-up by the Agency

on the lead after the Senate report appeared.

In the first place,

the Inspector General's report

corrected the statement in the Senate report that sources

reported that Lopez appeared "suspicious" when he was

65%

surveilled in Mexico. The IG report explained that the

196>

internal C.I.A. document of December 5, which characterized

the man as suspicious was merely "cryptic and impressionistic

rather than constituting a tangible basis for dramatic

activity or final conclusions."

The report stated additionally that the March 19, 1964

cable from the

which recounted the information

on Lopez from the contact of the Mexican police and claimed

Lopez was involved in the assassination was incorrect on

several points: Lopez 's name was misspelled "Lopes"; it

stated that Lopez entered Mexico on foot when the C.I.A.

repeated the F.B.I.'s conclusion that he had traveled by

auto; it gave incorrect digits in Lopez's passport number;

it stated that the Mexican tourist visa was

issued in

Nuevo Laredo and not Tampa; and it reported that he

67/

stayed at the Cuban Embassy. Based on these inaccuracies,

the Inspec#or General concluded that "the source patently

was extensively misinformed." Based on that observation,

the Inspector General completely discounted the cable

by the Deputy Chief of Station in Mexico City on March 20,

1964 that the Mexican police source information "jibed"

with what had earlier been

reported by the C.I.A.'s source.

69/

Presumably the discrepancies pointed out by the

Inspector General are meant to explain the fact that the

C.I.A. did not take more aggressive investigative steps

to ascertain whether there might have been some connection

between Lopez and the assassination. In that regard the

1977 Inspecotr General report explains that the Agency

had no other means of investigating Lopez at his disposal

and had carried the lead as far as it was able by questioning

a Cuban defector about Lopez. While the fact of the C.I.A.'s

lack of access to further information about Lopez may well

be the case, that fact does not explain either the failure

of the C.I.A. to take more seriously the suspicions of the

sources,

dad most importantly, to report whatever information

it had to the Warren Commission. In that regard, the attempts

of the Inspector General to denigrate the value if the

information provided on Lopez dows not diminishthe-apparent

negligence of the Agency in seriously pursuing the information

as it was received. The Agency is not to be faulted for the

strength of its intelligence gathering, but rather for

the judgment which kept that intelligence from the governmental

body, the Warren Commission, which was mandated to pass

on the strength of exactly that kind of information.

From the information collected by the F.B.I., there

appears to be well-explained reasons both for Me desire

to return to Cuba and his solicitation of the help of

a local FPCC chapter for that travel. His contacts in

Florida appear on their face to be innocent and non-

political and not in any way connected with the assassi-

nation. Despite the suggestion by the Senate report of

suspicion in the fact that Oswald "may" have been in

touch with that same FPCC chapter, no evidence appears

to suggest that Oswald washin touch with the tampa Epce,

or that Lopez was connected in any way with Oswald or

Dallas.

Despite what is now known about Lopez, the Warren

Commission may well have wanted to lay to rest suspicions

which would

remain about Lopez, and satisfy itself that

these circumstances in no way indicate foreign involvement

in the assassination. The C.I.A. has contributed to those

suspicious by not airing the matter and explaining

circumstances which could shed light on otherwise sinister

appearing events.

The Committee has documented instances where the

decree

C.I.A.

doreed to forego passing information to the

• Warren

Commission out of a desire to not lay bare extremely

sensitive

sources and methods of intelligence. The LIFIRE

operation certainly falls within that category and as sson

as the C.I.A. began receiving information that

LIFIRE was

the source of the information about Lopez's travel, the

cables andressages reflected the desire to not reveal that

method. It also seems plausible that the F.B.I. likewise

chose not to divulge what it had learned about Lopez, because

## Page 30

in doing so it would have had to reveal the sensitive C.I.A.

operation which

generated the initial information on Lopez's

travel to Cuba on November 27.
