The following

report is submitted in accordance with CSFHB-F 52-6-1,

section V, paragraph 2 (a) (1).

A.

EXPLOITATION OF LEADS

LIFEAT/Soviet

LIFEAT has continued its

daily coverage of the home phones of two known Soviet Intelligence Officers.

This has enabled the interested

Station officer to monitor the daily activities

of these officers including clandestine contacts of one and lately the appar-

ent Involvement of the other in an affair with the wife of another Soviet

official stationed in Mexico.

(2) LIFEAT/Polish

During the final weeks of

BEKNAVE's stay in Mexico, LIFEAT provided continuing support to the attempted

approach to BEKNAVE. This support included periods of "live-monitoring" the

target lines to give early warning of BIKNAVE's exact departure plans as well

as the movements of BEKNAVE.

LI' EAT also initiated coverage of the Polish

Commercial Office In support of the interested Station officer's attempt to

gain more information on that installation and the personnel assigned thereto.

LIFEAT/Cuban

LIFEAT coverage of two

targets related to the AMSTRUT operation are of great interest to JMWAVE and

Headquarters.

Copies of the processed take from these lines are forwarded

weekly to these customers.

A recent and excellent roundup of AMSTRUT-8 done

by Headquarters

drew heavily on LIFEAT provided information. This roundup

was very well done and greatly appreciated by the Station.

During the re-

porting period nothing of interest was obtained from the coverage of the

home of a Cuban Conmercial Attache and it is planned to cut this coverage in

future if it remains unproductive.

LIFEAT/Exile

LIFEAT coverage of ESLARD-1

continues to be of interest to both the Station, Headquarters and other

Stations who are connected with ESLARD-I's activities.

cerning ESLARD-l's planned travel to both Central America and PBPRIME was

fully reported from this coverage.

LIFEAT information enables the Station

to provide timely physical surveillance of ESLARD-1 which should give intor-

mation of his exact departure date and mode of travel.

CONTINUATION OF

DISPATCH

SECRET,

HMMA-22029

LIFEAT continued coverage of Judith FERRETO Segura has provided

a number of leads for possible agent candidates to assess and develop this

Costa Rican Communist exile.

(5) LIFEAT/American Communist Group in Mexico (ACGM)

The information provided to the local ODENVY office from the coverage of

David DRUCKER and Charles SMALL (SMOLIKOFF) is most useful to that office

for covering American leftists and Communists who

these travellers continue on to Cuba. Their contacts with members of ACGM

are of special interest to ODENVY.

(6) LIFEAT/Miscellaneous

As noted in reference the

coverage of a former SMOTH agent is of interest to Headquarters, SMOTH and

the senior ODYOKE official in Mexico.

Recent information from this coverage

indicates that this individual is continuing in his literary efforis against

PBPRIME interest.

LIFEAT, at Headquarters request, has undertaken coverage of two

targets of ZRKNICK interest.

Although the coverage has not as yet been of

sufficient duration to judge the take definitively, one of these coverages

appears to have potential in providing information of interest.

B. PROCESSING OF TAKE

Processing workload of the LIFEAT processor/translator staff remains

heavy, but no backlog has developed.

With the recruitment of LIFEUD-28,

there will be a possible more equitable division of the work for the noted

If he is successful LIFEAT's access to

would be re-established.

Just prior to the reporting period, a telephone work crew iisconnect

the LIFEAT lines routing the Yugoslav Embassy tap lines to the basehouse.

This was done at a point one-half mile from the basehouse and en equal di

tance from the target Embassy, and at a point where the tap routing was

"jumped" from one telephone central's area to the central area serving th

basehouse.

It was assumed the telephone crew would be curious as to the

nature of these unusual connections.

Even if the crew had then attempted to checkout the routing it would have

been impossible.

No direct damage was done to LIFEAT as a result of this

discovery but it was agreed that if possible LIENVOY should assume the

Yugoslav coverage in the future.

If such will not prove feasible, a coo!

off period will ensue prior to LIFEAT attempting to re-establish the notr
