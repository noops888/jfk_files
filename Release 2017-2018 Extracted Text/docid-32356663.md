Send; (WHEELOCK), a good ClA asset, to help

in the interrogation. We find it incredible

that the Cubans would brief and pay an assassin

sible or even likely that he has been in and out

of the Cuban Embassy as a NIC agent trying to

infiltrate Cuba and has picked up the names and

faces there in so doing. All he has said about

OSWALD he could have gotten from the newspapers,

except for certain incorrect Items such as his

statement that OSWALD wore glasses.

flooded by fabrications on the OSWALD case from

Such fabrication are not usually done for money,

but out of sickly fancy and a desires to get

Me do not think It a remarkable coincidence e

that both, DORTICOS and ALVARADO talk about money
