The party will be registered in New York and

endeavor to bring about the election of Ramfis as President of the

Davidson

said he is a good friend of Balaguer's and is not too interested

in taking the job but would do so if the Bureau wanted him to.

Inspector Nischwitz advised Davidson that in the event the Bureau
