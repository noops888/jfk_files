SOURCE: A former high-level Cuban official who was once active in the revolutionary

movement and a confidant of Fidel Castro.

He has always been anti-Commnist and

18 now strongly anti-Castro. He continues to maintain contact with many Cuban

officials at all levels of government.

Source has provided a limited number of

reports which appear to have been accurate.

Headquarters Comment.

Source, who also has good contacts among leaders of the

Federacion Estudiantil Universitaria (FEU, University Student Federation), re-

ported on 2 February 1965 that Jaime Crombet and Lazaro Mora would be elected

president and vice-president, respectively, at the 8 - 10 February elections

of FaJ officers at the University of Havana.

The following comments by Source

are reported in light of his experience and insight in Cuban student matters.

Jaime Crombet, newly elected president of the Federacion Estudiantil Universi-

taria (PEJ) at the University of Havana, has little Influence over the Universit

students and will find it difficult to restrict them to the ideological frame-

work which the Cuban régime tries to impose.

Lazaro Mora, the new vice president,

although younger than Crombet, is a member of the student

"old guard." he worked

with Rolando Cubela Secades during the period when the latter was president of

the FEU, from late 1959 to 1951.

Mora still maintains close contact with Cubela,

who apparently plans to retain his influence at the University with tre students

through Mora and with the faculty through luis Soto, Vice-Rector of the Univer-

sity.

It is certain that Fidel Castro will not be able to control the students

through Crombet as he has done through his predecessor, Jose Rebella Alanso,

for the past two years.

The fact that the students no longer react spontaneously

will make Crombet's task a difficult one. Crombet may be able to attract members

Comunistas (UJC, Union of Communist Touths), of which he

has been president, but Mora is considered the leader of the anti-Commnist groups

at the University. A small Trotskyist group still exists, but it is insignificant.

Hendouarters Comment.

A Havana radio broadcast of 11 February 1965 announced

the results of the elections, naming, among others, Crombet, Mora, Iliana Valmana

as secretary of organization, and Francisco Dorticos as deputy secretary of

organization.
