Of ZIGMUND PSKOWSKI, also Known as "ZIGGIE"; JOSEPH SANTIEIIO,

also known as "STIXIE",

and EDWARD HUGHeS, all of whom

represent Local 560; ALBERT SCALETTI, owner of a trucking

concern in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey; ALBERT NARCHINI,

owner of Moon Carriers, Clifton, New Jersey, and himself.

He advised that JACOB FRIEDLAND, attorney for the

local, attends the board meetings and presides over disputes

arising over welfare rates, medical eligibility problems

and many operational procedures.

stated that although unable to prove his

suspicions at this time he believes that the funds assigned

co the Welfare Fund are being misappropriated by the

recipient of the monies before they are disbursed to insurance

companies, dentists, etc., or they are returned to the union

officials

in the form of

a kickback.

He

Offered the following reasons for his suspicions:

bORI

SCA/sTTi

" A. ASCALETTI and MARCHINI readily agreed to accept

the 33 cents, employee contribution rate, demanded by

PROVENZANO and PSKOWSKI even though it meant that a two cente

loss would eventually be incurred by every owner operator

within the sphere of the local.

explained that practically all trucking

company employees must now contribute 33 cents per hour,

eight hours " day, five days a week, to the Welfare Fund

for every member of Local 560, which the firm employs. He

stated that a large firm such

as his must therefore contribute

as much as $25,000.00 a year, or more into a fund which they

cannot audit to determine how the funds are spent.

stated that the irony of the rate increase

is. that as a member of the Trustee Board he continues to

refuse to pay the two cents rise in the rate and has not

been bombarded by strike threats by the union.

He stated that he did not know whether MARCHINI

or SCALETTI are paying the increasedrate, but doubts that

they are.

As a trustee of the Welfare Fund he signs

almost all of the Union Welfare chocks payable to the physicians,

dentist, and the union optician.

stated that he has signed checks for

as much as $12,000.00 payable to a dentist on the rolls of

the Welfare Fund for one month's services to 560 members

and their families.

He stated

that he possesses no conclusive

proof, but feels that theerorsitant fees charges by the

dentist must require them to kickback some per cent of the

fees to the officials responsible for their selection as :

participating dentist.

stated that he was nut attempting to be

factious when he stated that any dentist making $12,000.00

a month would be the richest man in the profession over a

period of one year.

C. He explained that under the present system

voted by and adopted by the local, the 33 cents an hour

Welfare Fund rate is broken down as follows:

Eleven cents goes to the Pension Fund, approximately

six cents to dental expenses, one cent for eye care, and the

remainder is allocated to the medical and hospital insurance

handled by the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company.

stated that he has from time to time

attempted to query MARVIN ZALK, Administrator of the Welfare

Fund, to learn the methods by which contributions from

employers a'e handled and reflected; whether bills from

dentists are checked for accuracy before checks are drawn for

payment and the general bookkeeping procedures for the funds.

stated that on every occasion ZALK has

He offered the booklet to SA LINKER for his perusal and

pointed out that page seven of the booklet reads as follows:

"with this authorization card (referring to the members of

telephone numbers of the participating dentists and the

dental plan office".

"Call the participating dentist you select for an

appointment.

You will get a prompt appointment and we

assure you that you will be treated with the utmost courtesy".

Upon completing the review of the booklet,

pointed out that to his knowledge no member of Local

560

as ever been furnished a list of participating dentists.

He stated that in order to prove his point he would call

Doctor LEO MARCUS

that he would pretext the call by indicating to MARCUS that

many of his employees have requested that a list of the

fund's participating dentists and their addresses be posted

at the terminal in order to save time, in selecting dentists

stated that on February 17, 1961, he, PSKOWSKI,

ZALK, and FRIEDLAND arrived at the Union Title Guaranty Company,

Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to close the note with U. S. Glass.

He said that he thought it unusual that shortly alter arriving

at the title company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ZALK and

FRIEDLAND left him alone while they had a lengthy secretive

discussion with officials of U. S. Glass in another area of the

Jamaica,

West Indies, contacted the union and informed them

that they were destrous of obtaining a $400,000.00 loan from

the union

for capital improvements, and understood that the

union was making available such funds for this purpose.

explained that SHINDLER stated that his firm needed such

capital due to the influx of foreign glass and that it had

become necessary for his firm to obtain more modern equipment

in order to compete against the foreign products.

explained that although he did not participate

in the negotiations for the loan at the outset, he finally

approved the note which required U. S. Glass to pay the sum

involved in the issuance of the note. He further related

that he did not know whether SHINDLER and/or YETMAN were in

any way affiliated with the behind-the-scenes operation of

union's officers had an interest in U. S. Glass.

for believing that PROVENZANO and FRIEDLAND had been enter-

KILGALLEN in which she commented favorably on YETIAN's hotel,

CASTELLITTO that BENDER said that he was to get work.

According

to NK T-2; after this incident, his friend was able to work

regularly and never had any further difficulties with CASTELLITTO.

On May 21, 1960, NK T-3 advised that PROVENZANO was

fiendly with and associated occasionally with JERRY CATENA and

FRANK ERICKSON and other well known racketeers.

JERRY CATENA attended the Apalachin meeting in

November, 1957.

FRANK ERICKSON is a well known New York gabling

figure.

In December, 1960, NK T-4 advised that TONY PRO was

a "very big man in New Jersey" and had tremendous strength and

control.

Informant said that by this statement, he meant that

PROVENZANO was connected with influencial racketeers in the state

of New. Jersy.

On February 7, 1961, NK T-4 advised tht he had heard

that someone was working against PROVENZANO in attepting to take

over the control of Local 560 from him.

Informant stated that

PROVENZANO got his job

as President of the local through JOE

"SOCKS" LANZA and other "prominant New York City mob figures".

who dominate New York.

On September 11, 1954, NK T-2 furnished the following

information:

He stated that the local is headed by JOHNNIE CONLIN,

who is also a Second Vice President of the International AFL

Teamsters Union. CONLIN is an older man in poorthealth and is

not expected to continue in control of the local much longer.

MICKEY SHERIDAN, a delegate of the local, has recently

been set up as president by CONLIN in an effort to establish a line

of succession.

However, the informant stated,

the two Italian

delegates, "Three-finger TONY" CASTELLITTO and TONY PROVENZANO,

have the strongest backing and are expected to take over the

entire local when CONLIN dies or resigns. He stated that if

CONLIN were a younger man and were not nationally prominant as

a Vice President in the International AfL, he would probably have

been disposed of forcefully by the Italian faction of the local

long before now. There is also some fear of reprisal from mob

elements backing CONLIN. He said that CONLIN originally obtained

leadership of the local through the backing of CHARLIE "THE JEW"'

YANOWSKI,

killed in a gang shooting in about 1948.

ANTHONY STROLLO, aka. Tony Bendex, a known New York

City hoodlum, is now believed to

be backing CONLIN, but STROLLO

is also pushing PROVENZANO and the Italian faction to succeed

CONLIN rather than the SHERIDAN group.

The informant states

of the Greenwich Village hoodlums lead by STROLLO, at that time.

He later worked for the STROLLO mob in New York, and STROLLO

originally had him placed in Local 560 through CONLIN as a

shop steward at H. P. Welsh Company PROVENZANO rose allegedly

in the local because of his backing and soon became a delegate.

The informant stated that a delegate's job is a

highly coveted one and is given as in the case of PROVENZANC

for services rendered to the mob rather than for friendship

alone and as a result PROVENZANO is under constant obligation

to STROLLO.

The informant recalled that at one time about a

year ago when he was unable to obtain employment through Local 560,

he went directly to STROLLO with whom he is acquainted and STROLLO

had him put to work immediately through PROVENZANO. After going

to work with STROLLO and PROVENZANO's backing, he was not

required to pay the monthly dues.

The delegate's position pays a salary of $275 monthly,

plus $75 weekly expenses, three months vacation, and a new

Cadillac furnished each year.

The delegates also make side

money out of the "gypsy running" racket. Under ordinary union

procedure, gypsy drivers from out of town are not allowed to

make local deliveries without a local union driver.

The companies

regularly employing gypsy drivers make arrangements through the

delegate handling the terminal to let the gypsy complate the

delivery for a set financial consideration.

The informant stated that the current financial status

of the local is carefully guarded by the official, and if any

member makes inquiry in that direction at a meeting, he would

be told to "shut up" or he would be forced out of work; and if

he becomes persistent, he is thrown bodily out of the meeting by

bouncers hired by the official.

His union book is subsequently

taken away fromhim. The informant stated there are several

sets of books kept by the union for various purposes and on

one occasion when he asked to see the books, he was shown a set

in which the latest entries were more that two years old. He

said the monthly dues were $4.00 per member and the local is reported

However, only 11,000

appear on their records. The recorded members can be distinguished

from those not recorded on the records only by examination of

their individual books. Such an examination would show that

at some of the larger terminals the last checkmen on the seniority

list will have the stamp space initialed by a delegate rather

than the stamp which should be placed there when their dues are

paid. Those books with the initials represent the non-recorded

members.

This situation exists because the local buys their

stamps from the International for about $160 each, and stamps

are purchased only for the number of members actually appearing

on the local's records. The dues from the members who do not

receive stamps are not

collected by the shop stewards at the

various terminals as is the usual procedure, but the dues

are collected by the delegates

personally.

The informant stated

that money received from these

members did not go into the

union's funds, as there was no record of their membership.

By letter dated July 9, 1959, the Criminal Division

of the U. S. Department of Justice furnished information indicating

that a Mr. WALTER DORN, President of the Dorn Pransportation

testified before the Senate Select Committee on Improper

Activitles in the Labor or Management Field indicating that he
