CHOU EN LAI MAY VISIT AFRICA IN DECEMBER

23 Nov 63

Priority

I have the honor to inform you of the following,

I learned from an unofficial source that Premier CHOU' EN

LAI will leave Peking on 13 or 14 December for an official visit

in Egypt whence he will visit other African countries, among

them Guinea, Ghana, Mali. [SG] not have confirmation of this

information

despite several demarches to Chinése Protocol:

This discretion seems due to the fact that the Chinese Govern-

ment is (B val using) every means to ávoid'a reoccurrence of

the assassination attempt to which President LIOU CHAO CHI was

subject when he visited Cambodia

I continue my investigations. I will keep you informed

as soon as possible.

As I finish this telegram, I learn of the assassination

of President KENNEDY. The British flag has been furled and

creped since this morning.

Very high consideration,
