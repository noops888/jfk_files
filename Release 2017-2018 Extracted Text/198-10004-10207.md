Office of the Secretary of Defense

SUBJECT:

Anti-Sabotage Operations in Latin America

The Interdepartmental Coordinating Committee of Cuban

Affairs (ICCOCA) has recently considered

to provide

guidance to US firms in Latin America confronted with

i Gastro-

communist inspired sabotage of their facilities and assets.

contracted for the preparation of a report which will consolidate the

experiences of several US firms in Latin America in combatting

sabotage. After consideration by the ICCOCA this report will be

furnished through our country teams in Latin America to local US

firms to assist them in instituting appropriate anti-sabotage programs.

I would be most grateful if vou would prepare a brief report

designed to supplement

which would include enumera-

tion of general guidelines which might be adopted by US firms in the

Latin American area in combatting sabotage. In particular, an

enumeration of known appropriate anti-sabotage devices available on

the commercial market together with the manufacturer's names would

be most helpful.

A member of my staff has discussed this project with Mr.

Phelps of your staff, who has indicated that DDR&E might be of assist-

ance in this matter based on a recent field trip to Venezuela where

problems peculiar to that area were studied at the requent of the US

Ambassador. It is also possible that commercial devices developed

for South Vietnam would have applicability in Latin America. Because

this project le designed for distribution to several Latin American

countries, it is requested that where possible guidelines be developed

which might have general application throughout Latin America, but

with emphasie on key subversive target areas. Present plans antici-

pate finalization of thie project by December 23, 1963.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

Meeting of Subcommittee on Subversion,

October 10, 1963 a

Outlined below is a summary of deliberations of subject sub-

committee during the meeting of October 10 at 1430 hours in Room

6273, New State. Agenda is at Tab A.

Agenda Item 1

The Final Subcommittee Report for the months of July and

August was circulated. The report has been circulated to points of

contact by separate correspondence.

Agenda Item 2

The Subcommittee discussed the SCCS letter which referred to

the recent trip of US students to Cuba. (Attached to enclosure l) It was

apparent to all that criticism of the US could be implied from this letter.

The Chairman stated he would provide the SCCS with the substance of

State's telegram 647, which outlines actions undertaken by the US

Government against the students.

Agenda Item 3

a. CIA. in coordination with

America which could be utilized br

tection of

The DOD representative

was requested to ascertain whether ARPA had available some commer.

b.. State will prepare a circular telegram to all Latin American

Ambassadors requesting that an immediate review of Country Team

Emergency and Evacuation Plans be conducted to insure that plans were

adequate to meet a stepped-up campaign of Castro-inspired sabotage.

Agenda Item 4

In lieu of a written report on the Honduran guerrilla problem,

the DOD representative proposed a firsthand report to the Subcommittee.

Colonel Walter Hutchins, who has recently returned from assignment as

US Military Attache to Honduras, presented a review of the subversion

situation in that country and then answered questions from the Subcom-

mittee.

The general thrust of Colonel Hutchins' remarks confirmed that

there has been considerable Castro subversive activity in Honduras. The

most serious inroads are achieved through communist radio and press

and communist educators. Colonel Hutchins commented that recent

guerrilla activity along the Nicaraguan border was probably limited to

groups totaling between 100 and 200 men. He emphasized that Cuban-

trained Honduran guerrillas are successfully transiting by air through

Grand Cayman Island and British Honduras with some transiting Havana

to Jamaica via Belgrade. In response to a query from a State representa

tive, Colonel Hutchins pointed out that he believed that both Honduran.

military and commercial interests were genuinely concerned with Castro

subversion and that some of their leaders were perfectly capable of

discerning the true nature of the communist threat to Honduras.

Agenda Item 5

The Chairman stated that the paper for training Latin Americans

in the United States (included in the "Krulak Report''*) was too broad in

scope for implementation by the Subcommittee and proposed that it be

rewritten under narrower parameters. In this regard, the Defense

representative was requested to review pages 4, 5 and 6 of the paper

on training contained in the report with the view toward bringing the

Defense portion up-to-date.

Miscellaneous

The Chairman stated that preparatory actions on the Isthmian

meeting at San Salvador tentatively scheduled for the second half of

November would be held in abeyance pending further developments in

the Honduran situation.

Department of State

Instructed Embassy Conakry to try to persuade

Guinean authorities to deny use of airport facilities by

flights on Habana-Moscow route.

These efforts achieved a

temporary withholding of permission for future regular flights,

at least until such time as the Soviets develop cheir own:

refueling facilities at Conakry.

b. Instructed Embassy Rio to approach Brazilian

authorities to express. our deep concern at the growing

frequency of Cuban non-scheduled flights to Brazil and request

their cooperation in curbing them. Also instructed our

Embassies in several Latin American countries to work with

in furnishing the names of nationals of those:

countries travelling on these flights to local authorities

and urging them: (1) to institute tighter controls on their:

own citizens travelling to Cuba, and (2) to express their

concern to the Brazilian Government over Cuban use of Brazil.

as a way station for transporting subversives.

c. As a result of representations made to the

British Government about Cuban flights to the Cayman Islands

carrying Latin American subversives, the British developed

an administrative scheme which will effectively prohibit the

Fuse of British Caribbean dependencies by Cubana as transit

points for passengers. The British intend to require transit

visas of passengers passing through their areas, and to

reject applications: for such visas except in certain special

cases. Persons not possessing visas would be prevented from

leaving their aircraft, or would be returned to their point

of origin.

d. Instructed Embassy Mexico City on August 29 to

inform the Mexican airline CMA that the United States is

opposed to a proposal that CMA operate charter flights to

result, stated that they had no intention of proceeding

further with this project.

e.

Instructed our missions in Curacao and the Hague:

to investigate a report that KLM was planning to renew

scheduled Curacao-Habana flights and to reiterate US

opposition to resumption of air service to Cuba. KLM assured

our Embassy that there is no plan to initiate service,

scheduled or non-scheduled, to Habana.

f. Instructed Embassy Ottawa to express our strong

objections to a proposal that a Cubana charter flight pick

up a second group of U.S. students in Montreal to fly them

to Cuba. The flight was not authorized.

g. Instructed Consulate Georgetown to investigate

Cubana approaches to secure flight facilities. Mission

reported on August 1 that the Governor bed no knowledge of

any talks between the B.G. Ministry of Communications. and

the Cuban Government regarding landing rights for Cubana

planes. The Governor indicated his intention to inquire

further and to keep us advised. London reported that neither

the Cuban nor the British Guiana Governments had raised the

issue of landing rights with H.M.G.

h. Urged the governments of Mexico, Canada, Jamaica

and the Netherlands to refuse to assist the Cuban Government

in its efforts to find a short route for return of the 58

American students who illegally travelled to Cuba. Also

informed Pan American Airways that we were opposed to a Cuban

request for a PAA charter flight to fly the students from

Habana to New York.

1. Instructed our missions at Port of Spain and

Barbados on several occasions to approach these governments

to express the concern of the U.S. at indications of Cuban

interest in the use of their aviation facilities.

Embassy Port of Spain discussed with the Foreign Secretary

of Trinidad various legal moves available that would enable

citing examples of such controls instituted by Mexico, Canada

and Ireland. He indicated receptiveness to the proposal that

the list of suggestions be made available to the aviation

officials concerned.

Santiago urged the government of Chile to refuse visas to

Cuban delegated to a preparatory meeting for the II Latin

American Youth Congress scheduled for August in the Chilean

capital. Inability of Cuban delegates to obtain Chilean

visas for this meeting is one of the contributing factors to

the Cuban sponsors announcing during August that the meeting

had been postponed.

k. Sent general instructions to our missions in

countries which participate in the International Union of

Architects asking them to urge the coop-cation of governmental

authorities in preventing or discouraging the attendance of

their nationals to the VII UIA Congress in Habana, September

29 - October 4, 1963. Followed this up with instructions to

individual posts to try where feasible to dissurde

architects from free world countries from serving on the jury

for the selection of a Bay of Pigs monument.

1. Urged Canadian Government to block a plan to

commence food parcel shipments to Cuba on a commercial basis

that would have required the establishment of scheduled

weekly charter flights by Canadian planes.

Department of Defense

a. Continued surveillance of the area surrounding

Cuba during the months of July and August at the same rate

and with the same emphasis as prior to 1 July 1963.

b. Continued to maintain U.S. Forces, primarily from

within the Atlantic Command, available to assist other

Caribbean governments in the interception of suspicious craft

in territorial waters, as might be requested. No such

requests were received from any other government during the

period covered by this report.

However, U.S. Forces did keep

track of the location of the Soviet merchant freighter

MITCHURINSK, which was suspected of carrying subversives and

arms from Cuba to British Guiana in mid-July. MITCHURINSK

was under U.S. surveillance from its departure from Habana

until United Kingdom forces assumed the task of keeping this

ship under surveillance upon its approach to Georgetown,

British Guiana. Subsequeatly, British police search of

Continued the installation of military communica

tions facilities in Latin America. Operational dates for

the multi-channel radio stations to be installed in Managua,

Nicaragua and Tegucigalpa, Honduras have been delared to 15

October 1963 and 15 December 1963, respectively because of

new engineering and contractual requirements. Negotiations

are continuing with Colombia and Ecuador for installation

of U.S. military radio facilities. Completion of a new

commercial trans-isthmian cable in the Panama Canal Zone

within the coming month is expected to improve military

communications within the United States and the Commander

in-Chief, U.S. Southern Command.

b. Continued the surveillance of Cuba by U.S.

the U.S. Coast Guard has taken appropriate implementing

actions:

e. During the period of this report, the SCIATT con-

ducted an on-the-job training course at Puntarenas, Costa

Rica.

Training was given to 13 members of the Guardia Civil

of Costa Rica who were either newly assigned to the 40 foot

Coast Guard utility boats (CGUBs) or were to be assigned as

replacement crew members...

f.

A quarterly inspection and evaluation of the CGUBs

provided other Central American countries was conducted

during the period 17 to 31 August by a mobile training team

(MTT) made up of SCIATT personnel.

of Latin American armies through the provision of Intelligence

Advisors. Presently there

are such advisors assigned to 14

Latin countries, emphasizing counterintelligence and counter-

subversion.
