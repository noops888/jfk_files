The new Hotel Ponce de Leon, Santurce, Puerto

H. R. WEISSBERG chain, 1s in reality a property of SANTO

TRAFFICANTE and JIMMY HOFFA.

The relationship of these

two with the Hotel

Ponce de

Leon, is verified by the fact

that the attorneys who defended FRANK CHAVEZ (Secretary-

Treasurer, Local 901, Teamsters Union, Santurce, Puerto

San Juan, for

Rico, who was recently tried in t.S,pwhich trial resulted

attempting to influence Grand Jurors,

in no verdict), have been the attorneyes for TRAFFICANTE

for many years. They are FRANK RAGANO and HENRY GONZALEZ,

of Tampa, Florida.: RAGANO has been TRAFFICANTE's attorney

since TRAFFICANTE dominated gambling and the hotel business
