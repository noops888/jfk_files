Information has previously been furnished to the

Bureau regarding the 10/24/68 arrest by the Milwaukee

Police Department of SAM DI MAGGIO (Bufile 92-7731), LON

member of the Milwaukee Family, and TONY PEPITO, local

Italian hoodlum and burglar, on local armed robbery charges.

Milwaukee informants have furnished information

that the $10,000 bonds for Di MAGGIO and PEPITO were

arranged by FRANK BALISTRIERI, boss of the Milwaukee ICN

Family.

The money allegedly came out of Chicago and was

handled locally by a Bondsman, HARRY MEIROFF.

On 12/4/68, MI 636-C advised HARRY MEIROFF was

first contacted for bond arrangements by JOHN TRILIEGI

Local hoodlum, and later by AUGIE MANIACI, Milwaukee LoN

member.

MEIROFE refused to write the bonds as Jerry

DI MAGGIO, brother of SAM DI MAGGIO, owed him $1,000 for

a previous bond he had skipped out on.

FRANK BALISTRIERI then contacted IRV WEINER,

nicago Bondsman, and close associate of FELIX "Milwauke‹

Phil" ALDERISIO,

known top Chicago hoodlum.

WEINER called

MATTHEW SILVERMAN, Atlas Bonding Agency, Newark, N.J.,

a known New Jersey hoodlum bondsman.
