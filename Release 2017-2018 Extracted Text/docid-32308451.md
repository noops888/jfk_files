CUESTA is a Cuban national who has previously

participated in CIA operations against the present govern-

ment of Cuba.

HEMMING and COLLINS are American citizens,

mercenaries and revolutionists, who are not members of

any Cuban revolutionary organization, but are in constant

contact with most Cuban anti-CASTRO organizations in Miami

MM 639-S states that LA BORDE claims to know

the location of a CIA warehouse in Key West, Florida,

where arms are stored, and LA BORDE plans to burglarize

this warehouse later.

Informant advised that on April 21,

1962, LA BORDE, HEMMING and COLLINS went to Key West,

on their return, claimed to have seen the CIA warehouse

said it was full of all types of arms and ammunition,

has only one night watchman, and they think they could

burglarize it without difficulty. However, they plan to

wait until after they blow up the ship. (le

u)

The informant advised that on April 24, 1962,

CUESTA visited the Pier 3 area of the Miami Municipal Docks

to familiarize himself with theaarea and devise a plan.

CUESTA has decided to use an aqualung to attach explosives

to the ship. He claims to be an experienced diver. (Sed U)

Informant said that LA BORDE previously worked

on a subchaser owned by ALBERTO FERNANDEZ, which was of

operational interest to CIA, but has had no action in the

recent past. LA BORDE claimed that MAX might overlook

LA BORDE's burglarization of the CIA warehouse containing

arms, if the destruction of the ship were successful you

On April 24, 1962, informant advised that

LA BORDE and COLLINS on that date visited the Pier. 3

area of the Miami Municipal Docks to familiarize them-

selves with the general area. LA BORDE planned tof leave

that evening for New Orleans to bring back to Miamila

yacht 75 feet long which he hoped would be donated to

MARUCA agreed, and advised that CIA would notify local

law enforcement officials.

Prior investigation concerning another matter

„reflected that the "SS WILLIAMS"' is owned by TEOFILO

Conourist Cuban millionaire residing in Miami, ho is anti-

Communist and anti-FIDEL CASTRO. 1 The ship is presently on

a time charter to Inter Island Shipping Company, of which

VICENTE RODRIGUEZ is President and Manager. The ship left

Miami on April 19, 1962 bound for Phillisborough, St. Martin,

Netherlands West Indies, and

is expected back in Miami on

approximately May 2, 1962. 68) (g) (U)

The ship was described as being 750 tons, 167 feet

long, and Panamanian registry. (a) # (U)

On April 25, 1962, MARUCA said that LA BORDE was

then in Key West, Florida, owed the Blue Lagoon nine

hundred dollars on his bill, and the owner was going to

sign a complaint and obtain a warrant for LA BORDE's arrest.

MARUCA also advised that CIA were advising the local police

authorities and the Coast Guard of LA BORDE's plans.

On April 30, 1962, MM 639-S advised that CUESTA

has three aqualungs, and planned to teach HEMMING and

COLLINS how to use this underwater diving equipment.

HEMMING, on April 27, 1962, talked to ALBERTO FERNANDEZ,

who said that LA BORDE was in Key West, and HEMMING should

discontinue his association with LA BORDE, because of his

being irresponsible. HEMMING said that he, COLLINS and

CUESTA were practicing with the aqualungs in the ocean at

Key Biscayne, Miami, Florida, on April 27, 1962, when

CUESTA said that they were being watched by a CIA agent

whom CUESTA had previously known.

Informant advised that HEMMING has a friend

who is a ship surveyor, who was able to ascertain that

the "SS WILLIAMS" would be back to Miami, Florida on

about May 11, 1962. (ALU)

The informant stated that CUESTA claims that

during the time he was working for CIA, ALBERTO FERNANDEZ

received a certain quantity of money from CIA, to be used

to buy food for the group operating a boat belonging to

Inasmuch as this matter concerning the blowing

up of the "SS WILLIAMS" is not within the jurisdiction

of the Bureau, and LA BORDE and CUESTA have previously

been of operational interest to CIA, and there is apparently

ill feeling between LA BORDE, CUESTA and CIA, the Miami

Office anticipates no active investigation in this matter

The Miami Office will follow this matter through

{contact with MM 639-SJand liaison with CIA, and keep the

Bureau advised.
