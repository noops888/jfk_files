Assistant United States Attorney JAMES E. KEATING, before know-

ing that DALE and PEARSON were in custody at the time of this violation,

stated that he felt that all three should be indicted so that there would

be no fear of the subjects fighting removal, as they would probably do,

if arrested on the basis of a Cormissioner's Warrant. At the time of the

indictment, there was a reasonable doubt existent concerning the identity

Of JOHN A PEARSON as a subject, but in view of the above, KEATING decided

that he should be indicted along with DATE and LONDOSe He said, however,

that in spite of the indictments, the Bureau should continue that phase

of their investigation to identify GRANT and PEARSON, the two "steerers"*

He cited also that there was need of additional evidence to convict LONDOS

and for that reason, extreme care should be taken to arrest LONDOS in his

residence for the purpose of securing items of evidence such as type-

writers, pens, pencils, credentials, clothinge address books, etc.

After the issuance of warrahts based on the above mentioned

indictments, KEATING advised that he did not consider the dismissal of

said indictments prudent since upon the eventual identification and

apprehension of GRANI and PEARSON, the "steerers", the indictments could

then be changed. He stated that if the indictments were dismissed now,

that against LONDOS would automatically be dropped also since he is

mentioned in both counts. He advised that the Bureau or the Department

would not be liable to legal damages from DALE or PEARSON as long as the

Bureau did not cause the arrest of either DALE or PEARSON who are now in

custody.
