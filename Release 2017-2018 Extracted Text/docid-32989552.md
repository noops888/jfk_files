COLMUNIST PARTY. USA

THE TIREAT

The Conmunist Party, USA (CPUSA) presents a greater

menace to the internal

security of our Nation today

that i

ever has since it was first founded in this country in 1919.

The dangerousness of the CPUSA cannot be evaluated except in

the light of its relationship to the intornational communist

conspiracy and lts ties to the Soviet Union. In this regard

It is well to note that the rate of progress achioved by ine

international conmunise disensive is unparallcied in history.

In the past 43 years, 1t has advanced sicadily and surely,

newer varying its eventual goal of dominating the world.

until today its capire extends from Bast Comany to Chira.

This empire is so vast and spraning that when night settles

on its westorn frontier, dawn already is breaking on its

eastern frontier.

This international conmunist conspiracy

controls one fourth of the land arug and approxinatoly one

third of the inhabitants of the carcha

The CPuSa is a vital link in thia world ido con-

spiracy. It utiliaes claborate security measures to conceal

its operations mile vigorously promoting front groups ag.well

as other concealed outlets in furtherance of its clandestine

pursulist is completely dominated

by and is subservient

¿o the Communist Party (CY) of the Sovie, Union.

This lack

has been made abundantly clear, on a number of occasions, some

of which are:

Our responsibilities in the intornal security field

are twofold:

(1) to colicot intelligence inforation and

disseminate li to appropriate Goverment agencies and (2) $0

obtain Icgally admissibic evidence for prosecution under

existing Federal statutes.

By Presidential Directive dated September 6, 1939.

the FBI was designaied as the civilian intelligence agency

primarily responsible for protcoting the Nation's internal

sEcurity.

Since that date, it nas been the FBI's duty to

investigate subversion within the United Staics and io

corrclate all information relating to Amcricas internal

security and disseminato tnose data to interested Federal

agencies. Federal laws within the FBI's jurisdiction ained

primarily at the CPUSA are the Smith Act of 1940, the Internal

Security Act of 1950 and the Communist Control Act of 1954.

FBI COUNCERARIACI :

The FBI's counterattack against the CPUSA 1s many -

pronged.

Sore of

our more effectiva prograys are: ponstration

of the Pariy ai all levels with security informants; use of

various tochniques to keep the Party ott blanco and disillusion

individual comunists concerning communist idcology; invostigation

of every known menber of the crush in order to decermine nether

gathering evidence to be used in prosecutions of communists and

BACKCROUND

Historically, the problem of the Ku Klux Klan in

the United States has existed since the days of Reconstruction

folloving the Civil War. The Invisible Empire is well know

for its terrorist, nightriding activities and has been respon-

sible since its inception for numerous racial atrocities

throughout the country.

The Klan reached its peak during the

1920s when it claimed millions of members and it becama almost

defunct during World War IIe,

In 1954, with the historic

Supreme Court decision regarding desegregation of public

schools, it became revitalized. In 1964, with the passage of

civil rights legislation by the Congress, the Klan recruited

thousands of persons who feared the rise of the Negro and

the threat to the "Southern way of life."

в...

The Klan has usually been located in the South al

though there have been attempts to organize it in the North;

Midwest, and far Test. The Klan attracts individuals in the

rusal areas who are poorly educated with limited incomes.

The Klan exploits the fears, hatred, and ignorance of people

who feel they are threatened by the Negro, the Jew, the

Catholic, and the immigrant.

PRESENT STATUS

Presently there are 14 Klan organizations under

investigation with a membership of approximately 14,000. The

largest of these groups, the United Klans of America, Inc.,

Knights of the Ku Klus Klan, With Headquarters In Tuscaloosa,

Alabama, has an estimated membershid of about 10,000.

in recent years has been the White Knights of the Ku Klux

FBI RESPONSIBILITY

This Bureau has a three-fold purpose in investigating

the Ku Klux Klan and

individuals associated with man orgeni-

zations.

First, tre investigate violations of Federal law

committed by the Klan with the view toward prosecution in

Federal court. Second, we conduct intelligence investigations

with the view toward infiltrating the Ku klur klan with infoi-

mants, neutralizing it as a terrorist organization, and deterzing

violence. Third, 'we provide the Departinent with the results

of our investigations for possible designation of Klan organi-

zations under Executive Order 10450.

MAJOR CASES

Murder of Three Civil Rights Workers

In June, 1904, three civil rights workers were

murdered in Neshoba County, Mississippi, setting off an inter-

sive MI investigation. In October, 1907, 7 of 18 defendanis

were

convicted in Fcderal court in Meridian, Mississippi, for

Klan informants were used as witnesses in this trial and

they unfolded a story of klan violence and terrorism rarely

Murder of Vernon Dahmer

In January, 1966, Vernon F. Dahmer, a leader of

the National Association for the Advancement of Colored.

People in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, died as a result of

wounds received when his home was burned and shot into by

the Ku Klux Klan.

Iwelve klansmen have been indicted by

the Federal Grand Jury and the case is presently pending in

United States District Court at Hattiesburg. FBI informants

were instrumental in determining in the early stages of the

iavestigation that

and the members of the

White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi were

responsible for Dahmer's death.

Murder of Lemuel Penn

In July, 1964, Lemuel Penn, an Army Reserve

Lieutenant Colonel and Negro educator From Washington, D. C.:

was killed by shotgun blasts near Colbert, Georgia. An exhaus-

tive investigation by this Bureau resulted in the arrest of

four members of the Ku Klux Klan. Informants also played a

major role in this case. In October, 1954, a Federal Grand

Jury returned an indictment charging six men, including the

four arrested for Penn's murder, with conspiracy to injure,

oppress, and threaten to intimidate Negro citizens in the free

exercise of their Constitutional rights. Two of the defendants

were convicted and four were acquitted..

dramatically emphasized our penetration of the Klan when it

was publically disclosed that Rowe was an FBI informant. The

three defendants were indicted by a Federal Grand Jury and

convicted in Federal court for conspiracy.

McComb, Mississippi, Bombings

From June through September, 1964, a series of

bombings occurred in McComb, Mississippi. After intensive

FBI investigation; nine members of the Ku Klux Klan were

arrested and charged with bombing homes and churches at McComb.

These nine klansmen entered pleas of guilty and nolo contendere

in local court: FBI informants were instrumehtal in uncovering

the plot and identifying suspects.

New Bern, North Carolina,' Bombings

In early 1965, a strategically placed informant

enabled us to identify klansmen responsible for. the bombing

of two automobiles and a Negro mortuary in New Bern,

North Carolina. This information was turned over to local

authorities. Three defendants were convicted in State court.

Bogalusa Injunction

In Bogalusa, Louisiana, during the height of the

racial disorder in that community in 1965, FBI investigation

led. to the obtaining of an injunction against the Anti-

comnunist Christian Association also known as Original Knights

of the Ku Klux Klan. This was a major deterrent to further

Klan violence in that community.

Virginia Klan, contain Its growth, and deter violence. Working

closely with local and state authorities ve were able to

disseminate Information on contemplated cross burnings.

Several arrests were made based on FBI Information furnished

to local police and in one situation, a klansman was sentenced

to three years in local court for burning crosses, a felony

under Virginia law. While conducting official investigations,

two Agents of this Bureau were assaulted by klansmen who vere

later convicted on charges of Assault of a Federal Officer and

Obstruction of Justice in Federal Court in Richmond, Virginia,

result, Governor Godwin pressed for more effective enforcement

of Virginia cross burning laws, and publically repudiated the

Ku Klux. Klan. Shortly after the Governor's public repudiation,

the Klan attempted. to retaliate and we learned of plans to

burn crosses in the City of Richmond in defiance of the

Governor. Tie furnished this data to local auchorities who

arrested five klansen, thus seriously dampening Klan enthu

INTERVIEIS OF KLANSMEN

One of the greatest attractions for klansmen is

the alleged cloal of secrecy which surrounds their Klan

membership. We have found that a program of seledtive inter-

views of klansmen, where they are made aware of our knowledge

of their Klan affiliation, has done much to cause disillusion-

ment of the members and disruption of the organization." In

some Instances klansmen volunteer information about the

organization and its activities.

These interviews also put

us in a position to assess eachumember with regard to his

potential as an informant. Although our Agents in conducting

their interlews are frequently met with hostility and threats

by militant klansmen, our Klan Interview program has been most

effective in deterring violence and developigs informants.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On December 7, 1967, an Informant of our Mobile

Division learned of Kan plans to burn crosses in Montgomery,

Alabama.

This Information vas disseminated to appropriate

local authorities in an effort to effect arrests during the
