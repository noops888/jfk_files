ReBucab 6/30/70.1

ReBucab indicates ALEX and wife departed

for

Germany and Switzerland from New York City on 6/13/70.

The Swiss Central Police Bureau was

promptly

alerted, but no information has been received from

them to

indicate

ALEX and wife came to Switzerland. This is con-

sidered highly unlikely, since Swiss have issued an entry

oan against him and put his name.on the list of persons to

be checked if they arrive in Switzerland.

His name would

therefore undoubtedly have been picked up at the airport

on arrival or in the hotel registry during his stay.
