in press references to Oswald's activities in

New Orleans

for the few days he was in that area prior to going to Russia

in September, 1959, when he was 19 years old. She also said

that Oswald knew Mary Louise Patterson, an American negress

presently attending the Friendship School in USSR) when he was

in Russia; hence we are furnishing copies of letterhead
