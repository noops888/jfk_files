MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, CI/R&A

SUBJECT:

lace Results on Persons Connected with

centro Wondiale Commerciale (World Trade

Center)

REFERENCE:

Our memorandum of 8 March 1967 on Italian

aspects of the Clay Shaw affair

The, S March 196% edition of Il Messaggero contain:

a story linking Clay Shaw, currently under Investigation l

New Orleans for his alleged part in a Kennedy assassination

conspiracy, with Centro Mondiale Commerciale (CMC) in Rome.

The story mentions four other persons as having been in-

volved with CMC:

Carlo D'AMELIO, a lawyer and' former

president of CMC; Ferenc NAGY,

former Prime Minister o1

Hungary; Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO, president of the Italo

American Hotel Corporation, who was managing director of

CMC; and George MANDEL, father of Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO

founder of CMC.

A copy of the Il Messaggero story was

forwarded with the reference memorandum.

Carlo appears to be identical with the

Rome lawyer Carlo

D'AMELTO, D'AMELIO listed on page 464 of the 1956

edition of Panorama Bibliografico degli Italiant D'Oggi.

According to

Panorama,

D'AMELIO was born in May of 1902 in

ts a lawyer

and publicist, represented the Savoy

(Italian royal family) heirs'

claims, and was King Farouk's

The Il Messaggero story noted above states that

D'AMELIO was the lawyer and administrator of the estates of

ex-royalty.

OIR-605,

15 January 1953, mentions a

fnu D'AMELIO, a lawyer for ex-King Farouk of Egypt.

5013, 28 April 1955, mentions a lawyer, Carlo AMELIO. This

document cannot be located and no further information

available.

It seems likely that all the above are identical

with the Carlo D'AMELIO of CMC.

NAGY,

Ferenc, the subject of 201-11893,

was a cleared

contact of the International Organizations

Division.

citizen, is the administrator of the World Trade

reportedly had contact with Hungarian Minister

Gyula SIMO (201-257724).

According to the 5 March 1967 story

in Il Messaggero,

Henrich MANDEL-MANTELLO's father is George

MANDEL.

ESBW-1819,

17 June 1954, states that George MONTELLO

(an alias of George HANDEL) had a son between the ages of

22 and 26 years old in 1954.

It is possible that this is

HANDEL-MANTELLO Of CHC.

MANDEL, George (aka MANTELLO, George Land other

allases/) is the

subject of 201-11728.

He is described as

an unsavory person who has been involved in shady deals

gince World War II. (See attachments.)

No pertinent identifiable information was found on

It le belleved that a considerable number of the

the validity of thie theor unlese the exhibitors who can talo

With rerard to the failure to obtain U.S. exhibitors

and the rostrictlons inosed unon than and other non-nonbers of

it would seen that thare has been a

lack of rosearch on the part

At thie stago, the venture soens highly apoculative from an

For, 11 the present exhibitoro failed to

renew their contraota for space at the end of the firat yoar, the

possibility of obtaining replacements and extending the space sold

would appear to be rather ranote.
