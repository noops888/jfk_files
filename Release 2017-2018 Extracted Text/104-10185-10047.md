During the discussion with QJWIN ou 2 May, he raised two problem.

in the event al postponement of bia move to Leopoldville:

When tele decided to move him. he would appreciate our timing

the move, ll possiblo, to enable hlo children to completo tbeir tben current achool

"ere in Luxembourg and to regiuter for the next following term la Leopoldrille.

Pleade inform kim ihat into desire will be giveo the fullest possible consideration.

b. Ií he la to remain in Enrope for any length o! time al our behest.

an he now will per reference, he should move out of Luxembourg with his family.

As he correctly pointed out, he has no cover job, now has a good salary, in known

to the Gendarmerie in Luxembourg, and he foresees difficulty in explaining his

nori, source of income, declaration of income lax, etc. We agree wth his view-

point, and this problem'is under active consideration. He cannot, of course. movelin

to Belgium with a sentence hanging over his head there. We are reluctant to move

him to France since he was once convicted there, and application for a residence

permit would renalt in a police files check with possible resultant and undesirablo

police attention is him. Farthermore, since a good deal of his search activity bas

taken place and wil take place in France, we far prefer to have him reside alae-

where. Switzerland might be a possibility (except for tight police cortrola), but

Germany appesta to be a better possibility. Il QJWIN does move to Leopoldrille

at the end o! this year, he can probably survive the period in Luxembourg. II the

move la to be postpmned beyond the end of this year - and we shall let you know as

moon as thie ly decided - he should be relocated. In the meantime, please discuss

the above ponsibilities with him and let us know his ideas on residence other than

Luxembourg and on possible cover for his residence elsewhere.

5.

Daring April 1961, QJWIN spotted nome candidates in France. Two

or threa of these will have to be revisited by him for a second look at them, and to

obtnin data which he was not able to obtain during the first contact without arousing

maspicion on their part.

We shall inform you and send pertinent details (by dispaich

11 time permits) when we desire that this be done. In the meantime, please inform

QJWIN that the need for his recontacting theme people without undue delay in recog-

nined and is on the front burner.

6.

With regard to funding QJWIN, it in requested that he be given his

pay, travel money, operational money, and any other neceasary funds in cash

LCFLUTTER examination his statement that money was deposited to the Baaque

Interationale for him by the American Embassy.

The deposit was putsuant to a

roquest from Leopoldville, but tae method of deposit was counter to the maximum
