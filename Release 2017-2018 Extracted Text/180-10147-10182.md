Purpose and Scope of Study

The Central Intelligence Agency's performance

in' its role of support to the Warren Comnission

has been a

source of controversy since the

inception of the Warren Commission.

Critics

have repeatedly charged that the CIA participated

in a conspiracy designed to suppress information

relevant to the assassination of President Kennedy

During 1976 the critic's

assertions were the subject of official inquiry

by the Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations (hereinafter SSC). The

SSC, in its

report regarding "The Investigation

of the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy:

Performance of the Intelligence Agencies"

reached

the following conclusion:

The Committee emphasizes that it has

not uncovered any evidence sufficient

to justify a conclusion that there was

a conspiracy to assassinate President

Kennedy.

The Committee has, however, developed

evidence which impeaches the process.

This Committee has sought to examine in

greater detail the general findings of the SSC.

The Committee has particularly focused its attention

on the specific issue of whether the CIA or any

employee or former employee of the CIA misinformed,

or withheld information relevant to the assassina-

tion of President Kennedy from the Warren

Commission. In addition, the Committee has

attempted to determine whether, if the Warren

The Committee has sought to examine the

and disciplined manner.

In order to accomplish

this goal the Committee has utilized a 1977

and submitted special analyses and reports."

the Committee agrees with the 77 IGR wherein

it is stated that "This compiliation (of

CIA generated material) is appropriate to

consideration of the extent of the CIA effort.

In examining the Agency's comprehensive

listing of CIA generated material referenced above,

the Committee has paralled its review to the

structure given to these materialsby the 77 IGR.

In this regard the 77 IGR details four inter-

related compilations of Kennedy assassination

material. These four compilations are:

to the Intelligence Community (Formal

I. Organization of CIA Investigation

of President Kennedy's Assassination

In his Executive Session testimony before the Select

Committee, Richard Helms, the CIA's Deputy Director for

Plans during 1963, described the CIA's role in the

investigation of President Kennedy's assassination as

follows:

This crime was committed on United

States soil. Therefore, as far as the

Federal government was concerned, the pri-

mary investigating agency would have been

the Federal Bureau of Investigation without

any question. The role of the CIA would

have been entirely supportive in the sense

Of what material we are (sic) able to

acquire outside the limits of the United

States with reference to the investigation.

had no investigative role inside the United

States at all. So when I used here the

word "supportive," I meant that in the

literal sense of the term. We are (sic)

trying to support the FBI and support the

Warren Commission and be responsive to

their requests, but we were not initiating

any investigations of our own or, to my

recollection, were we ever asked to.

(Executive Session Testimony of Richard

Helms, 8/9/78, pp. 17-18.).

On November 23, 1963. Helms called a meeting of senior-

level CIA officials to outline the Agency's investiga-

tive responsibility vis a vis the assassination. (sSC,

Book V, p. 25.) At that time, Helms placed John Scelso,

Branch Chief for CIA operations in Mexico, Central

America, and

In charge of the Agency's initiat

investigative efforts. (HSCA Class. Deposition of John

Scelso testified before the Select Committee,

that he was given charge of the Agency's investigation

on the basis of two considerations: 1)' his prior

experience in conducting major CIA security investi-

gations and 2) the observance of Oswald by CIA

surveillance in Mexico, (Scelso's operational concern)

less than two months prior to the assassination. (SSC

Book V, P. 25, HSCA Class. Deposition of John Scelso,

5/16/70, pp. 111-112.; Scelso also noted that

during the course of his investigative efforts, Helms

did not pressure him to adopt specific investigative

theories nor reach conclusions within a set period of

time; Executive Session Testimony of Richard Helms •

119/78, pp. 9-10)*

C°

Raymond Rocca, Chief of Research and Analysis for

CIA's Counterintelligence Staff characterized Scelso's

responsibility not as a mandate to investigate but

rather to "coordinate traffic (code facilitation,

telegram or telegraphic consideration) for working

with the DDP with respect to what was being done over

the whole world..."

(HSCA Classified Deposition of

R. Rocca, 7.17/78, p. 9.)

Rocca referred to this

phase of CIA activity as

the GPFLOOR phase. (Ibid.)

Scelso described in detail to the Committee the

manner in which he conducted the Agency's investiga-

tion:

•practically my whole Branch participated

in the thing. We dropped almost everything

else and I put a lot of my officers to work

in tracing names, analyzing files.

We were flooded with cable traffic, with

reports, suggestions, allegations from all

over the world, and these things had to be

checked out. We were checking out just dozens

and dozens of people all the time. (HSCA Classified

*. During the course of the Agency's invetigation, Liaison

with the FBI was handled for the CIA by Birch O'Neal

(Ibid. p. 80.). At the time of the assassination Mr. O'Neal,

a former FBI agent, was Chief of the Special Investigations

Group of the CIA's Counterintelligence Staff. (ESCA Classified

Scelso stated during his testimony that CIA

field stations worldwide were alerted to the Agency's

investigation "and the key stations were receiving

tips on the case, most of which were phony. We did not

send out instructions saying everybody participate in

the investigation." (Ibid. p. 133.) It was his

designated the central point for collection of assassination-

involved in investigatory activities related to President

Kennedy's assassination. (Ibia.)

ON 101/3/63

During the latter half of December, Scelso

issued a summary report which described Oswald's

activities in Mexico City from September 26, 1963 -

October 3, 1963. Scelso characterized the summary report

as incomplete by comparison to assassination-related

information then available to the FBI but not provided

to CIA until late Dec. 1963. (Ibid: p. 114-115.) (CIA

Document Report by John Scelso to C/CI, 34 Dec. 63.)*

Following issuance of this report, Helms shifted

responsibility for the CIA's investigation of President

Kennedy's assassination to the Counterintelligence

Staff: (HSCA Classified Deposition of John Scelso,

Helms' reasoning was expanded upon by Raymond

who testified before the Committee that the

shift in responsibility described by Helms was caused

in part by the establishment of the Warren Commission.

(ESCA Classified Deposition of Raymond Rocca, pp. 12-13.)

Rocca added:

to this Cormittee that the Agency's efforts to

gather and coordinate information related to

the assassination underwent a metamorphic

transition. Initially, Angleton noted, the

Director, Deputy Director, Division Chiefs and

Case Officers approached Warren Commission

reguirements in a piecemeal fashion. However,

Angleton testified the Agency was eventually

able

to focus its resources to avoid duplication

of effort and provide a system for the central

referencing of assassination related information

A. Opinions of Warren Commission and CIA Representatives

Regarding Warren Commission-CIA Relationship

The Committee has contacted both representatives of

the Warren Commission staff and those representatives of

the CIA who played significant roles in providing CIA-

generated information to the warren Commission. The

general consensus of these representatives is that the

Warren Commission and the CIA enjoyed a successful

working relationship during the course of the Commission's

investigation.

(HSCA Class. Depo. of R. Rocca 7/17/78,

p. 18)

(See also Exec. Sess. Test. of Richard Helms,

8/9/78, p. 24.) William Coleman, a senior staff counsel

for the Warren Commission who worked closely with Warren

Commission staff counsel W. David Slawson on matters

which utilized the CIA's resources, characterized

the CIA representatives with whom he dealt as

highly competent, cooperative, and intelligent.

(See ESCA staff interview of William Coleman,

8/2/78.) Mr. Slawson expressed

a similar opinion

regarding the Agency's cooperation and quality

(Ibid. p. 24.). Mr. Rocca concluded that on this basis:

"the CIA was to turn over and to develop any information

bearing on the assassination that could be of assistance

to the warren Commission." (Ibid., p. 26.)

A different view of the CIA's role regarding the

supply of CIA's information to the Warren Commission was

propounded by Richard Helms. Mr. Helms, who served as

the CIA's Deputy Director for Plans during the Warren

Commission investigation, was directly responsible for the

CIA's investigation of President Kennedy's assassination and the

as tablishment of ClA policy visa ris the Warren Commission.

(Ibid., p. 23.)

He testified to the Committee that the

CIA made every effort to be as responsive as

possible to

Warren Commission reguests. (Exec. Sess. Text. of Richard

Helms;

8/9/78, p. 10.) Mr. Helms added further testimony

regarding the manner in which the CIA provided its infor-

mation to the Warren Commission. He stated:

An inquiry would come over (from the Warren Com

mission).

We would attempt to respond to it.

But these inquiries came in individual bits and

pieces or as individual items...Each individual

item that came along we took care of as best we

could. (Ibid., pp. 10-11.)

However, it was Mr. Helms' recollection that the CIA

provided information to the Warren Commission primarily

oath he supported this proposition:

Mr.

Goldsmith :

In summary, is it your position that

the Agency gave the Warren Commission

information only in response to speci-

fic requests by the Warren Commission?

ME. Helms:

That is correct.

бр

I want to modify that by saying that

memory is fallable. There may have been

times or circumstances under which some-

thing different might have occured, but

my recollection is that we were attempting

to be-responsive and supportive to the

FBI and the Warren Commission. When

they asked for something we gave it to

• them.

As far as our volunteering information

is concerned, I have no recollection of

whether we volunteered it or not.

(Ibid., p. 34.)

Mr. Helms' characterization of fulfilling Warren

Commission requests on a caselbasis rather than uniformly

volunteering relevant information to the Warren Commission

stands in direct opposition to J. Lee Rankin's

perception

of the CIA's investigative responsibility. : MI. Rankin was

asked by Committee Counsel whether he worked under the

impression that the Agency's responsibility was simply to

respond to questions that were addressed to CIA by the

Warren Connission. In response, Mr. Rankin testified as

follows:

be called upon to provide additional information

employed to enable CIA to work cooperatively

with the Commission in a manner which would

Among the policies articulated were two which

Helms claimed would enable the Agency to control

Telephone Taps

Mr. Helms offered testimony regarding the CIA's

reticence to inform the warren Commission, at least

during, the initial stage of the Commission's work,

of the CIA's telephonic and photo surveillance

operations in Mexico City.

The reason for the

sensitivity of these

telephone taps and surveillance was not

if this had become public knowledge,

it would have caused[very bad feelings

and that was the reason.

(Exec. Sess.

The CIA's unwillingness to inform the Warren

Commission in the early stages of its investigation

of the above-described surveillance operations is

a source of concern to this Committee..

It is

indicative of an Agency policy designed

Rankin inquired in the February 10, 1964 letter

These comments indicate that Slawson placed

Moreover, there is no indication that Slawson had

been provided the Duran telephonic intercept tran-

scripts. In fact, by virtue of Slawson's comments

concerning the Mexican police report, it would

appear that the Warren Commission, as of March 25,

had been provided little substantive information

pertaining to Silvia Duran.

As Slawson reveals;

the Commission had been forced to rely upon the two

The Committee's belief that Slawson had

further supported by reference to his

memorandum

of March 27, 1964 (CD 692) wherein he states his

conclusion that Oswald had visited the Cuban

again

conclusion, he wrote, was based upon an analysis of

Silvia Duran's testimony before the Mexican police.

This memorandum bears no indication that he had

reviewed any of the Duran transcripts. Furthermore,

had Slawson been given access to these transcripts,

certainly their substance would have been incorporated

into his analysis and accordingly noted for this

His analysis would have reflected the fact

J. Lee Rankin March 16, 1964, JFK DOC. # 3872, Slawson

Memorandum, March 12, 1964)

The record indicates that the Commission at

the March 12 meeting pressed for access to the

Secret Service materials.

Rankin wrote to Helms

on March 16 that it was his understanding that the

CIA would supply the Commission with a paraphrase of

each report or communication pertaining to the Secret

Service materials "with all indications of your

confidential communications techniques and confidential

sources deleted..

You will also afford members of

our staff working in this area an opportunity to

review the actual file so that they may give assurance

that the paraphrases are complete." (Letter of J. Lee

Rankin, March 16, 1964, paragraph 2, JFK DOC. No. 3872)°

Rankin further indicated that the same

procedure was to be followed regarding any material

in the possession of the CIA prior to November 22,

The following day, as agreed by Warren Commission

he reviewed Oswald's file with Raymond Rocca.

Stern

Luisa Calderon

Approximately five hours after President

Kennedy's assassination a Cuban government employee

in Mexico City named "Luisa" received a telephone

call from an unidentified man speaking Spanish.

( CIA DOC. FOIA

MEXI 7105, 11/27/63, 173-615, attachment)

This call had been intercepted and recorded by the

CIA's Mexico City Station as the result of its

LINVOY (tel. tap) operation. ](Ibia.) The Mexico

City Station,as subsequently reported to CIA

headquarters, identified the Luisa of the conversa-

tion as Luisa Calderon, who was then employed in

the Commercial Attache's office at the Cuban Consu-

late. (Ibid.)

During the course of the conversation, the

unidentified caller asked Luisa if she had heard

(of the assassination)

the latest news.: Luisa replied in a joking tone:

"Yes, of course, I knew almost before Kenneay.",

"President of one of the Committees of the Fair

Play for Cuba." Luisa replied that she also knew

this. Luisa inquired whether the person being

held for the killing was a "gringo." The unidenti-

fied caller replied, "yes." Luisa told her caller

that she had learned nothing else about the assassina-

tion and that she had learned about the assassination

only a little while ago. The unidentified caller

commented:

We think that if it had been or had

possibility that a sort of civil

Standing by itself, Luisa Calderon's cryptic

comments do not merit serious attention. Her words

may indeed indicate foreknowledge of the assassina-

tion but may equally be interpreted without such a

sinister implication. Nevertheless, the Committee

has determined that Luisa Calderon's case

should

have merited

serious attention in the months following

the assassination.

In connection with the assassination, Luisa

Calderon's name first surfaced on November 27, 1964

in a cable sent by then Ambassador. Mann to the State

Department (CIA Doc. DIR 85573, 11/27/63) •

In that cable Mann stated:

.. •Washington should urgently consider

feasibility of requesting Mexican authorities

to arrest for interrogation:

Eusebio Azcue,

Luisa Calderon and Alfredo Mirabal.

The two

men are Cuban national and Cuban consular

officers. Luisa Calderon is a secretary

*Regarding the issue of whether Calderon's comments

During the Rockefeller Commission inquiry,

Calderon's conversation was identified

as a possible item of information from

the[Agency' s ]Cuban and Soviet| telephone

intercepts that might suggest foreknowledge

of a plot to assassinate the American Presi-

dent. This involves a faulty translation of an

answer Calderon gave to her caller. In answer

to the latter's question as to whether she

had heard the latest news, Calderon said:

"Si, claro, me entere casiantes que Kennedy."

The verb entere is mistranslated. Me entere

past tense) should be translated as

Calderon was saying she heard about the shooting

of Kennedy almost at the time the event took

place..•

Calderon conversation, p.l).

The Committee fundamentally disputes the

narrow interpretation of Calderon's comments

assigned by the Agency. It is the Committee's

position that translation of Me Entere as

either "I found out" or "I learned about"

does not foreclose interpretation of Calderor®s

According to CIA files, Calderon made

reservations

to return to Havana on Cubana Airlines on

December I1, 1963, less than four weeks after the

assassination. (CIA Doc. CSCI-316/01783-65, 4/26/63)

Calderon, Azcue and Mirabal were not arrested

nor detained for questioning by the Mexican federal

police.

However, Silvia Duran, a friend and associate

of Calderon's and the one person believed to have.

knowledge of the Oswald case. (Ibid, attach. 5)

Langosch paraphrased ANMUG's knowledge of Calderon

as follows:

I thought that Luisa Calderon might have:

had contact with Oswald because I learned

about 17 March 1964, shortly before I made

a trip to Mexico, that she had been

involved with an American in Mexico.

The

information to which I refer was told to

me by a DGI case officer...

I had commented

to (him) that it seemed strange that Luisa

Calderon was receiving a salary from the

DGI although she apparently did not do

any work for the Service. : (The case officer)

told me that hers was a peculiar case and

that he himself believed that she had been

recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel Pineiro, the Head

of the DGI, did not agree.:

As I recall,

(the case officer) had investigated Luisa

Calderon. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted

a letter to her by an American who signed

his name OWER (phonetic) or something

similar.

As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difficult in

Spanish so I am not sure of how the name

mentioned by Hernandez should be spelled.

It could have been "Howard" or something

different.

As I understand the matter,

the letter from the American was a love

letter but indicated that there was a

clandestine professional relationship

between the

writer and Luisa Calderon.

I also understand from (the case officer)

that after the interception of the letter

she had been followed and seen in the

company of an American.

I do not know if

this could have been Oswald... (Ibid.)

in what form this information was provided,

and which CIA official provided it. (HSCA

request letter of August 28, 1978)

The CIA responded by memorandum:

"Although the (Mexico City) Station considered

the conversation of sufficient possible

interest to send a copy to headguarters,

the latter apparently did nothing with

it, for there appears to be no record in the

Oswald file of such action as may have

Secret or Top Secret classification does

not reveal whether the conversation was

given or

(CIA Doc., Memorandum Regarding Luisa

The available evidence thus supports the

conclusion that the Warren Commission was never

given the information nor the opportunity by

which it could evaluate Luisa Calderon's

significance to the events surrounding President

Kennedy's assassination. Had the Commission been

This form is to be used for material extracted

and the Cub#om Exeranpaied dementle involvement in

Two difficult issues remain which are raised

by the Committee's finding. First, why didn't

the Agency provide the Calderon conversation to the

Warren Commission; secondly, why didn't the Agency

reveal to the Warren Commission its full knowledge

of Calderon's intelligence background, her possible

knowledge of Oswald and

her possible connection to

the CIA or some other American intelligence apparatus.

The first question can be explained in benign

terms. It is reasonably possible that by sheer

oversight the conversation was filed away and not

operation (CIA Inspector General Report 1967

pp. 1-74, 78-112). The AMLASH operation involved

a high level Cuban official (assigned the CIA

cryptonym AMIASH/1) who, during 1962 while meeting

with a CIA representative expressed the desire to

assassinate Fidel Castro (Ibid., p. 84). As a

result of AMLASH's expressed objective and the

CIA's desire to find a viable political alternative

to the Castro regime, the Agency subsequently

provided AMLASH with both moral and material

support designed to depose Fidel Castro. (Ibid.,

pP. 80-94). The AMLASH operation was terminated

by the CIA in 1965 as the result of security leaks.

(Ibia. pp. 104-106) During 1965, AMIASH and his

conspirators were brought to trial in Cuba for plotting

against Castro. AMLASH was sentenced to death, but

at Castro's request the sentence was reduced to

twenty-five years imprisonment. (Ibid. pp. 107-110)

assassination operation.

In pertinent part, Pollock

drew the following conclusions:

To the best of my knowledge, Mr. FitzGerald

considered the AMLASH operation to be a political

action activity with the objective of organizing

a group within Cuba to overthrow Castro and the

Castro regime by means of a coup d'etat. I heard

Mr. FitzGerald discuss the AMLASH operation

frequently, and never heard him characterize it as

an "assassiantion operation." Mr. FitzGerala

stated within my hearing on several occasions

his awareness that coup d'etat often involves

loss of life. (Ibid., par. 3, p. 2)

He also stated:

Desmond FitzGerald did not characterize the AMLASH

operation as an "assassigntion operation"; the

case officer did not; I, as Executive Officer, never

discussed any aspect of the AMLASH operation with

Joseph H. Langosch; the Deputy Chief, the other

branch chiefs and the special assistants could not

have so characterized it since they did not know

about the pen (the pen was specially fitted with

hypodermic syringe in response to urgings by AMLASH

the ne nat

for a means to start the coup by killing Castro.)

The case officer offered the pen to AMLASH on the day

of President Kennedy's death.

AMLASH rejected the

pen with disdain. LIbid., par. 4, p. 2/), (Ibid.,

par. 6, p. 3)

operation was ar

assassination plot prior to President Kennedy's

death. The broader and more significant issue,

as the 1977 IGR has identified it, is whether

the AMLASH operation was of sufficient relevancy

to have been reported to the Warren Commission.

In the case of the AMLASH operation this

determination is a most difficult matter to

resolve. Reasonable men may differ in their

characterization of the Agency's operational

objectives.

Based upon the presently available evidence

it is the Committee's position that such informa-

tion, if made available to the Warren Commission,

might have stimulated the Commission's investiga-

tive

corcern for possible Cuban involvement or

complicity in the assassination. As J. Lee Rankin

commented before this Committee:

...when I read...the Church Committee's

report--it was

an ideal situation for

them to just pick out any way they

wanted to tell the story and fit it

in with the facts that had to be met

and then either blame the rest of it.

on somebody else or not tell any more

or polish it off.

could have happened back in 1964.

I think there would have been a

much better chance of getting to

the heart of it.

It might have

only revealed that we are involved

in it and who approved it and all

that.

But I think that would

have at least come out.

(HSCA Class.

Depo. of J. Lee Rankin, 8/17/78, p.91)

The Committee is in agreement with Mr. Rankin

that had the AMLASH operation been disclosed to

the Warren Commission, the Commission might have

been able to foreclose the speculation and conjecture

that has surrounded the AMASH operation during

the past decade. As history now records, the AMLASH

operation remains a footnote to the turbulent

relations between Castro's Cuba and the United States.
