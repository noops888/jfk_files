DCI/ IRO

DCI/OIG/ IMO

SUBJECT:

(C) Breckinridge, LHO Report, and

Report Indexes/Inventory

(AIUO) The OIG/IMO has made exhaustive searches

both manually and electronically.

The attached is all of

the responsive material that could be found.

(AIUO) It appears that all reports and material

done by the IG on JFK or LHO have long since been turned

over to OLd (currently OErA) .

Shelflists and a memorandum

contaiming this are attached.

An electronic search produced 240 'hits' on

Breckinridge. I personally went through all 240 and have

selected only a few from that number that may be responsive.

(AIUO) The Office of the Inspector General does

not keep an inventory or index of IG cases.

5. (AIUO) If you have any questions regarding this
