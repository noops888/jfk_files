SUBJECT:

ANONYMOUS LETTER DATED 6-10-65 TO

PRESIDENT JOHNSON POSTMARKED

FORT WORTH, TEXAS, CONTAINING ALLEGATIONS

AGAINST INSPECTOR H. E

EDWARDS AND OTHER

BUREAU PERSONNEL

ROUTE IN

ENVELOPE

Anonymous letter writer, signing himself "A loyal, concerned Dallas FBI

employee," by letter to President Johnson dated 6-10-65, postmarked Fort Worth, Texas,

makes several allegations against Bureau personnel. Director stated,

"Look into

this

promptly. I suspect someone in the Bureau here may be the author or is furnishing

information to such ex-Agents as Turner or Levine. The postmark Ft. Worth means

nothing. H."

Allegation #1: That Inspector H. L. Edwards attended Attorneys General

conference at Phoenix, Arizona; was found drunk in hotel room, was unable to deliver a

speech; later same night was stopped for driving on wrong side of road and running through

stop signs; and that ticket was fixed on instructions of high FBI officials in Washington.

Facts: Almost identical allegations received in previous anonymous letter to Director

dated 5-15-65 postmarked El Paso, Texas. My inquiry in Phoenix, as contained in my

memo 5-24-65, reflected allegations were distorted exaggerations; indications were that

Edwards delivered scheduled speech; was awakened next morning in hotel room, but no

evidence he was drunk; received ticket for unlawful speed which was not "fixed" but is still

on file in Phoenix Police Department; plea of guilty was entered by former SAC Edward

Boyle and judge suspended sentence.

Edwards was censured for failure to report traffic

ticket. Allegation #2: Writer of present letter states above matter was recently brought

to Director's attention by one who attended the conference and a top aide was sent to

Phoenix where a whitewash was apparently administered as decision reportedly reached

that Edwards was innocent and no administrative action was taken against him, certainly

none approaching that rigidly required by FBI rules. Facts: This obviously refers to my

inquiry. No "whitewash" was administered. I obtained signed statements from Bureau

personnel, verified movements through #3 Cards, personally examined police records,

interviewed hotel manager,, police officers, judge, and others having knowledge of

incident and presented full facts to Director, who approved censure for Edwards.

Allegation #3: Edwards' conduct was covered for and not disclosed to Director at time it

happened by Assistant Director James Gale, you (Mr. Mohr), /me (Tagel)y

and possibly

Memo to Mr. Mohr from W. S. Tavel

Re: Anonymous Letter dated 6-10-65 to President Johnson, etc.

Edwards' conduct. Facts: Gale denies knowing of incident when it happened and no white-

wash resulted. SAC William Soyars has been transferred from Phoenix to Cincinnati since

my inquiry, with Director's approval, but his transier had no relation to my inquiry:

Allegation #4: That several years ago you (Mr. Mohr) were involved in drinking incident

at Toots Shor's in New York but were covered for by associates, several of whom suffered

severe administrative action including transfers. One "took the rap'' for you, was broken

from his high position, but is now reinstated in charge of large eastern office as reward

for "taking rap" for you. Facts: On night of 5-8-57 SAC Mac Lennan, Pittsburgh Office,

then ASAC at New York, had dinner with you and former SA T. F. Ring and non-Bureau

personnel, and about 10:30 P.M. left the others and was stopped while driving personally

owned car alone shortly thereafter going wrong way on one-way street and did not have autc

registration with him. No charge was placed and officer said Mac Lennan was

not under

influence of alcohol. MacLennan did not immediately report incident and was censured,

placed on probation, removed as ASAC, demoted to .GS-13, and ordered under transfer to

Kansas City but transfer was later canceled, and SA Joseph M. Zimmerman, Night Super-

visor who knew of incident and did not report it, was censured and removed as Supervisor

and Inspector's Aide. Mac Lennan has held several positions, including assistant to

Mr. Belmont, after leaving New York and prior to his present assignment. Allegation #5:

That you (Mr. Mohr) have also been involved in drunken escapades in other places,

including Miami where you allegedly were arrested at one time, Chicago, Los Angeles,

and Washington, D.C. Facts: You have denied this whole allegation categorically and have

stated that you have never been arrested in Miami or elsewhere. Allegation #6: Your

brother, Paul J. Mohr, reportedly had upwards of $1, 000 in bad checks out against him

when he applied for Special Agent position and investigation had to be held up 3 times befor

you were able to cover this blemish. Facts: Paul Mohr applied as SA 9-8-51 and entered!

on duty 10-29-51, reflecting no delay in investigation. He listed $557 of outstanding debts,

including $300 loan from his brother, Chester, and $160 to General Services Adminis-.

delay facts!

tration Credit Union where his credit was satisfactory. Credit agencies and police records

checked reflected no credit difficulties or bad checks outstanding and he was earning

$3100 per annum. Paul denies allegation, states is outright lie, and that he never had any

bad checks and didn't even have a checking account prior to his entering Bureau.

Allegation #7: You (Mr. Mohr) are reportedly brother-in-law of Sam Astoli, alias

"Kingston Sam," notorious east coast bookie and hoodlum operating out of Kingston,

New York. Facts: You have advised that the mother of Samuel Astolas, Jr., is a distant

relative of your mother's and you have had no significant contact with him. Bureau files

reflect he was known as 'Kingston Sam,"' is a professional handicapper, and had associatec

with bookies and gamblers in Kingston,

New York; Cincinnati; and Newport, Kentucky,

according to reports in 1953, 1960 and 1961.

Writer also criticizes Bureau's weight program and what he terms the

Director's "destructive personnel policy." He suggests the President may wish to have

John W. Macy, Jr., Chairman of Civil Service Commission, review recent instances of
