CARMEN A. DIPLACIDO, Director, Citizens Consular

services, Orice of consular Attairs, United States Department of

State (USDOS) (202-647-3666) was telephonically contacted by

Special Agent (SA) THOMAS FITZPATRICK on this date and DIPLACIDO

therefore provided the following pertinent information: (It is

noted that DIPLACIDO was previously interviewed in person by SA

FITZPATRICK and another FBI SA on 10/2/92.)

ADJUDICATION CONSIDERATIONS:

DIPLACIDO said "I am a very senior guy knowledgeable of

the adjudication area" (as regards adjudication of a United

States (U.S.) citizen's expressed intent to denounce his U.S.

citizenship).

He said that "I was on an adjudication desk starting in

August, 1970. "

Under certain circumstances, the USDOS could send an

adjudication letter or a citizen's name to the U. S. Secret

Service based on a request being made by a citizen to renounce

his/her U. S. citizenship. To his knowledge, the USDOS would not

send such a letter or citizen's name to any other agency.

He believes that this requirement for the USDOS to

provide information to the U. S. Secret Service in this regard

was based on action of the Warren Commission as a result of its

investigation of the assassination of U. S. President JOHN F.

KENNEDY (in November 1963) • DIPLACIDO believes that KENNEDY'S

reported assassin, LEE HARVEY OSWALD, had reportedly expressed an

interest in the past in renouncing his U. S. citizenship.

Accordingly, apparently the Warren Commission felt it was

the Water

appropriate for the USDOS to be required to disseminate to the u.

S. Secret Service information received by the USDOS about other

persons who expressed an interest to the USDOS in renouncing

their U. S. citizenship.

DIPLACIDO said that dissemination of such information

is not sent to the U. S. Secret Service in every case.

He commented that how a possible letter from WILLIAM J.

CLINTON (relating to his possibly renouncing his citizenship) was

worded would determine how it was handled by the USDos.

If this possible letter said that he wanted to renounce

his citizenship, it most likely would have been disseminated to

the U. S. Secret Service.

If "someone" said that he/she wanted to be naturalized

in another country, this would probably not be the type of

situation wherein

dissemination could be made about such to the

U. S. Secret Service. A person can be naturalized in another

country without giving up their U. S. citizenship but "at the

time" (circa 1969-1970) most countries wanted such a person to

give up their prior citizenship if they were naturalized in

another country, and the United States was a country that took

this

stance at that time.

DIPLACIDO advised that he thought that any

correspondence (relating to a person's intent to denounce his/her

citizenship) would be sent to the USDoS passport file.

He thinks that passport records were sent to the

Washington National Records Center (WNRC) (at Suitland, Maryland)

in three-year blocks before 1978.

If WILLIAM J. CLINTON's 1968 passport application had

been retired to the Federal Records Center, any possible letter

from CLINTON expressing his intent to denounce his U. S.

citizenship would have been kept separately in the passport

records.

This would depend on what he

requested, what the

response of the USDOS was, and whether the 1976 passport

application of CLINTON'S

had come in yet.

He indicated that there may be a question as to if such

possible letters (it they existed) were kept in passport records.

He said that no one seems to know where they would be kept.

DIPLACIDO advised that in 1968, a U. S. passport was

valid for five (5) years.

Accordingly, CLINTON's 1968 passport

would have expired in 1973.

RETIRED USDOS EMPLOYEE ASSOCIATED WITH ADJUDICATIONS RELATING TO

EUROPE:

DIPLACIDO provided the following information regarding

a person who could possibly have information about an

adjudication of denunciation request coming in from Europe in the

late 1960s-early 1970s.

He said that a woman named VIRGINIA CARROLL who retired

Irom the USDos in 1979, 1980 or 1981, was (while still employed

with the USDOS) in a group of officers that handled denunciations

coming in from Europe.

She was an Assistant Branch Chief in the

late 1960s to early 1970s timeframe.

"Europe" would have

included England.

DIPLACIDO suggested contact with the USDOS Retirement

Office to possibly locate CARROLL if an interview of her is of

interest to the FBI.

He thinks that she spent most of the latter part of her

USDOS career in the adjudication office.

VIRGINIA GLADHILL (OF THE U. S. PASSPORT OFFICE):

DIPLACIDO said that VIRGINIA GLADHILL "has been in

'records' (of the U. S. Passport Office) a long time."
