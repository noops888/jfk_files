i SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION

This reports play

of four New England

hoodluas to "kill two Agents of our

Boston

office.

Three of these hoodlums are currently

fugitives in connection with the ITAR-Gambling

investigation:

The fourth was arrested by our

Boston office yesterday and is being held on

$150,000 bond. All four have been implicated

in the gangland slaying of Rudy Marfeo, Boston

Massachusetts,

bookmaker.

According to a

former informant of our Boston office, the

plans call for his urging our two Agents to

contact him, after which the hoodlums would

take the

Agents under control.

One Agent

would be killed immediately. SA Paul Rico

would then be forced to drive_ the hoodlums

to the place where John J. Kelley was being

guarded by U.S. Marshals.

Kelley is current-

these hoodlums in the murder of Marfeo.

The hoodlums belleved that the marshals,

upon seeing Agent Rico, would relax, after

which they would kill Agent Rico,

the marshals

and Kelley. The hoodlums indicated that if

they locate SA Rico's exact address, they have

other plans in mind which were not furnished

our source.

The Lerner mentioned in this teletype

when apprehended by our

Boston office yester-

day, commented to Agent Rico "You look just

like your pictures."

Lerner, according to

Kelley, is extremely courageous

and appears to

relish

killing.

A teletype is being sent immediately to

SAC, Boston, containing specific instructions

security; to vigorously press their investi-

gation toward locating the three fugitives

aware of plan and that adequate

involved in this plan; to insure u.s. Marshal

security

Marshal

afforded Kelley; and in the event Lerner makes

bond, to take appropriate steps

for revocatio
