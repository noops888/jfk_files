NOTE FOR: Director of Central Intelligence

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Deputy Director for Administration

Task Force Report on Procedures for the Public

Release of Information under FOIA, Privacy Act

and Other Programs

We have no major comments on the draft decision

memorandum.

I would suggest one relatively minor change,

however.

On page 2, paragraph b, regarding the placement of

the Historical Review Group, I would like to see the wording

be a bit more open-ended.

When we fully establish a CIO and

its subordinate organizations, it might make sense to place y

the HRG in that structure. Accordingly, I would insert in

the first sentence of paragraph b after the word

intelligence, "for the time being."
