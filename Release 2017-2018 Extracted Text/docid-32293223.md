...

ReBulet 5/20/64.

A survey was conducted by SA NATHAN O. BROWN

of the Holiday Inn, Lafayette, Louisiana, on 6/12/64. This

survey developed that the subject uses a twin room on his

visits to the motel and that each of these rooms butts

against another twin room.

There is a telephone conduit

connection on one side of

each room which will afford

direct air space between these units and is readily adaptable

for use of a mite pre-amplifier unit.

The ceilings in the motel are dropped, acoustical

tile suspended by wire from rafters, the tile being tongue

and groove and cannot be individually removed.

Access can

be gained to the space above the tile and an installation

made there.

The walls are of cement block and use of a

contact microphone would not be possible.

It would appear that no satisfactory installation

can be made without a degree of trespass and in view of the

forthcoming trial of MARCELLO scheduled for August, 1964 in

U. S. District Court as well as the fact that he makes

rather infrequent visits to Lafayette, it is not believed

installation should be contemplated

at this time.

In the

event it is felt that an installation is desirable a request.

will be made of the Bureau at that time.
