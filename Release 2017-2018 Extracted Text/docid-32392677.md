CRITERIA FOR SELECTING SUBJECTS) FOR PHOTOGRAPHING

2.

If the target is unknown and/or a previous

photograph has not been taken, the observer takes one:

At the same time he records the time of arrivall

departure, whether the target is known or unknown,

and records any obvious identifying data such as

license plate, apparent nationality, apparent occupa-

tion, etc. In addition to the above general visual

surveillance, the agents are occasionally provided

with photographs of targets the Station believes

might visit the compound and on whom we wish a speci-

fic alert - such as visiting agent personnel and third

country subversives known or believed to be in the

area.
