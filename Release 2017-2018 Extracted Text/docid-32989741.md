Telephone conversation with MICHAEL EBERHART, Attorney for the House of Representatives

Select Committee on Assassinations, at 10 AM on Friday, September 1, 1978.

Mr. EBERHART stated they were interested in the escape of JAMES EARL RAY and the

investigation conducted by the Bureau under the UFAC statute in his escape from

the Missouri State Prison prior to the assassination of MARTIN LUTHER KING. He

said that they have some records and some of the records had been destroyed. He

is trying to gather information and piece it together with what records they have

available.

EBERHART asked me if I recalled having done any investigation concerning the Bureau's

UFAC investigation. I answered, "Not really. Well, I tell you the only thing I

recall and I don't know whether it was at that time or the time of the assassination.

It seems to me some rumor or some information came to my attention that he (RAY). was or

had relatives from the Quincy, Illinois area or some place in that area that would

be covered by ithe Resident Agency in Quincy."

EBERHART then asked if it could have been the Alton area rather than the Quincy

area. I answered, "The Alton area does not ring a bell with me."

He said that BOB HAINES was in the Alton Resident Agency. I answered, "That's true."

EBERHART then stated that in handling investigation, he presumed that all information

came into the Springfield Office first, was that right? I answered, "All leads came

into the Springfield Office and would have been disseminated to the proper Resident

Agency which would have taken care of them."

EBERHART made the statement he had recently talked with BOB HAINES, formerly of

the Alton Resident Agency, Alton, Illinois, who recalled having done some work

concerning RAY's escape. He said, "Let me ask you a general question, which you

may have already answered. Do you recall any investigation pertaining to RaY pre-

assassination or pro-assassination by the Alton Resident Agency." My answer was,

"No. Let me clarify one thing. When you talk about Alton, I would have been

160 some odd miles north and east of it. And Quincy, I would have been approxi-

mately 150 miles almost more east than north of there. Quite a distance in between.

The only contact I would have had with them (the Agents in those areas) was when

we were all in the Springfield Office as we all worked on our own."

EBERHART asked me if I recalled any investigation conducted by the Alton Resident

Agency concerning JAMES EARL RAY. I answered, "I wouldn't know what the others

were doing on the investigation unless I had a specific lead to handle myself.

I don't recall any, to tell you the truth."

EBERHART asked me if I had any knowledge of anyone in the Bureau having been in

contact with JAMES EARL RAY before the assassination. I said, "I can't help you

there. I don"t know of any investigation that was conducted by any of the other

parties involved or any of them coming in contact with anyone connected therewith.

Just at a complete loss when it comes to that, I'm sorry."

EBERHART asked me if I came into contact with or had done any investigation

concerning the bank robbery of the Bank of Alton, Alton, Illinois, in July of

1967. I repeated, "The bank robbery of the Bank of Alton in July of 1967? No

sir, I don't recall anything about it. I don't even recall the robbery. It was

way south of me. I may have handled some leads on it, but I don't recall it."

the Jackson file regarding Burgess Audie Wilson and his

allegations pertaining to the MURKIN case.

The HSCA amended

the request to ask for

access only to the FBI Headquarters

(FBIHQ) file regarding this matter. As the investigation into

Wilson's allegations is being filed in FBIHQ MURKIN file to

which access is provided as new material is filed, the Committee

Is being advised that the Wilson material is not being

separated from the other MURKIN serials.

Attention: Judge William H. Webster

Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation

Room 7162

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

On August 2, 1978, I as Chief Counsel for the Committee

along with Michael Eberharat, Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel,

met with Special Agents Ron Heller and James D. Carey in order

to apprise the FBI of a matter of extreme sensitivity which

involved possible physical endangerment to two Committee

witnesses, Oliver B. Patterson a

anREG yence Haynes

During the meeting of hug ft 2, 1918, the a vas 22X

that a Committee source closeto both Mark Lane, the current

attorney for James Earl Ray,

and Jerry Ray, brother of James

Earl Ray, had learned that both Lane and Jerry Ray were aware

of a confidential relationship between Oliver Patterson and the

Committee.

The same source also learned that Clarence Haynes

was regarded by at least Jerry Ray to be in the same posture.

The FBI was further told that the Committee information indicat-

ed possible physical harm to Patterson and Haynes by Jerry Ray,

and because of such information the Committee felt an obligation

to have each of them warned of the danger.*

The FBI was advised

however that in view of the fact that the information had come

from a confidential source for the Committee that it was abso

lutely necessary that neither Patterson nor Haynes learn that

EAS OCT 28 1978

*/ Also related to the FBI from the same Committee

source was

information that Jerry Ray and others were planning a bank

robbery

• in the St. Louis area.

The treatment and handlin

f this information is not the subject of this letter however

тоб.

Honorable Griffin B. Bell

September 26, 1978

¡¡the Committee had originally provided this information. As a

result of the discussion on this subject amongst those present

at the August 2nd meeting, it was understood that the FBI would

make arrangements to have

agents advise Patterson and Haynes of

the possible endangerment to them without any indication that

the Committee was the ultimate source of the information.

We

are advised by Mr. Heller that indeed the FBI directive to the

field on this matter expressly stated that the Committee should

not under any circumstances be divulged as the source of these

threats.

The Committee has received information however that the

FBI did not act responsibly in the treatment or dissemination of

this matter and that as a result the identity of a Committee

source may have been compromised.

Specifically, Mr. Patterson,

who has independently exposed his relationship with the Committee

recently and has aligned himself with Jerry Ray, alleges that

during the course of the warning provided to him by FBI agents

St. Louis he was advised that Clarence Haynes had a similar pos-

sible security problem and that the Committee was the source of

the information which suggested possible harm to him.

The con

veyance of the information that Haynes was

also endangered not

only unnecessarily provided Patterson with information for which

he had no need but it also potentially identified the Committee

source in question since the information about possible harm to

both Patterson and Haynes

was unique to a single conversation

attended by only the Committee source and one other person.

How-

ever, the gravity of this problem has been magnified substantially

If,

as Patterson alleges, he was in fact also told that the infor-

mation conveyed to him had come from the Committee.

While given

the circumstances I might normally consider Patterson's claims to

¡be indicative of an attempt on his part to identify other Committee

sources on behalf of Jerry Ray instead of a truthful account of his

FBI interview, such is not the apparent case. I have been inde-

pendently advised by trusted acquaintances in the media that the

FBI in Washington, D.C. has leaked similar information indicating

that the Committee was

the initial source of the information that

Patterson's life might be in jeopardy.

I have also been told that

the FBI regarded this information as frivolous.

If any of the allegations received via Patterson or the media

are in fact true then I would strongly suggest that serious errors

in professional judgment have occurred - so serious as to warrant

disciplinary actions against any individual responsible for what

so this committen in te cement.

would appear to be a fundamental disregard for not only the

security of a Committee source but also of the very trust placed

by this Committee in the FBI when this information was imparted

to it. Ironically, this Committee has operated reluctantly under

NW 55038 DocId: 32989741 Page 47

---

## Page 48

Page Thr'èe

Honorable Griffin B. Bell

September 26, 1978

less than satisfactory arrangements in order to get access to FBI

Informant information without disclosure of informant identity.

Despite the respect by this Committee for FBI protection of its

sources, it would appear that the allegations contained in this

letter, if true, indicate a less than mutual respect by the FBI.

It is therefore requested that the FBI conduct an investiga-

tion to ascertain if Patterson was advised that the Committee was

the source of the information related to him and that Haynes was

also endangered. It is requested that the FBI provide the Commit-

tee with copies of all documents, directives and interview reports

which bear on the determination of this matter. Similarly, it is

requested that the appropriate FBI personnel in Washington be

interviewed to ascertain if information concerning Patterson was

Improperly related to members of the media and that all documents,

directives, and interview reports on this matter also be provided

¡to the Committee.

In view of the seriousness of this matter it is suggested

that it be handled on an expedited basis. Futhermore, in light of

the sensitivity of the matters contained herein, this document

should be classified and handled in a manner to preclude future

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

NOTE: In referenced letter, HSCA refers to individual who

had told St. Louis informant of offer made to him to kill

Dr. King.

This individual is Russell George Byers. All

information concerning this matter, including the excised

St. Louis and FBIHQ files on the informant; all informatior

Russell George Byers excluding Byers' informant file;

and all Information regarding the misfiling of that

information in the St. Louis Office, has been previously

furnished the HSCA by

6/9/78, 8/7/78, 8/23/78, and 9/28/78.

5 0 O n 60 3/23/18, 372018,7

HSCA alleges in their letter that during inter-

view of Byers, he admitted his informant status; however,

he would not authorize the release of his informant files to

the HSCA. HSCA alleges also that his informant status raises

questions regarding involvement of an FBI informant in a

conspiracy to kill King•

In discussion between members of

Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management Division;

SA's Ron Heller and D. 0. Coulson, Legal Counsel Division;

and Mr. Bob Keuch, Special Counsel to the Attorney General,

it was

decided that this request 1s outside the scope of

HSCA's inquiry as Byers was not opened as Informant until

seven years after King's assassination; however, St. Louis

is being requested

' to ascertain whether Byers had any prior

contact with the FBI, as well as whether he admitted his

relationship with the Bureau and his reasons for refusing to

authorize the release of his file to the HSCA.

This is being

requested to provide basis for discussion with HSCA regarding

ultimate disposition of referenced request.

On 10/30/70, SAC Roy B. Klager, J1., St. Louis,

was telephonically advised of the contents of this teletype.

SAC Klager advised that he wished to go on record that he

did not want to place his Agents in a position of checking

up on the HSCA or influencing a Committee witness. He was

advised that contacting an informant and verifying oral

written waivers is done solely to protect the informant and

the information he confidentially furnished, and not to

influence a Committee witness.

had any additional questions upon receipt of Bureau teletype,

he would contact FBIHQ.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with this Committee's investigation into

the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I write to request

that you make the name of a former Security informant available

to the Committee so that the person might be interviewed in

order that serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the death of Dr. King may be resolved.

The

Committee has had access to the relevant Bureau personnel and

the Headquarters and Field Office files of the informant, duly

excised to protect the informant's identity; and it also con-

ducted extensive interviews among others who are also the subject

of this aspect of the Committee's investigation.

What the Com-

mittee now desires is to determine

if the oral testimony of the

witnesses support or refute the written record as well as

information obtained during previous Tonterviews ^ 290-1248

Tennessee during 1968, who were apparently involved in the

violence that occurred in Memphis one week prior to Dr. King's

death. He was an older person, and he had

apparently been a

Bureau source since 1958.

As a recognized community leader, he

was able to move about freely within the Black community.

Committee knows independently that in the early months of 1968,

the Invaders were attempting to obtain influence in that same

community, and they initially attempted to do so, in part, by

approaching established organizations.

They even went so far

as to invite special agents of the Memphis office to meet with! 1378

them early in 1968, at which time they delineated their goals

and objectives.

If the Bureau sought to shape the actions of

these individuals in ways detrimental to DI. King in connection

with the counterintelligence program being waged against him,

it would appear that this particular informant would have been

a logical vehicle for that effort.

As you know, with respect to the king investigation, the

Committee is, in effect, performing for the death of Dr. King

the same function that the Warren Commission performed for the

death of President Kennedy•

One of the most frequent criti-

cisms of the Warren Commission is that in attempting to resolve

the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was an

FBI in-

formant, the Commission accepted sworn affadavits from the

Bureau.

The Committee feels, therefore, that it would be

derelict to rely on anything

less than an opportunity to examine

and cross-examine relevant witnesses on this crucial issue.

The Committee is not unmindful of the sensitive nature of

its request.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the

Committee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not

until our field interviews with former members of the Invaders

and people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed, (1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and (2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives, that the Committee requested access to any

informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders, King and SCIC substantive files.

It had also

reviewed the Memphis Police Department files, and it had inter-

viewed its undercover operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

sought could be resolved by reviewing the informants Headquarters

and Field Office files. Subsequent interviews with current and

former agents revealed, additionally, (1) that the Memphis Field

Office had prior knowledge of the impending violence (a fact

memoralized in FBI documents) and (2) members of the Invaders

were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and

readying

weapons from signposts (a fact testified to under oath

by these agents.)

Further, while the Committee has insisted that the files

of all five of the informants said by the Department of Justice

to be involved with the Invaders should have been made available

to its staff pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, it

made a good faith effort to work out a compromise proposal that

permitted my exclusive review of the excised files. The

NW 55038 DocId: 32989741 Page 80

Committee has now reached a point, however, where the balance

between maintaining the integrity of the Bureau's informant

program and the resolution of this critical issue must be struck

in favor of the Committee's receiving the identity of that one

informant. A request is not being made for all five, and absent

new developments, this request should resolve the outstanding

issues.

The burden of the Committee's mandate is largely a

reflection of the desire of the American public to learn the

true facts concerning the death of Dr. King. That burden is

perhaps never more apparent than in connection with the issues

that the Committee is now attempting to address here.

The claim

that an FBI/Invader connection

resulted in the violence on April

28 and contributed to DI. King's death has now received nation-

wide attention.

It is recounted in existing literature and was

broadcast nationally in a dramatic account of Dr. King's life.

The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, close friend and successor of Dr. King,

testified in public under oath and before Members of the Com-

mittee and the national news media, that he recalled members of

the Invaders acknowledging that they had caused the violence

on March 28, in return for compensation from the FBI. Indeed,

an individual who was a recognized leader of the 1968 Sanitation

Strike and made the invitation to DI. King to come to Memphis,

is a leading exponent of the theory that the FBI, through its

informants, had a direct role in DI. King's assassination.

Finally, the Committee's investigation has revealed that

the Bureau recommended that informants be used with or without

their knowledge to implement counterintelligence proposals

directed against Dr. King, in 1968.

clear that the Committee has no choice but to satisfy itself

concerning the events which took place in Memphis.

The public

interest in the death of Dr. King cannot be met by less than a

full investigation.

to the fair resolution of these most serious questions.

Talk these most

Talking with this individual is essential

I would hope that it might be possible to secure the

identity of this informant, either through his consent or para-

graph I. B. (1) of the Memorandum of Understanding between the

Department and the Committee. Nevertheless, I am authorized

to inform you that the Committee is

prepared to seek this

information through formal process

• if all other avenues are of

no avail.

Finally, I would note that this issue must be resolved

well before the resumption of the Committee's public hearings

Attention:

Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations into the death of

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., I write to request that

you make the name of the former Security informant

available to the Committee

so that the person might

be interviewed by the Committee in order that serious

allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and the death of Dr. King may be resolved. The Committee

has had access to the relevant Bureau files concerning

this informant, but the files were duly excised to pro-

tect the informant's identity.

The Committee now desires

to interview this informant to determine if his oral

testimony would support or refute the written record.

In addition, the Committee would expect to obtain other

information from the informant to corroborate or refute

information the Committee has obtained from its other

sources.

RE 7062-117298-1250

The Committee 'is extremely sensitive to your

concerns about preserving the confidentiality of your mi li

informants.

In addition, the Committee can certainly

appreciate

the desire of most Security informants to OCT 25 1978

remain unidentified. Should the Committee learn the

identity of this informant, it will be used at the cut

rent time solely to have counsel on the staff interview

and perhaps depose the informant. This would be done in

the Committee's offices

in Washington, D.C. and without

the knowledge of any member of the public. Indeed, not

pott

## Page 86

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Page Two

even every member of the Committee staff will become aware

of the informant's identity.

The Committee is primarily

interested in the information the'informant may provide

the Committee. The Committee has no desire to have the

informant's identity needlessly publicly exposed. Absent

extraordinary circumstances, the Committee would not divulge

in its hearings or its final report the name of the informant.

As you are aware, the Committee has extensively pur-

sued its investigations into the Invaders. The claim that

an FBI/Invader connection contributed to Dr. King's assassi-

nation

has received nationwide attention.

We have held

field interviews with many members of the Invaders and re-

viewed numerous files on them.

In addition, the Comnittee

has interviewed current and former agents of the Department

and Bureau on this issue.

Our Committee has been mandated

to conduct a "full and complete" investigation into the

assassination of Dr. King.

Talking with this informant is

essential to enable us to fulfill our legislative mandate,

and our responsibilities to the American people. As I indi

cated to you, I hope it will be possible for us to secure

the identity of the informant through his consent, or pur-

suant to Paragraph I, B. of our Memorandum of Understanding.

Nevertheless, I must

inform you that the Committee is prepared

to seek the information through formal process if all other

avenues fail. This latter alternative, in the event litigation

ensued and the Committee won, might publically disclose the

identity of the informant.

Indeed, litigation would only

attract undue attention to this issue, and the participants

involved.

I believe if you adequately express to the infor-

publicity, he will consent to his identity being disclosed

and an interview with the staff.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation by this Committee

into the assassination of DI. Martin Luther King, Jr.,

the rai has previously provided, by communication eatéa ("/

March 13, 1978, confidential source information which in-

dicates the identity of a person to whom an offer to kill

DI. King had been made. By FBI communication dated March

20, 1978, the identity, date of birth and FBI number of

the person receiving this offer was provided to the Select

Committee.

By letter dated June 5, 1978, the Committee

routinely requested all files pertaining to this individual.

By communication dated August 7, 1978, the FBI completec

its response to this request which did not originally anti-

cipate the production of any informant files for this in-

dividual.

REC20 62-117290 1251

On October 16, 1978, however, the Select Committee

re-interviewed the individual who had received the afore-

mentioned offer to kill Dr. King and was advised that he

had previously provided information to the FBI on a con-

fidential basis. This individual has indicated that he

would not provide an authorization to allow the Committee

access to his FBI informant file unless the Committee

assured him that he would not have to testify in the

about his receipt of an offer to kill Dr. King. * The

Committee has indicated that no such assurance will

Despite the absence of a specific authorization, it is

reguested that the E Headourters and Field Offi

informant files of this individual be made available to

the Committee.

His divulgence of a confidential relationship

with the FBI not only eliminates the responsibility of the

FBI

toprotect his identity but it also raises some serious

At the time EDMONDSON became an IO fugitive in

May, 1966, an "88" indices card was prepared indicating •

that ALEXANDER GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON was an alias of

GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON whose date of birth was 8/3/37,

Springfield, Missouri, and who was assigned FBI #990 987 B

and who was the subject of IO #4011 and wanted flyer #398.

At the time of filing this indices card, a prior reference

to EDMONDSON (SL 137-4674) was consolidated thereon.

is assumed that sometime during the period that EDMONDSON

was an informant for the Kansas City Division, the St.

Iouis Division received a lead to check the National

Personnel Records Center concerning EDMONDSON and, this

being prior to the current method of not opening up full

cases for record checks, a "137" case was opened for the

purpose of checking those records.

At the time the "137"

reference was added to the

"88" indices card, the date of

the "137" being opened should have been added also but this

was not done.

Following normal destruction procedures, when

EDMONDSON's "88" file was destroyed, that number was inked

out on the indices card leaving only the reference to

137-4674. Under the old file destruction program (approximately

five years ago), Sy file 137-4674 was destroyed and the

indices card should have been purged; however, the indices

card was inadvertently not destroyed.

The above described indices card has been purged

from the St. Louis indices and is being maintained as an

exhibit in captioned file.

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D. C. 20305

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with this Committee's investigation into

the death of Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., I write to request

that you make the name of a former Security informant available

to the Committee so that the person might be interviewed in '

order that serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the death of Dr. King may be resolved.

Committee has had access to the relevant Bureau personnel and

the Headquarters and Field Office files of the informant, duly

excised to protect the informant's identity; and it also con-

ducted extensive interviews among others who are also the subject

of this aspect of the Committee's investigation.

What the Com-

mittee now desires is to determine if the oral testimony of the

witnesses support or refute the written record as well as

information obtained during previous interviews.

The person, whose identity the Committee seeks, was asso-

ciated with the Invaders, a Black militant group in Memphis,

Tennessee during 1968, who were apparently involved in the

violence that occurred in Memphis one week prior to Dr. King's

death. He was an older person, and he had apparently been a

Bureau source since 1958. As a recognized community leader, he

was able to move about freely within the Black community.

Committee knows independently that in the early months of 1968,

the Invaders were attempting to obtain influence in that same

community, and they initially attempted to do so, in part, by

approaching established organizations.

They even went so far

as to invite special agents of the Memphis office to meet with

them early in 1968, at which time they delineated their goals

and objectives.

If the Bureau sought to shape the actions of

these individuals in ways detrimental to Di. King in connection

Page 2

with the counterintelligence program being waged against him,

It would appear that this particular informant would have been

a logical vehicle for that effort.

As you know, with respect to the King investigation, the

Comnittee is, in effect, performing for the death of DI. King

the same function that the Warren Commission performed for the

death of President Kennedy•

One of the most frequent criti-

cisms of the Warren Commission is that in attempting to resolve

the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey Oswald was an FBI in-

formant, the Commission accepted sworn affadavits from the

Bureau.

The Committee feels,

derelict to rely on anything less than an opportunity to examine

and cross-examine relevant witnesses on this crucial issue.

The Committee is not unmindful of the sensitive nature of

its request.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the

Committee has attempted to move with restraint.

It was not

until our field interviews with former members

of the Invaders

and people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed, (1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and (2) that it is universally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives, that the Committee requested access to any

informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders, King and SCLC substantive files.

It had also.

reviewed the Memphis Police Department files, and

it had inter-

viewed its undercover operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

sought could be resolved by reviewing the informants Headquarters

and Field Office files. Subsequent interviews with current and

former agents revealed, additionally, (1) that the Memphis Field

office had prior knowledge of the impending violence (a fact

memoralized in FBI documents) and (2) members of, the Invaders

were observed by agents of the fBI exhorting the

crowd and

readying weapons from signposts (a fact testified to under oath

by these agents.)

Further, while the Committee has insisted that the files

of all five of the informants said by the Department of Justice

to be involved with the Invaders should have been made available

to its staff pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, it

made a good faith effort to work out a compromise proposal that

Committee has now reached a point, however, where the balance

between maintaining the integrity of the Bureau's informant

program and the resolution of this critical issue must be struck

in favor of the Committee's receiving the identity of that one

informant.

A request is not being made for all five, and absent

new developments,

this request should resolve the outstanding

issues.

The burden of the Committee's mandate is largely a

reflection of the desire of the American public to learn the

true facts concerning the death of Dr. King. That burden is

perhaps never more apparent than in connection with the issues

that the Committee is now attempting to address here.

The claim

that an FBI/Invader connection resulted in the violence on April

28 and contributed to DI. King's death has now received nation-

wide attention.

It is recounted in existing literature and was

broadcast nationally in a dramatic account of DI. King's life.

The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, close friend and successor of DI. King,

testified in public under oath and before Members of the Com-

mittee and the national news media, that he recalled members of

the Invaders acknowledging that they had caused the violence

on March 28, in return for compensation from the FBI. Indeed,

an individual who was a recognized leader of the 1968 Sanitation

Strike and made the invitation to DI. King to come to Memphis,

is a leading exponent of the theory that the fBI, through its

informants, had a direct role in Dr. King's assassination.

Finally, the Committee's investigation has revealed that

the Bureau recommended that informants be used with or without

their knowledge to implement counterintelligence proposals

directed against Dr. King, in 1968.

With this backdrop, it is

clear that the Committee has no choice but to satisfy itself

concerning the events which took place in Memphis.

The public

interest in the death of Dr. King

cannot be met by less than a

full investigation.

Talking with this individual is essential

to the fair resolution of these most serious questions.

I would hope that it might be possible to secure the

identity of this informant, either through his consent or para-

graph I. B. (1) of the Memorandum of Understanding between the

Department and the Committee.

Nevertheless, 1 an authorized

to inform you that the Committee is prepared to seek this

information through formal process if all other avenues are of

no avail.

Finally, I would note that this issue must be resolved

well before the resumption of the Committee's public hearings

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20530

Attention:

Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the investigation of the House

Select Committee on Assassinations into the death of

DI. Martin Luther King, JI., I write to request that

you make the name of the former Security informant

available to the Committee so that the person might

be interviewed by the Committee in order that serious

allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and the death of DI. King may be resolved. The Committee

has had access to the relevant Bureau files concerning

this informant, but the files were duly excised to pro-

tect the informant's identity. The Committee now desires

to interview this informant to determine if his oral

testimony would support or refute the written record.

In addition, the Committee would expect to obtain other

information from the informant to corroborate or refute

information the Committee has obtained from its other

sources.

The Committee is extremely sensitive to your

concerns about preserving the confidentiality of your

informants.

In addition, the Committee can certainly

appreciate the desire of most Security informants to

remain unidentified. Should the Committee learn the

identity of this informant, it will be used at the cur-

rent time solely to have counsel on the staff interview

and perhaps depose the informant. This would be done in

the Committee's offices in Washington, D.C. and without

the knowledge of any member of the public.

Indeed, not

even every member of the Committee staff will become aware.

of the informant's identity. The Committee is primarily

interested in the information the informant may provide

the Committee.

informant's identity needlessly publicly exposed. Absent

extraordinary circumstances, the Committee would not divulge

in its hearing's or its final report the name of the informant.

As you are aware, the Committee has extensively pur-

sued its investigations into the Invaders. The claim that

an FBI/Invader connection contributed to DI.

King's assassi-

nation has received nationwide attention. We have held

field interviews with many members of the Invaders and re-

viewed numerous files on them. In addition, the Committee

has interviewed current and former agents of the Department

and Bureau on this issue.

Our Committee has been mandated

to conduct a "full and complete" investigation into the

assassination of DI. King.

Talking with this informant is

essential to enable

us to

fulfill our legislative mandate,

and our responsibilities to the American people. As I indi-

cated to you, I hope it will be possible for us to secure

the identity of the informant through his consent, or pur-

I, Formant

suant to Paragraph I, B. of our Memorandum of Understanding.

Nevertheless, I must

inform you that the Committee is prepared

to seek the information through formal process if all other

avenues fail.

This latter alternative, in the event litigation

ensued and the Committee won, might publically disclose the

identity of the informant:

Indeed, litigation would. only

attract undue attention to this issue, and the participants

involved. I believe if you adequately express to the infor-

mant our sincere desire to avoia unnecessary disclosure or •

publicity, he will consent to his identity being disclosed

Attention:

Mr. Siebert

Dear Ms. Babcock:

By way of introduction, l am a retired Special Agent of the Federal

Bureau of investigations At the time of my retirement, I was Section Chief

of the Domestic Intei ligent Section at FBl headquarters.

I have been advised by the FBI that I am listed as a witness for interview

by the House Committee on Assasinations.

I have been told that my interview

will pertain to the FBl's investigation of Martin. Luther King.

In my previous position with the FBI, I was privy to numerous memoranda

written concerning the various aspects of the Martin Luther King investigation.

The above memoranda included very sensitive areas such as informant operations

and other matters which I do not feel free to discuss at this time. I have

been given a briefing by a representative of the FBI's Legal Council Division

and I am knowledgeable concerning these areas which I may or may not discuss.

However, in view of the sensitivity of the above information and especially

in view of the possibilities of civil action, l am respectively requesting

that I be represented by legal council. I understand that the Department of

Justice will authorize payment for the hiring of legal council.. In view of this,

I request your authority and naturally your authorization to hire Mr. Joseph

Morrissey, who is a member of the Welsh & Morgan Law Firm, 900 17th Street, N.W.,

Washington, D.C. 20006.

Thanking you in advance for your cooperation.

Respectfully yours,
