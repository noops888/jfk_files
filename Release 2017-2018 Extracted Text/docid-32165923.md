THOMAS. HOLI appeared at the office of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI); 3801 Biscayne Boulevara,

Miami, Florida, where he was interviewed by Special Agents PETER B.

SCHOPPERLE aNd DON J. DUMFORD, FBI: Prior to the interview,

Special Agent (SA) SCHOPPERLE had explained to Mr. HOLT that the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was desirous of knowing.

any information concerning remarks made by one FRANK STURGIS in

his presence concerning the assassination of President JOHN F.

KENNEDY at Dallas, Texas:

HOLT advised that he is not that well acquainted with

FRANK STURGIS, but that he met him approximately. one year ago

at a party given at Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

He stated that

he was introduced to STURGIS by a friend of his, BILLY JOHNSON.

HOLT advised that at this party STURGIS had told him that he

had been a hit man for FIDEL CASTRO, and that both CASTRO and

he (STURGIS) had both worked for the Central Intelligence Agency

(CIA) •

At this point in the interview, HOLT stated. that

ROCKEFELLER, meaning NELSON ROCKEFELLER, had been in charge of

the Warren Commission, and that it had been a cover up as far

as the assassination of KENNEDY was concerned. HOLT next stated

that the "hit" was done in Texas to make it look like JOHNSON

(President LYNDON JOHNSON) was at fault.

HOLT stated that he believed BILLY JOHNSON may have

told STURGIS to say the above things, just to impress HOLT.

HOLT next stated that while at this party, STURdIS

had named many people whom he stated were "big", and that he

knew these people:

HOLT stated that he thinks STURGIS may

have killed KENNEDY because STURGIS had said that he could

"shoot a person's brains out at 1,000 yards with a simple

rifle and imagine what I could do with a scope.".

HOLT next

stated that if STURGIS had made these comments to him concernino

the assassination of KENNEDY he was sure that he had probably

told them to other people.

HOLT stated that STURGIS was a man

approximately 50 years old. HOLT next. stated that he advised

BILL JOHNSON had worked as an informant for the FBI, CIA and.
