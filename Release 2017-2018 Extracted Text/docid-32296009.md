MACGIR

MAGELO

on 2/6/62, LOUIS ALFRED PERSICHETTI met with MARIO

MAGelo and furnished additional information which MARIO NAGGIO

was to relay to ANGELO BRUNO.

MARIO MAGGIO,

with his brothers,

SALVATORE and PETER, operate the Maggio Cheese Company In -

They are closely aligned with BRUNO.

PETER MAGGIO Is married to ANGELO BRUNO's sister. Investigation

has established that the MAGGIO brothers' father, MICHAEL

MAGGIO (Deceased), was the individual more than anyone else that

CHIOVERO, Intelligence Division, Internal Revenue Service,

Philadelphia, Pa. was endeavoring to arrange a meeting between

BRUNO and CHIOVERO.

CHIOVERO, it is noted,

has been second in

command and is now in control

of the Intelligence Division,

Internal Revenue Service, Inquiry in regard to ANGELO BRUNO,

In which capacity he has full knowledge of the entire Internal

Revenue Service investigation, plus information disseminated

by the FBI in regard to BRUNO.

As a result of this informa-

tion, there has been in the Philadelphia Division a separate

in the event future information is developed showing that

CHLOVERO.

In addition to the above, PH 614-PC, who 1s furnish-

ing Information on a daily basis in regard to

ANGELO BRUNO,

is maintaining such a close personal relationship with BRUNO

that the informant's safety would be jeopardized if Informa-

tion he furnishes is reported In general report form and

ultimately came into the possession of the Internal Revenue

Service in Philadelphia.

In addition, PH 623-C* was placed in a position to

furnish extremely valuable information beginning 2/5/62.

Information being developed by this informant is both volumi-

nous and of excellent quality, not only in regard to BRUNO, but

many subjects in Philadelphia

and other localities.

PH 92-444

Because it has been developed, as outlined above,

that the Internal Revenue Service cannot be trusted even with

paraphrased information from the above three sources, the

Philadelphia Division 1s setting forth information as developed

by these sources in a separate communication.

This is a

necessity as previous experience has indicated that Departmental

Attorney THOMAS MC BRIDE maintains a close relationship with

the Internal Revenue Service in Philadelphia In regard to the

investigation of ANGELO BRUNO and other allied matters, and

would possibly furnish information from these confidential

sources to the Internal Revenue Service even though the Phila-

delphia Division has not been disseminating this type of

information to the Internal Revenue Service in Philadelphia.

In the event that Internal Revenue Service, Philadel-

phia,

Pa., requests dissemination in report form or any

portions of a report by the FBI in regard to ANGELO BRUNO,

VACB, they will be advised by the Philadelphia Division that

this

Information will be available only at the Bureau at

Washington, D. C.

A point of Interest in this regard is the fact that

Internal Revenue Service Agent JOHN CHIOVERO, during the week

of 2/4-10/62, has telephonically contacted SA J, ROBERT PEARCE

for the first

time in over a two month period for no apparent

reason, which could be contributed to lend a support to the

possibility that CHIOVERO 1s working with LOUIS PERSICHETTI

In an endeavor to sell information to BRUNO.
