per

To recommend that legal Counsel Division consult

with the Department to seek guidance as to the manner in

which the Bureau should respond to HSC requests for materials

in Bureau files relating to organizations and individuals

currently involved in civil litigation with the Bureau, and

to ascertain how Bureau personnel should respond to similar

inquiries while giving testimony in either Executive or

public sessions.

DETAILS:

In September and October, 1975, the HSC requested,

among other items, information from Bureau files concerning

a number of individuals associated with the Socialist Workers

Party (SWP) and information from the file on the Institute

IOr POLICy studies (les), as well as the file of former

Bureau informant Earl Robert Merritt, Jr.

On 11/5/75, Bureau representatives Mr. W. R. Wannall,

Mr. R. L. Shackelford, and Mr. D. Ryan furnished depositions

to the HSC concerning numerous matters including Bureau

5 individuals affiliated with the SWP

and this Bureau's investigation of the IPS. HSC representatives

indicated at that time, that these topics will be the sub-

ject of testimony scheduled for public session 11/18/75.

With regard to HSC inquiries concerning the 5 SWP individuals,

the thrust of the inquiries centered around this Bureau's

authority to investigate the SWP and its members, which is

one of the main issues to be resolved in a pending civil

suit which the SWP has

brought against the Bureau.

With

regard to the IPS, HSC inquiries centered around this

Bureau's authority to investigate

this organization, as

/well as public charges

against this Bureay bye

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

U. S. House

Select Committee On Intelligence (HSC)

Earl Robert Merritt, Jr., a former Bureau informant who

furnished information concerning the IPS.

Charges by

Merritt have been publicly refuted by this Bureau. It

is noted that the IPS is also currently involved in

cIvil litigation with this Bureau charging illegal

wiretapping and breaking and entering.

Additionally, on 11/5/75, 2 Bureau Agents

gainst whom. Merritt has levied his unfounded charges, were

deposed by HSC members at which time the Agents were

accompanied by the Departmental Attorney who is handling

this litigation.

OBSERVATIONS:

In view of the pending HSC request for material

relating to lis, as well as intormation pertaining to

Lar1 RObert Merritt

in the IPS civil litigatiom, and to ause the ical witness

representatives have indicated that the questioning of

Bureau officials scheduled for the HSC public hearing on

11/18/75 will involve matters directly related to the

Government's actions in the defense of the civil suits

regaraing both the IPs and SW, it is felt that Departmental

advice should be sought prior to this Bureau responding

to or engaging in further response to the HSC in these areas.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1) That Legal Counsel Division consult with the

Department to obtain advice as to how the Bureau should

respond to HSC requests for materials concerning IPS and

Merritt, and advise the Intelligence Division by memorandum

of the results.

2) Legal Counsel Division should determine from

the Department,

should confine their testimony in either Executive or public

Memorandum from Legal Counsel Division to Mr. Adams

dated 11/5/75 was approved releasing the above INTD personnel from

the provisions of Code of Federal Regulations and existing employ-

ment agreement for the purpose of furnishing a deposition to the HSC

concerning special indices, including ADEX, Cointelpro-type

activities after 1971, electronic surveillance approval procedures,

informants and investigative procedures in the intelligence field.

The INTD personnel were deposed in a small conference room in the

HSC offices, B316, Rayburn House Office Building from 2 p. m.

until approximately 6:15 p.m. Representing the HSC staff, all of

whom participated in the questioning, were Richard Vermeire, Tim

Oliphant, John M. Atkisson and Ellen Miller. Jerry Rudolph and

Mickey Coplan were present as court reporters. The INTD represent-

atives were placed under oath by HSC Staff Director A. Searle Field

who immediately thereafter departed and did not further participate.

No ettort was made to advise the ED represent as i the 74 51l620

Mr. Wannall, pribi to the questioning, querted as to

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re: Houstudy

62-116464

in accordance with the rules of the Committee nothing would be pub-

licized without the knowledge of the FBI. Later in the meeting the

question of classification arose again and the HSC staff members

indicated confusion and an inability to specifically outline the

classification procedure.

The questioning opened with Mr. Wannall being asked if

he had knowledge of any electronic surveillance coverage of Congress-

men. It was subsequently determined the HSC staff had specific

reference to our microphone coverage of a hotel room in New York City

in the 1960's wherein Congressman Cooley, who was associated with

a sugar lobby, was monitored. It also became apparent the question

was based upon information recently furnished to the Committee by

former Assistant to the Director William C. Sullivan. Thereafter a

wide range of responsibilities, activities and operations of the INTD

were discussed in what can only be described as a "shotgun" manner.

Some of the topics discussed, which the Committee staff members

indicated would probably be discussed again in public were: security

index; informant procedures; electronic surveillance matters and

approval procedures; jurisdiction; surreptitious entries; Cointelpro

history, philosophy and techniques; the Socialist Workers Party (SWP);

the Vietnam Veterans Against the War; the institute for Policy Studies

(IPS) investigation; trash covers; former informant Robert Merritt, Jr.;

number of arrests of "soviet illegal agents" and U. S. citizens en-

gaged in espionage; persona non grata matters; retention of FBI

records policy; etc.

Specifically, it was indicated the following

individuals who have been affiliated with the SWP and about whom

there are allegations of improper investigation would be discussed

at public hearings: Kathye Zahrie, Norma Lodico, Bruce Bloy, Mark

Rich, Matilde Zimmerman. Although it was pointed out to the HSC

members of the Committee desired the matters could be discussed

in executive session. Additionally, it was indicated Cointelpro-type

action effected against the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

to preclude it from obtaining a loan, Ralph Abernathy as relates to his

involvement in child molestation, and as relates to Father Taylor (not

further described) would be discussed in forthcoming hearings,

Mr. Oliphant of the HSC staff indicated as soon as the

record of this deposition was transcribed a copy would be furnished

to the FBIfor editing. When this copy is received, you will be

further advised together with appropriate recommendations.

ACTION:

For information. Appropriate Section Chiefs will have

background material prepared as necessary relating to above matters

to be discussed at hearings before the HSC.

On November 4, 1975, Inspector

Thomas

Leavitt and I

briefed Emily Sheketoff of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence with respect to our counterintelligence respon-Pameland

sibilities. At the close of the briefing, Emily Sheketofi

asked if she could be furnished with data concerning infiltration

of Congressional staffs.

On November 5, 1975, Emily Sheketoff called, at which

time I referred her to a letter directed to Mr. Kelley dated

October 22, 1975, from Mr. Aaron B. Donner, Counsel to the

Select Committee.

I noted that Mr. Donner

specifically would

like to know the

extent with which

"Russian spies have

infiltrated our country and Capitol Hill as well." I told

Emily Sheketoff that we were responding to this letter and

answer would cover the question raised by herself. She said

this was not so, and she wanted specific intormation from the

Bureau on those staff members on capitol Hill who were giving

out information to hostile services.

She noted that Mr. Donner's

letter was limited to Russian spies and she stated that

she was

interested in any hostile elements - East German, Polish, or others.

I requested Emily Sheketoff to go to her Chairman

and have the Chairman forward the request to the Bureau in

writing. She said she would do this and would have the letter

in my hands today. I asked that she have the letter forwarded

through regular established channels.

She noted that this would

involve sending the letter to Mr. Michael E. Shaheen, Jr, in the

Justice Department and this always meant delay.

In this case

she stated that she needed the answer certainly by the close of

business on November 7.

I told Emily Sheketoff that I could not

make any commitments but certainly we would put forth our best efforts.

Committee (HSC) Staff, a comment had been made that Army engaged (i

in clandestine operations in the U. S. in concert with the FBI.

As a result, Army was now compiling material which could be pro-

vided to the HSC.

Following consultation with SAW. O. Cregar, it was

concluded that the proposed Army submission to ESC coild be

made available if the target services in each instance were

identified as 'communist intelligence services" throughout,

thus providing additional protection to our bilaicral operations

Since the material furnished indicated that a similar

requesi had been directed to Navy and Air Force and the suspense

date

was 10/15/75, inquiry vas made of Charles Torpy, OStHC,

and Jacl: Donnelley, MISHQ, as to the status, of requests from

those agencies. Neither individual vas avare of the situation

Washington, where her father is a medical doctor.

SE T-1 (8/29/71)

According to this source, KATHY (LNU) and BABAK

The

"UW Daily," a student newspaper published in

Seattle, Washington, on January 13, 1972, page one, carriec

an article by GAIL FLIGSTEIN entitled, "Abortions in Hall

Health?

UW Hospital Prices Too High, says New Group."

KATHLEEN SLEDGE, one of the founders of the campus abortion

reform

group, was quoted as stating, "Hopefully we can raise

seople's consciousness so they can realize an abortion is very

minor surgery."

The group was to hold its first meeting on

January 13, 1972.

In part, according to SLEDGE, the UW Hall

Health Center could perform abortions on students free or

cheaply, whereas the University Hospital charged $300, which

was beyond the average student's limits.

She did not

fore-

see any political

conflicts within the new group.

As of February, 1972, KATHLEEN SLEDGE, 816 Northeast

53rd Street, Seattle, was a member of the YSA.

charges 'political' move to deport him."

According to the

article, BABAK ZAHRAIE, President, UW

Foreign Student Council,

yesterday charged that the United States Immigration and

Naturalization Service (INS) was attempting to deport him

to silence him

politically.

on

a student visa, was arrested by INS, Tuesday and escorted

to

a hearing concerning his re-entry into the United States

on a student visa from Canada.

According to ZAHRAlE, he came

to the Ul in 1969 and is currently a junion student in Mathe-

matics married to the former KATHLEEN SLEDGE of Spokane.

SC 140-429

During early 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE attended a regional

meeting of the YSA at Sacramento State College, Sacramento,

California and a regional meeting of the YSA-SWP at Modesto,

California.

In April, 1971, SIAMAK ZAHRAIE was described as a member

of the Persian Students Union, reportedly made up mostly of

Middle Bast Asians, who have goals similar to ocher Communist-

oriented groups.

He openly referred to himself as a "Trotskyist"

and was of the

opinion the U.S. Government "must go".

During the late spring or early summer of 1971, SIAMAK

ZAHRAIS and his brother, BABAK ZAHRAIE, and other Iranians,

discussed plans to establish a New Persian students organization

in the United States, with an alleged purpose of establishing a

revolutionary base in Iran and installing a socialist Government.

The existing Persian students organization was at that time con

sidered ineffective by SIAMAK and BABAK ZAHRAIE.

BABAS LAHRAIE preVIOUSLY had indicated & determination to subseltut.

Communism for the present form of Government in Iran. SIAMAR ZARRA:

shares this same ideology.

According to surce in 1971, SIAMAR ZAHRAIE, had frequentl;

stated his desire to personally kill

all of the present members of

the ruling family of Iran

and their administration.

Miss WILSON advised that employee is extremely

interested in the study of animals and is very excited and

happy about her present position. She recommended the em

ployee highly for Government employment.

On 6/6/74, Mr. NORMAN W. ZIRBEL, Vice President

of Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company, Room 1912,

Exchange Building, Seattle, advised he and his wife have

been good friends of DI. J. N. SLEDGE and his wife,

the

parents of the employee

who reside in Spokane, Washington.

They became acquainted in 1952 and have been very

close friends since that time.

He said KATHY was an extremely bright student in

high school, graduating with honors

and being among the Top

Ten students in her class scholastically. He said she was

very athletic and is a very pleasant and industrious girl.

He has not seen her very much since she came to the UW in

1969 but has the impression that due to her idealistic

nature, KATHY became sympathetic toward the underprivileged

and later this led her into marrying one BABAK ZAHRAIE,

whom he believes she married out of sympathy and to prevent

BABAK from being deported to Ixan.

He said his knowledge

concerning this, however, was obtained

from KATHY's parents.

He also heard she planned to divorce. BABAK but

has been held up in securing the divorce because she could

not locate him to serve divorce papers. MI. ZIRBEL advised

he and his wife have read in the newspaper that BABAK ZAHRAIE

was accused of engaging in political activities against his

native country and also that he was charged with being

pert Dr. James Heckman testified to the contrary.

The Indians

"know much more

about the fish

and fishing than many

of us learn in college,"

he said. According to Heckman's figures, the In-

dians take only

5 to 6 percent of the total catch

in the area, the rest going to sports fishing and

commercial catches.

Over the past 50 years the annual salmon catch

. ordinator.

Lane also pointed out that "the state has ailed

to recognize the fac that the treaty rights of In-

dians never belonged to the state in the first place.

They were original rights held by the Indians

before there was a state and reserved for them-

selves in an honored agreement with the federal

government while Washington was still a territory."

Furthermore, the federal government has allowed

the state to develop two completely different cases.

The fisheries department argues that it does rec-

ognize treaty rights, and simply asks the court

to determine the scope of those rights so it can

regulate them. The game department, on the other

hand, says the Indians

have no treaty rights,

- and refuses to concede that it should allow any

tribal fishing at all.

Despite these

obstacles, the Indians say they

are determined to

"fight as our ancestors have

for over 100 years iur our rights, as the original

inha'sitants of this land, to lish and sustain our-

selves."

1975, of Unit Chief Janes C. Kraus.

It ras explained to Vernalre

that

the method of selection by the House Select Committee was such

that the Committee was not obtaining the best possible witnesses and

that in most inetances

it would be beneficial for both the Committee

and the Bureau for the Bureau to have an Input into the witness

selection process.

It was indicated to Vermeire that the Burea

mon learning of the tople that was the subject of a beasing coula

suggest the witness that would be the nost knowledgeable concerning

that particular batter and, more importantly, be in a fosition

address policy questions which night arise during a hearing.

Vernette stated that,

generally, in the future le 1o

tended to consult the bureau priot to requestins a particular

witness s0 that the conmittee night avoin prchlans such as those

that mere posed during the testimony of Unit Chiei James C. Kraus.

He stated that he could not make a coumitment for the Committee

that the

. Bureau would have an Input into the witnesd selection

process; however, he stated that both be and Tlothy Oliphant,

Staft Member of the House Select Committee, felt strongly that

their procedures concerilng witness sclection had to be changed

alons the ther stated khove and that their views

accepted byMall Bommittee Itself.

This recommends House Select Committee on

file material under same guidelines which were applied when

we permitted Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSC)

Staff access to it.

Letter from Department 10/6/75 forwarded HSC

request dated 10/3/75 requesting that we deliver "all files,

memoranda and materials found in former Director, J. Edgar

Hoover's safe, after his death." Department memorandum

requested discussion with us regarding response to HSC

request. From 10/9/75 to 10/21/75, Michael E. Shaheen, Jes

and Steven Blackhurst, Special Counsels for Intelligence

Coordination of the Department, negotiated with the HSC on

On 1 12/75, ent,

this request. On 10/21/75, Mr. Blackhurst informed us that

the HSC will accept the same guidelines which applied in

our granting SSC access to 0 & C material. Single copies

of the aforementioned gutdeline f"ph aforementioned"

correspondence are attached.

Procedure followed with SBEC-3D

BEC 30 1444 - 1415

'to first make

available for review the excised summaries of the 0 & C

files prepared by the Inspection Division. Review of these

summaries, while not disclosing derogatory information to

which the Committees are not privy, served to have the SfG -

3ENGISURE eliminate from further consideration some files which were

of no interest to the SSC.

Thereafter, Supervisor Hughls NOV 4 1975

Mallet, now of Legal Counsel Division,

met with Committee

Staff, holding possession of the actual 0 & C files and

responding, according.: to guidelines, to inquiries by Staff

for pertinent information.

This procedure satisfied SSC

requirements and it is hoped that following the same process

will satisfy HSC, while protecting our interests.

Memorandum to Mr.

W. R. Wannall

Re:

Houstudy 75

62-116464

The 0 & C material is, of course, closely held

and it will be necessary initially for Mr. Mallet to meet

with HSC Statt for the handling of the 0 & C material,

inasmuch as he is most familiar with the necessary process.

However, in view of Mr. Mallet's other current responsibilities,

a representative of the Intelligence Division will be phased

into this process as soon as possible.

Richard Vermiere, HSC Staff Member, informed

Supervisor Paul V. Daly, Legal Counsel Division, 10/21/75,

that he

would like to begin review of O & C material 10/23/75.

However, on 10/22/75, he told Mr. Daly that he would be out

of town on 10/23 and 10/24/75 and would therefore contact

us thereafter to make arrangements for review of this material.

SUBJECT:

0 E C FIles AccEss

the procedures which were adopted on Jily 24, 1975, wal

ultimately apply to access quactions molved in the 0 & C Files.

In order that there is consistoney in reaction to this question,

I have discussed the C & C Files and our concurns about them with

the Senate Sclact Committee staff and have reached an agreement

which the Dureau finds most satisfactory. The agreement, which

I proposs to carry out, is as follows:

the tams. of the Procedures.

derogatos, infomation, access will be withera; roweves, ene

file wis be held in the duotocy of spectal sant too already

nas detailed knowledge of it, and who what answer procedural a

PROSECO Elbanave questschs, at the recuast of the sse star

in an intowiew tomat. The derogatory information will, thus,

not be disclosed, ad the SSC staff members do not want to have

it; however, the infonration as to the procedures wich resuited

in the collection of the derogatory information, and any disposi-

tion as it, will be to the extent reflected by the file made

available to the Senate Select Cormittee staff members.

I think that this system is a most satisfactory arrangerent

fron the position of discharge of the mandate of the Senate Select

Cormittce, discharge of our responsibilities regarding the files,

and protection of the privacy of all irdividuals involved.

Unless directed to the contrary, the Bureau and this Office

will proceed as indicated above.

Mr. Clarence M. Kelley, Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

United States Department of Justice

Washington, D.C. 20535

Dear Mr. Kelley:

HousTuDy, 7'

I want to thank you for your reply to my inquiry concerning Bureau operations

within Berkeley.

I would like to follow up that reply with an additional

inquiry into some of the policy matters which underpin that response.

1. I was frankly surprised to note the size of the contingent of Agents op-

1975

erating from the Berkeley Field Office (19), and would appreciate knowing

how this compares to other cities of 100,000 population?

In addition,

how does this compare to other cities of 100,000 population which are

located within a Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area of the size of

the San Francisco-Oakland SMSA and which have other major offices

this instance offices are located in San Francisco and Oakland at least)?

2. What are the Bureau's policies regarding "affirmative action" or assignment

to areas with substantial minority communities? Berkeley has a Black

population of some 25% and a population of other minorities around 10%,

yet the Field Office is 100% white/male.

Is this a situation which the

Dear Mr. Jones:

As you are aware, I have been concerned for some time about the nature of the

Bureau's involvement in local law enforcement affairs. This concern has been

heightened by my appointment to the House Select Committee to Investigate the

U.

S. Intelligence Community.

In this light, I am requesting answers to the

following questions concerning FBI activity in Berkeley:

1. What is the size of the contingent of agents in the Berkeley field office?

2.

What are the functional responsibilities in the field office, and what are

the percentages of agents involved in each, i.e., political, drug abuse,

criminal, etc.?

3.

What are the titles of the agents, and how do these relate to their

involvement in category two?

4. What is the ethnic and sexual breakdown of the staff and agents in the

Berkeley field office?

5. What are the interactions and working relationships between the field

office, the Berkeley Police Department, the University of California

Police Department, private security agencies and informers? How many

informers are utilized by the field office?

6. Recent disclosures have raised serious questions regarding the Bureau's

involvement in political surveillance activities of organizations and

individuals over the past several years. What actions has the local

field office taken to correct the abuses of these actions, and what

Dear Congresaman Dellums:

1975

This is in response to your letter dated

May 28, 1975, sent to the

Senior Resident Agent

of the Berkeley, California, FBI Resident Agency.

To clarify your inquiries, it should be noted

the Resident Agency et Berkeley, California, operates

under the general

supervision of the FBI'

San Francisco Office.

There are currently nineteen Special Agents

assigned to the Berkeley Resident Agency. All are white

males.

The function of a resident agency is to handle

all FBI matters within its specific geographical

territory.

This Includes criminal, security ano

applicant investigations.

The FBI does not have primary

jurisdiction regarding drug matters and does not

conduct "political" investigations.

As a matter of policy, the FBI advises other

governmental law enforcement agencies of mtters coming

to our attention which are within the investigative

jurisdiction of those agencies.

concurrent jurisdiction and a joint investigation may

be conducted; however, local law enforcement agencies

do not have access to

• FBI files.

Representatives

of private security agencies may be contacted from

time to time in the

course of discharging our official

responsibilities just as any other citizens may be

contacted.

The FBI also utilizes the services of

informants to develop information conceming matters

within this Bureau's investigative jurisdiction; hovever,

it would be inappropriate for me to discuss more

specifically the number of such informants or the manner

in which they are utilized.

Honorable Ronald V. Dellung

As I have already Indicated, the FBI does not

conduct "political" investigations, nor do we conduct

"political surveillances."

We do, oI course, have a

responsibility for conducting domestic intelligence

investigations authorized under legislative enactments,

Presidential Directives and instructions of the

Attorney General. These matters relate to espionage,

sabotage, treason, sedition, and other activities

Involving the internal security of the United states.

The policias relating to such investigations are

not made on an ad hoc basis by individual

Agents or individual offices, but conform with broad

policy applicable to all offices.

The FBI offers a variety of courses of

instruction for law entorcement personnel throughout

the United States, including such subjects as

anti-sniper and survival training and special weapons and

tactics, commonly known as "SWAT"

The basic purpose

of this training is to provide well prepared

teams capable of resolving highly dangerous situations

with a minimum of risk to innocent bystanders, the law

enforcement personnel involved and the subjects of the

Some Intelligence Agencies Don't Report on Electronic Surveillance

Equipment

NBC reported Wednesday that some of the federal intelligence

agencies that are required by law to report on the quantity

of electronic surveillance equiprent yearly have refused to

comply with the requirement.

Carl Stern (NBC) reported that in 1968, FBI Director

J. Edgar Hoover declined to furnish such information to

Attorney General Ramsey Clark because he didn't like him

or trust him.

"The Central Intelligence Agency not only

ignored the order but three months ago when asked by the

Justice 'Department why it wasn't obeying reporting require-

ments, said it was not and would not and indicated that it

alone would be the judge of what the law requires.

The

Justice Department has not chosen to press the matter,"

Stern said. The Secret Service has not reported in the

past but is now, he added.

When asked for copies of the reports from the various

agencies, the Justice Department said it had lost them and

had to ask the agencies for dupiicates.

"So much for supervisión of electronic eavesdropping.

With that sort of vigilance it is not hard to understand

how abuses occur even if laws and regulations are coming

out of our ears," Stern said. -- NBC Today Show
