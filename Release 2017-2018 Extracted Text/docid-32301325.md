TRO-CHINESE PRESS IN FRANCE JES ARTiC pRena

In the last year, the number of newspapers advocating

the

theses of "Chinese communism" has increased considerably.

The three pro-Chinese organizations which exist in france have

striven to create, individually, several press organs. (S)

Launched

in February, 1965,

Marseilles, this newspaper was a monthly Rene

until 1966.

The first weekly issue appeared on October 6,:

1966.

The edition was

55,000 copies. On October 12, 1967

the edition dropped to 18,200/copies.

It is printed at

Meaux (Seine-et-Marne), but its offices are located at 40,

boulevard Magenta, Paris (10me. ).

The managing director of the

paper is Mr. Francois Marty. The chief editor is Mr. Regis

Bergeron.

(5)

In addition to this weekly (which has the highest

number of copies as far as the pro-Mao press is concerned),

the M. C. F. (M. L.) puts out a number of papers which appear

As a matter of fact, they are more similar to

"tracts for cells" than to regular newspapers. However,.they

all have claims to being the first stage toward the feation

of local publications appearing at fixed intervals.

The more vigorous of these publications is 'Eveil

Proletarien'/ (Proletarian Awakening), organ of the eagene

France

which occasionally rates the honor

of radio broadcasts in French from Peking and Tirana.: Mention

For a while, the leadership of the M. C. F.

(M. L.) has contemplated resuming publication of this paper

in the form of a bulletin for internal liaison.

At the present

time, pending the transformation of the movement into a party,

the P. C. F. (M. L.), ambitions are growing and there is

under study the launching of a "quarterly theoretical review"

before the end of 1967. If this materializes, the pro-Chinese

Communist Party will have an organ comparable to the "Notebooks

of Communism"' of the French Communist Party. S)

Speaking of the M. C. F.
