With regard to PHILLIP BEITOR, who has been reported previouely

to have been bookkeeper for the MANNArING organization, on

5/15/61, PG 545-0 advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III aS

follows:

PHIL BETTOR has an upstairs apartment, consisting of bedroom, bath,

kitchen and living room, in a bullding he owns on Route 35o neax

the junction of Route 66, RD 2, Apollo, Fa.

The lower floor of

this building 16

"Dave "s

ยก Market,"

a grocery store operated by DAVE

NAHEY, who 18 BELTOR's brother-in-law,

Since BETTOR le unmarried

he lives alone but Mr. and Mrs. DAVE NAMET live in an apartment

next to his.

BETTOR works daily in his Army Surplus Store on Fifth Avenue,

New Kensington, Pa.

On Thursday and Saturday the store is open

until 9PIl and on other days, except Sunday, it closes at 6PM.

Generally, BETTOR goes home to hie apartment after his store closes

although occasionally he has "dates"

with Jewish friends.

BEFTOR

no longer frequente the clubs in New Kensington but once

in awhile

he goes to the various supper clubs in Monroeville, Fa.

If BETTOR still keeps books for the MANNARINOs, it is unlikely that

he does so at his apartment

It ie more probable that he keeps them

in hte second floor office at the rear of his store, where there

are necessary items like adding machines end file cabinets.

Informant, who can visit BETTOR either at his apartment or his

store, will attenpt to obtain more information to resolve the

question concerning baron and the

MANNARING boOks.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANCEROUS.
