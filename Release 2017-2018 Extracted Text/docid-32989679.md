MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

This informative memorandum to recoril inquiry of

Department concerning tapes of microphone surveillances on

Martin Luther King, JI.

On 2/5/76, Supervisor S. F. Phillips, INTD, returned

a call to Hr. Quintan J. Shea,

on the beputy Attorney

General's (DAG) Staff, who said he had been informed by Clviz

Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Pottinger that

Supervisor Campbell was the custodian of the King tapes and

Shea desired some information from Campbell. It was explained

to Shea that Pottinger was apparently given a vrong impression

As to the

"custodian" of the tapes, shea was told that;

in Bureau records they are charged to Section Chief J. G. Deegan

and maintained in the latter's office but that if Shea wants

to talk to the person most knowledgeable as to the tapes, it was

Phillips.

Shea then said that his purpose in calling was a

desire to protect the DAG relative to a pending suit wherein

someone is attempting

; to obtain the tapes.

He said that it was

necessary that he give advice to the DAG to support an appeal

regarding a denial of information to the person seeking the tapes.

Shea indicated that research resulted in a determination that the

privacy issue relating to King himself could not be raised as

King is dead but that the Department was exploring the privacy

issues as relating to the King family. At this point,

Phillips

inquired as to whether or not Shea was aware of the efforts

which vere initiated by the King family through its attorneys

to obtain FBI files concerning King.

Shea said he was not

familiar with this fact and itias suggested to him that he

the tapes which

he frequently referred to as the "sex tapes" but wanted to have

some idea

of their contents.

It was explained to him that while

the tapes' contents vere primarily of personal activitles,

, they

were not to the exclusion of other matters such as discussions

of current events, civil rights issues and conversations

between King and his advisors.

Phillips inquired of Shea as to exactly what he

ranted to know that he would use in his advice to the DAG.

Ile stated that he would like to know whether or not the

revelation of these tapes would be embarrassing to the King

Family and whether or not it would lead to an harassment of

the family. He was told that such revelation would be

embarrassing but that it was not clear what he meant by

harassment.

He then asked whether such revelation would likely

result in the family being submitted to questions from the

press that might be harassing to them.

He was told that such

revelations tould quite likely so result. Concluding, Phillips

told him that if he desired any more information, it might be

best for Phillips to visit his office.

He responded that he did

not anticipate any further needs in this matter.

ACTION:

None. For information.
