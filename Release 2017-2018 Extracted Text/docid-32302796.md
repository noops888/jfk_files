Re New York airtel 9/16/64 (5)

On 10/4 and 10/8/64, CG 5908-S, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, furnished SAs HERBERT K.

STALLINGS and ROBERT R. GLENDON

information on a contact with

HOMER BATES CHASE at CHASE's residence in Dorchester, Mass.,

on 10/2-3/64.

During this contact CHASE spoke of his recent trip

to Albania and the fact that he did attend the Albanian

Conference.

CHASE stated that he and his wife attended this

conference

but did

not indicate that any other person from the

U.S. had attended. (ul)

S) As this was the first meeting between CHASE and

CG 5908-S and as this informant was at a disadvantage during

his meeting with CHASE since CHASE had brought along five

other individuals for discussion at the meeting, it was

impossible for him to press for details concerning CHASE'S

participation in the Albanian Conference. Neither was he

able to specifically ask if other individuals from the u.s.

had attended this conference.
