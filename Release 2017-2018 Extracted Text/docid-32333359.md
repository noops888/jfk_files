contacted and have indicated a desire to be cooperativern

They indicated they planned

to place the

"Angelina" in dry dock for major repairs and would

keep the San Juan Office advised concerning the activities

of the "Angelina"

Portions

the information cortained in enclosed

letterhead memorandum were previously submitted under the

caption of

"RECE" by referenced San Juan airtel, however, for

the interest of clarity, this information is being restated

in enclosed letterhead memorandum.

The following agencies were contacted for the purpose

of effecting close liaison and to determine what action these

agencies were taking to prevent the departure of unauthorized

anti-CASTRO raiding groups from the San Juan area:

Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) TYRUS E.

MINNIX, Deputy District Director, advised his office in San Juan

has received no instuctions regarding steps he should take

to prevent the departure of unauthorized anti-CASTRO rading

groups. He stated he would contact

regarding the crew of the "Angelina" and would request

his office in Miami, Florida,

• the Miami

office of INS to obtain from the coordinator of Cuban affairs their ai-

vice relative to the serving of prevention of departure notices

on the members of the crew of the "Angelina."

He staced that the

serving of this notice is the only action which his agency can

take to discourage unauthorized anti-CASTRO raids. He also

advised he would, in the future, take the same steps regarding

any aliens that came to his attention as possibly being involved

in plans to initiate raids against Cuba.

U. S. Coast Guard - RICHARD J. HIGHSTREET, Captain

of the Port Office, advised

the Coast Guard is periodically

boarding the "Angelina" so that the crew of the

will be aware that the Coast Guard does not intend to allow

that boat to leave the island with arms aboard.

He advised that other than routine patrols the Coast

Guard does not have specific plans to discourage anti-CASTRO

raiding groups

He stated, however, that

on receipt of information, indicating the planned departure

of an anti-CASTRO raid from Puerto Rico, the Coast Guard

will make every effort to prevent the departure of the, raiding

party.

U. S. Customs - JESUS M. MARTINEZ, Customs Agent

in Charge, and MANUEL F. CASANOVA, Assistant Customs Agent

in Charge, advised the interest of their agency lies in possible

violations of the Neutrality Act by the exportation of arms

or munitions from san Juan for the purpose of carrying out

acts of aggression against Cuba.

In this regard, they

stated they had boarded the "Angelina" on

• two occasions

had not encountered any arms or munitions. They stated that

on receipt of specific information relating to planned departures

of exiled groups from San Juan in the possession of arms or

munitions, their agency would cooperate in every way in the seizure

of these arms and munition.

They further indicated they had

received no instructions from their headquarters in Miami, advis-

ing them to conduct any investigation relative to planned anti-

CASTRO raids:

San Juan has conducted considerable investigation

regarding the "Angelina" in connection with the attack which

took place in Havana harbor on Cetober 14, 1965. This information

is reported under the caption of "RECE"
