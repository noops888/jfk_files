his own initiative. He said he loft Mexico City on 30 May and arrived in

Moscow on 3 June.

(He did not say then ho returned to Nedco.) He gave no

reason for the trip, but said he had "evoral conferences and meetings" in

soscow. Subject interjected that he thought the trip might have had somethang

to do with the Middle East erisis, sinco it troke out just' about the time

XAZANISEV left. KAZAiTSEV laughed spontaneously at this tdoa and replied

that what he know about the riddle fast wouldn't do anyone any good. He

then. went

on to say he had soont, his first weekend in Moscow with his son,

who shortly thereafter left for his sunner

.j0o in "Siberia." He said he'

spent the second weekend (10-11 Juno) with his daughter. The daughter.

according to KAZANISSV, had planned to do "south" for a 2-3 week vacation in

early Jure, but postponed the vacation when she learned her father was

coming: (Tha Implication, according to. Subject, was thut KAZA'SEV's trip:

came about fairly suddenly.) What KAZAITSEY was most interested in talking

about, however, was the fact, he had unexpectedly had had to take his English

proficiency test in loscow. He consequently set aside the last three days

of his stay for the test, which can often take that long. The first day

_Is taken up by an oral test, and li one passes that, he goes on to the writtan

test, which càn take up to two days. KAZAiTSEV,

'however, did so well on

the oral test that he was exemsted from the written test. He said his

examiners gave hin á "4n (on a 1-5 scale) and would have given him a "5s.

MEMO OF CONVERSATION

Leila BELAVAL, Visa Officer or U.S. Endassy.

1. I talked to Lella today about her contact with the Sovier who brought

BAZAROV's passport In for a visa yesterday. She Identifled the Soviet from

a photograph as Valent in SergeyevIch LOGINOV, and sald that he is always

the one who comes to the U.S. Embassy for visas. She did nor recognize:

the photograph of Vladislav Sergeyevich KORMUSHKIN, the Vice Consul.

Actually, Lella believed that LOGINOV was a Vice Consul, sald she always

asks for him as such when she has to call the Soviet Embassy.

A 2. Apparently yesterday was not the first time that LOGINOV has tried

to make a date with Letla. She says that he always asks her what she does

in her free cime, and that she has put him off by saying that she is very busy.

Once shexx he asked her whether she spent her free time with other people

ax from the Embassy and was surprised to hear that she usually spends her

off bours with non-Embassy friends. Yesterday LOGINOV again asked hér

what she did in the evenings, and she said she was especlally busy now

because she lias started taking guitar lessons.

•He mentioned some Soviet

dance group that was coming to Moxico in a month.or so and sald he would

like to invite her to go to sce them with him. He also told her he was not

marrled. Lella sald she did not refuse the Invitation outright but said chat

she did not know whether she would be free when they carne or not.

3. I told Leila a few of the facts of Soviet life: that all Soviets have to

be marrled in order to go overseas, that LOGINOV Is-a KGB. officer and

was obvlously trying to get his foot in the door of the U.S. Embassy through

her, that he'was unisubtedly disappointed to hear that she did not spend

all her free time with other Embassy people, etc. Leila has evluently been

unsure about how to react to: LOGINOV's advances, has not wanted to be

rude to him, and seemed relleved when I suggested that she simply decline

his invitations by always being busy. She says she does not like his slick

manner at all, and I gather that she has felt uneasy in having to deal with

him,, but now that someone has told her how to react she will have no problem.

4. Lella mentioned that LOGINOV knows English but Is reluctant co

He once read off the visa stamped in a passport in peffect English,

and he also read a copy of the new visa regulations in English (to himself,

but evidently understanding ir all). According to the new regulations,

Sovlets no longer need visas for continuous iransit of the U.S. (I.e., on the

same flight), but LOGINOV insisted on gerting a visa for BAZAROV in spite

of this. (This Is confirmed in LIENVOY.) --

MATE OF MATING: 11 May 1967

- P-581

I. liy last meeting with Subjoct was on 23 Karch, at.

which time the agreed to provide information on LOGINOV

obtained during their normal business contact and iny further

zocial contact initiated by hlm. She was to call me after

their next date..or

any other cignificant contact the hnd with

him. sinco I had not heard from her, I called her at her

apartment about 2115 on 11 May. I apologized for calling so

late, but

said I had juit got out of work and had a package

for her i had brought back from the States which I

wanted

to deliver before the contents got stile, Could I drop over

that night or perhaps another evening.

Subject. Immediately

recognized the "package" as the Benson and Hedges cigarettes

I had promised her, gently protested, and then told me she

whe

not feeling well, but the doctor had told her she had

"to eat, and it so happened she was just going out for a bito:: "

when I called. I consequently suggested we have dinner together,

which we did from 2145-1215 at the Gondola. Afterwerds, wo

went

around the corner to her apartment for a nightcap until

0200.

?. Subject had lost 8 or 10 pounds and looked a bit thin

and not as attractive as I had remembered her. She told me

she was simoly working too hard and not eating

and sleeping

properly. I had come fear that she might have had come second

thoughts in the seven wecks since she had agreed to cooperate,

but it proved unfounded. She this time was relaxed from the

start, was very friendly, and

seemed to onloy the opportunity

to set out. (She later told me in her apartment that she didn't

5o out much, liked to spend her evenings at home reading,

Ilstening to records, tending to her dwars trees, etc.) She

wide it clear from the start that she hadn't changed her mind

by werning me half-seriously and half-playfully that I shouldn't

think I could "buy" her with sifts.

"You've bought me up here,"

she said, tapping her head with her forefinger. "That'g

the only way you'll get anywhere with me." Most of the evening

was spent in general and (especlally back at her apartment)

Increasingly fuszy discussion of Israel, the Jews, her 100,

the Russians "as people," her very humanintic philosophy about

l1c, and I don't

exactly remember what else. She is definitely

a mart girl, but I think less profound and sophisticated than

she tries to appear. Otherwise, she seems to be a very sincere

person, and she has liven me no reason to doubt or suspect

anything she has told me.

3o Contact with TOGNOV. Subject said she hadn't been

out with LOGINOV sinco our list meeting and had had ants one

ince-to-lace contact with him.

She sald this was a little

over a month

ago fearly April) and was occasioned by fer

offorts to help a ollent br the name of or. Jury Kurner get

a soviet visa..

She isid TiLin 19 E dentist and definitely

a Communist sympathizer, if not a Communist. (aUTTER has

out, however, he nau a nard ture evei gutting a soviet visa.

Subject finally called: LOGINOY herself to try to push thinga

Blong. but TOGINOV showed no willingness to racilitate things.

(LIENvOY hes subject on the phone to LOGINOV on 5 April.

After aisoussing KUTTLER's case, Subject, remarked to tOGINOV

that she understood that lyou. (ustedes) must have some reason

not to want to give him (KUTTISh) the vian." LOCINOV replied

that there were "reasons enough,")

Ho A day on two after her telephone conversation with Loosior,

Subject said

she went over to the Soviet Imbassy personally to

see 1s she could got anywhere with LOGINOV. LOQINOV received

her cordially, and for the first time asked her into his

offico, (she said lt was the first office off the outside

Reception Room), She egain asked LOGIVOr. to try to stretasty

speed up the granting of KUrTLiP's VIsa. LOGINOY hermed and

hawed, Indicating that he wasn't even sure the yisa would be

granted.

Fe finally told Subject that look, he had gore to

SoaR for dental work once, and uppers had charged him ruda

too mueb, Consequently, he said, he wasn't going to givo hia

a visa.

Subject said she could not tell it the destist pill

was the real reason for LOGINOVly nogative attitude, but kbea

she persisted; LOGINOV finally relented and the following

exchange ensued:

Subject:

"All right....in thát case, let me in the name

LOGINOV:

I don't mean that."

rodINoy then went on to say that as he had mentioned to her

before, he would like her to introduce hin to "someone who

would be simpathetic to us" (1.f., to the Soviets). LOGINOV

emphanired that he realized subject might not agree with this

"someone's" ideas, but stated that he knew subject was the

type of person no "had respect for other people's views.""

subject said that she replied in a casual, almost flinpant

manner that "well, sure, if she met such a person, sherd

Introduce them." With this the eibject was dropped and subject

left.

Se Htc0zr-5. Subject on her own initiative began telling

me what a terrific guy her boss 19.

ever

met.

it the same time he is extremely intelligent and shrewd.

"If he can't get what he wants through cham, he does It by

pure sarewdness." This 1s why he is such a successful businessman.

In reply to a question about LICOZI-5's baciground, Subject

said he had tien born in toland, was imprisoned by either the

roles or Germans just before or during world war II (abo was

rather vague on this point, ard I confined myself to listening),

sorehow got out and joined the Russians, taking part in the

soviet Invasion of cemany. Sonehow he hed survired all this,

Baöle on the

subject of tocryov, sunject said she "supposed""

Subjeet, who sailed faintly when I mentioned his using the

was to it. Thoy never discussed politics, and even if LocINoy

Interest in politics.

as surprised as I, Introduced him as Alejandro ALVAREZ (20

had in fact just|recently returned ron a three week trip. to

Germany. He spoke some English.

To The appearance of ALVARIZ, who by now was ordering his

first of two martiniss seemed to end any remaining chances of

setting angwhere with the girl. As It worked out, however,

his appearance had just the opposite effect, because it provided

more than an hour: of conversation on an Inoreasingly frierdly?

and personal level.: sy her second drink, Subject was even

managing a sew laughs...

Eventually we got onto the subjeot.of

delighted to toil me about both. It then turned out that her

mother who Subject sald Is a U.S. citizen-had lived In Moldavia;

had told her daughter vivid stories of pogroms carried out by

the Russians assings the Jews, and had fled Rumania before the

Invading Russians (evidently during World War II.) The fact

that I had been In Humanis and Moldavia was good for another

ten minutes of conversation and seemed to Impress subject far

beyond its worth..

and thanked her. He then asked if she were going on the Consular

Corpg.tour of the lexican Home Show on 3 March.

Well, n0g

subject replied, why would she be, she wasn't a consul or married

to one, nid consequently hadh't been invited. LOGINOV repiled

that he thought she should go and therefore he was making her

an honorary Soviet consul. Subject sold that was fine with her

and she'd see him at. the Home' Show. (I told Sibleet on 28

february to be careful with LOGINOV, because he was an experienced

KGB officer and one, of the most able men in the Sovlot Imbassy.

Cocktail Party with Official

1.

• At a party giyen by the local head of the Consula!

Corps Association on 28 June, the undersigned met and agair

chatted with Valentin S. LOCINOY of the Soviet Embassy..

also met for the

first time Jan Jakowiec of the Polish Embassy

who

was Introduced to undersigned by LOGINOV.

2.

As USual LOGINOV spent most of the time converaing

with

undersigned provocating him on a nümber of issues..

undersigned answered, making a few similar comments about the

Chinese Civil War.

Then LOGINOV mentioned Vietnam, undereigned

felt it would be nice if the Soviets helped the U.S. to

bring peace to that area so they could concentrate more-on

the Chinese Communist danger.. At one point in the conversation

undersigned Jokingly. asked LOGINOV if there were Soviét

nationals in North Vietnam.

many advisors there."

The

The latter said,

"sure, we have

undersidnged said,

110g..

what he

meant was behind guns or'in the seats of airplanes." •LOGINOV

said absolutely not.

It also seems that LOGINOV has been

keeping track of the people' he sees undersigned talking with

at cocktail

parties.

For example, LOGINOV was curious to

know if undersigned has seen

"his Haitian friend$."

Undersigned

asked which one the black one of the white one. LodIno

satd.thet

wbite one, referring to the Haitian Vice Consul whom

undersigned occasionally talks to

Undersigned said he had

seen the Haitian 'at the Haitian, National Day about a month

ago but noted that the only Soviet present at that party was

ANDREYEV, not LOGINOV. " The latter, incidentally, corners

the Haitlans' anytime he. has a chance

to, although he officially

poo poos the Haitian regime. 'LOGINOV once more asked under

signed when he would come play tennis with bim (this is about

the fourth

or fifth time).

Undersigned told him he would do

so after he gets invited by LOGINOV as the latter has often

promised to do.

One of the topics that LOGINOV mentioned

was the Protection Section of the Embassy. "Protection against

whom,"

the usual lowdown:

on

the

LOGINOV must have been interested in the section as he

mentloned

that a U.S. Vice-Consul working in that section whom he had

JAKOWIEC appears to be a man who likes to talk. His

Spanish 1s quast bi-lingual and JAKONIEC says, by the way,

His wiie 1s & plump, vers

Polong woman erased conversation was to caust

at some of the exchanges between LOGINOV and the undersigned.

Both Mr. and Mrs: JAKOWIEC appear to speak fluent Russian.

At one point in the conversation undersigned mentioned there

1s hardly a Pole 1p Poland who does not have a relative in

the United States; JAKOWIEC agreed and commented that while the

Poles are close to Americans in many things they are not so

Pleased at other things that the U.s. does.

Undersigned

deferred this discussion of this point for another meeting.

'As many of the Consular Corps members know that undersigned

served many years in Vietnam,

the latter felt that he should

not hide

this fact to the official bloc representatives as

they would find out about it anyway.

This came out for the

first time on the occasion of this cocktail party when

JAKOWIEC somehow mentioned Vietnam and the efforts of the

Polish members of the Armistice Commission there..

The

undersigned, who has known a number of these people quite well,

told JAKOWIEC that they speak French better than Polish as

they were sons of Polish emigrants to France who returned to

Poland after Gomulka took power.

When JAKOWIEC started to

imply that this indicates how wonderful

things were in Poland,

undersigned pointed out that the parents of the returnees, ..

many of whom

worked under very difficult conditions in France

in the coal mines, preferred the hard work to the chance of

working in Communist Poland.

The next cocktall party held by the Consular Assn.

will probably be held

at the Soviet Embassy.

of the Association told

undersigned that LOGINOV had asked him

for his agreement to hold the next party at his Embassy.

large attendance of official bloc representatives can therefore

be expected at the next get-together.:

PERSONALITY ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE

1. This is a new, experimental version of the Persônality Assessment

Questionnaire (sometimes informally called the PRQ Ill) which has been in

use for several years.

This new form is largely a checklist and thus requires

far less essay-type reporting than the previous form.

a. For. a number of years, our operational psychologists have been de

raloping a system for indirect assessment of target personalities

The

system employs-in lieu of psychological tests and interviews-observations

of appearance, manner, and style of behavior. Such observations are

used as it they were items in a psychological test, and like test items, are

weighted and analyzed to yield a personality profile: Working from the

profile, operational psychologists describe the target personality's basic

aptitudes, attitudes, motives and susceptibilities.

The goal of the assess-

ment is to identify feasible means of influencing the target person.

3. Reliability is vastly increased when two or more observers complete

this questionnaire independently.

All items need not be completed; in fact;

it. is a rare case. where contact is sufficient to complete it fully. You are

encouraged to guess where complete information is lacking.

Mark such

items with a "G." instead of the customary check mark or "X." Thus, an

observer with very limited contact can be expècted to enter more "G's'

than

"X's."

(Check the most appropriate description.)

•An active, alert individual with a purposeful stride who appears

to have a very practical mind. He enjoys "fixing things,"

pears fo have sound knowledge of automobiles, and drives in c

relaxed efficient manner:

An active individual who is somewhat standoffish (or negative)

toward others. His stride is fast and intent. He appears to

have a practical mind, is quite possessive and protective and

is reluctant to share his possessions with ottiers.. He "Fixes

things" in a matter-of-fact way, appedrs to have good know

ledge of automobiles, and drives in a determined (sometimes

even hostile) but efficient manner.

An active, alert individual with a free-ard-easy stride who

appears möst of the time to be in good humor. Seldom tiles

to fix things, but is often quite good at getting others to fix

things for him. He appears to have little knowledge of auto-

mobiles but drives in a relaxed, efficient manner.

An active individual who has a cautious finge to his walk as

though he is easily embarrassed or easily startled. He appears

rather helpless and awkward when he has to "fix things." He :

evidently has little knowledge of automobiles and drives in à

careful (sometimes tense) but efficient manner.

A well-controlled and attentive individual who walks in

something of a clipped, formal ranner. Although generally

practical, he seldom will do anything by "feel." He must

read up and prepare himself when required to "fix things."

He appeais to have acquired considerable knowledge about

automobiles but drives in a somewhat mechanical or highly

controlled manner.

A well-controlled individual who is often somewhat preoccu

pied even in his walk. When he takes time to "fix things" he

does so with intensity and precision. He is often very well

read about automobiles and cares for his car or sees that it is

cared for meticulously. However, when involved in conver-

A well-controlled individual who has a glide (or grace). in

his walk. He has little or no interest in "fixing things"

but usually krows the best places to get things done and is

inclined to be quite particular in how things are done for

him. He appears to have relatively little knowledge of

the mechanics of an automobile, but appreciates and take

good care of a good automobile. He drives with confidence,

but usually at a fast pace with not too much awareness of

others

À rather nervous and temperamental person who walks rap

idly and rather awkwordly.. He has little or no interest in

"fixing things" and is inclined to ignore or throw away

things that do not work. He appears to have little interest

His humor is forthright, not subtle, and although he is sometimes

loud, he is rarely unpleasant or objectionable. Most of the

He is a hearty fellow who, when he laughs, does so with con-

siderable gusto. However, he is frequently dour and sometimes

con do a good job appropriately livening up a party: Although

something of a teose, he is never cruel or insensitive.

He is generally a rather quiet and somewhat complacent person

who, at times, con be surprisingly gay and carefree. However,

when gay, he sometimes overdoes it and couses some strain for

those around him. His humor is often clever but he con be

quite sarcastic and even biting on occasion.

He is an urbane fellow, generally quite conventional and appro-

priate. He does.not necessarily appear to be a humorless person,

but he seldom displays his sense of humor. It is sometimes diffi-

cult to tell whether he is in a good humor, because of the way:

he covers or controls his feelings. His humor is more studied

than spontaneous yet it is never crude or inappropriate.

He is a dour and humorless person, always serious and intense.

It is difficult to joke around him partly because he is not re-

sponsive and partly because he seems to disapprove.

He is a sensitive, sophisticated fellow. with a subtle wit. He

can be quite charming and amusing in the right sort of setting.

However, there is something of an aristocratic quality to his

sense of humor and he.can be quite condescending towards

peoplé who do not understand or appreciate his sense of humor.

flippant at times. His humör tends to be a bit far out. He

it. He is a rather soft man who iries härd to be inoffensive.

However, he will frequently follow attractive women with his

eyes when he thinks no one is looking: He is also prone fo.

•brush against or touch women "accidentally" whenever he gets

a chance.

He is o self-confident, rather polished person who is proper

and conventional with either men or women. He is always

considerate and polite with all women and it is difficult to

ascertain what his sexual attitudes and interests might be.

In.algroup, he.always.behaves according to protocol and

usually can be quite efficient in doing so.

He is a self-confident and precise person who has something

of the air of ó professional man about him. 'He is polite;

almost to a fault, and is inclined to go out of his way to

light d woman's cigarette or see that she is properly taken

care of. Nevertheless, he shows considerable distance in

his relations with women. Somelimes his formality is out

of place, but he will rarely, if ever, change his manners

or procedures to fit the situation.

He is a charming, urbane person and both friendly: and:

sophisticated. He deals with women in a cultured way.

but shows little sensuality or sexual inappropriateness:

He is neat, even dapper, and can, be quite fastidious.

Most of his relations with women appear. to be quite pla

tonic. He is the kind of person who likely has several

very close friends who are wömen.

He is a somewhat shy and indifferent person whom some

people consider odd'or unusual. He shows little or no

interest in women in public. In general, he is a preoc

cupied person who only seeks out people with similar

* interests. There is an ascetic, asexual air about him

most of the time.

On 29 January, 1969, Sanuel J. KARTASUK not with Subject to

Subject initially

refused to cooperate on the grounds that he does not want to gét

involved in this type of business and that he had given the same

answer to "the other side.". He readily admitted that he has been

under intensive development by Valentin LOGINÓV (201-285412) to spot

Mexican students wbo eventually may go to OLADY; he denied, however,

that he has ever accepted the money LOGINOY continually offers him.

Subject volunteered

that Yurly. CHERNYSH (201-825743) is currently

developiag one of Subject's students (which we knew), and that subject

woüld like to foll CHERNYSH's attempt.

In spite of Subject'e expressions of reluctance to be recruit

he anawerod a number of questiona put to him by KARTASUK and he

agreed to a follow-up meeting

on T February. At that meeting, he

submitted to more intensive questioning about his background, family,

and his association with the FJSTEAl community.

There were no ettempts

it evasion and many of his answers were corroborated by information

that was already known trom uther sources. Subject agreed to continue!

meeting clandestinely with KARTASUK and to provide additional

Information

on his contacts with LOGINOV and other menbers of the kGB.

Subject's'activities immediately following the pitch vere

monitored closely by LIEKBRACK and by LIFKAT for the week between the

two meetings.

The "second meeting sas counter-surveilled with negative

results.: Although the recruitment is still tenuous, we believe that

it can be firaly ceninted and that Subject is committed whether or

not be is ready to admit it to hinselt at this point.

There was instant rapport between KARTABUK and both

and Informal relationship. He is an intelligent person with a

friendly, open personality and a good sense of humor. Politically,

he is pro-American to the point that he magnifies our strengths

and positive qualities and tends to minimise or overlook negative

factors in our socioty. Subject knows I am with the Political

Section of the Embassy and that I häve been in the Soviet Union.

We have consequently gotten onto the tople of Russians and

Cominism several times, and he has always come out a strong

anti-Comminist. He has one brother and two sisters living in

the United States.. The brother is marrled to an American and

Lives In Virginia, where he is in the construction business.

One of the sisters is also marcled to an American and lives in

Californiá (I believe San Francisco). The second sister is

married to a Polish tunigrant and lives with him in Chicago.

6. From this conversation, it appeared that GAZIYEV was

probably talking about subject, since;

(a) GAZIYEV had been taking Spanish at the Mexican-North -

American Institute and I knew from Subjoct that Subject had had

• GAZIYEV in one of his classes, that subject occasionally chatted

with GAZIYEV after class, and that GAZIYEV had once given Subject

an invitation to a Consular night at the Soviet Embassy (although

Subject told. me he had not gone):

(b) subject had gotten married that month.

(c). Subject had just returned to Mexico with his bride.

(d)

subjoct and his wife were looking for an apartment.

(o) Subject normally arrived at the Institute at 1800:

to teach evening Spanish elasses.

?. Prior to this reported telephone conversation, I had

considered using Subject as an access agent against GAZIYEV,

but had decided not to approach

Subject on the matter unlesg

there was evidence that his relationship with GAZIYEV was

developing into something nore than occasional chats betreen

classes.

I did not see nuch potential in approaching subject

before this with shetad the idea of having him deliverately

such a busy and hectic life that I would get very littlo out

of him. Prior to bla marriago, ho wis kroping such a hectic

schedule botween his Institute and private classes that ho

wasn't sleeping or eating proporly and was having increasing

problems with his health. If anything, his pace and health

problems increased after his marrlage and hie taking of the

Job with the American School (although he gave up most of his

private classes)

8. Since the GAZIYEV-LOGINOV conversation made Subject'g

relations with

the Soviets look much more interesting, I

attempted

to find out what I could about.

them from subjoct. Por a number.

os reasons, however--Including My, boing to the States in June

wo were not ablo to get together, until ll July. on that date

I took subject to a belated "bachelor'e lunch" at a ilttle

Spanish restaurant dotom

9. The lunch was disappointing and, for me, misleading.

I was certain that if given the opportunity, Subject would

voluntarily tell me if his relationship with GAZIYEV had

developed any further.

When I casually brought the conversation

around to GAZITV, hovover, subject simply told me that GAZIYEV

was still studying at the Institute and that he stil? occasionally

chatted with him in the halls or over a cup of coffee in one

of the near-by coffee shops during the 20-minute break between

the two eveniny classes.

Subject commented that he enjoyed

talking with GAZIYEV, as he was a simpatico, interosting suy,

as well ag an outstanding Spanish student. He also added that

they never talked polities.. In reply to an offhand question

about whether he had not any other Soviets through GAZIYEV, Subject

said that he had

_note My inclination was to bellovo Subjoct, and

I went away thinking that oither GAZIYEV and LOGINOY had. been

talking about someone else over

the phone. or that they had

never gone boyond the stage of simply. talking about Subject.

20.

On 1 November 1967, I ran Into Subject and his brother

Javlor In Sanborne-Insurgentes, They were about to have a

quick lunch and Inosted that I join then for a cup of coffoo.

As soon as we sat down, Subject told me he had a problem and

would Iiko my advico. Ho said GAZIYEV had givon him an invitation

to the ? November colobration of the Rovolution at the sovlot

Embassy, and although he would ilke to go for the experience,

he was very concerned that his name would be put on "the black

Ilst" at tho U.S. Embassy if he went. He said that he had

tried to call ie at the Embassy after he got the invitation to.

ask my advice, but had boen told I was out of town. (I was in

El Paso from 25-29 October.

He stated that if he had not been

able. to reach me in the next day or two, he was going to simply

walk into the Embassy and ask to see someone from the "security

department" about his predicament. What did I think he should

do?

11. I told subject to relax and forget about going to the

U.S. Embassy, as the Embassy would not give hir any advice

other than to toll him that it was entirely his own business

whother he went to the Soviet reception or not. Besides, I

asked, what made Subject think his name would be put on a

"black list" if he went. Subject replied that he didn't know

how the U.S. Embassy did it, but "everyone knew the VaS.

the Soviet Embassy. Moreover, he said, even 1f the U.3. Embassy

molised to Elve him any adoleo, at least it would make are

of into vlast and anyone who was ever interested wouls his

hoart was in the right place. He simply did not want and couldn't

afford to get into any trouble with the U.S. Embassy, he said.

Aftor all, he had an American wifo, he might want to go to the

States to study sometime; and they might even want to go to

the Statos to live someday. Seeing that Subject was indeed very

sorious; I becamo more sorlous myself and told him that just so

he wouldn't worry, I'd write a memo to the propor Embassy

department stating for the sake of the record that subject had

told me he planned to attend a Soviet Embassy roception, but

wished the U.S. Embassy to know he has doing. It sololy out of

curlosity and was in no way th sympathy with the Soviet Union.

Subject

seemed greatly relleved and thanked me very much.

.1zo solzing of the fact that GAZIYEV had given subject the

Invitation, I asked 1f Subject saw much of him anymore. Subject

replied that yes, he still saw him occaslonally, as GAZIYEY was

now studying English at

the Institute. subject added, on his

own initiative, that he had,also been to GAZIYEV's apartment

twice and had met another Soviet there on one occasion. He said

that the first time he went to GAZIEVis was shortly before he

(Subject) got married (Subject me vag marrled about mid-ipril

1967) and the second time was shortly after his marriage, as he

and his wife had gone to dinner at the GAZIYEVS'.. Subject finished

eating about this time, and since he was in a hurry and had

his brother with him, I didn't try to question him any further,

but docided to walt and have a second go at him alone another

time.

13.

My wito and I entortnined subjoct and hia wifo nt our

home on 2f November, but the eventig was not meant to and did

not afford an opportunity to discuns the Soviets any further.

Subfoct did tell me, howover, that he had not gone to the

7 November Soviet recoption afterall, because, despite by

assurances that there was no reason for him not to go, he

felt it. was simply safer to stay avay foon the Soviet Embassy

altogether.. At my suggestion, we agreed to got together for

lurch somotime in the near future.

14. For various reasons, Including the poor state of

Subject's health when I called him one day in January, we did

not got together.for. the lunch until 7 Marche. This time, I

played it straight with subject, told him that I was interested

In anything he could tell me about GAZIYEV and the otherSoviet

he had met, and questloned him closely regarding the details.

Subject was completaly cooperative, and I am satisffed he answered

my questions to

the best of his ability, It seemed to me, and

still does, that there was only one possible reason why Subject

had not told me on ll July what he subseguently told me on

I November (1.e-, that he had been to GAZIYEV's home twice and

on one occasion had met another Soviet there). This was that

he felt, somewhat guilty about going to GAZIYEV's and meeting

the other Soviet there, and as long as I didn't push him too

hard (which I didn't on'll July), he felt more comfortable

ignoring it. The reason he go readily mentioned the two visits

and the other Soviet on I November was, I think, that he was

genuinely concerned not to "get into any trouble" with the U.S.

Embassy over attenline the Soviet Embassy reception, wished to

Impress no with his sincerity about whose side he was on, and

folt obliged to complotely clear the rocord by montioning the

visits to GiZIYi's home and meeting the other soviet there.

15. Subject stated that GAZIYEV had invited him to his

apartment for dinner about a month before he (Subject) wint to

Chicago to get married. This means that the dinner took place

about mid-March 1967 Subjoct said he had expected to find

only GAZIYEV and his wife in the apartment, but that a third

person was there when Subject arrived. _ Subject said. GAZIYEV.

introduced the third person as Valentin "something " When I

asked if the last name were LOGINOV, Subjoct immediatoly reacted

and said he was almost positive that was it. Subject's description

of the Soviet also fIt LOGINOV. CAZIYEV stated that LOGINOV was

with the Embassy (Subject coulda't remember in what capacity) and

described LOGINOV as a good friend. Subject said that the evening

started off very casually, with LOCINOV expressing interest.

In the Spanish courses at the Mexican-North American Institute.

LOGINOV, who Subject noted spoke almost as good Spanish as most

of the Spanish teachers at the Institute, said he'd like to get

a certificate in Spanish from the Institute and asted Subject 1f

he could help him enroll, choose the best course for him to.

Subjuct replied that he'd be happy to, although

It didn't seem to him that LOGINOV needed much instruction in

Spanish. LOGINOV simply laughed this off, and it was agreed

LOGINOV would drop around to the Institute sometime soon.

evening, then bogan to ask subjoct questiong which loft subjoct

most of LOGINOV's questions, but he did recall that LOGINOV

began the feeling-out procedure by asking Subject if he didn't

find that the Americans vere much poorer at learning Spanish

than other nationalities. He also made various derogatory

remarks about the extent of American Influence in Mexico. Subject

said that after about ton minutes, LOGINOV's purpose became so

blatantly obvious; that ho (subject) stopped the conversation

and told LOGINOV that bofore they went any farther, he thought

LOGINOV should know that he was talking to someone who was

"10oi capitallst," completely pro-american, and had absolutely

no sympathy with Cormunism. (Whilo this sounds amfully blunt

and Subject was unquestlonably trying to make hinself look good

in my oyes, the fact of the matter la that subject does tend to

be dst a bit blunt at times, and khowing his Ideological leanings,

I would not put it past him to have sald exactly this.) Subjoct

said that LOCINOV tried to backtrack a bit after this, but the

conversation heated up again a few uinutes later when Subject

conmented that he had a pretty good idea of what thé Sovlets were

up to in Mexico. When LOGINOV asked what Subject meant, Subjoct

related the story he

once told me about having been in Veracrus

a few years ago when a Soviet ship was actually or virtually put

under arrest there. Subject told LOGINOV that "everyone knew

the ship was loaded with Communist propaganda."

"It After about twenty minutes, accordine to subject, politica

Subject

said that GAZIYEV loft most of the politically

related part of the conversation to LOGINOV and never referred

to the evening again. Howover, a fow woeks after Subject

returnod to Moxico with his bride, GAZIlEY had Subjoct and hia

wifo over to dinner (thie would place the secönd dinner in

about mid-Mar) ..

This time GAZIYEV and his wife were the only

others present, and the ovening

passed ilthout any reference

to politics.

Subject shated that he still occasionally goes

across the street for a cup of coffee with GAZIYEy betweem

evening classes at the Institute, but that he has not been

to GAZIYEY's apartment again and has never had GAZIYEV to his

home •

18.

Although Subject was very aware that LOGINOV's purpose

In meeting him was to assosa his exploitability, he did not seem

to fully appreciate that GAZIYEV had both fingered him for

LOGINOV and set up the situation for LOGINOV to meet him. I

spelled this out for Subject and also informed him that LOGINOV

swas an exceptionally capable Soviet Intelligence officer. I

also explained. that lt was very possible GAZIYEV was using the

Institute: to spot other candidates for interviews with

intelligence officers, and questioned subject about GAZIlEVg

activitios and contacts at the Institute. However, Subject said

that as far as ho could tell GAZIlEY probly much stuck to himsèlf

at the Institute and did not have any particudar friendo there

whom subjoct knew about.

subjoct suld he would keep his eyes

open for the type of thing I was looking for, however, and would.

let me know if he came onto anything interesting. Subject also

offered to. "play up tor GAZIYEV and/or LOGINOV under my guidance

If i wished, but I declinod the offer with appropriate expressiong

of appreciation.

19. The question that reming unanswered after all this 18,

of course, why LOGINOV and GAZIYEV wore talking about subjoct

over tho phone on 24 April 196% According to. Subject, the

dinner which LOGINOV attended took place in March 1967, whilo

LOCINOV did not attend GAZIYEV's second dinner, which took

place about mid-May: Since I am satlafled Subject told me the

truth, it would appear that the "certain things" which LOGINOV

told GAZIYEV on 2 April he wished to discuss with GAZIYEY

concerned how to handle Subject in the light of the LOGINOY

Subject encounter in March. Whatever LOGINOV had in mind on

24 April, it would appear that it was finally decided that

GAZIYEV and his wife should simply have Subject and his wife

over to a peaceful dinner in order to at least partially erase.

the memory of the first dinner.

In reply to

FRADYER's queries,

RONTON stated that LIREALN-1

was somewhat disappointed that he could not

provide him with some sort of written contract

for. LIRELIC-1 and also because of the delay in

reimbursing him for operational expenses (some

-of which had been disallowed).

ROWTON then

revealed to FRADYER

that LIREALN-1 was waiting

for him at the Sanborns bar so that he could

pass him the money without further delay.

FRADYER then regretted that he had been unable

to see LIREALY-1 personally to explain the

disallowance of some of the expenses.

suggested that FRADYER might take this

opportunity to say a few words to LIREILN-1,

When the conversation cuded, Rowrov land

LIKEALN-1 moved

to the men's room, where

LIRENLJ-1 was ablo to chock the amount of

moncy. for him and sign the enclosed receipt.

it will be noted from the above that the ROWTON:

LIRFALN-1 meeting with FRADYER WaS

not planned in advance.

(as pointed out in refcrence A), but was a hasty recommendation

made to FRADYER by ROWTON. and an equally lasty decision taken

the spot.

ROWTON and LIREAIN-1 had met previously

only in ROWTON's home,

excopt on two occasions when ROWTON

picked up LIRALN-1 in his car in tho Ciudad Deportes (near

the main Mexico City bull ring) beticon rogular meotings to.

pass him funds.

ROWTON. hnd never met with LIREALM-l at

Sanborns or in any other public place prior to this meeting.

LIREALM-I also ampliflod his written report sub-

sequently in one significant dotall.

In rcference to the

remark of LoGIlor to the offoct that he had seen him with his

boss at Sanborns two Wednesdays previously when "you had a

drink in the bar and then talked to your boss,'

LIREALN-1 told

ROWTON on reflection that LOGINOV had also stated that "you

were having a drink at the bar and a man came up to you and

brought you to your -boss."

This indicates

that FRADYER WaS

meant as the person described as LIKEALN-l's boss.

With regard to where and how often ROWTON and

LIREALN-1 have hid operational nootings in the past,

requested in paragraph 3 of jeference B, Station files show

that between 20 October 1967 and 16 January 1968 ROWTON met

with LIREALM-l at his home ten tines.: Besides these meetings

with LIREALN-1

at his home, ROwTON recalls only two other noctings

with -LIREALM-1, when ho picked up LIREALM-I in his car for brief

meetings to pass him funds.

Since the LOGINOV/LIREALN-1

episode, ROWTON has met. with LIREALN-1 at obscure bar's to avold

possible positive identification of ROWTON in the event

LIREALN-l was under surveillance.

'LIREALN-1 has passed his

reports to ROWTON between their wookly meetings via & P.o.

letter drop taken out previously by LIREALM+} under alias.

The only telephone contact that has existed between them has

been brief calls to ROWTON's homo by LIRALl-l alerting ROVION,

With regard to the frequency of LiRFALM-I's meetings

LOGINOY, mentioned in paragraph 4 of reference B,

LIREALN-I's contact reports

list only four meetings during

the same period,

all of which occurred at the French Club,

one of which, on 2 November 1967, was a casual encounter at

which very few words were exchanged.

It is significant to note,

that at the 12 November 1967 meeting, while LIREAL-1

and LOGINOV were chatting ill

292382

Headguarters will recall that the LIkELN-l relation

with tho soviets dates back many months prior to

date ROWTON took over his

handling.

The file reveals

LIREALN-1 first met LOGINOV

on 22 April 1967, and that at

that timo, LOGINOV proposed to LIRALl-l that

they meet

regulaily..evory Wednesday, for tennis and occasionally take

in a movie with their wives.

doubt that the

paco was set by LOGINOV himself since he undoubtedly saw

LIREAL-I a potontial target.

The situation was further

complicated by the character and modus

operandl of LOGINOV,

as woll as the limitations of LIREALN-l's cover situation at

tho time...

A prinelpal dilemma facing the Case Officer with

rogard to LIRALN-l's exposure to the Soviets has been his

regular attendance at the French Club.'

Since the French

target

has boon one of the main ones left to LIREALN-1 after the

olimination of the soviet,

Indonesian, and VAR operations, it

Was considored necessary

for LIRkALN-1 to continue his nornal

contacts with the Fronch.

Ho could have dropped his menbership

in the club to avoid further involvement with the Soiets,

but this would have broken a long-established pattein and

deprived him of his principal access at that time.

It was

therefore ruled out as counterproductive:

• Subsequent developments appear to conflim the

that LOGINOV based his provocative remark on

a hunch or, at most,

on a strong suspicion concerning

LIREALA-L.

As- mentioned in paragraph 1 of reforence B, such

prolonged social contact between an Amorican and a Soviet

"is almost inevitably

construed ou both sides to have intel-

ligence ,connotations.".. The Station wishes to emphasize,

whatever suspicions were aroused in the mind

of LOGINOV concerning LIREAL'-I were already generated months

before he joined the, PBRUNEY Sectión in late October 1967.

In conclusion,

the Station feels that nothing has

been

noted in the subsequent operational activity of FRADYER

or RONTON to indicate that either of them has been identified

as an intelligence operative.

RONTON has had no contact of any

kind with Soviets in this area, nor has he detected any

surveillance, either physical or technical, of his person

or home.

Both he and FRADYER, however,

will continue to

maintain maximum security to avoid any

further exposure

to

such persons as LOGINOV:

LIREALM-1, on his part, has been

able

to

morove his cover by opening an office

and making his

overt activity as plausibly commercial as possible.

When the undersigned refused to go to the"

I had Joined Val and my wife on her

He apologized

for interrupting our game and suggested we go back

to playing and he would watch us.

We had made. a

He would call me if his

was unable to play. Now he said he wanted to study

"I saw you talking with your boss the other

"My boss?" I asked. I suspected nothing and

seriously considered the question:

The conversation proceeded too rapidly,

for me to answer my own question.

The fact is

"Two Wednesdays ago...

Embass thon that LOGINOV was not present at the time of the

möeting but was told that LIREAL-l met with two Americans..

Itwas-and still is the undorsigned's conviction that whoever

1s not completely stupid,

would have either said nothing' or.

By the same token it

appeare that LOGINOV failed to identify ROWTON... The

undorsignod had only met with one other Soviet besides

LOGINOV at the time of the meeting, and that only once; and

"that Soviot was no longer in Mexico City when the meeting

with LINEALM-I took place. ROWTOY has never had any contact,

social or otherwise,

with any of the Soviets.

The undersigned is the first to recognize that meeting

with LIREALM-l at the Saiborns silver shop vas a thoroughly

unwise move: He wishes

"to emphasize that this was the only.

meeting at the time that he had held with LIREALN-1 outside

of a satehouse.: All

meetings between the undersigned and

LIREALM-I have since been held under' the most secure con

itions on the edge of the Federal District and, in one case,

beyond.

While this does not make this decision

any wiser, he

also wante to emphasize the fact that it was made on the spur

öf the moment, to quote the old cliche, because the undersigned

"felt sorry" for LIREALM-1 because of

the latter's financial

difficulties with

the Station over his last accounting.

The

undersigned unwisely put LIREALN-l's morale for a brief moment.

over basic security considerations.

He is not in the habit

of doing this as a matter of course.

The day before his nest

scheduled tennis meeting with LIREAIN-l the following Wednesday,

LOGINOV called LIREALN-1 and asked to be excused as his leg

had worsoned.

The week after that LOGINOV showed up for his

regular tennis game with LIREALN-1 but made no mention of

his previous conversation with him two weeks before.

The

undersigned waited to complete a review of this case until

he met LOGINOV face to face at one of the Consular Association

functions.

Because of the visits of Soviet athletes and

artists which kept LOGINOV busy,

however, this meeting did not

materialize until 28 March

Although the undersigned and

LOGINOV talked to each other off and on for more

than two hours

on

never mentioned anything about the Sanborns meeting.

LILYRIC photo covorngo shows that Subject was at the Soviet

that Subject visited the Sovlet Embassy from 11: 20 to

Again, LILYRIC has LOGINOV in the

from 09:07 to 13:45 on that date, thus conflining that Subject

Thus her first meeting with LOGINOV at the

party was probably on 6 or 8 November 1967.

was at the

reception in tho Embassy.

man"')

and as a person.

From her conversationa she concluded that he liked

Anericano and was interested in meating them, that he is really

Interested In learning English so that be can go to the United Statea

and that, sonchow, he didn't want his own people to know about theme

interesta and intentions.

In fact, LOGINOV, did a fine job in de

briofing her and in keeping the contact open. This type

of activity

has become standard for hin in México.

6.. Although the subject of his marital status never came up,

Subject assumes that LOOINOV 1s single.

"He acta like a single man".

He loves parties and dancing and sports.

(Again; standard behavior

for him.)

The guard on duty

promptly looks through the observation

According to LIROCKEl-1, there is a

keyhole on the inside of the gate, but there definitely is no keyhole

•on. the .outside.. LIROCKET-l.has never seen anyone opch the gate

with a key.

LIROCKET-I has been present in only about five instances

non-Soviets in vehicles

have-sought. admittance through the

vehicle gate, which is adjacent to the loot gate.

In cach of 'the

instances; the callers have been delivery men whose trucks

have apparently been recognized by the guard. In cach instance,:

the truck has pulled up with its nose to the vehicle bate and the

guard has walked to the gate and opened it manually... The

gate consists of two doois which open inward.

It is secured by

one dead bolt: fron one door to the other. -LIROCKET-l has never

noticed a padlock. on the gate. After boing admitted to the Embassy

grounds,

gatehouse,

where - although LIROCKET-l has never actually

a guard doing so

someone inside the

main building to give notification of the truck's arrival:

LIROCKET-] has been present perhaps 25 times when pedestriah

callers. (delivery men, students, persons on

visa business) have

the foot gatc buzzer, and in each

instance the guard has

routinely let them in without coing

to the gate to question them

or observe them more closely.

On one occasion,

as many as four

young Mexican males who appeared

to be university students rang

the büzzer while LIROCKET-l was

inside the gatehouse, and the guard

let them in in the routine manner.

6. Once inside the gate,

the pedestrian caller is expected

to present himself at the gatehouse door, which is usually left

open, and state his business.

The guard

then either soes next

or, as in Subject's case, uses the interphone

(In LIROCKET-)'s case,

the guard calls one of his Soviet students.)

The sccond iffice is at the back of the irst

an outsidé door.

about 20 of the roughly 10 times LIROCKiT-l was in the leception

The Soviots frequently left. the:

door to the

first office; and somerhat less ficquently

to the

The firse door or both

door's vere sonetines also left open when no soviet was

present.

When the door to the first office or the doors to both offices

were open and LIlOCKIT-l sat opposite the door to the fiist office,

he could

see about a quarter-of the interior of the first office

and a small. part of the interior of the second office.

Although

official Soviet visa hours are. only ou Tuesdays and Fridays

(from 1100-1300), LIROCKET-l' saw Soviets in both offices with

about

equal frequency

on liondaj

and: Friday nornings. from that LInOCklI

the Soviets parcly seened to be busy with desk work,

but contined themselves to looking ver nowspapers, opening mail,

chatting with each othel,. ete.

Frequently Sovicts

went into one

of the offices. for. just i moment and then left.

Since LINOCKIT-1

has begun going to the Sabassy about 1530 on Tucsdays and Thursdays,

however,

he has always found the door to the first office shut and

bóth offices evidently .empty..

This is probably explained

by the fact that the lmbassy lunch break is fron 1100-1000).

Tho INPURE officer nleo informed the case officer that Subject had

proviously

mentioned that he had once been

"approached" to supply

Information on Soviet travelers on n regular basis and had refused

to do 80.

Subjoct evidently did not spocifically say that he had

beon approached by HorACT, but this tas clearly the lapilestion.

Subject told the INPURS officor that he wag willing to supply InfOma™

tion he considerod unusual or especially interesting, but was not.

willing to supply, information on a routine insis.

The Station had no contact with Subject between 6 January

and 28 Soptömber 1966. On 20 September, the Station learned from

LICOY -5 that Subject

hn: boen invited along with sovernl other

Merican traves agents to attend an Intourist conference li Moscow

from 24-29 October:

A meetine was consequently arranged with Subject

for 28 Septenber through the INPURE officer:

contact the Station about hls forthcoming trip,

which,

he: Baid,

assined. was what the case officer winted to talk about

He gave the case officers copy of his invitation to the Intourist

conferenco and on his ow inittative offered to provide the Station

with a

full report of the conference when be returned.

Horever, he

stated that he was not intorested in working for the Station on a

permanent,

"agent" basis, in heeting under clandestine circustances,

or taking noney.

Ho was willing to help to the extent he was, he

explained,

bocause he belloved basically what we did about current

vorld problens and, after all, had lived in YOLADY for many years and

regarded it ng his

"second home".

On the basis of this intervier

and a review of Subject's file, Subject Impressed the case officer

as a somewhat disingenuous. egost who,.

despite a gonuine syapathy.

segardod his cooperation with the Station primarily as a

means of Insuring his business contacts with INPURs and as sonething

wbich bad to be tept to a mininun lest it limit his Independence or:

This impression sorved as the basis for the evaluation of Subject

contained in Reference A.

The case officer's impression of subject changed considerably

with the noxt

which-was held on. 18 October.

At this neeting:

- the case officer gave

Subject defensive briefins for his. trip. and

went over general roporting requirements.

The case officer told Subject that

and a second to Santlago' (H4WA-30749, 2 December

According to

Subject, their relntionship during-the past year- has been strictly of

• businoss' nature and LOGINOV has show no interest In extending it

beyond this.

Subject consequently appears to have little to offer

in the way of an access agent to the Soviets in the foreséeable

future.. However, as the manager of one of fivo Mexican travel

agencles reprosonting Intourist and because of his apparently

oxcellent contacts with key personnel of the other four travel agencies,

he promises to be a useful roferent on persons who book travel in.

that at

present it is better loft as a form of tacit control than brandished

even subtly. It is our opinion that Subjoct would regard an SCSWIRL

intervlew as an effort both to licrease our control over bim and to

draw him dooper into the Intelligence business.

Such a reaction

would in all probability undo much of our recent progress ulth

Subject. Consequently, we would prefer to postpone an SGSWIRL

intervlew until other

ve further solidily our relationship with

Subject or we

wish to use him in more sensitive vork.
