Detroit, Michigan, and residence as 315 West 94th Street,

preliminary check verified Klawuhn's

birth in Detroit to German alien parents and there were

no traces of this family after 1933 which suggested they

had returned to Germany. It was determined that Klawuhn

was born a cripple with a hip disease and would probably

have the appearance as walking like a "duck" all his life.

State Department records revealed the Klawuhn brothers

were taken to Germany by their mother in May, 1932.

Specimens of the handwriting of Helmuth and Horst Klawuhn

appearing in State Department files were compared with

presence in New York was July 8, 1959, when he rented a

room on the West side of New York. He was employed as

a salesman by Service Guidance Corporation and was

phones and a long coil antenna concealed in a foot locker.

He also had a black portable typewriter, various types of

pills, pads of writing paper and several books on grammar.

SUBJECT:

HEKLAR.

ESPICNAGE - R

Above caption is the code name for this case which

an individual using the name of Helmuth Felix Klawuhn who, we are

reasonably certain, is a Soviet illegal

agent. This memorandum is

to consider our future course of

action.

origin of Case

Through our Socap Program (screening of new social security

applications in Baltimore) the social security application of Klawuhn

lated 5/2/60 was located. He gave his birth as 1/29/25, Detroit.

Michigan, and his residence as s15 West 4th Street, NYC. Mis hand-

writing contained foreign characteristics. A preliminary check

verified Klavuhn's birth

• in Detroit to German alien parents.

There

was no trace of this family after 1933, suggesting the possibility

they had returned to their native Germany.

Information Developed on the True Helmuth Felix Klawnhn

The Detroit Office determined that Klawuhn was born a

cripple with a hip disease and would probably have the deformity

of walking "like a duck" all his life. He had a younger brother,

Horst Albert, born 5/23/30, Detroit.

State Department records reveal that the Klawuhn brothers

fore tad them the doll thie mother in gay 1197, the emeriether

followed them the following year.

In warch,

Military Government in Berlin received a letter in the German

language from a Helmuth Klawuhn residing at Parchim, Necklenburg,

Germany,

advising of the birth of himself and his brother, Horst,

in Detroit in 1925

in 1932.

The writer wanted to knew whether he the is ip to fermany

to know whether he and his brother were

still considered as U. S. citizens and whether they would be permitted

to that office.

_.-nistate Departmen records also miral that in 1951-Horst

citizenship was established. His application listed his brother,

Helmuth,

as then residing in Germany. State Department records fail

to reveal that Helmuth or Horst ever took subsequent steps to validate

their claim to U. S. citizenship or repatriate themselves to the U.S.

Specimens of the handwriting of Helmuth and Horst Klawuhn

appearing in State Department files have been compared with subject's

handwriting by the FBl Laboratory. Subject's handwriting is not

identical with these specimens.

Information Developed on the Subject

The Neiv York Office (NYO) determined that subject's first

known presence in New York was 7/8/59 when he rented a room on

New York's west side.

He has been at his present address since

17/8/60. He is employed as a salesman by Service Guidance Corp.,

jobbers of household services.

He does not walk like a cripple.

Information developed through an anonymous source reveals

that subject is in possession of a Hallicrafter short-wave radio

receiver with earphones and a long coil antenna concealed in a

locked foot locker.

He also has a black portable typewriter,

various types of pills, pads of writing paper, several books

grammar.

The FBI Laboratory determined that one of the pills made

to resemble "Creamal iphonync

tablet, a common antacid preparation sold

in drugstores, is a

and closely resembles other tablets

which have been used as developers for secret ink messages in Soviet

espionage operations.

At the present time NYO is maintaining most discreet

coverage of subject through an observation post, spot check

surveillances and mail coverage.

His only activity, other than

his employment, is dating an Irish immigrant waitress, Rose McKinley,

who appears to

have been a "pickup."

She spends many

nights and

weekends with him.

Analysis

Further, from information developed through the anonymous source and

from our knowledge gained in the Karot case, it is believed reasonable

to conclude that subject is in the U.S. as

a Soviet illegal agent.

Karot is the Soviet illegal agent we broke in Wisconsin in March, 1959,

and who is now cooperating with us as

„a double agent.

Course of Action

We have carefully analyzed all aspects of this case and

considered various possible courses of action. As can be seen, we

do not have sufficient legal evidence for a prosecutive case.

Whether admissible legal evidence can be developed in the future

in light of the clandestine nature of Soviet illegal operations

appears unlikely. From what we have learned in the Karot case, we

consider it extremely doubtful that surveillances and other investi-

gative techniques would produce anything of value even if continue

for an. extended period of time. There is always the possibility

that an extended investigation would alert the subject and he would

disappear, and we will have gained nothing.

We, therefore, feel that the best course of action is a

most thorough interview,

Similar to that conducted in March, 1959,

in Wisconsin during which we developed the Karot subject as

a double

agent. it is recognized that suviect nav be difticult to break

he has been

in the J. S. at least l, nonths and probably longer.

Farot was in the U.s. for about two months when we approached him.

we believe the ultinate

possible gain is worth the attempt.

Despite the uncertainty as to successff we are unsuccessful, we

will have at least neutralized hin.

We also feel that if we are to interview the subject, it

should be done very soon.

If delayed, his relations with the Irish

waitress may develop to the point that would cause us additional

problems in our efforts to handle our approach to him in a most."

discreet and unobtrusive manner.

NYO has advised that it has a suitable location for use

in a most thorough interview of subject.

ACTION:

If you approve,. we will plan to make our approach to the

conduct the interview of the subject.

• With regard to the subject serving in the Armed

Forces of the United States since his arrival here, he stated

that although he registered for the Draft, he was not accepted

for service because he had flat feet. When he was advised

that flat feet would not keep one from serving in the Armed

Forces, he stated

there was something else that the

doctors had found out that was wrong with him but they did

not tell him what it was and he did not know what it was.

He

stated

he-believed also that he was kept out of the

service because the time he took his physical examination,

he could not speak English and

because of his lack of

knowledge of the English language, he was not taken into the

Armed Forces.

When advised that lack of knowledge of the

English language does not keep you out, but on the contrary,

special schools are run in the Armed Forces after

Induction and

this could not possibly be a reason for

non service, he stated

he did not know why they did

not want him but they never got around to calling him into

the service and that he was classified as being physically

unfit.

When asked why he received a 5A classification instead

of a 4F classification, he advised that the man who typed his

card at the Draft Board probably made a mistake in classi-

fying him. He advised that he knew that the term 4F applied

to persons who were rejected from military service for

physical reasons and

he believed that was what he should

have been classified.

He could not account for registering under one

Selective Service Act and being classified under another

Selective Service Act. He stated he did not register for

the Selective Service Act of 1948, did not serve in the

Armed Forces in the Korean War and could give no reason for

not registering under this Act.

With regard to certain of the contents of his

wallet, the subject advised as follows.

he saved only $20 bills because he liked them and they

were

less bulky than $5 or $10 bills. He stated

he

With regard to the receipts for radios purchased

at the Grand Central Radio Shop, he stated

he originally

He stated that while his father

and mother separated, his father never remarried and did

not live with any mistress.

His father secretly met with his

mother under clandestine circumstances on many occasions

and the subject, on some occasions, went to Berlin with his

mother to meet with his father.

According to the subject, this marriage was

apparently never known to Nazi officials and did not prevent

his father from being accepted as a true Nazi.

He stated

that his father frequently sent money and gifts to his

mother and himself.

subject claims to not know whether

his father is dead or not but said he has heard nothing

definite about his father since World War II.

Subject claims to have led an extremely difficult

life and said that he has been persecuted and taken advantage

of from as early as he could remember.

He said that he

has always lived with his mother and that most of his life

was in Germany. He stated that he has spoken English since

a child, that both his mother and father spoke English and

that in addition to speaking English with them, he has also

been accustomed to using the english language in talking to

various friends of his mother. He indicated that he had,

at one time, been in England, probably with his parents, or

at least with his mother.

Subject indicated that he and his mother had, at

one time, been in a displaced persons camp but he would not

say in what country or indicate the camp.

He did say that

he and his mother had attempted to gain admittance to the

United States and indicated this attempt may have been made

while in the displaced persons camp.

Subject refused to give any details of his

personal history and stated that he did not, at this time,

want to furnish any information which would

identify his

mother or father.

He Indicated that his father had held

such a position in the Nazi government that his name would

be known to us. He also indicated that because of certain

acts of his father, he was afraid that this would have a

detrimental effect

on the possibility of the subject himself

ever being allowed to remain in the United States.

FINAL STORY AS TO RECRUITMENT, INTELLIGENCE

TRAINING AND ASSIGNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES

Recruitment

In about July, 1958, subject was residing with

his mother In a city in East Germany. He was employed as

a piano instructor at a music school and also gave private

lessons.

The music schools in East Germany are under the

direction and control of the Ministry of Culture of the

tart or nis duties entalled

instructors at the music school would furnish musical

entertainment which was used to entice people to the

meetings.

While at the music school, he was accosted

by a man

who identified himself as Mr. KUEHN, who addressed

subject by his name and questioned him about his work at the

school. KUEHN appeared to be familiar with the personnel

and school activities generally.

Subject formed the opinion

that KUEHN was either a superintendent of the school or an

official of the Cultural Ministry of the East German Govern-

ment. The conversation between KUEHN and the subject was

meet again at a later date.

Subject agreed and suggested

that the meeting be held at his, subject's, apartment.

described KUEHN as being 40 years of age, six feet, one inch,

tall, bony structure, light brown hair,

light eyes with no

other distinguishing marks. Subject stated that KUEHN was

a very cultured and well-educated person who spoke "hoch"

or high German.

He believed that KUEHN was possibly a

Berliner. KUEHN could read English but was unable to speak it.

After the meeting that was held at subject's

apartment, KUEHN scheduled a third meeting at his apartment.

KUEHN accompanied subject to the house and escorted him

Into the apartment house through the rear door.

Subject

said that the apartment house was four stories high and con-

tained approximately 34 apartments.

The apartment to which

he was escorted was on the third floor in a wing of the

building.

The apartment consisted of a large parlor on either

side of which were two separate units.

Each unit consisted

of a bedroom and living room.

Subject was escorted to the

bedroom and living room on the left hand side of the parlor

as he entered.

The kitchen and toilet facilities were

adjacent to the apartment on the right hand side.

Upon arrival at the restaurant, KUEHN pointed out a man

whom subject described as either American or English looking

and who was quite dapperly dressed, sitting alone at another

table in the restaurant.

KUEHN suggested to the subject

that he address

him and offer

assistance.

In view of

his American appearance, he suggested the possibility that

the man was unable to order properly.

Subject advised that

he objected on the grounds that he did not know the man.

However, KUEHN Insisted and thereupon subject addressed

this unknown man.

The man pretended to be delighted to

find somebody with whom he could converse in English and

at KUEHN's suggestion, subject invited this unknown man

to their table.

The man questioned subject closely regarding

the books in the English language that he had reag and his

education in English.

subject stated that he, upon reflection,

decided that this man was in the restaurant by prearrangement

with KUEHN for the sole purpose of testing subject's English.

He deduced this from the questions he was asked by this unknown

man concerning his background in English studies and literature.

Subject recalled that KUEHN ordered a bottle of

wine with the dinner and the subject was quite surprised at

the termination of the meal when KUEHN allowed

• subject to

pay the check.

Subject advised that he had made the offer

out of courtesy. Upon leaving the restaurant, KUEHN advised

subject that he did not want to argue with the

subject over

the check while in the restaurant and placed a sum of money

in subject's pocket.

Subject stated that upon his arrival

at home, he found that the money given to him by KUEHN was

300 East German marks. The check in the restaurant had been

merely 60 East German marks.

Subject had a series of four more meetings with

KUEHN at which they discussed politics and geography. At

the eighth meeting, which was approximately two months after

his initial introduction to KUEHN, while talking in KUEHN's

apartment, KUEHN said to the subject "I came across a name

which will be interesting to you."

He thereupon mentioned

the subject's father's name.

Subject aävised that because

his father had failed to notify the Nazi government that he

was married to a Jewess

it would be detrimental to

his father should it be known. His mother and he, so far as he

knew, were the only ones who knew of the marriage.

revelation by KUEHN took subject so by surprise that he

Immediately began discussing his father's career and

relationship to him and his mother.

Subject stated that

he was afraid for himself and for his mother believing that

reprisals would be taken against them because of his father's

prominence as a Nazi.

After revealing to KUEHN all the

details of his father's relationship with his mother,

KUEHN assured him that he would not use the Information

which subject had given to him and facts he knew about

subject's lather to the detriment of either subject or

his mother.

Upon reflection, subject felt that KUsHN

actually did not know

as much about his father as subject

had related and he felt later that he had been tricked into

revealing too much.

He said, however, that his purpose was

to try to show that he bad actually had very little to do

with his father and that he had always lived with his mother.

Subject advised that his education and indoctrination

continued with KUEHN for about two more months, the meetings

being held in KUEHN's apartment.

KUEHN began his educational course with geographical

albums on the Soviet Government.

These albums contained

information on the progress that the Soviet Government has

made since the Soviet

Revolution. The albums contained

photographs of cities, buildings, factories and important

landmarks of the Soviet Union.

Underneath the photographs

were descriptions citing the production figures of the

factory or the political or social significance of the

photographed place.

The second album introduced by KUEHN

was on the socialist Camp.

This consisted, according to

subject, of photographs of cities and places of countries

that are affiliated with the Soviet Union, such as Czecho-

slovakia,

Bulgaria, etc.

These albums also contained figures

and charts and a description of the progress that has been

made by these countries since they adopted a Communist

Training in Radio Reception

Subject advised that after approximately four

months association with KUEHN he went to the apartment

and was introduced by KUEHN to a Mr. SCHILLER. SCHILLER •

made a joking remark to the subject impizing

that the

apartment was not KUEHN's, but was in fact SCHILLER'S.

Subject describes SCHILLER as being approximately 47

years old, dark hair, dark complexion, about 5' 101 tall,

and rather chubby.

The only distinguishing reature

subject could recall was that SCHILLER had a recessed

bridge to his nose.

He advised that SCHILLER spoke

German with either a Mecklenburg or part Polish accent.

He advised that SCHILLER was not as cultured as KUEHN,

but appeared to have a very wide technical knowledge.

Subject stated that SCHILLER was an engineer or

technician.

He questioned the subject on his knowledge

of radio operation and construction. After questioning

subject, SCHILLER told him that he knew nothing about

radio and proceeded to give him instructions. SCHILLER

also furnished subject manuals on radio construction and

He went into complete details on the

functional parts of radio. At the completion of the

technical aspects of the radio construction, subject

was required to locate various frequencies on the radio

to display his ability to locate low wave length broadcasts.

One of the stations which subject was required to locate

Instruction in Espionage Technique

After the completion of the radio course,

the subject was furnished books which were case

histories on espionage activity by German, English, and

other agents during and prior to World War II.

recalled that the first book that was furnished to him

by SCHILLER was "The Espionage Activities of I. E. Lawrence"

a British Intelligence agent. With this book and the other

books which subject was required to read, he received a

supplement for each book, which he was told to guard

carefully as they were considered highly confidential

by his instructors.

These supplements consisted of a

series of questions on the errors that were committed

by the espionage agent.

The supplement made reference

SCHILLER discussed in

by page to the espionage book the espionage agent, the

detail the techniques used by

errors the agent made, and also the particularly fine

accomplishments which

he might have made. Subject was

questioned in detail regarding the errors and advantages

of various espionage techniques.

subject stated that

at about this time he gathered that he was being

groomed by SCHILLER for activity outside the East German

Government. Heretolore, under the training of KUEHN and

SCHILLER, he believed that he was being groomed for use

within the East German Government itself.

pesos groomed for use

After the completion of the course on espionage

techniques, subject told SCHILLER that if he was being

groomed to work in the west Berlin sector or the Western

Zone of Germany, he would not accept such an assignment.

He said he did this because he was continually reading

about East German agents who were apprehended by West

German authorities. subject advised the books on espionage

cases were for the most part in the English language. He

remembered one was: about spies on long Island, New York

and another dealt with the Rote Kapelle.

Training in the Use of Secret Writing

subject stated that after the completion of

his studies on espionage techniques and the errors

committed by espionage agents, he was then introduced

Into the use of preparing secret writing by SCHILLER.

In this connection, SCHILLER told subject that

he could prepare an open text letter whichwould appear

entirely innocuous.

Thereafter, SCHILLER showed subject

how to use special paper and this was done in the

following manner.

After an open text letter was preparea,

using either pencil, pen, or a typewriter, the open text

letter was placed over a special sheet of transfer paper.

Subject described this as a chemically treated paper which

could be used to transfer invisible messages to another

sheet SCHILLER taught subject to place the transfer

paper on a table and according to subject, any hard surface

was satisfactory.

He said it could be done on glass,

marble, or wood,

and in lact the wood suriace did not have

to be especially hard.

He said that in placing the open text letter on

the transfer paper you could write on either the side on

which writing appeared or on the back, or on both.

He

said that he was taught to use a rounded Instrument with

no sharp edges and said that a piece of wood could be

used, but he, himself, customarily used the reverse end of

•a ball point pen and he demonstrated with a ball point

pen, which had a fairly fine end, but was not sharp.

He said that the letters or numbers could be written

right over the handwriting or typewriting, but they

had to be larger and he indicated a size almost one half inch

high.

It was noted, however, that in demonstrating this

writing his actual letters and numbers did not appear

to be quite this large.

In the secret writing It did not matter where

he started on the page and there was no necessity to have

any breaks in the writing

for folding the letter.

said, however, that because of subsequent handling, it was

not desirable

to write near the edge either at the top

or bottom or on the sides.

In describing the pressure

exerted he said that a moderate amount was used to insure

the transfer, but nevertheless you should not press too

hard

as the indentations left should be light enough that

they could be removed.

He said that the transfer paper

furnished him was In tablet form and all of the paper in

the tablet was transfer paper as far as he knew.

He

said he was quite sure this was so as they did not tell

him to use only a certain portion of the tablet.

He

said they also told him that he could use each sheet of

transfer paper approximately live times, either side, but

that he normally only used the transfer

paper once and then

destroyed it.

He said that he did not know anything about the

composition of the transfer paper other than that it was

specially treated.

With regard to the paper to be used

for the open text letter he said that any paper that was

not too rough or porous could be used.

desirable as the lines would interfere with reading some of

used in any letter.

He said he presumed as many sheets

as necessary could be used and this would not affect

subject advised that for purposes of security

when a sheet of the transfer paper had been used, rather

than put it back in the pad

where

It might be detected,

subject was instructed that he could crumple the sheet

lay It aside casually where its significance would

not be detected by any searcher.

He advised that he

was instructed'that when he again desired to use the

paper he was not to smooth the crumpled sheet by pressing

It with his hand, but rather he was to take the sides

of the paper and stretch the paper back into shape.

Development of Secret Writing

After subject practiced

waiting open text

letters and then preparing a secrei message on the

letter, he was given instructions in developing

the secret writing.

For this he was given three

pills. One of the pills was disguised as a greamalin

tablet and this tablet had three deltas or triangles

on 1t.

Inside the white coverage was a core which

the subject described as dark yellow.

(It actually

appears to be more of an orange-brown color. The

second. tablet was the same size as the first one, but

there were no markings on the white outer coating.

subjectwas advised that he should crush these

three tablets thoroughly.

He has the impression that the

white coating on all three have no purpose whatsoever

and he therefore did not make any special effort to

retain all of the coating.

He crushed the core

very carefully until it was in powder form with no

grains remaining.

After all three cores had been

thoroughly crushed, they were placed in any solution

which contained 80 per cent or more alcohol. This

was then mixed very thoroughly and there was no time

limit placed on the mixing. After it was mixed thoroughly,

the paper containing the secret writing was held by

the edges, quickly inserted into the solution, and

sifted around in the solution for approximately ten to

fifteen seconds. Subject said it was necessary that the

solution cover

the secret writing uniformly as

otherwise part of it would appear quickly and would be

over-exposed before the remainder was finished. He

said that it was necessary to watch this most closely

as when the writing started to appear there was only a

time of a few seconds that it could remain in the

solution before it had to be removed.

He said that

in training he often had difficulty in that the writing

would become visible along certain edges and he would

take the paper out too quickly, and as a result much of

the writing would never be visible.

With regard to the 80 per cent alcohol,

subject said that they did not indicate that any certain

product was desirable, although he presumed that a

It could, but that he should be careful and not drink

too much. He said that he subsequently used a cologne

for this purpose (Jaynor Alcoloyne - purchased in the

United States) which contained 92-per cent. alcohol.

With regard to the amount of liquid needed for

amount was,

an easy way to measure this.

He said he was told to

take a normal glass (by description and measurement

this turned out to be an eight ounce glass) and then

fill the glass approximately half full of the liquid.

He would then tilt the glass until the liquid barely

touched the lip of the glass and also barely touched the

raised part of the bottom of the glass.

Thereafter,

he always added a very slight amount so that he actually

would have slightly over four ounces of liquid.

subject said that any container could be used

for mixing the solution and for sifting the paper in

the solution, but inasmuch as the secret writing could

be on both sides of the page, it was necessary to see

that the solution was sifted

over both top and bottom.

He demonstrated this by holding diagonally opposite

corners of a sheet of paper, quickly inserting them in a

liquid moving the paper back and forth, and then at

approximately 12 seconds removing the paper from the

liquid.

He then shook the paper slightly and said that

nothing else was needed, that it could dry by itself.

subject said that in the event the paper was

left in the solution too long the action could be

stayed somewhat by immediately placing It in cold

water after it was removed. He said, however, that this

did not do too much good.

With regard to the appearance of the secret

writing, he said that when developed it was a copper-

bronze color.

He said that when it first began to appear

it appeared as a very light brown and that you had to

remove the paper when the writing first became truly

visibler

• He said that if the paper was left in the

solution too long the entire paper and writing would

turn a dark brown and the writing could not be read.

With regard to the effect the solution had

on ink, he said that while the ink ran and became

smeared all over the paper he said that it was actually

easier to read with this background than if a pencil

or typewriter had been used.

While one sheet was normally developed at a time,

training was also given in developing two sheets at a

time, and subject thought that it might be possible to

do even more, but he thought this would be very

aifficult.

He said that when two sheets were going to be

developed at the same time you doubled the amount of

alcohol (eight ounces) and used a total of six pills.

The mixing was done exactly the same. Thereafter,

you separate the two sheets to be developed by placing

a pencil or some other hard object of a similar size

between the edges of the sheets, grasping them securely

and then inserting them in the solution and sifting

as previously described.

He said that sometimes the

sides of the sheets facing each other did not receive

an even amount of the solution and this resulted in an

uneven development.

He said that there was also a way

to prevent too rapid development of the writing and

he said this was done by taking a drink of water,

holding it in your mouth, and spraying lightly on the

paper.

He said this was probably desirable if you

tried

to develop two sheets at the same time.

any of his own writing after he came to the United

to crush his pills as the shot glasses prevented losing

any of the cores of the pills. He said that for a

container for the solution he used a large dust pan,

which he cleaned thoroughly and then tilted slightly

by placing the lip of an ashtray or similar object

and thereby forming a basin. He said anything of this

nature could

be used and it could be tin, metal, or

glass.

Instruction in Use of Camera

Subject advised that he was Instructed in the

use of a camera. He stated that he had a good working

knowledge of the operations of the camera and that this

phase of the instruction extended over a very short period,

possibly one or two days.

He advised that he was not

Instructed in the method

of preparing mikrats or

microdots.

He stated that he was instructed in the

technique of reading mikrats with the use of the camera.

He advised that although he had had the instruction,

he was never able to read a mikrat by this means.

advised that he was instructed by SCHILLER that the

scope, but that in emergencies ií no microscope were

available he could read the mikrat with the aid of the

camera in the following method: The mikrat was to be

placed on a piece of glass of transparent paper, such

as cellophane.

Underneath the mikrat a light source

was to be placed.

The lens of the camera was to be

opened to its widest capacity and the rear of the camera

was to be removed.

The camera was then to be held at the

proper distance from the mikrat and by the use of the

camera lens the mikrat would be sufficiently magnified to

enable it to be read.

He stated that the distance...on the

mikrat depended upon the strength of the lens of the cameri,

and-that it could only be done by trial. He advised thai he

was given a 35 mm. Kodak camera for practice purposes and

was

allowed to retain It.

Training in the Use of Cipher

In the last two weeks of instruction, SCHILLER

gave subject the following instructions in the use of ciphers

* which was to be used in his communications with his superior.

The secret writing processes which he had learned enabled

him to send hidden messages.

These messages,

for further

security, were to be inciphered when mention was made

of sensitive subjects, which would include names, addresses,

and so forth.

With regard to the above usage, the subject was

provided with a combination code book and

cipher pad. He

stated that he believed he could determine the size of this

book because it had left an imprint in his wallet where he

had carried it. He viewed his wallet but could not ascertain

the imprint.

from memory, alter looking at his wallet, he

stated that its approximate size was 3" x 241 x 3/8".

He described this book as follows:

It opened like a book rather than a pad. The

outside of the book was a greyish-green plastic type cover.

The cover itself had no writing on the outside of it.

He did not recall how the paper was bound to the cover,

but stated that it must have been glued because the individual

sheets came out very easily. He descirbed the sheets of

this book as very thin paper.

The color of these pages

have the same color as parchment paper and he stated that

this color would most approximate ivory.

He stated that the

pages were divided into two sections, the first half of

the book being the ciphers for receiving and the second

half being the ciphers for sending.

The color of the pages

for both halves of the book was identical and they were

distinguished by a different color on the edges of the

pages; however, he could not recall the color utilized

on the edges of the papers...

He merely rememberes that

they

-29-

SECRET

were different. With regard to the writing on the pages,

he stated that

the printing on the pages was smaller

than typing, however,

he could not ascertain the exact

, size of the printing.

He stated there were approximately 100 pages in

this book, fifty pages for receiving and fifty pages for

sending.

He began using the first page for receiving

and then proceeded to the middle of the book for sending

rather than beginning at the opposite end. He believed

that the numbers were in five digit groups, that there

were about five groups to a line, and about forty lines

to a page. The lines ran consecutively for twenty lines

and then a double blank space appeared in the middle

of each page and twenty more lines appeared below this

spacing.

When sending or receiving a message he began using

the first half of the page. If the message did not

necessitate the use of

the whole twenty line group, he

disregarded any remaining numbers in the first half of the

page for his second message.

He would begin his second

message then with the bottom half of the page.

When he

Iinished with the two halves of any page, he tore this page

from his book and destroyed it by burning.

In the back inside cover of the book was the code

that he utilized. This consisted of the German alphabet

with numbers after the letters signifying what numbers

should be used for what letters.

He stated that to the

best of his recollection, the majority of letters utilized

three digits, however, some had two and some had four

digits.

basic language used for the code was the German

language. The alphabet in the code book was not a complete

German alphabet, as several letters were missing. The missing

letters were repetitious letters which were differentiated

with an umlaut.

In addition to the alphabet, the code

contained

punctuation signs such as neriods, commas,

and s

so forth and he believed that all punctuatiun signs

NY 65-18217

consisted of five digits.

There were no numerals in the

code and for the numbers zero through nine, the spelling

of these numbers was encoded. He stated that there

were also special signs in the code which also had

numerical equivilents although he could not remember

the number of digits used in these equivilents.

He

, said that there was a special sign that meant that

what followed this sign in the message was in the Latin

alphabet rather than the German alphabet. There was another

sign which meant that what followed this sign was again

going to be in the German alphabet.

He stated that this

was necessary because being in America you would run

Into words which could not directly be translated into

German and, therefore, would necessitate lt to be written

in English.

The only other things

appearing on the back

page of this code book was a set of numbers which was

his code name for sigring his secret writing message.

As an example of how he utilized this code he

provided the following ercoding of the word "dear":

He stated that when enciphering the code, the

numbers from the cipher pad were added to the code, which

had already been prepared.

The addition was done from

the beginning i.e.,

the left side of the line.

When

the numbers were added and the total was more than 10,

anly the last digit was but down,

the first digit beine

General Instructions

After KUEHN introduced subject to SCHILLER, subject

visited the apartment in which he was trained alone.

At

the firsc meeting alone with SCHILLER, after subject was in

the apartment for about an hour, SCHILLER received a

telephone call, after which he questioned subject as to

whether subject had noticed that he had been surveilled

from the music school to the apartment. Subject advised

that he had not made any such observation and SCHILLER

proceeded to tell subject in detail what he had done

and how he had travelled from the time he left the music

school until he arrived at the apartment. SCHILLER cautioned

subject that for security reasons he must be alert for

surveillance. He told him that in crossing streets he

should look back and observe whether any person was

following him.

subject advised that on three or lour

subsequent occasions he observed KUEHN observing him

and so reported to SCHILLER.

subject stated that this

was the extent of training he had in surveillance detection.

store.

Proceed into the park in a direct line past an

open play area and proceed for about five minutes checking

behind you to male

sure you are proceeding in a direct

line with the furniture

store at your back.

After about

five minutes walking, you will come to a slight rise.

On

the other side of this rise are located three rocks.

The

first rock about shoulder height on a man, the second rock

about three feet high in line with the first and the third

rock about one foot high and in line with the other two.

Under the thira rock there will be locateá a container to

receive the messages.

The subject stated that although

he could not remember exactly,

there was some type of

path close by to the rock under which the container is

located.

Subject further advised that said path was between

the first large rock and the remaining smaller rocks.

General Observations of Subject

During Training Period

Subject advised that from various things he observed

he was sure that the apartment in which he received his

training was also being used to train other individuals for

a similar purpose.

He said that frequently on arriving at

the apartment, he would notice numerous cigarette butts

in the asn trays. He also on one occasion arrived at the

apartment approximately thirty minutes early and was told

at that time that he should not arrive before the appointed

time.

Thereafter, if he would get to the apartment before

the scheduled time he would have coffee at a nearby cafe.

While sitting in this cafe he noticed another young German

about his age walking by the cafe carrying books on several

occasions.

Also, on one occasion, when he left the apartment

he noticed this same German in the cafe having coffee and,

in his own mino, he is quite certain this individual was

perhaps destined for the United States inasmuch as subjeat

noted that he had the same German-English books as did

the subject.

While the apartment building was obviously used

for-residential purposes, the apartment which subject

visited

was at one end of the building and had large

antennas and also had the windows covered with heavy drapes.

Subject noted that on the opposite end of the apartment

building was another apartment with similar drapes and

antennas and he, therefore, concluded that probably the

second apartment was utilized for the same purpose.

In the apartment where subject received

his

training, he was always immediately escorted to one bedroom

wing of the apartment and remained in this wing all the

time he was there. He was quite certain that another

student was receiving training at the same time in the other

bedroom wing inasmuch as frequently he heard voices. In

addition, he was instructed never to come out of the rooms

he was in without knocking on the door and being permitted

to come out,

This was true whether he wanted to go to the

bathroom or wanted anything in connection with his work.

It was also tilie

"when he was through with his work

and ready to depart.

Subject observed that on several

occasions se also heard female voices.

Subject stated that he believed that both KUEHN

and SCHILLER were members of the East German Secret Police.

They never asked him about other students or his friends.

Subjert aid not inow whether anyone else was aware of the

training he war receiving, but he supposed that the principal

of the music school knew that he was under instruction

because on one occasion when he was unable to attend class

the principal said to him "Oh, it's right you are busy. I

will. get someorie to substitute for you

• subject advisec

that as the tempo of his meetings increased it was necessary

for him to miss some of his classes. SCHILLER instructed

him to skip the classes and obtain a substitute.

the classes. Subject recalls that the fiest payment he

received from SCHILLER was 400 East German marks.

were to reside in one of five cities in the United States.

He recalled that they included New York, Baltimore and

Detroit. He could not recall what the other two cities

were.

In adaition to the postcard, he sent a total of three

letters to his mall drop advising of his travels, addresses

and so forth.

He said he sent no information other than

concerning

his experiences in his travels. In each of

his letters, he included a secret writing message as he

sent long letters to his mother:

He said that actually

what he would

do in determining how long his open text

letter was to be, was to first prepare a letter to his

mother and then prepare

the open text letter which would

give him enough room to include that message to his mother

and a short message to his superiors. The three letters

subject sent were from New York City.

Subject received from his superiors four or five

letters and he stated these letters were alr mail letters

and he believed they came from France.

He said he does not

recall looking at them specifically, but believed it was a

foreign cancellation mark.

that one of the letters

from his superiors told him to go to a city in Connecticut.

and establish himself there. It was following this letter

that he made a short trip to the city in Connecticut and

thereafter to Boston before he returned to New York.

subject

did not indicate which of the letters from his superiors

contained this instruetion about going

According to subject, all of the letters

from

his superiors contained general instructions about being

careful, not overlooking

• the importance of his task and

to proceed cautiously in his activities.

He said that he

had expected to receive letters from his mother but actually

the only thing he received was a brief statement in two of

the letters that his mother was writing.

With regard to the

letters received from his superiors the subject stated that

either the first letter or the first two letters were hand

written and the remaining letters were type written. Subject

advised that he, was not told what superior would be handling

the correspondence with him, however, from the contents of the

letters which he received, he concluded that It was SCHILLER .

Inasmuch as reference was made to certain things that he and

SCHILLER had done together.

Subject said that he last wrote his superiors in

approximately September, 1959. He said that he last heard

Irom them in approximately October, 1959, and that definitely

It was before Christmas.

them and he broke off his activities by not writing them

any more. He said that they do not have his current address.

With regard to breaking off his activities, subject

said that he is not cut out for this type of work and was

sorry that he ever got involved.

He said he got involved

as a result of promises made to him, and as a result of a

desire to help his mother, and also a personal desire to

come to the United States.

He said that after his arrival in this country, he

continually worried and wanted to get out of the business:

He said that on his own

he decided he was not cut out for

this type of work and, therefore, decided to discontinue

his activities in such a manner that they would not know

what had happened to him and, therefore, would perhaps not

take any action against his mother and not cut out the money

they were furnishing her. He said that following his

decision to break away, he had disposed of his code

book by throwing it in an open sewer in the city of

Connecticut. -He said that he had rationalized with

himself that he actually had not thrown it away but had

merely dropped it.

He said that subsequently he had

destroyed two pads of the transfer paper and thought

he had destroyed all of the pills which contained the

chemicals for secret writing.

He said that he destroyed

these by throwing them

In the Hudson River after unscrewing

the caps of the bottles.

He also advised that he had

destroyed the money container which had been given hin

as he found it inconvenient to use.

At the time of the interview, subject had $200.00

concealed in the lining of his toilet kit.

This $200.00

consisted of ten twenty dollar bills and they were in

an

envelope.

Subject said that he had placed this money in

the tollet kit himself and wanted it for emergency purposes.

He said that he had not been told by his superiors where to

keep the money and had not been told by his superiors to

conceal any money in the toilet kit or similar articles.

He said the only, instruction he had about concealing something

of this nature was that he was told he could carry his cipher

pad

In his shoe and he said this was a stupid instruction

because it wore blisters on his feet. He said, therefore,

he actually carried his cipher pad in his wallet.

With regard to the emergency drop in Van Cortlandt

Park, subject stated that he had never visited this drop

but was familiar with the location of Van Cortlandt Park.

He said that he actually went to 259th Street and Broadway

and located the furniture store but had never entered the

park itself to locate the actual drop.

On October 31, 1960, the subject accompanied by

previously been located, there were no buildings standing

a construction company had excavated the site.

subject then proceeded into Van Cortlandt Park utilizing

the excavation site as a general guide. After proceeding

half a mile into Van Cortlandt Park, no rock formation was

Located which approximated the subject's previous description.

While searching for a rock formation of this type, the subject

stated, "Over there by that clump of trees". He explained

that seeing a particular clump of trees reminded him that he

observed a similar tree formation in the photographs which

had previously been shown to him by his superiors.

arriving at the site of this clump of trees, various rocks

were located, none of which actually fitted

the peculiar

formation described by the subject.

Several attempts were

made to move some of these rocks and one rock approximately

one foot high, one foot wide and two feet long when raised up

revealed a container imbedded in the dirt beneath it.

This container Is described as follows:

It is a metal container painted rust colored on

the outside and black on the inside.

One side of this container

has a sliding metal door with two magnets on each side of the

container surrounding the metal door.

The outside dimentions

of the container are 62"

Each of the four magnets have rounded

The container itself was actually left face down,

that is, with the door and magnet side in the dirt and the

door partially slit out about 3/4"

KAROT

ESP - R

Karot is code name of Kaarlo Rudolph Tuomi a

Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) illegal who cooperated

as a double agent with the FBI from March, 1959, until 1964.

In early 1959 when Tuomi appeared at a small town

returned to Finland in the early 1930's. Tuomi panicked and

left the hotel where

he was staying and an examination of

possessions left behind disclosed

paraphernalia that could

be used in espionage activities.

Investigation disclosed a Kaarlo Rudolph Tuomi

was born 11/30/16, at Ishepeming, Michigan, both parents

born in Finland.

State Department records disclosed Tuomi

at age 16 departed the United States in 1932 with his parents

to return to Finland and there was no record of him having

reentered the United States or having applied for a U.S.

passport.

In view of the results of the investigation and our

past knowledge that Soviet illegals had assumed the identity

of someone who had left the United States it appeared certain

we had an espionage subject and whether this individual was

the real Tuomi or not he apparently entered the United States

in a fraudulent manner.

His activities gave the appearance

of an illegal in the initial phase of familiarizing himself

with his cover identity.

The decision was made to interview subject in hopes

of developing him as a double agent, realizing the subject

would flee if he detected our coverage.

Subject was interviewed

from 3/9/59 to 3/18/59 at a summer house in Hartland, Wisconsin,

and agreed to cooperate.

Subject advised he was recruited

into the GRU and in May, 1957, commenced illegal training in

Moscow.

Subject furnished invaluable information regarding

the communications systems involving the illegal networks

and furnished information which assisted in the identification

of other GRU illegals. During the period subject operated

Through an anonymous source it was determined that

ithe letter was addressed to an address in helsink, finland.

The return

The contents of

A carejul analysis as to action we should take indicates two

alternatives, namely:

noping he will reveal contacts and possible associates in espionage

activity. This we feel unwise as it is a highly defensive position

with the

probability of success not balanced in our favor.

us that the handwriting in these letters is identical with the hand

writing of subject appearing on various registration cards of hotels

at which subject has stayed. Surveilling agents who have observed

subject disagreed as to whether subject appears identical with the 1952

intended to depart from New Iork in September, 1932 to visit Finland

and sweden. Passport included Tuomi born 11-30-16 Ishpeming (near

Negaunee, Michigan. The file jurther reflects that the American Embassy

in Moscow adui sed

the state Department that Robert Saastamoinen had

obtained souiet citizenship on 7-5-34.

A certificate of expatriation

dated 4-22-38 was prepared by the American Embassy in Moscow on

saastamoinen. It was stated that since the stepson (Fuomi) was over

I? years of age at the time of his acquisition of soviet citizenship

through naturalization of his stepfather and since no information was

available that he gave his consent to soviet naturalization, a

certificate of expatriation would not be prepared on the stepson until

after he reached his majority. No other information appears in State

Department files on ruomi.

Re :

Kaarlo Rudolph luont, also known as

105-76441

To date we have been unable to determine the do, e and

mode of entry of subject into the United States.

We are still

continuing our efforts to resolve this.

Courses L Action I

that kay be Taken

From the foregoing there appear to be

overwhelming

indications that subject, whether or not he is the real ruomi,

has recently re-entered the United states in a clandestine manner.

His activities to date appear to be that of an "illegal" agent in

the initial phase of his operation, loe.s building up his background

as an American by fomiliarizing himself with that part of the

United states Tuomi originally come from so that he will be above

suspicion in playing the part. The next phase will probably be for

him to establish for himself a residence and business cover.

Assuming that subject is an "illegal" who has recently

arrived it will probably be several months before subject engages

in any activities such as making contacts. (lote: In ine abel case,

Reino Hayhanen's initial contact was made about y months after he

entered the United States).

According to Agents having subject under surveillance he

does not appear to be surveillance conscious.

This could be explained

by the fact that he has not considered it necessary to check for

surveillances since he is not ready to make any contacts of significance.

Ther first question that arises is whether we should continue our

efforts to cover subject with the hope of making his contacts and

uncovering an espionage network. Of course, it must be realized that

as time goes on we run the risk of subject detecting such coverage

cover his activities and identify his contacts with the end in mind

of developing an espionage prosecution.

However, inasmuch as such

coverage would have to be maintained for several months the risk of

losing him increases. I he does disappear, our opportunity of

uncovering his operations

would be lost forever.

An alternative course of action would be to take our

chances of approaching him at this time with the hope of breaking

him and possibly operating him as a double agent. If he refuses to

cooperate we will have at least neutralized him.

In considering

chances of developing him, it is felt we might have a psychological

advantage particularly if we are right in believing that he is a new

arrival in this country.

In attempting to establish himself he

undoubtedly is under some tension and uncertain of himself.

KAARLO RUDOLPH TUOMI

ESPIONAGE • R

The two alternatives boil down to this:

(1) Continue to attempt coverage of subject by surveillance,

hoping he will reveal contacts and possible associates in espionage

activity. This we feel unwise as it is a highly defensive position

with the probability of success not balanced in our favor.

If SUD

ject recently arrived in U.s. (as it appears) it may be months be-

sore he makes any espionage contacts and any surueillance over this

extended period of time may well be detected and subject might dis

appear with little of value gained by us. By letting subject carry

on we would be letting him pick his own course of action and we

would be constantly on the defensive trying to guess his moves and

defend against them.

(2) Intensively interview subject before he gets his cover

in this country all set and while he is still away from New York

(probably his base of operations). He have developed considerable

information unich subject will have to refute and the unexpected in

terview, plus our knowledge, my put him on the defensive and give

us a psychological eage. Our prime target indulegal case is to

penetrate the network and develop a double agent.

This case gives

us an opportunity and the value to the U.s.,

if successful, would be

tremendous.

Recognizing that if unsuccessful the intensive inter-

view probably required will rule out subsequent prosecution or pubo

Licitys we can still neutralize subjecto an the remote event the

subject should be legitimate, this could be quickly determined early

in the interuiew and there would

be no problem. We feel the in-

tensive interureu, ouer an

extended period of time if necessary, is

the proper course of action.

to an apartment which he described as being on the

9th iloor of a building in which building the elevator ran only

to the 8th floor. The only floor above him in this building

was an attic. The apartment was composed of a kitchenette

containing a gas stove, refrigerator and table. The llving

room contained a television set, radio, table, a grandfather's

clock that rang every half hour and an old-fashioned cupboard

with a glass door for dishes.

The bedroom had twin beds,

wardrobe and

a big mirror with a dressing table that was

located on the wall opposite the doorway. In the attic there .

was a room for photography work.

Although the first approach to Subject had been made by a representa-

tive of State security, he reallzed, upon entering his Intelligence

training in Moscow, that he would be working for soviet Military

Intelligence. He stated

he was required to sign a statement in .

which he pledged to work for Soviet Military Intelligence and

keep any information coming to his attention in a secret and

confidential manner. Subject stated thet ha thought that he was

probably assigned to work for Soviet Military Intelligence

because of the faot that he had a knowlodge of English which

would enable him to be of service to Military Intelligence abroad.

He had nevor been advised as to the difference between soviet

state security and Soviet Military Intelligence but he assumed

that soviet State Security was responsible for detecting foreign

Intelligonce organizationu working within the UsSR. He said

that he belleved that state Scourity would send some representatives

abroad for the purpose of datermining if a particular foreign

government was sending agorts into fussia. He belleved, however,

that this representative of stato security working in a foreign

country was not chargod with any espionage responsibilities in

that particular country. In hia own estimation, Subject thought

that the responsibilities of Military Intelligence were to carry

on espionage activities in foreign countries. He aldo

out that he krow of another Soviet intelligence agency calledd

Ecchomic Intelligonce but he did not know It this organization

was a part of State Security or Soviet Military Intelligence.

and drops and as a practical part of his course, subject was

required to detect and lose survelllances by persons unknown

know all of the facts whish he taught through actual experience,

but had obtained some of his information through books and reports

from other persons.

With regard to determining surveillances in the U.S., Subject

Although Military Intelligence did not advise him definitely

with regard

to this point,

they hinted that later in his

intelligence career he would probably be working with someone

GUNSON

ESP - R

Gunson is code name for a Soviet Military Intelli-

gence (GRU) illegal identified in September, 1961, utilizing

the identity of Richard Earl Hauta.

Subject was identified

as the result of the Sam Survey program which was a program

whereby Special Agents reviewed air mail directed to specific

European cities and countries with the object of identifying

correspondence of Soviet illegal agents.

In septender,

1961,

subject became a prime suspect as a Soviet illegal utilizing

an accommodation address in Helsinki, Finland.

Background investigation disclosed that Richard

Earl Hauta was born 11/21/26 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. His

father was listed as Axel Hauta who was born 2/26/03 Brantwood,

Wisconsin, and his mother, Adi Hauta was born 10/12/05 in

Clifford,

Wisconsin.

The Hauta family obtained passports to

travel to Finland in 1931. A review of State Department

records revealed that during the middle 1940's the Hauta

family was in the Soviet Union and there was no record

in State Department files to indicate the return of Mr. or

Mrs. Hauta or the son, Richard Earl to the

United States.

He was employed as a photographer by Roberts Studio,

3072 Steinway Street, New York, New York, since May, 1959,

and resided at 1703 Montgomery, Bronx, New York. Investigation

pointed out discrepancies in Hauta's documentation and an

FBI Laboratory examination of a letter directed to

Hauta established that the letter was typed on the same

typewriter utilized in sending communications to the subject

azed In sendie

of the Karot case, a GRU illegal who cooperated as a double

agent with the FBI from May, 1959 until 1964.

In view of the successful results of the Karot

case, the subject was interviewed and cooperated with the

FBI as a double agent until his departure from the United States

on May 16, 1962.

Subject was interviewed from 9:30 a.m. 10/16/61

until noon 10/22/61 under secure conditions when he was

released and proceeded unaccompanied to his residence in

New York. Subject admitted he was Leonard Vassilevitch

into the Soviet Intelligence Service in 1955 and began his

training as an illegal in the GRU in an apartment in Moscow

at that time. Subject furnished complete information pertaining

to his training and assignments in the United States, the

methods of communications and identified two other Soviet

illegals with whom he had been in contact with in the

United States. He advised his assignment related to the

development of information concerning naval operations, the

Berlin situation and any mobilization plans under way in the

United States.

Subject cooperated as a double agent until he

departed to the Soviet Union in May, 1962, in accordance with

instructions from Centre on anticipated home leave with the

expectation he would return to the United States. To this

date he has never returned.

An analysis of other activities

pertaining to this case indicates that subject would not be

returning to the United states.

In view of the fact that subject cooperated with

the FBI, returned to the Soviet Union, and

exact whereabouts

are not known at this time, this information should be closely

held so as not to effect the security of the subject.

Subject is the Soviet

illegal agent uncovered in New York

on 9-3-61 as a result of highly confidential airmail coverage.

In-

vestigation has determined he is using the identity of an individual

born in Milwaukee who went to the Soviet Union with his parents at

an early age.

ASAC Schmit, NYO, advised on 9-29-61 that a letter has been

the same typewriter utilized in sending communications to the Soviet

illegal agent who is our informant in the KAROT case. In fact, a

letter prepared on this typewriter addressed to our informant was mailed

In NYC at 10:30 PM on 9-2t61 and the letter, to the subject was mailed

in NYC at 10:30 PM on

9-28-61..

• The contents of the envelope addressed to subject were two

sheets of advertising material of the Gray Manufacturing Company,

High Fidelity Division.

The lower right hand corner of each sheet

has been folded which, as we know from the KARCT case, means there

is secret writing on the back of the paper. The paper is also folded

so that the blank side is on the inside in order to protect the secret.

ASAC Schmit said that NY was in favor of withholding this

letter from the subject and conducting an immediate interview of him

of the type conducted in the KAROT case. He said in the alternative

should it be decided the letter go through, New York still felt an

immediate

interview should be conducted. Schmit said this recom-

agents conduct themselves and the secure systems they have for com

munication make it extremely. unlikely that normal investigative

measures would provide information concerning the actual clandestine

activities.

He said that recognizing the extreme difficulties in

such an interview, he felt the interview should be conducted and he

felt the letter should be withheld from the subject to prevent any

possibility of it containing any instructions for him to disappear.

OBSERVATIONS:

Bed New York's position has merit and it may well be that

after subject receives the letter he may disappear, It is also true

that the great potential in one of these cases is in doubling the in-

dividual and this can only be accomplished through an interview.

Nevertheless, we have been extremely discreet in our investigation of

this subject

to date.

We are accumulating information about the in-

dividuals he is in touch with in New York and about his habits and

personality, all of which will be helpful should we subsequently

want to interview him.

We have been investigating him Lass than &

month and we believe that additional time may enable us to obtain

more valuable information concerning him. We therefore feel that

we should permit the letter to go through and run the calculated risk

in hopes that at a subsequent time we will be better prepared to

conduct an interview or take any additional action warranted. It

fis recognized that a decision as to interview will probably be desir-

able within the near future.

While it is not known definitely how this would be

She has expressed a willingness for

and her position as a Soviet agent, we are

In view of her illegal status in the Us

justified in taking this action.

Through intermittent interrogation

over a period of

time, a fey days or a week as

has been done in the past with other Soviet

illegals,

we can anticipate getting her full

Story

and this, as has been noted, should be

valuable to us.

If at the end of that time she is not

completely cooperative we can then consider

other alternative steps which can be taken.

For example,

we can then consider

curning her over to the Soviet hission to the

United Nations (SHUN, presenting her as one

of their illegal agents uncovered in the Us.

If they refuse to accept her

we might escort

her to a plane en route to the Soviet Union.

Of course

we would arrange to have photographs

taken of her when we present her to the SilUN

and_photographs taken of her being placed aboard

i at open upon developens during the

interview.

ACTION:

with the ab you astee, we will proceed in line

New York City who has been under interrogation by New York Agents

since 4/9/63.

Our New York Office advises that subject ha furnished

the complete story of her life and activities here and from the

information previously available to us concerning her, it appears

that she is telling the truth.

New York Agents characterize her as a

very intelligent person with good educational background equivalent

to that of a Ph.D.

Prior to her intelligence activities she was in

the Soviet diplomatic service for a number of years and is very proud

of her service for the Soviets and for that reason she insists she

to the soviets dee

will never reveal to the soviets her cooperation with us in order to

protect her career.

She advises she is scheduled to return to the Soviet Union

around May I and that she will continue her cooperation with us until

her return. Further, that if she ever comes back to this country or .

is given an assignment in another country, she is a potential to

cooperate in furnishing information.

In order to allay any suspicions on the part of the

Soviets of her cooperation and in order for her to keep certain

for the soviet Union. She has promised she will continue to meet

with New York Agents regularly until that time and cooperate fully.

New York Office strongly recommends that this be done.

In view of her cooperation and her promise to continue this

cooperation, it is believed desirable that she be returned to her

apartnent at this time.
