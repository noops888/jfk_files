SYLVIA DURAN'S PREVIOUS STATEMENTS RE LEE HARVEY OSWALD'S

VISIT TO THE CUBAN CONSULATE IN MEXICO CITY

Qui

On November 23, 1963, one day after the assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy, the Central Intelligence

Agency's Mexico City Station suggested to Mexican officials

that they arrest Sylvia Tirado de Duran. (Mexi 7029 to

the Director, Nov. 23, 1963; Note to Luis Echevarria,

November 23, 1963) The Mexico City Station asked that

Sylvia Tirado de Duran be held incommunicado until she told

the Mexican officials everything she knew about Lee Harvey

Oswald.

The Mexican government arrested Sylvia Tirado de

Duran the same day. Captain Fernando Gutierrez Barrios,

Assistant Director of the Federal Security Police, interro-

gated her at 6:00 p.m. that evening. (CE 2121, p. 35)

Version of Interrogation Given to the Warren Commission

By The Mexican Government

Ms. Duran stated that she became secretary to the

Consul, Eusebio Azcue, three months prior to the assassina-

tion of President John F. Kennedy, due to the death of

Maricarmen Olivari. (Ibid. p. 37) She stated that in late

September or early October of 1963 a North American by the

name of Lee Harvey Oswald appeared at the Cuban Consulate

and applied for an intransit visa to Russia by way of

Cuba. (Ibid. p. 39) Duran stated that. Oswald presented

presented evidence that he had been in Russia for three

years, that he was married to a Russian woman and also

that he was the leader

of an organization in New Orleans

called "Fair Play for Cuba." Sylvia Duran stated that

Oswald stressed that his visa application should be accepted

as he was a friend of the Cuban Revolution. (Ibid. p. 39)

Sylvia Duran stated that there, in compliance with her

duties, she had Oswald fill out the appropriate application

(Ibid. p. 39). Oswald then left and returned in the after-

noon with the necessary photographs. (Ibid. p. 39) Ms.

Duran stated that at that time, exceeding her duties,

she

telephoned the Russian Consulate because of her interest

in facilitating the handling of the Russian visa for

Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid. p. 39) The Russian Embassy told

Duran that there would be a delay of approximately four

months in processing the case, which annoyed Lee Harvey

Oswald since, according to his statements, he was in a

great hurry to obtain a visa to travel to Russia. He

insisted on his right to obtain a visa in view of his back-

ground and activities on behalf of the Cuban movement. (Ibid.

p. 39) When Oswald understood that it was not possible

to give him a Cuban visa without previously obtaining a

Russian visa, he became extremely angry. (Ibid. p. 39)

At this point Ms. Duran stated she called Consul Azcue,

who, at that time was in his private office accompanied

by his upcoming replacement Alfredo Mirabal. (Ibid. p. 40)

Mr. Azcue came out of his office and argued with Oswald

in English. (Ibid. p. 40) Ms. Duran stated that Mr.

Azcue told Oswald that a person like him instead of aiding

the Cuban Revolution, did it harm. (Ibid., p. 40) Oswald

at that point stated that he had two reasons for request-

ing his visa with such urgency: one, that his Mexican

per -

mit expired soon; and two, that he needed to reach Russian

soon. (Ibid., p. 40) Sylvia Duran stated that in spite

of the argument she gave Oswald a pice of paper with her

name and Consulate business phone number (11-28-47) (Ibia.,

p. 40) Ms. Duran stated that she also initiated the handl-

ing of his visa application by sending it to the Cuban

Ministry of Foreign Relations, from which a reply was re-

cevied in the normal manner some fifteen to thirty days

later approving the issuance of an intransit visa on

the condition that he previously obtain a Russian visa.

(Ibid. p. 40) Mrs. Duran stated that she does not recall

whether Oswald subsequently called her on the Consulate

phone number which she had given him. (Ibid. p. 40) Sylvia

Duran stated that all the conversations that Eusebio Azcue

and she had with Oswald were in the English language since

Oswald did

not speak any Spanish. (Ibid. p. 40) Finally,

she stated that upon

seeing Lee Harvey Oswald's photograph

in the newspapers, she immediately recognized and identi-

fied it as being

the same person that she remember as Lee

Harvey Oswald. (Ibid. p. 40)

they were detaining her to protect her. (HSCA Staff Inter-

view of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78 p.

Subsequently about her second detainment, Duran stated,

"They were very rough this time...they repeated the same

questions but they

were more, how do you say, evil. And

they...wanted to know exactly what I have done in Cuba,

the people that I met there, everything. They were asking

me questions about all the people that were working the

Embassy and this time I wanted to go to the bathroom and

they wouldn't let me and it was longer, because it was

from 10:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (HSCA Staff Interview of

Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78 p.

According to the Mexican officials that detained Duran

a second time she remembered Oswald perfectly and denied

he wore glasses. Otherwise there was no addition to her yo

story. (Cable from Mexico City Station to Director,

HSCA INVESTIGATION OF SYLVIA DURAN'S ACCOUNT OF LEE HARVEY

OSWALD'S VISIT TO THE CUBAN CONSULATE IN MEXICO CITY

To investigate Sylvia Duran's account of Lee Har-

Pcswaza's 1161ls lo iho cuba consulate ti commictee

sought the cooperation of

the Cuban Government. The Com-

mittee traveled to Cuba twice interviewing most of the

Cuban employees at the Cuban Consulate and Embasssy in

Mexico City in September 1963. (See Procedural Writeups

Cuba Trips 1 and 2) Only two individuals remembered Oswald,

Eusbio Azcue Lopez and Alfredo Mirabal Diaz. Only EusEbio

Azcue personally dealt with Lee Harvey Oswald. Afredo

Mirabal could only state that he never doubted that the

Lee Harvey Oswald who visited the Consulate was the same.

Lee Harvey Oswald shot by Jack Ruby in the basement of the

Dallas Police Department, that he caught only glimpses of

him. (HSCA Interview of Alfredo Mirabal Diaz,

p.

For this reason, only Eusebio Azcue Lopez and Sylvia Tirado

Bazan's accounts will be dealt with in detail.

RECONSTI

After interviewing Sylvia Duran and Eusebio Azcue

the

Comnittee has found conflicting stories...

MS. Duran

told the Committee that Lee Harvey Oswald visited the

Cuban Consulate on three occasions, all on September 27,

1963. (HSCA Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/79, JFK Docu-

ment. No.

, p. 523) This contradicts her statement

to the Mexican officials that Oswald had visited the Con-

sulate on two occasions, both on September 27, 1963. (See

section entitled Version of Interrogative Given to the

Warren Commission by Mexican Government. ( (Also, see sec-

tion entitled Original Signed Statement of Sylvia Duran

Interrogation by the Mexican Government.) Though neither

report quotes Tirado as stating that Oswald's visits were

on September 27, 1963, she states that they occurred on

the same day in late September or early October. (Ibid.)

When the House Select Committee on Assassinations checked

Oswald's visa application, the date September 27, 1963

was clearly markedon it. (See Oswald Visa application.)

Mr. Azcue remembered three visits to the Cuban Con-

sulate occurring on different dates.

Mr. Azcue stated

that Oswald's first visit would have been "one or two days

prior to the date on the visa application at around 1:00

p.m." (HSCA Interview of Eusebio Azcue,

, p. 3) MI. Azcue stated that Oswald

probably returned to the Consulate the following day

"at approximately the same time that he came on his first

visit" (Ibid., p. 4) with his photographs--"probably

that same day listed on the (visa) application, the 27th

of September." (Ibid., p. 3) Azcue stated that Oswald

left to get a Soviet visa and probably returned to the

Cuban Consulate one day after he had filled out the visa.

(Ibid., p. 6 (Tape 2)) Mr. Azcue

stated that it was then

that he had the argument with Oswald. (Ibid., p. 6 Tape 2)

Ms. Tirado stated that Oswald first visited the

Cuban Consulate at approximately 11:00 a.m. requesting

an intransit visa to Cuba with Russia as the final destina-

tion. Oswald showed her some documents and then left to

obtain photographs needed for his application.

(House Se-

lect Committee on Assassinations Interview of Sylvia Duran,

Consul Eusebio Azcue stated that Oswald's first

with the photographs "probably that same day listed on the

with Eusebio Azcue, JFK Document No.

: p.3) This is

the Oswald visit Ms. Tirado had never mentioned before or

had mentioned but had never been reported before. (See

above.)

Ms. Tirado stated that

she typed Oswald's visa

application in duplicate, staped a picture on top of each

and had #swald sign each in her presence. (House Select Com-

mittee on Assassinations Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78,

her special documents he had brought with him: his Russian

labor card,

marriage certificate with name of Russian wife,

his American Communist Party membership card and his

"Fair Play for Cuba" membership card. (HSCA, Ibia., p. 28);

When Azcue noticed that Oswald was a stubborn man he told

Oswald that obviously he was not a friend of the Cuban

Revolution, because if he was a friend he would understand

that Cuba had to be extremely careful with the people it

allowed in Cuba. (Ibid., p. 47) Ms. Tirado stated that

Azcue and Oswald yelled at each other. (Ibid. 44) Azcue

then went to the door, opened it and asked Oswald to

leave. (Ibid. 47)

Ms. Tirado stated that Oswald did not revisit or.

telephone the Consulate because if he had she would have

remembered it.. She stated that the Consulate did not have

many American visitors who had been to Russia and had

married a Russian woman attempt to get a Cuban visa and

then get into an argument with staff personnel. (Ibid. p

Lee Harvey Oswald's number of visits to the Cuban

Consulate on September 27, 1963 are not of major substan-

Ms. Duran told House Select Committe on Assassinations

staffers that Lee Harvey Oswald made his third visit to the

Consulate late afternoon around 5:00 p.m. (HSCA Interview

surveilled both the Cuban and Soviet Diplomatic compounds

electronically. From the electric surveillance of the

Soviet Embassy the Central Intelligence Agency learned

of the following two conversations in die

At approximately 4:05 p.m.

" Sylvia Duran called

the Soviet Embassy. She told the person at the Embassy

that an American citizen seeking a visa was at the Cuban

Consulate. Sylvia explained that the American citizen

wanted to know the name of the official he had dealt with

at the Soviet Embassy. Sylvia had sent the American to

the Soviet Embassy stating that his acquiring a Cuban

visa was contingent on his previously acquiring a Soviet

visa. Sylvia explained to the soviet official. that the

American had stated that he was assured that there would

be no problem.: At that point, the Soviet official put

another official on the phone, causing Sylvia to repeat

the story.. The official then asked Sylvia to leave her

name and number to call her later. This conversation was

also in Spanish. (Classified Staff Summary of Review

of CIA Documents, 3/9/78, pp. 6-7; Cable from Mexico to

the Director, 11/23/63, MEXI 7025; CIA Transcript from

Russian Embassy, 9/27/63.)

At 4:26 p.m. an unidentified Soviet official

called Sylvia Duran inquiring whether the American citizen

had been to the Cuban consulate office.

Sylvia responded

NW 53080 DocId: 32271437 Page 16

Page 20.

affirmatively, stating that the American was at the office

at that time. The Soviet official told Sylvia that when

the American visited the Soviet Consulate office he had

displayed papers from the Soviet Consulate in Washington.

He also had a letter stating that he was a member of an

organization that favored Cuba. The American wanted to

go to the U.S.S.R. with his Russian wife and remain there

a long time. The Soviet official had not received an

answer from Washington to the American's problem. The prob-

lem traditionally took four to five months to resolve be-

cause Washington had to secure

authorization from the

U.S.S.R. The Soviet official added that the American's

wife could get a visa in Washington very quickly and she

could have it sent anywhere but

that he felt that the Ameri-

can would not

get a visa soon. Sylvia said that the Cuban

government could not give the American a visa because he

had neither friends in Cuba nor authorization (?) for a

visa from the U.S.S.R. The Soviet official added that

the Soviets could not give the American a letter of recom-

mendation because they did not know him.. This conversa-

tion was also in the Spanish transcripts. (Classified

These two phone calls were summarized by Sylvia

Duran when she stated that she called the Russian Consu-

late who said that Oswald had been told that the reply

from the Soviet Union would take approximately four months.

(See Version of interrogation given to the Warren Commis-

sion by Mexican Government; Original signed statement of

Sylvia Duran Interrogation by the Mejican government; and

HSCA interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document No.

Ms. Duran failed to mention that the soviet official took

her number and called her back. The Committee attributes

Ms. Duran's neglect to mention the call from the unidenti-

fied Soviet--probably the Soviet Consul--to forgetfulness,

since she has consistently stated the substance of the

conversation. (Ibid.)

Mr. Azcue stated that he understood that the

Soviet Consul called him but "maybe a secretary called

the Soviet Consul and then the Soviet Consul called me,

that's possible. (HSCA interview of Eusebio Azcue, JFK

Document No.

, Tape 2, P. 11) Mr. Azcue's statement

does not explain the Friday, September 27, 1963, 4:26 p.m.

call because it was Sylvia who spoke to the Soviet Consul.

(See September 27, 1963, 4:26 p.m. call.) Azcue states

that he spoke to the Soviet Consul.

The Committee has ne-

ver seen a transcript of this phone call. One of four ex-

planations

is possible: l) The Soviet Consul called Azcue

from a telephone at the Soviet Embassy that was not tapped;

2) the Soviet Consul called Azcue from outside the soviet

compounds; and 3) Mr. Azcue never spoke to the Soviet

Consul--Sylvia Duran did--and recalls discussing the call

with her, making him believe

that it was he who spoke to

the Soviet Consul; or 4) the Soviet Consul did call Azcue

on one of the tapped phones and the C.I.A. never forwarded

the transcript to the House Select Committee on Assassina-

tions staffers to review.

Ms. Duran stated that the guard routinely called

her when an individual who did not speak Spanish came to

the gate inquiring about a visa after work hours.. (HSCA

Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document No.

p. 544) Sylvia Duran stated that she would normally ask

the guard to escort the individual to her office.

(Ibid.

p. 544) At this point Committee staffers asked her if it

was possible that in addition to his visits on Friday,

September 27, he also visited the Consulate on Saturday,

September 28, though the office was again not open to the

public. (Ibia. p. 547) Ms. Duran stated that it was not

possible because she remembered the fight and would have

remembered if he came back. (Ibid. p. 547) When asked if

there was a guard at the gate on Saturdays, Sylvia Duran

answered yes, but that he never let people in Saturdays

because he could reach her on the intercommunications

telephone. (Ibid. p. 549) When the Committee staffers

explained to Ms. Duran that the guard could also do that

on Fridays, Ms. Duran stated that he remembered having

given Lee Harvey Oswald her name and business telephone

number on his second visit. (Ibid. p. 549) The Committee

does not consider Ms. Duran's answer responsive because

Lee Harvey Oswald probably had her name and business

telephone number on Saturday, also. When the Committee

staffers pressed Ms. Duran on her answer she stated that

the guard was allowed to bring individuals to her office

during the five to eight non-public work

but not on weekends. (Ibid. p. 549)

weekdays

The Committee does not consider her explanation

credible. Eusebio Azcue

stated that visiting hours at

the Cuban Consulate were 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. Monday

through Saturday. (HSCA Interview of Eusibio Azcue, 4/3/78,

JFK Document NO.

Also, from the electronic surveillance of the

Soviet Embassy by the Central Intelligence Agency Mexico

City Station the Committee learned that on Saturday, Sep-

tember 28, 1963, Sylvia Duran called the Soviet Consulate

at 11:51 a.m. stating that there was an American citizen

at the Cuban Consulate who had previously visited the

Soviet Consulate.

The Soviet asked Sylvia to wait a minute.

Upon his return to the telephone, Sylvia put the American

on

the line. At first, the American spoke in Russian

and the Soviet spoke English. The conversation then pro-

ceded in English until the Russian discontinued it, and

put another Soviet on the line. The Soviet spoke in

English but the American, in broken Russian, asked him

to speak Russian. The conversation resumed in Russian

at that point. It also became incoherent and is thus

quoted in its entirety:

Russian: What else do you want?

American: I was just now at your Embassy and they

took my address.

Russian: I know that.

American: --speaks terrible, hardly recognizable

Russian. I did not know it then. I went to the

Cuban Embassy to ask them for my address, because

they have it.

Russian: Why don't you come again and leave your

address with us? it is not far from the Cuban

Embassy.

American: Well, I'll be there right away.

The Committee feels that there is a possibility

that the American Sylvia Duran put in contact with a So-

viet official on Saturday, September 28, 1963, was Lee

Harvey Oswald. The American citizen had previously visited

the Soviet Consulate and called from Sylvia Duran's of-

fice on a Saturday when the guard never allowed visitors

into the Cuban compound., (Ibid. p. 549)

The Committee feels that Sylvia may have lied

about

an Oswald visit to the Cuban Consulate on Saturday,

September 28, 1963, for either of two reasons: 1) Ms.

Duran did not wish to disclose that Oswald had visited

the Cuban Consulate again after his argument with Consul

Eusebio Azcue and that she had decided to aid him; 2) Ms.

Duran may have had personal reasons. Elena Garro de Paz

reported that she attended a "twist party at Ruben Duran's

house which Oswald, accompanied by two other American young

men, also attended." (See write-up.) Elena also reported

that Duran had an affair with Lee Harvey Oswald. (Ibid.)

The Committee attempted to locate Elena Garro de Paz who

might have shed some light into this area.

(See Elena

write-up.) If Sylvia Duran did in fact have an affair

with Lee Harvey Oswald, he might have visited the Consulate

on Saturday and Sylvia would have denied it.

The Committee also feels that there is a possibility

that the man Sylvia put on the phone with the soviet offi-

cial on September 28, 1963 was not Oswald. The man Duran

put on the line spoke broken Russian. George De

Mohren-

schildt, Marina Oswald and George Bouke all stated that

Oswald spoke a very refined Russian and that he preferred

speaking Russian to English. (Note: String Cites:

Nonetheless, Ms. Duran lied to the Committee about

the guard not allowing visitors into the Cuban compound

on Saturdays as the electronic surveillance files for

September 28, 1963 illustrate$.

When Eusebio Azcue and Sylvia Tirado were asked

to describe Lee Harvey Oswald, both gave similar discrip-

tions of him that are not even remotely close to Oswald's

physical appearance. Consul Azcue stated that the man

who visited the Consulate looking for a visa differed

from HSCA JFK Exhibit No.

as follows: his nose was

more aquiline; his eyelashes were straighter; his hair

was blonde; his height was between five feet six and five

feet seven; he was between 35 and 37 years of age; his

cheeks were sunken; and, he had a cold look in his eyes.

(House Select Committee on Assassinations Interview of

Eusebio Azcue,

• JFK Document No.

• pp. 19-21)

Consul Eusebio Azcue further stated that the man who

came to the Cuban Consulate requesting an intransit visa

and the person that Jack Ruby assassinated at the Dallas

police station--which he saw on television--were different

persons. (Ibid. p. 18)

Ms. Tirado stated that the person that visited

the Cuban Consulate and the person she saw Jack Ruby as-

sassinate at the Dallas police station were the same per-

son. (HSCA Interview of Sylvia Duran, 6/6/78, JFK Document

NO.

• p.

) Yet, when Ms. Tirado describes the

(alleged) Lee Harvey Oswald that visited the Cuban Consulate,

the man does not really bear any resemblance to Lee Harvey

Oswald. Ms. Tirado stated that Lee Harvey Oswald was

approximately five feet six, had blonde hair, weighed

about 125 pounds, had small eyes, smaller fingers than

Ed Lopez (HSCA staffer) and did not have very much hair.

(Ibid. p. 96)

Since neither description resembles Oswald the

Committee has determined that there is a possibility that

the man who visited the Cuban Consulate was not Lee Harvey

Oswald. It is difficult to justify the above since the

House Select Conmittee Handwriting Panel has determined

that the signature on the visa application matches other

samples of Lee Harvey Oswald's signature. There is a pos-

sibility that a man who

claimed that he was Lee Harvey Oswald

picked up an application, took it to Lee Harvey Oswald who

filled it, attached pictures, signed it and then returned

to the Cuban Consulate once again impersonating him. The

Committee considers this a possibility because when the

Committee staffers asked Duran if she would ever have

allowed a person to take the application out of the Con-

sulate, fill it out, attach a photo, sign them

and then

return them to the Embassy she answered affirmatively.

(Ibid. p. 31) (Also no photos materialized.) The one

problem with this possibility is that Ms. Tirado stated

that she thinks Lee Harvey Oswald signed the visa application

in

her presence. (Ibid. p. 33)

CIA Handling of Sylvia Duran Matter

President

When/ John F. Kennedy was

assassinated on November

22, 1963, the United States investigative agencies -- FBI,

CIA, Secret Service, etc.--were asked to investigate the

assassination. When the Central Intelligence Agency learned

that Lee Harvey Oswald had visited Mexico City between

late September and early October they reviewed their

files and found in the electronic surveillance files

phone calls to the

Soviet Embassy made September 27th,

September 28th, and October Ist.

that could have been

made by Oswald. (See Electronic Surveillance Section.)

They also found phone calls between the Russian Consul

and Sylvia Duran where Oswald appeared to be discussed.

(See

Soviet Electronic Surveillance Section.) In addition

they found a phone call made by Sylvia Duran to the

Soviet Consulate on September 28, 1978, where Sylvia Duran

stated that there was an American citizen at the Cuban

Consulate who had previously visited the Soviet Consulate,

and put a man on the line. (See Soviet Electronic Surveil-

lance Section.) A final phone call where Oswald identified

himself was

also found. (See Soviet Electronic Surveillance

Section.)

At this point the Central Intelligence Agency

determined that it would ask the Mexican Government--

whom it had

a good relationship with--to arrest Sylvia

Duran because she might shed some light on the circum-

stances surrounding the assassination. Sylvia Duran was

also a Mexican citizen and did not have diplomatic immunity.

The Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Station

sent a note to Luis Echevarria requesting that he arrest

Sylvia Sylvia Tirado de Duran immediately. The agency

stated that

she was a Mexican citizen who had put Oswald

in touch with the Soviet Embassy. The agency gave Echevarria

a note with Duran's address, her mother's address, her

brother's address, her license plate number, her home

phone number and her place of work. The Mexico City

Station also suggested that Duran be held incommunicado

until she could be questioned on the matter. (Note to Luis

Echevarria to arrest Sylvia Duran, November 23, 1963, CIA

The request to Luis Echevarria was not authorized

by the Central Intelligence Agency's Headquarters.

they received the cable on November 23, 1963, Headquarters

discovery

The Central Intelligence Agency feared/that Amer-

icans were behind the arrest of Sylvia Duran.

It would

endanger their continuing convert surveillance operations.

For this reason the Mexico City Station requested the

Mexicans to arrest Sylvia Duran on their initiative.

Similar logic dictated when Headquarters asked the Mexico

City Station to request the Mexican authorities to inter-

rogate Sylvia Duran to the extent necessary to clarify

the outstanding points raised in their fables the previous

forty-eight hours. Headquarters

stated that the Mexico

City Station could provide questions to the Mexican

interrogators but that they wished no Americans to come

in contact with Duran. (Cable CIA Headquarters to Mexico

City Station, November 27, 1963, DIR 85318, CIA NO. 497;

chronology of Anne Goodpasture, November 27, 1963, entry

no. 121, CIA No. 653) When on November 27, 1963, the

Mexico City Station sent a photostatic copy of Sylvia Du-

ran's ten page signed statement to Headquarters (Cable

Mexi 7105, CIA No. 479; Chronology of Anne Goodpasture,

November 27, 1963, entry no. 127, CIA No. 656) the follow-

ing day Headquarters sent a clarification cable to the

Mexico City Station. Headquarters wanted to insure that

neither Sylvia Duran nor the Cubans got the impression

that the Americans were behind her rearrest.. The cable

stated "We want the Mexican authorities to take the re-

sponsibility for the whole affair." (Cable from Headquarters

to the Mexico City Station, November 28, 1963, DIR 85371,

CIA NO. 464; Chronology of Anne Goodpasture, November 28,

1963, WX7241, entry no. 141, CIA No. 658)

When the Central Intelligence began to deal with

the warren Commission, Headquarters cabled the Mexico

City Station that their present plan in passing informa-

tion to the Warren Commission was to eliminate mention of

telephone taps in order to protect their continuing opera-

tions. Headquarters stated that they would rely on Sylvia

Duran's statements and on the Consular files which the

Soviets

gave the State Department. Headquarters stressed

that exact, detailed information from AeTAMIL-7 and

REESMIL-9 (Penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy) on just

what Sylvia Duran and other officials said about Oswald's

visits and his dealings would be valuable and usable

corroborative evidence. (CIA cable from Headquarters to

Mexico City Station, December 21, 1963, DIR 90466, CIA

No. 549; Chronology of Anne Goodpasture, December 21, 1963,

Entry No. 268, CIA NO. 682)

April 1964 the Agency still felt that if an American con-

tacted Sylvia Duran their covert continuing operations

might be endangered. Headquarters cabled the Mexico City

Station that one of the touchy subjects that the staffers

would discuss was whether they should talk to Sylvia Duran

in Mexico at the Consulate. (Cable Headquarters to Mexico

City Station, April 8, 1964, DIR 13026, CIA No. 698)

Headquarters further cabled that the Warren Commission staf-

fers knew that the Central Intelligence Agency had tap

assets and that they might have guessed from the coverage

that they had photo points and a source in the Cuban Em-

bassy but that they did not know the details on the Agency's

arrangements with the Mexicans. Headquarters stressed

that the Chief of Station should lend them all the needed

assistance with the minimum possible disclosure of assets

and techniques. (Ibid.)

At this point the House Select Committee on Assassi-

nations has determined that the Central Intelligence Agency

thought their continuing electronic surveillance operation

extremely sensitive and important.

The Warren Commission

would have needed to disclose sensitive information to

contradict Sylvia Duran's story.

The Central Intelligence

Agency had input into what could go in the Warren Report.
