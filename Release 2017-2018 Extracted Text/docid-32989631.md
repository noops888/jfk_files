Reference is made to the memorandum dated August 15,

Intelligence Coordination, which enclosed a copy of a letter

dated August 12, 1975, from the SSC asking the FBI to provide

third-agency clearance of certain FBI materials disseminated

to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) which have been requested

by the SSC.

In an attempt to identify the FBI materials referred

to in the SSC letter of August 12, 1975, contact was made

with Mr. Thomas V. Glynn, Assistant to

the Commissioner, IRS.

On September 2, 1975, Mr. Glynn advised that he had been

unable to identify the FBI materials in question. He stated

that he would communicate directly with Mr. John I. Elliff of

the SSG for a listing of the FBI materials after which he

would seek FBI clearance for SC access to these materials.

Director Sec'y

At 2 PM on August 14, 1975, the writer accompanied Judge Tyler,

Deputy Attorney General, and Richard Thornburgh, Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, to a meeting with Senator Church, Chairman of the above-

mentioned Committee and Bill Miller, Staff Director for the Committee. Also present

from CIA were William Colby, Director, and Mitchell Rogovin, Counsel for Mr.

Colby.

Judge Tyler informed Senator Church the purpose of the visit was to

inform him concerning the activities of captioned individual who had allegedly made

a copy of a CIA document which contained information relating to the CIA involvement

in the Chilean situation and discussed Senator Henry M. Jackson of Washington as

potentially involving himself in connection with this matter at the behest of CIA.

The document was classified "Secret/ Sensitive - Eyes Only." He was further

informed he had displayed this document to two individuals not identified to the

Chairman one of whom brought this matter to our attention at which time it was ali

alleged that subject had made this document available to a member of the staff of

Representative Morris K. Udall of Arizona. Subject indicated to our source that"he

had done so thinking that it might assist Udall in his Presidential aspirations and for

use against Jackson whom the subject considered was a threat to Udall's chances of

obtaining the Democratic nomination.

The Chairman was also informed that upon being challenged by one of

the sources as to the morality and legality of his actions the subject is alleged to

have stated that while his actions may have been illegal he did not consider it immoral,

REG. 27

Miller were both disturbed at receiving this

information indicating that they had come along so far without any such incident such

as this or any leaks from the Committee or staff. The Chairman stated that he would

be willing to cooperate in any manner in order to have this matter resolved at the

earliest possible date and requested that the investigation in this matter be pursued

He stated full cooperation would be forthcoming from him and his Staff Director Mr.

Miller and inquired as to the proposed course of action to be taken.g Jydeedlyler

Memo to the Director

Re: James Daniel O' Flaherty

deferred to the writer to outline future steps in this matter and the Chairman was

informed in order to resolve this as promptly as possible it would first be necessary

with the assistance of Mr. Miller to ascertain without arousing anyone's suspicions

whether or not the document displayed to our sources existed in the files of the

Senate Select Committee. Should such a document exist our next procedure would

be to promptly interview the subject and the individual to whom this document had

been displayed (not the original source). These interviews would be conducted

simultaneously; however, it was pointed out that the other party to be interviewed

was not in the immediate area but an Agent could be sent and this action coordinated

to prevent the possibility of contact by subject with the other individual before such

interview was handled.

The Chairman inquired of Judge: Tyler as to the prosecutive action in

a case of this type and Judge Tyler responded that Mr. Thornburgh would review

the situation after all the facts had been fully developed and make a determination.

Judge Tyler however did indicate that should the violation involve the espionage law

without having all the facts and with what we have to date, he would be highly

doubtful that a prosecutive case would exist but reserved final determination as to

when all the facts were known. Senator Church indicated that irrespective the rules

of the Committee would require the immediate dismissal of subject should it be

determined that he had in fact acted as alleged.

Subsequently, arrangements were made with the Staff Director, Mr.

Miller, for a determination to be made of the existence of the document and this

was accomplished on the afternoon of August 14, 1975. Pertinent is the fact that the

document in the files of the Committee did not contain a date which apparently had

been omitted in the duplicating process and our original source in this matter stated

that the document exhibited to her by the subject contained no date whereas the

document obtained from CIA files and exhibited to her upon interview previously did

contain a date.

Later in the afternoon of August 14, 1975, arrangements were made

with the Staff Director Miller for Agents of the Washington Field Office to conduct

an interview with subject at approximately 11:00 AM on Friday, August 15, 1975, iN

space to be provided by Miller for this purpose. An Agent of the Washington Field

Office familiar with this matter departed Washington in the early AM of August 15th

for Nashville to interview the other individual to whom this document was displayed

simultaneous to the time the interview was to be conducted with subject. The above

arrangementswere brought to the attention of Judge Tyler who concurred.

This is submitted for record purposes.

O'FLAHERTY presently resides at 1609 Preston Road, Alexandria,.

and is employed by the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intel~

ligence Activistes.

D'FLAHERTY is married to CYNTHIA KEYWORTH,

who goes

by her maiden name and who is employed

a as a writer

by "public television" in the WDC area.

Knew CYNTHIA KEYWORTH when the latter was

residing with her husband in Sewance during the period January

to August, 1974.

KEYWORTH had been involved in the women's

Liberation Movement and had set up a workshop in Serance.

This

had not gone over well at Sewanes which was, in

opinion, a conservative school.

had learned from

Sewanse faculty members that it

was a consensus of opinion

that KEYWORTH was not liked and that she was giving her husband

problems insofar as the University was concerned.

explained she was privy to faculty members' thinking inasmuch

as her family had been prominently identified with Sewanse

fos several generations.

Her grandfather had been an Episcopalian

bishop:

?, who 1s not married, and O'FLAHERTY became*

friends and by August, 1974, they had reached, an understanding

that O FLAneRt gould avorce keyort. and marry

She admitted to having

had relacions with O'FLAHERTY while at

In AuguSt 1974,

transferred to Berkeley

because she felt Sewanee was not offering her the curriculun

she wanted.

In August, 1974, O'FLAHERTY

of FBI National Academy. Officials contacted by Inspector warmly praised

Director, FBI and Beirut Office personnel. Dr. Charles Malik, former President

of. United Nations General Assembly and now professor, American University of

Beirut, was highly complimentary concerning Director and stated he has read

all the Director's books and concurred with Director's anti-communist stance.

Memorandum to Mr. Tolson

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Bern

take in effort to develop additional information concerning activities of Black

Panther Party (BPP) in Switzerland and to gain access to data concerning accounts

in Swiss banks used for funding BPP.

While five high-level intelligence items submitted by Bern have been dissemi-

nated to White House, Legat instructed to devote more time and penetrative attention

to this important program; Legat has positive attitude toward program. He is of

opinion large majority of accomplishments, whether in criminal, security or intel-

ligence field,, would.not have been possible without presence of Legat. No substantive

errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Very Good). Office staffed

by experienced Legat and one clerk-stenographer; well administered. Chief Clerk's

Office operating efficiently; form errors below average and down from last inspection.

Stenographic production substantially above average with retypes low. Continued.

close attention to all administrative operations stressed.

Personnel Matters ~ Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent): Complement of one

Agent and one clerk-stenographer (same as last inspection) considered adequate to

handle liaison and other responsibilities. Legat agrees. Agent not overweight,

unavailable or on limited duty. Close professional working relationship between

Agent and clerk-stenographer; morale appears high.

Contacts - Very Good (Last Inspection - Excellent). Legat has congenial and

productive liaison with wide range of agencies and individuals, both American and

foreign. Instructions issued to strengthen liaison to insure Legat is promptly

notified concerning proposed visits to U. S. by high Swiss officials in order that

any courtesies which might be appropriate in furtherance of Bureau's best interests

can be arranged (Legat was not promptly advised of plans of Swiss Attorney General

Ito visit U. S. and Bureau headquarters). All persons met by Inspector expressed

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Bern

2. The Bern Office covers Switzerland, which is a stable and conservative

country. It may not offer the same potential for high-level intelligence as do some

other territories; but positive items have been developed and should continue.

Swiss banks have long been recognized as the repository for funds illegally acquired

I by Americans, now including some of the Black Panthers. We have made some

progress in gaining access to these funds and findings of Inspector (together with

prospects for signing mutual legal aid treaty between Switzerland and U. S.)

indicate further success through close personal liaison is possible and probable.

The existing case load, combined with these other considerations, justifies

continuance of our Legat in Bern. It is, t

therefore, recommended that the office

of the Legal Attache in Bern be continued with the present complement of one Agent

and one clerk-stenographer.

(determined experienced clerical employee (Miss Cuddy) capable of reviewing and

processing much of this material. Assignment of this clerk-stenographer full time

io project would release Agent personnel to handle other important responsibilities,

primarily in the field of gathering high-level intelligence (HII,EV). Since last

inspection 78 Security Index subjects known to have visited or resided in Bonn

territory; 76 other security subjects known to be residing these countries. Sources

providing coverage on activities. In criminal field Bonn' reported location of 22

fugitives and/or Selective Service delinquents in last 12 months. Valuable infor-

mation also developed in several car theft ring cases, major thefts in U. S. and

activities in Black Panther movement in Algeria. While 7 HILEV items worthy of

dissemination io the White House (3 in August) have been submittea, there 1s a

definite need for expansion and intensification. Positive program for this purpose

outlined. Legat of definite opinion great majority accomplishments in all areas

ment 3 Agents and 4 clerk-stenographers (2 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers last

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Copenhagen

Scandinavian countries in the past to initiate operations against the United States;•

similar instructions issued concerning the Chinese communists. Danish Security

Service recently furnished information of value concerning Soviet KGB officer who

passed through Denmark. Since Scandinavian countries are recognized haven for

draft dodgers and New Left fugitives, Inspector instructed Legat to request back-

ground data and photographs of extremist fugitives for alerting cooperative police

services in territory. Office is showing steady improvement in providing HILEV

information. Only 4 items worthy of dissemination to White House submitted

1/1 - 7/31/71, but 3 such items furnished in August for total of 7. Inspector placed

strong emphasis on this phase of Legat's responsibilities. Legat and Assistant

¡ recognize importance and have specific plans for expansion of program. Legat

of definite opinion majority of accomplishments to date achieved only because of

personal contact by our Agents. This is especially noticeable in our Selective

Service and Deserter cases in Sweden, where 21 Bureau fugitives and 7 Selective

Service delinquents have been located even though official government position is

to provide asylum for persons who refuse military service for 'humanitarian or

political reasons." No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent. Legat is capably administering office,

with Chief Clerk's Office running smoothly and work current; stenographic production

above average. Continued close attention to all administrative operations emphasized

by Inspector.

Personnel Matters - Very Good. Personnel complement of 2 Agents and 2 clerko

stenographers.

Case load per Agent below average, but substantial increase each

month (up from 43 on 6/30/71 to 91 as of 8/25/71). Considering case load,

geographical area covered, potential for HILEV and other factors, present com-

plement considered adequate but not excessive to handle responsibilities at this

time. Legat instructed to follow closely. Both Agents available; neither overweight

or on limited duty. Morale appears high.

Contacts - Excellent. Effective liaison program in effect and being expanded with

a number of new contacts established since office opened; others previously developed

are becoming more productive. Contacts are diversified, both American and

foreign; and are scattered throughout territory covered. All met by Inspector

expressed highest regard for Director and FBI as well as our local personnel, and

expressed appreciation for having Bureau representatives in Copenhagen.

Hea,

3. This office was opened on 12/21/70 with a complement of 2 Agents

and 2 clerk-stenographers. The case load and the accomplishments have shown

a steady improvement and this favorable trend is now gaining momentum. The

results to date in all areas, including HILEV, and the potential for the future

are encouraging. It is recommended, therefore, that the Office of Legal Attache

in Copenhagen be continued with the present complement of 2 Agents and 2 clerk

stenographers.

Memorandum to Mr: Tolson

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

Hong Kong

84 National Academy graduates occupy responsible positions throughout territory

covered. Two additional candidates presently attending National Academy session.

Sources and contacts so urgently required in connection with HILEV Program need

further attention.

Persons contacted by Inspector spoke highly of the Director,

FBI and Hong Kong personnel.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Daniel A. Grove, GS-16 at $29, 067, aged 41, veteran, not on probation,

Legal Liaison Officer, Hong Kong, since 4/17/66. He makes an excellent per-

sonal appearance, is intelligent and has been most effective in establishing liaison

contacts who can assist the FBI in handling normal investigative matters. He has

an excellent command of the Chinese - Mandarin language. Since the previous

inspection Legat Grove has failed to fully_comply with Bureau instructions in

aggressively obtaining intelligence_data vitally needed under the HILEV Program

(Administrative write-up attached). His failure to develop sources and contacts

capable of producing high-level intelligence data as urgently needed, and his

(marginal administration of this important program warrant administrative action.

Therefore, 'it is recommended that he be retained as Legat but censured and placea

on probation. If approved, letter attachea.

2.

Joseph D. Maurice, GS-14 at $23,591, aged 45, veteran, not on probation,

Assistant Legal Liaison Officer, Hong Kong, since 12/15/70. Maurice has an

excellent personality and presents a most businesslike appearance. He is mature,

intelligent and since being assigned to Hong Kong is gaining the necessary experience

to handle assigned duties. He is considered qualified to continue in present assign

ment.

3. During the current inspection all pending investigative matters and the

overall operation of Legat, Hong Kong, were subjected to penetrative and in-depth

analysis. Investigative phases of Legat operations are being afforded aggressive

¡l attention; however, noticeable weaknesses detected in the developing of intelligence

sources relating to HILEV Program. Hong Kong is the closest Legat operation to

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

Hong Kong

Communist China and Hong Kong itself thrives with CHICOM activity. An extremely

high potential exists for the development of intelligence data so vitally needed to

fulfill our obligations concerning the internal security of the United States and our

additional responsibility to the President. It is essential that our office in Hong

Kong be retained since it has produced some high-level intelligence data of interest

to us and, due to its strategic location, has the potential of obtaining highly sensitive

information which would otherwise not be available.

Personnel Matters - Very Good. Staff of two Agents and two clerk-stenographers

adequate but not excessive. No Agents on limited duty, on probation, overweight

or unavailable. Morale appears high.

Contacts - Very Good. Several quality contacts developed in high executive and

operational levels of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in territory.

Intensification ordered. Ambassador and others contacted by Inspector expressed

admiration and esteem for Director, FBI and personnel in Managua.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. That Legat be continued in view of extent of territory (all of Central

America); unrest, particularly in Guatemala; the Communist interest throughout

territory, particularly in Guatemala and Costra Rica; internal strife between

El Salvadore and Honduras; and potential unrest affecting internal security of the

United States; statistical accomplishments (20 fugitives and Selective Service delin-

quents located, 5 deportations effected, 10 stolen vehicles recovered valued at

$56, 812.92); and potential for additional accomplishments. Office in existence

seven months and potential not yet developed.

Legal Attache at Managua since 12/27/70.

He makes an excellent, mature appear-

ance and seems interested and enthusiastic. He was involved in a

substantive error

write-up and an administrative write-up. (copies attached). Error related to excessive

delay (12/14/70 to 6/7/71) in verifying address in Nicaragua of Selective Service

subject. Miller explained the delay was due to opening of new office and case not

received at Managua until 3/2/71; that he initiated action 3/3/71 but made no record

of it

serixplanation unacceptable. Miler was assigned case in Mexico City, 12/14/70,

and sent to Managua by Mexico City 1/21/71. Records at Mexico City reflect serials

received Managua 1/25/71. File shows no action taken by Miller until 5/4/71.

Subject's address in Managua verified 6/7/71.

The administrative write-up dealt with lack of sources (Miller had 27 of the

indicated on #3 (locator) card as relating to office administration; failure to contact

possible source in Panama suggested by New Orleans; and failure to index, properly

record or pursue another possible source, an American Businessman in Panama.

Naterial relating to latter sources improperly placed in fileon office administration.

Miller explained he has other sources bui maintains no record of them in

the Legat; he utilized the office administration file number to sign out on when making

contacts; he made no entries for contacts after hours; and information concerning

possible

sources was mistakenly directed to office administration file.

This is Miller's first assignment as Legat -- his previous duties related

primarily to a road trip out of Mexico City. He needs additional time to develop

ability to administer and direct Legat operations. In view of the deficiencies

detected, recommend Miller be censured and placed on probation. Letter attached

for approval will summarize inspection results and advise him of censure and

probation.

3. Armand A. Cammarota, GS-14 at $26, 367, aged 54, veteran, not on

probation, Assistant Legat since 1/9/71. Cammarota makes an excellent, mature

appearance; has leadership qualities; is dedicated, experienced and knowledgeable

employee, with sincere, businesslike and enthusiastic attitude. Legat considers

him qualified for additional responsibilities and recommends him for immediate

advancement. Inspector concurs that he is qualified for position of greater

responsibility.

Mẹmorandum to Mr. Tolson

Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

Criminal informant strength improved since last inspection - further improvement

ordered.

Substantial contributions made by office in securing high-level intelligence

of interest to Bureau and White House. Particularly significant information developed

regarding recent student demonstrations in Mexico, Soviet and North Korean training

of Mexican guerillas and matters involving Mexico - Cuba relations. This phase of

operation emphasized by Inspector. No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Supervision

equitably shared between Legat and Assistant Legat. Chief Clerk's Office well organized

and functioning efficiently. Pending work and project work above average - attributable

to new Bureau-authorized file destruction program. Intensification of destruction

ordered. Form errors below average. Misfiled index cards average for offices of

similar size and below overall field average. Stenographic production above field

average; no retypes or delinquencies. Travel and communications expenses reduced;

slight increase in per diem costs -- justified. Confidential Fund closely controlled.

Recommendation made for strengthening accounting procedures with respect to

informant payments. Overtime essential, productive and equitably shared. Trend

memoranda prepared calling for better protection of informant identity in communica-

tions and destruction of informant memoranda no longer needed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel complement

7/12/71, 23 (11 Agents, including Legat and Assistant Legat; 12 clerks). Inspector

considers clerical complement excessive by one stenographer; Legat agrees. Reduction

ordered by attrition. Agent complement reduced by one since last inspection due to

opening new Legat in Managua, Nicaragua. Territory covered by Mexico City reduced

correspondingly. Agent complement adequate, but not excessive. No Agents on

limited duty, probation, overweight or unavailable. No training weaknesses noted.

Personnel represent U. S. Government in efficient and effective manner. Morale

appears very high.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). The two FBI National Academy

(NA) graduates who occupied positions of importance in agencies within Legat territory

were replaced with administration change in Mexico in December, 1970. Mexican

authorities encouraged to nominate qualified police officers for NA to upgrade law

enforcement.

Excellent network of contacts maintained on operational and executive

levels of Mexican Government and police agencies. Contacts among U. S. agencies

indicate effective relationships. All officials contacted by Inspector hold Director.,

FBI and Legat personnel in extremely high esteem.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Robert T. Nischwitz, GS-16 at $29, 067, aged 47, veteran, not on probation,

Legal Attache at Mexico City since 4/27/70, second office as Legat. Nischwitz makes

leadership and ability. Results of inspection tend to substantiate these comments.

Ottawa, Canada

Administrative Operations - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Form errors

above field average.

Weaknesses ordered corrected. Misfiled index cards below

field average. Suggestions made regarding preparation and destruction of index cards

to alleviate space problem. Trend detected in failure of clerical personnel to initial

incoming and outgoing mail - ordered corrected. Communications, travel, per diem

ana contaçt costs down. Economy stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment 2 Agents, 4 clerk-stenographers - increase of one clerk-stenographer since

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Relationship with RCMP

excellent.

Quality liaison contacts maintained on all levels. All officials contacted

expressed high regard for FBI and Legat personnel:

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Recommended that Legat Office, Ottawa, be retained. The relationship

between U. S. and Canada brought about by common border, similar domestic

problems and constant travel between countries of dangerous New Left and black

extremists requires daily contact with liaison sources regarding these problems.

Potential for Chinese communist intelligence activity directed against U. S. from

Canada is also paramount. Existence of Legat, Ottawa, is also beneficial in locati

¿ various types of fugitives of interest to us as well as monetary recoveries.

2. Moss Lee Innes, aged 50, GS-16 at $31, 881, veteran, not on probation,

at Ottawa since 4/19/59. Presents impressive personal appearance, is mature

"and extremely able liaison representative. Qualified to continue as Legat. Attached

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache

PRET

Paris, France

since they are charged with responsibility for gathering positive intelligence infor-

mation even from friendly nations, and our employees on foreign assignment could

be possible targets. Noting probability Chinese communists will be admitted to

United Nations and, therefore, have Mission in New York in near future, Legat

instructed to be especially alert for information of value concerning modus operandi

of Chinese Communist Intelligence Service (CHICOM) from experience of French

security forces since diplomatic relations have existed between France and CHICOMS

for extended period. Considerable support in France of Eldridge Cleaver faction

of Black Panther Party; effective coverage through French criminal and security

services. Favorable results achieved in recent months in acquiring HILEV data of

interest to President - 38 HILEV items submitted; 21 disseminated to White House"

(10 to White House in June - July). High priority this important program strongly

emphasized by Inspector to all personnel.. Legat recognizes importance and has

positive plans for expansion of sources.

No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Legat and

clerical staff are well experienced in foreign operations and office is effectively

administered. Inspector suggested in interest of closer supervision and fixing of

responsibility that Legat prepare written instructions setting forth guidelines for

division of work between him and the two assistants. Legat agreed and this has

been done. Minor corrections ordered in Defense Plans. Chief Clerk's Office

operating efficiently; work current and form errors below average. Stenographic

production high with retypes low. Continued close attention to all administrative

operations stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment of 3 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers considered optimum number for handling

lalson and other responsiblities. Overtime essential, productive and equitably

shared. No Agents unavailable, overweight or on limited duty. Staff working as

team and morale appears high.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Effective liaison maintained

with diversified and productive contacts, both American and foreign. All met by

Inspector were cordial and expressed high regard for and confidence in Director,

FBI, and Paris personnel.

administrator; fully qualified to continue as Legat. Attached for approval is letter

to Philcox advising him of inspection findings.

2. Mike G. Zinck, GS-14 at $22, 897, aged 41, veteran, not on probation,

Assistant Legat since 12/22/70 and Number One Man since 8/20/71. Zinck makes

excellent initial impression, is personable, experienced in foreign operations,

hard worker and qualified to continue as Assistant Legat.

3. The case load of investigative matters, as well as the important liaison

and intelligence responsibilities in the countries covered by Paris, justifies

continuance of our Legal Attache Office there. It is recommended, therefore,

that the office of Legal Attache in Paris be continued with the present complement

of 3 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers.

Michela assigned to Rome Office during expansion of Legats in December, 1970.

Continued assignment of Assistant Legat considered contingent upon ability to

produce results in HILEV Program. Legat instructed to make appropriate recom-

mendations regarding reduction of personnel if additional production not realized.

Legat instructed to follow closely. No Agents on limited duty, probation, over-

weight, or unavailable. Overtime productive, essential, and equitably shared.

Morale appears high.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Rome Office since last inspec-

tion expanded contacts and has effective sources in a broad area of foreign and

U. S. Government agencies, as well as sources outside of official agencies.

Recently developed sources should result in more effective HILEV Program.

SUBJECT: FOREIGN OPERATIONS - LEGAL ATTACHE OFFICES (LEGAT)

PURPOSE: To summarize views of Bureau officials and set forth recommendations

of Inspection Division relative to retention of IT existing Legats,.

recommend opening of 6 more, and reopen Resident Agency in Mexico.

BACKGROUND:

Prior to December, 1970, we operated ll Legat Of, Mexico City,

Bonn, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong, London, Madrid

Ottawa, Paris, Rome and Tokyo). In September, 1970, the President in conversation

with the Director requested that we expand our foreign operations because of the

President's desire for better intelligence. The President also discussed this with.

the Secretary of State who advised that he thought it was a good idea. As a result,

6 additional offices were opened in the latter part of December, 1970 (Beirut, Caracas,

Copenhagen, La Paz, Managua and Tel Aviv). These were opened based on the opinion

of the President and Dr. Kissinger that our Legats were furnishing highly valuable

I information of interest to the White House.

On the basis of our productivity in obtaining hign -level intormation, the

President again requested (May, 1971) the Director to consider further foreign oftice

(expansion. In response to this, at Director's request Domestic Intelligence Division

(DI) recommended reopening our offices in Manila, Rio de Janeiro and santo Domingo

and opening new offices at Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delht. DID also

recommended adding one Agent to eachot Sexisting offices

Madrid and Tokyo.

2 are caracas, Lonada!

Mri

Sullivan had approved of the f additional Legats opened in December, 1970,

and, in fact, personally initiated the recommendation of one of them (Beirut),/ He had

not previously expressed opposition to the expansion of our foreign liaison operations,

but in a, memorandum 6/7/71 Mr. Sullivan expressed the strong opinion that the

proposed addition of Agent personnel abroad and reopening or opening of new offices

should not be accomplished as he felt that many of our Legats were not furnishing

information and services sufficiently valuable to justify their retention. In his memor -

andum 6/16/71 Mr. Sullivan recommended our offices at Bern, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong)

Madrid and Tokyo should be closed

With regard to Beirut,

Caracas

, Copenhagen,

Lạ Paz, Managua and Tel Aviv (openea December, 1970, with his approval) Nr.

be permitted to operate for 6 months and then analyzed thoroughly to determine if

they were worth the money being spent; if not,

all of them should be closed. He

completely opposed further expansion and opening offices in Manila, Rio de Janeiro,

Santo Domingo, Canberra, Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi.

INSPECTION DIVISION EVALUATION:

Based on the divergence of opinion the Director ordered immediate inspections

of all existing, Legats. These inspections have been completed and separate memoranda

have gone forward justifying the retention of all l7 existing offices. Retention has been

based primarily on our success in obtaining high-level items of interest to the white

House.

As of 8/31/11, 52L items had been submitted to the Bureau by these offices,

of which 295 had been disseminated to the White House. Numerous favorable

comments have been received from the White House. In each instance the Director

concurred with recommendations that the 17 existing offices be continued.

It had been suggested by the DID that our coverage could be steppea up by

increasing our complement in Beirut, Caracas, London

m, Madrid and Tokyo.

As a

result of our inspection an additional Agent was recommended for London and this

was approved.

It is also felt that the Resident Agency formerly at Hermosill, This

Mexico, should be_reopened to cover a vast region now handled as a road trip.

should be staffed by personnel already assigned to our Mexico City Office. Addition

of personnel to other Legat Offices is not recommended,

sattcisientor'+9432573070

As indicated, it was recommended that offices be openea in Canberra, Buala

Lumpur, Manila, New Delhi, Rio de Janeiro and santo Domingo. Basea on the desires

jof the White House for additional high level intelligence and our past successes

in this area, it is felt that we should advise the President that we are ready to

attention to mounting political developments in China

.. Reopening Rio de Janeiro

would relieve Buenos Aires of a 25,000 mile road trip and provide on the spot

coverage in this important area (Brazil) which is larger than the United States.

Reopening Santo Domingo would relieve san Juan Office of road trip and furnish

prompt coverage not only of Dominican Republic but of current political developments

in Haiti.

Canberra would cover Australia and New Zealand, relieving Hong Kong

of the road trip.

Kuala Lumpur would cover Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, and

initiate coverage in indonesia, would relieve Hong Kong of road trin and provide

more rapid coverage of area currently politicaliy important. New Dehl would

cover India, East and West Pakistan and Nepal, an area where we previously had

no coverage, but where potential for political intelligence is high.

QUOTA OF FBI EMPLOYEES ON FOREIGN ASSIGNMENT:

is 88,

When it was approved that we add 1 Agent to bondon, it was decided to movet

an Agent from Buenos Aires to London to stay within our quota.. Subsequently,

James A. Miller was removed as Legat at Managua; and it was recommended and

approved that Managua operate with only l man until the full potential of that office

•could be determined. Thus we presently have 87 employees on foreign assignment,

I under our quota. As we may have to replace Agent in Buenos Aires or Managua, we

snould not reduce our quota

In its recommendation of 5/28/71 for expansion of Legat operations, DID

recommended staffing the 6 proposed offices as follows:

increasing the number of Bureau employees on foreign assignment by 12 rather than

increase our present

Re: Inspection - Office of Legal Attache, Bonn

(determined experienced clerical employee (Miss Cuddy) capable of reviewing and

processing much of this material. Assignment of this clerk-stenographer full time

to project would release Agent personnel to handle other important responsibilities,

I primarily in the field of gathering high-level intelligence (HILEV). Since last

inspection 78 Security Index subjects known to have visited or resided in Bonn

territory; 76 other security subjects known to be residing these countries.

Sources

providing coverage on activities. In criminal field Bonn reported location of 22

fugitives and/or Selective Service delinquents in last 12 months. Valuable infor-

mation also developed in several car theft ring cases, major thefts in U. S. and

activities in Black Panther movement in Algeria. While 7 HILEV items worthy of *

disint neto the hite and see ties Pose posite, these is ose

definite need for expansion and intensification,

outlined. Legat of definite opinion great majority accomplishments in all areas

achieved only because of presence our personnel and would not have been possible

through normal diplomatic channels. No substantive errors detected.

Administrative Operations - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Office is

capably administered. Chief Clerk's Office operating efficiently and work current.

Stenographic production above average even though time spent on clerical duties

is high. Continued close attention to all administrative functions stressed.

Personnel Matters - Very Good (Last Inspection - Very Good). Personnel comple-

ment 3 Agents and 4 clerk-stenographers (2 Agents and 3 clerk-stenographers last

inspection). Thorough analysis by Inspector of work load, types of cases, and

experience of personnel determined Agents required to spend too much time in

office handling high volume of security matters (Communications Intercept Service).

Overtime essential, productive and equitably shared. Time in office higher than

should be due to above-mentioned processing of mail. Morale appears high.

Language ability Agent personnel satisfactory.

Contacts - Excellent (Last Inspection - Excellent). Productive and cordial liaison

maintained with diversified contacts, both American and foreign, throughout territory.

Legat recognizes need for cultivating and expanding contacts, especially in HILEV

field. Instructed to do so. All contacts expressed highest regard for and confidence

in Director and our Bonn personnel.

Honorable H. R. Haldeman:

Washington, D. C.

Dear Mr. Haldeman: •

DESPIO SPEZRUN ANE

110/2600

By letter dated September 21, 1970, addressed to the

President, I outlined the manner in which this Bureau might expand

its coverage abroad in an effort to produce intelligence information of

a high quality.

Aiter giving further consideration to this matter, I would like

to advise you that it is my feeling that the opening of an FBI liaison

Late yesterday I received a call from Major General Alexander

Haig, Advisor to the President on Foreign Affairs, in the office of

DI. Henry Kissinger.

He said that he was with the President at the

time the conversation took place with the Director, relative to

opening some new FBI liaison offices and adding men to some of those

already in existence.

He said he thought it was an excellent idea

and just wanted to pass on to the Bureau his own reaction. He said

DI. Kissinger certainly shares this same viewpoint.

General Haig went on to explain that this country needs more

high-quality intelligence and a greater knowledge, in depth, of

what is going on in the troubled areas of the world. He inquired

where some of our new oftIces might be. i did not want to ve

definitive on the matter, but pointed out that the Director was

giving consideration to opening some offices where, as he indicated,

there was

trouble, and where it was important for

the United States

to have high-quality information relative thereto. I said the

Director was therefore considering countries like

Israel, Venezuela,

Lebanon, Finland, Bolivia, and the addition of some men in other

offices, such as Buenos Aires.

General

Haig said this is good, and he added that he thought

it especially important for us to open offices in Israel, Lebanon

and finland.

He said that he will be out of the country for awhile

and

I wished him a safe trip and this terminated the conversation.

I told him I would imagine he will have difficulty on that and

Mr. Haldeman said he already has. I said knowing the State Departnent:

they have always had a suspicion. which is not true, that in these places

where we have our men stationed that we are looking over their shoulder,

which ve do not do. I said I have instructed our people never to get in-

are kind of a watchaog on their carryings on in the embassy, which 15

in our expansion of our liaison abroad.

We point out that subsequent to his discussion with

the Director on 11/10/70,

Secretary of State Rogers telephoned

the Director 11/20/70 and made arrangements for a meeting of

Bureau representatives with Deputy Under Secretary of State

William B. Macomber, Jx., on that date. At this meeting

the

details of the proposed

expansion were discussed and confirned

by letter to Nr. Macomber dated 11/25/70..

We note that ou

advised that our representatives would be maintaining a

relationship with the policy (rather than

police) agencies

in the new. countries and asking whether the new offices would

present any difficulties.

The letter points out that although

the Director and Secretary Rogers agreed that no notification

would be made to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), we

were informed, 12/3/70, that Under Secretary of State

We also inform' Dr. Kissinger of the several instances

MR. MOHR

MR. BISHOP

MR. C. D. BRENNAN

MR. CALLAHAN

Secretary of State William P. Rogers called. He stated he was

ca ling, after a discussion with the President, about the Bureau's liaison

offices abroad, and, of course, he thought it was a good idea and they (the

State Department) are enthusiastic about it, but he had

just one question

which he thought could be handled on the phone due to his busy schedule.

He said the only one he had any reservation about is Helsinki, Finlana,

the reason being, if wora gets out, it could appear that it is in connection

with the SALT talks or that we are trying to be provocative. He continued

that if I thought it will be productive; he thought they were perfectly

prepared to take the slight risk that is involved in open discussion about

it, but if I thought it is not apt to be productive, he would prefer not to.

I told him I am perfectly willing to postpone it and not have it

included in line with the recommendations we have made until after the

SALT thing is over and if at that time it is felt desirable to have it there

it can be taken up again.

Mr. Rogers suggested then why not go ahead on

that basis as to the schedule

• I have proposed and not make a negative

decision on Helsinki but hold it in abeyance as he thought if we could do

this and it not get mixed up in SAlT talks, it would be a good idea. I said

it is a good listening post for information we might obtain, but on

other hand, if it would irritate the SAlT talks, I am willing to postpone it

Mr. Rogers said that was good and we would do that then; that he

nas spoken to Paul Macomber (WILLIam B. Macomber, Jr.

for Administration), who is an old-timer and a Republican and sort of

Administrative Assistant, but he is the only one he has spoken to and the

only one who knows about

President made the suggestion to me as he wanted better intelligence.

Mr. Rogers said he, the President, mentioned it to him and it was his

idea and nobody else's.

I said when the President handed it to H. R.

Haldeman he told him to take it up with him, Rogers, and only him, so

I assume he did not notify the CIA and certainly we have not. Mr. Rogers

said he would not do anything about it and will let the White House do it

as he did not think state should or that we should. I said I thought it was

up to the President.

This summarizes the current status of our expansion of.

our foreign liaison.

Following Mr. Sullivan's meeting with

Deputy Under Secretary of State Macomber on 11/20/70, State, who

had informed us that they would tell the interested embassies

that clearance had been granted for assignment of additional FBI

personnel abroad, forwarded cablegrams to the affected embassies.

One cable went to the four embassies where we are adding to an

existing office and another to the embassies where we propose to

open new offices, with the exception of Copenhagen, Denmark,

which had been the subject of our separate request

11/23/70.

Both cables asked the Ambassadors to advise immediately of any

difficulties foraspen:

Responses from the countries where we

now operate were prompt and favorable. Unfortunately, State,

in its cable to the new countries referred to our intention to

develop and maintain a cooperative relationship with the police

and other investigative agencies of the countries covered and

made a typographical error.

The cable as forwarded indicated

that we would be dealing with policy rather than police agencies.

Nevertheless, favorable responses were received from most of the

addressees•

exceptions were la Paz, Bolivia

Costa Rica.

RECTO DE

3124495 251

La Paz expressed concern over the number. of U.S. people

there engaged in clandestine operations requiring cover and

questioning what

Bolivian policy agencies the FBI Agent would or

could work with. Marvin Gentile, Deputy Assistant Secretary of

state for security, has advised that State has cabled the

Ambassador explaining the typographical error and pointing out

that our Legat will not be operating in a clandestine fashion,

that he will not be operational, and

that his assignment there

has been approved at the top level.

Gentile says we should

proceed to

open our office in La paz without regard to the.

Memorandum to Mr. C. D. Brennan

RE: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

SEgRET

Gentile telephoned 12/8/70 to advise that the

U. S. Ambassador in San Jose

had described the exceptionally

large U. S. presence in this tiny country as "simply

overwhelming" and reminded State that

it is trying to

sharply reduce the U. S. contingent there. The Ambassador

recommended that if San Jose was considered essential, our

office be limited to one man who would be part of a new

"Office of Security" in the Embassy which would serve a

number of U.S. agencies.

Gentile said that the concept

of an FBI office in Central America has definitely been

approved but the Ambassador is correct in pointing out

that state .

that State has insisted on reducing the U. S. delegation

Gentile said State is most anxious to assist

in establishing an FBI liaison post in Central America and

asked whether an office in Managua, Nicaragua,

San Salvador,

El Salvador, or Panama City, Panama, would permit us to

carry out our mission as effectively as an office in

San Jose, Costa Rica.

From our standpoint, we can do this

from any

point in Central America. As there is a strongly

provt. S. government in Nicaragua, the Prosidont of which

is personally known to'SA James A. Miller, who would become

Legat there,

we could readily open in Managua rather than

San Jose.

This would require no additional training of

personnel or major alteration in our plans.

Our intention

is to intensify our coverage of the seven Central American

countries and this can be handled very effectively from

Managua.

With respect to Copenhagen, action has been delayed

within State, according to Gentile,

because of the recent

incident involving the attempted defection of a Lithuanian

from a soviet fishing vessel.

The cable informing the Embassy

in Copenhagen laid for three days on the desk of Deputy

Under Secretary Macomber, who has been testifying before a

Congressional committee concerning State's part in that matter.

Gentile advised 12/8/70 that Macomber had just approved and

signed the cable and that he anticipates no difficulty or

delay in the opening of our office in Denmark.

ACTION:

our office i ipproved, we will inform State that we will open

Jant years nice

nagua, Nicaragua, instead of San Jose,

Costa Rica, Utilizing the same personnel already approved.

we recommended that the Central American office be established

"overwhelming" U. S. delegation presently in Costa Rica.

With respect to the comments of U. S. Ambassador Bunker,

the office be canceled.

In this regard the Director is, ot

RE: EXPANSI, Y OF FOREIGN LIAISON

As discussed in my memorandum 12/8/70, a typographical

error in this cable resulted in the Ambassadors being

informed that our liaison representatives would develop

and maintain a close cooperative relationship with the

policy agencies of the countries which they would cover

whereas State had been told that we would be developing

this relationship with police agencies. It is surprising

that more Ambassadors did not protest this apparent

intrusion into their personal responsibilities.

We have

already pointed out this error to State, who acknowledged

it and, in fact, State corrected this in a separate cable

to La Paz because the Ambassador there had made specific

reference to our contact with policy agencies. We feel

we should go on written record as well regarding this

error.•

ACTION:

If approved:

(1) The Administrative Division will promptly

cancel the transfers which have been issued to personnel

destined for Saigon, South Vietnam (one agent, one clerks) .

Dear Mr. Macomber: .

I have revieved the various responses forwarded

9126/0924m 716..

by the United States Ambassadors in the embassies where

the EBI proposed to establish new liaison posts and I am

disturbed by the apparent misconception regarding the

purpose of these nosis.

It would appear that this

misconception arises directly irom a typographical

appearing

in the Department of State cable nuber 68641

informing those embassies that FBI liaison representatives

are stationed abroad to develop and maintain a close

à quite different function 3 92 4141-341

In view of the comments of the United States
