failed to reveal a photograph of OSWALD. (320) This Committee

has not been able to rule out the possibility that a photograph

of OSWALD was obtained in Mexico City by these operations since

the material made available

[Agency withholding - implication]

p. 90 This Committee cannot state with certainty that a photo-

graph of Lee Harvey OSWALD was not obtained by the photosurveil-

lance operations. in Mexico City because of three reasons: (a)

the photographs from LILYRIC, the "alternate" photographic

base which covered the Soviet Embassy main gate, and the photo-

graphs from the pulse camera, which covered the Cuban Consulate

entrance, with the exception of a few samples, were not made

available for review by the CIA; (b) testimony from knowledge-

able people that it would have been unlikely that the photo-:

surveillance would have missed someone whom it had at least

five chances of recording; (361) and (c) reports that such a

photo did, in fact, exist. (362)

"... Simply put, this Committee has not seen all of the

photographs produced by the photosurveillance operations in

Mexico City (363) Hence, it cannot conclude that a photograph

of OSWALD does not exist among those photographs it has not

seen. Writer fails do note that the Station, in November 1963,

reviewed all photographs and found nothings - see cable traffic.]

by these photographic surveillance operations. How does one

"withhold" material when thereis none to withhold?]

p. 114

"Material removed from SCODT's safe now

in possession

of the CIA provides critically important circumstancial evidence

that the CIA photosurveillance operations obtained photographs

of OSWALD:

"(OSWALD's) visits and conversations are not hearsay;

for persons watching

these embassies photographed OSWALD

as he entered

and left each one; and clocked the time he

spent on each visit." (469)

"This Committee believes that a photograph of Lee Harvey

SOWALD was probably obtained by CIA photosurveillance in Mexico.

There are allegations that such a photo was found; there is

testimony that such a photo should have been obtained; the

CIA's

withholding of materials; Ms SCALETI's strange lapse of memory

regarding the events of 11/22/63; and Mr. SCOTT's manuscript;

these

things, innthe Committee's view, would tend to indicate

that a photo of Lee Harvey OSWALD was obtained. On the other

hand the consistent testimony that a photo was not obtained in

Mexico; the absence of any record of transmittal of the photo

to Headquarters (the weight of this consideration is mitigated

by the fact that there were methods of communication available

that were not incorporated into the CIA's record keeping systems);

and the testimony of Ms SCALETI and Mr. SCELSO that a photo was

not discovered would tend to indicate that, in fact, the allega-

tions that SCALETI found a photo of LHO are false."

[A review of 1963 traffic shows no photograph was found of Lho.

The Station would have reported finding one, if it had.]

p. 115 This study has demonstrated that the information from

the Soviet Embassy taps and from Headquarters was available to

the Mexico City Station prior to the assassination of President

John F. Kennedy. In addition to the Agency acknowledged infor-

mation, there is a distinct possibility that the Station had

available to it one additional telephone intercept transcript,

and one or more surveillance photographs.

"At the bottom of each attachment page to the SCOTT

memorandum, a summary of the conversation is provided. (474)

The Station questioned the relevancy of only one of the seven

calls presented in the memorandum.. The summary of the 10/3

call says:

"By context of other conversations by OSWALD and

the fact that this called sic spoke in broken Spanish

and English rather than Russian which he used previously,

it is probable that this caller is not OSWALD. (475)

[OSWALD did not speak Spanish - see DURAN's remarks, etc.

Therefore, any call in Spanish was considered to have been

made by OSWALD. Nor has it ever been confirmed that OSWALD

wanted to go to Odessa.

According to his wife's correspondence

to the Soviet Embassy in Washington, D. C., she wanted to go to

Leningrad. There is no record that he wanted to go elsewhere.]

The HSCA has not been able to determine why the 9/27

10:30 and 9/27 1:25 calls were not included in this memorandum.

While the 1:25 call could be considered unrelated, it is unlikely

that the same would apply to the 10:30 call since the 9/27 10:37

call is included in the memorandum. [Later review by qualified

professionals of the Agency determined that the four calls listed

on page 2b were not relevant, OSWALD did not initiate them - the

reasons are given above.]

A judgement that this call (10/3/63] did not pertain to LHO

could be paiid based on the following facts:

1) the caller spoke broken Spanish;

2) the caller did not have the number of the Consulate;

3) the caller did not know that visas were issued at

the Consulate; and

4) the caller states that he isseeking a visa, not

that he is checking on an application already

made.

The majority of the evidence indicates that LHO could not speak

Spanish. (476)

In light of DELGADO's assertions, it is possible that

OSWALD had at least a limited knowledge of Spanish. It

should be noted that the 10/3 transcript listed above indicates

that the caller spoke in broken Spanish. (477) The fact that

this conversation was in Spanish, should not by itself rule

out the possibility that OSWALD made the phone call. ...

[The writer choses to ignore the most important and relevant

reason that the 10/3 call was not made by OSWALD - OSWALD

left Mexico City early in the morning of 2 October 1963!1

American citizens in Mexico, this Committee is certain, on

the basis of the above detailed evidence, that such an agree-

ment existed, either formally or informally. (594) Hence,

the assertion in the 1977 TFR that "OSWALD was not an investiga-'

tive responsibility of the CIA" (595) is eemingly inaccurate and

misleading.

p. 156 "... two assertions of the 1977 IFR are important:

(1) that it was not discovered that OSWALD was seeking a visa to

Russia and that he had also been in contact with the Cuban Embas-

sy until November 22, 1963; and (2) that the Station did nothing

other than ask headquarters on 15 Octkber for a photograph of

OSWALD" because no other government agency had made an official

request for further information. (596) It has already been shown

that the 'official request' that the Agency claims was not forth-

coming was, in fact, not necessary and that, as a matter of fairly

routine operating procedure, the CIA headquarters requested a

follow-up on the information already reported about OSWALD.

[See Hadts regulation re reporting on Ameri-ans - was in effect

then. It would have been necessary for the Station to receive a

request (official) from the FBI, the Navy, or State, for the

Station to initated an OFFICIAL investigation. Also, headquarters

did not ask for a follow-up, Headquarters ask that any additional

information which might come to the Station's attention be reported

to Washington. Such a statement is not a requirement, it shows

interest and asks that the Station forwarded additional information

but without setting up an official investigation.! The text of the

cable is as follows: "Please keep HQS advised on any further con-

NB: DIR-74830 was written by BUSTOS on 10 October; it was not

given any priority slug; it went out at 2229z; it could have been

authenticated by C/WH/3 and released by C/WH; the cable was

probably written late in the evening, therefore, C/WH would have

authenticated - KING did not sign, his OPS officer signed - HOOD -

therefore, TK would have relaased for the DDP. It might be in-

teresting to know if ADDP means assistant or acting. However,

whatever the case, its is not suprising that TK signed off. No

p. 157 There are several marginal notations on this document

IDIR 74830, 11.10.63]. Perhaps the most interesting is the nota-

tion "sic" with an arrow drawn to the "Henry" in the name Lee

Harvey OSWALD". That notation was made by Win SCOTT when he

read the cable on the day it was had received in Mexico. (598)

This notation struck Committee investigators as very strange be-

cause it was a possible indication that Win SCOTT knew, at the

time the cable was received, that Lee OSWALD's middle name was

not "Henry". [The notation on the cable was not made by SCOTT;

it was made by ROCCA when he reviewed the file after its arrival

in headquarters ca. 1970.

p. 159 If SCOTT did in fact make this notation prior to the

assassination of John Kennedy, this Committee has not been able

to determine why "sic" was used. (602) [Inasmuch as SCOTT did

not make this

notation, ROCCA did, the entire argument HARDWAY

builds from page 157 - 159 is based an inaccurate determination

as to who made the notation.] In footnote no. 602, HARDWAY states

"SCATT's manuscript may provide a clue when he writes that during

his first contact with the Soviet Embassy, OSWALD 'gave his name

very slowly and distinctly'. (Foul Foe manuscript, p. 267.)

about 15 October 1963 [See cover sheet to DIR 74830, 11 October

It should have been possible at that point to compare tapes

p. 150 The second point of interest that is illustrated by the

10 October cable and teletype is the inference that can be made

from reviewing paragraph 3 of the teletype, paragraph 5 of the

cable, and TK signing off on the cabde, that the CIA was asking

for, and promising, a further investigation of OSWALD without

a specific request from any other government agency who might

have had, as the 1977 TFR says, 'investigative responsibility'."

[Thesstateneht in the cable was a routine request to keep Has

informed if any additional information came to the Station's

attention - this was not a requirement for an investigation.]

"The request for further investigation and dissemination

contained in paragraoh 5 of the 10 October cable to Mexico

was the reason

that the cable was sent to the ADDP for release.

(588)" [This is the opinion of an unqualified person reading

traffic.) [This point has already been discussed above.]

[Much attention has been given to SCELSO's testimony which is

not accurate.]

p. 161 This Committee believes that Station personnel did,

between October 11 and October 15, go back and recheck the

transcripts and connect the important substantive calls to

OSWALD. Under normal

operating procedures a tape of OSWALD's

calls to the Soviet Embassy should not have been erased until

16. October, 4 to 5 days after the case took on added significance.

tely been linked to OSWALD prior to receipt of the 10/11 cable

call had probably occurred on September 28, 1963. (612)"

[HARDWAY is pushing - The files do not support "the Committee's

belief that the Station did, between October 11 and October 15,

go back and recheck the transcripts. The Russian translator in

the Station did remark that "the same person who telephoned a

day or so ago and spoke in broken

Russian" speaks to OBYEDKOV".

At that time, the identity of a caller and the contact was

the

reportable item, it was

done. There was no connection in the

Station's mind that Lee OSWALD was possibly the same as Lee Harvey

OSWALD. The HSCA wants

to say that the reference to an earlier

conversation in "broken Russian" means the Station did check

back (as they would say we should have) and, ergo, we knew about

the Cuban contact too.]

p. 161. "A notation made by GOODPASTURE on a newspaper article

in 1964 [21 October] suggests that a comparison of the tapes

containing "broken Russian" between 11 and 15. October -

"The caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidentified

until HQ sent traces on OSWALD and voices compared

by [TARASOFF].".

p. 162 "An examination of documents in LHO's Mexico City Station

P file and the cable traffic from Mexico City to Headquarters

one tape of OSWALD's voice existed as late as 16 October 1963.

According to SCELSO, it was belief that the tapes were probably

still in existence at the time of the assassination. The HSCA

notes, however, that the testimony of the persons at the Mexico

City Station "is consistent in saying that the tapes did not

cable was Station response to DIR 84886, 23. November 1963 which

asked Station to review all LIENVOY tapes and transcripts since

27 September to locate all material possibly pertinent to sub-

ject reference (MEXI-6453). See also MEXI-7023 (IN 67108),

comparison was not possible becuase of the first tape being

sistent with the

statements made in testimony and in other cables.

(622) and with the procedure then in effect at the Station at that

time. (623) It is, therefore, considered highly unlikely that a

tape would be held only one or two days, the situation that is

implied by the statement in MEXI-7023.

*There is some confusion in GOODPASTURE's testimony - She stated

that the caller from the Cuban Embassy was unidentified until

on OSWALD. Now that would have been in answer to

the cable dated the 8th October.. Their cable (DIR- ) was 18

OSWALD in 1963 and that he had not done a voice comparison. (626)

testified that TARASOFF did not do a voice comparison but

connected the two conversations in his marginal comments in the

transcripts on the basis of memory. (627)

P. 166 Whether or not TARASOFF or someone else did a voice com-

parison of the tapes, it is likely that the tapes did exist un-

til at least the l6th of October and would have been available

for such a comparison. It is possible that the connection between.

the 10/1/63 call and the 9/28/63 call was made on the basis of

TARASOFF'S

memory. in any event the record clearly indicates

that the tapes should have been available, and probably were

available, as late as 16 October. (628) This is significant

because

it was after receipt -f the 10/10 cable from Headquarters

that the OSWALD case took on a more than routine coloring.

p. 167 The increased significance that the OSWALD visit took

on during the period from 11

October to 16 October 1963, could

have provided the Station with reason to retain the OSWALD

tapes. (629)

p. 168 On the whole most CIA officers wh. testified stated that,

if a tape of OSWALD's voice existed at the time of the assassina-

CIA officer (SCELSO) testified that he believed the tapes did

exist at the time of the assassination. "Yes, the tapes were

p. 170 On 15 October 1963,

tion regarding OSWALD's contact with the Soviet Embassy. (640)

By this date at least the 10/1 10:45 call, the 9/28/ 11:51 call,

the 9/27/ 4:05 pm call, and the 9/27 4:26 pm call had been linked

to OSWALD. (641)

[The 16 October 1963 memorandum to the Ambassador et al refers

only to the l October 1963 call. It makes no reference to any

other calls. "It was determined by the Station (by

OSWALD's

own statement by telephone) that OSWALD had been at the Soviet

Embassy on 28 September 1963 and had talked with Valeriy :

Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV ... ." There is nothing in the memorandum

regarding the other calls. These other calls were not reported

to the FBI until 25 November 1963. This CSCI included as attach-

ments transcripts of three calls on 27 September, 1 call on

28 September, one call on 1 October, and one on 3 October 1963.

In other words the other calls available to the Station were

not linked to OSWALD until the Station reviewed its holdings

after the assassination of Kennedy. HARDWAY is really pushing

to prove his hypothesis - don't allow the evidence to conflict

with the hypothesis!] - The files do not support his hyposhesis

nor, apparently, do the testimonies of CIA employees; can one

trust their statements after fifteen years. Details become

blurred.

P. 121 When asked why the 10/16 memorandum said that there was

no clarifying information on OSWALD'ss'request' when it was known

by this time that he was seeking a visa,

said that

'They had -no need to know all those other details."!

[The reason

why the Station did not know what OSWALD was talking about was the

Station had not yet learned the purpose of OSWALD's contact with

the Soviet Embassy, nor had the Station learned that OSWALD had

first contacted the Cuban Consulate. It was not until after the

assassination that the Station put together the information

(trans-

cripts) it had on OSWALD's contacts with the Cuban and Soviet

Consulates.]

p. 171 Even though the Station's actions after the 10/11 cable

were not highly extensive, it is inaccurate and misleading to

say that those actions were limited to requesting a photograph

Of OSWALD from Headquarters. Other actions included rechecking

the transcripts and discovering the substantive ones that concerned

OSWALD and reporting the information in MEXI 6453 ... in a misleading

manner. This is absolute crap - it's the Gospel according to Saint

Dan! The files do not support this hypothesis.

Hence, the fact that OSWALD was seeking a visasand had been in

contact with the Cubans as well as the Russians was known prior

to the assassination, and the Station's actions prior to the as-

sassination were more comprehensive than merely requesting a

photograph; although if any action other than a file check was

taken, no record of that action has been made available to this

Committee.

p. 172 Possible that information developed by Station after 11

October 1963 was reported to Headquarters - SCALETI said such

a report "would have been expected". SCELSO agreed that such

information should have been reported to Headquarters.

p. 173 SCALETI said she could bot recall that Mexico had sent any

other information to Hqts before the assassination. SCELSO

was certain

that this information was reported but could not

recall the form of the report or whether it occurred before

or after the assassination. Allan WHITE, DC, had no knowledge

before the

assassination of any information being sent to Hats.

GOODPASTURE was unsure - it was not until after the assassina-

tion that Hats was informed of OSWALD's contact with the Cubans.

p: 174

was certain a second cable reporting OSWALD's

contacts with the Cuban Embassy had been sent to Hots before the

assassination. She did not

send such a cable, but knew that one

had been sent.! PHILLIPS had no knowledge of a second cable.

P. 176 HARDWAY cites SCOTT's manuscript - "(O)n page 777 of

(the Warren) report the erroneous statement was made that it

was not known that OSWALD had visited the Cuban Embassy until

after the assassination! Every piece of information concerning

Lee Harvey OSWALD was reported I immediately after it was

received to: U.S. Ombassador MANN, by memorandum; the FBI

Chief in Mexico, by memorandum; and to my Headquarters by cable;

and included in each and every one of these reports was the con-

versation OSWALD had, so far as it was known. These reports were.

made on all his contacts with both the Cuban Consulate and with

the Soviets. (656) [See remarks above regarding the validity of

SCOTT's manuscript as to an accurate record of events in Mexico

City before and after the assassination.]

177 SCELSO was asked whether or not the Station was ever criticized

for this failure to report in the face of a specific request to

do so by CIA Hqts. [There was no specific request from Hqts.

Hats merely asked to be kept informed on any further contacts or

positive identification of OSWALD. This request was not one to

initiate an investigation.]

p. 178 Perhaps the nature of the CIA Mexico City Station's han-

dling of the OSWALD case prior to the assassination can best be

summed up in Dave PHILLIPS' response when he was asked how he

would characterize that handling: "At the very best, it is not

professional, at the best." (659)

p. 184 In view of what is now known about the standard operating

procedures and about the Station's actions prior to the assassi-

nation, the Station's confusing and somewhat contradictory re-

porting after the assassination is strange. (684) It is possible

that these confusions and contradictions

arose out of the crisis

atmosphere at the Station and the rush to report information.

This Committee has not found any solid evidence that there were

sinister qualities in the reporting after the assassination.

LiARDWAY's argument is to prove that the Mexico City

Station knew

about OSWALD's activities in Mexico City before

KENNEDY's assassination. He makes reference to various cables

which, according to the Agency, indicate that the Station had

not reviewed its

telephone tap or photographic production in

a serious manner until the news of KENNEDY's assassination.

It's true that the Station had transcripts of telephone calls

(five in all) which concerned OSWALD; either he identified

himself or, from the context of the call, the call related

tO OSWALD. HARDWAY does not accept facts, he tries to make a

case out of hypothesis - when the facts do not coincide with

his preceptions he

then manipulates the evidence so that he

can make a case that the Station knew about OSWALD's contacts

with the Cuban

IbAlald and the Soviet Consulates. When the

facts are not there, he hypothesises. This may be acceptable

in a legal summary, but when presenting a counterintelligence

case, facts are the basis

for any conclusions.
