2749 dated 1L April 1969

Even though we have maintained AFLANYARD fOr a

considerablo length of time,

we have not been able to

establish a pattern of activity for AsBoor.

The cause

of thie lack la quite simplo:

AELANYARD lne boon main-

tained more or lose on a working hour schedule, 1.0.

rom roughly 0400 to a400 hours with occasional additional

night monttoring. Roalizing this, wo decidod

to carry

out a two wook operation whereby we usol diflorent equip

ment,

Wo will conne this phase of the operation since we

now have, we belleve, sufilosont coverage to unstablish

-the pattern of activity of AN300%.

The operation has proved very hulpful. we now

Know that on two occasinia AEBOOR did no, return home

until Iive or nix in the morning.

Nre, AEBOOR on one

occanion launched into him comanding to know where he had

His serly was "I have been working" and nothing

Our next step asninet ABBOOR ie to mount via

It le our

howover, since an many an 12 officers per duy will be

it was ond of the favorite dishes of his wife. He surgested that perlaps

he could pick her up aftor tha "cormand perfumance" and bring her to the

apartmont.

Thie was readily agreed to but since there was an hour and

a half romaining before Subject could fetch his wife, we consinued with

goneral sonveragiln.

The followish: puints concerning Sub lect's past

1958 and that during this time he had had a chance to travel freely

and one something of the country. The pouple wore friendlier, politer

As oxytainod in Reisrence A we briofed BIOCENESIS

in the early aftornosn

of 25 January.

BIOGENES IS innediately

issued instructions

that the portero of tho building be

approachod.

This wes accomulished

Successiully in the

Inte afternoon of the same dily.

Untortunately the portero

did not havo a koy.

The sam: night a BIOGENESIS team

throw (including BIBAFFLE-3 und BIOGENESIS-14) attenptod

in vain to ick the lock.

In the course of this

picking exorcise PIBAFFLE-3 had to identify BIOGSNESIS

interost in the apartment to the ownor of tho noighsoring

apartmont.

Fortunatoly this individual is wealthy and

was

coopointive.

Once we had boon forced to temporarily withdrav

necupiod the apartment on 27 January, we

obtained through BIOGENESIS the bluoprints of the target

apartmont and the apartments which abutted.

thoso bluoprints shows that the apartmont belonging to

tho wonlthy cooporative neighbor has a maid's room which

sharos the wall of the living room of

apartmont.

Wo pointed this out to BIOGENESIS and suggested

that thoy

onlist tho further cooporntion of the owner in

ordor that a microphono could bo installed through the

common wall.

novoral wooks leavo.

Tho owner should be back inl

this timo and wo havo instructed BIOGENFSIS to approach

him again and to movo on with the oporation.. We are also

presently working on an LP.

Wo shall koop you advised of our prugross in

this oporation.
