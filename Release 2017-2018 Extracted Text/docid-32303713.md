SUBJECT:

Les CAUSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

(00: NEW YORK)

Previous New Haven information submitted in this matter has

Indicated that FRANK LEWIS PICCOLO, a highly placed racketeer

in the Bridgeport, Connecticut, ares, is possibly connected

with the THOMAS LUCHESE family

through ANTHONY CASTALDI, aka

, Tony Higgins, or with the CARLOVGANBINO family inasmuch

FRANK PICCOLO's name was fuund among the personal effects

of CARLO GAMBINO. The purpose of this communication is to

point out additional evidence which has been developed

strongly indicating that PICCOLO is very likely connected

with the CARLO GAMBINO family through an association with

JOSEPH ARCURI, whom New York sources report is a "Captain"

in the CARLO GAMBINO family of the CAUSA NOSTRA.

On June 29, 1962, Confidential Source MM 802-C reported

that the name FRANK PICCOLO, 220 East 23rd Street, with

Telephone Number MU 9-0160,

was found among the personal

effects of CARLO GAMBINO in that his name was found on a

business card for the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing

Corporation, 1184 Chapel Street, New Haven, Connecticut,

MARVIN BOTWICK, President.

It is known and it has been reported to the Bureau and

New York that PICCOLO has admitted to two agents of the

New Haven Division that he was associated in business with

the Consolidated Research and Manufacturing Corporation,

which at one time had offices both in New York and in New

Haven, as a salesman. PICCOLO further advised that his

office in New York City with the Consolidated Research

Corporation was located at 220 East 23rd Street.

It is known through interviews with MARVIN BOTWICK, former

President of Consolidated Research, now deceased, that

BOTWICK had personal relations with PICCOLO and strongly

indicated that PICCOLO had offered the Consolidated Research

Corporation financial assistance.

On December 21, 1962, Special Agent WINTHROP A. YOUNG Of

New Haven contacted PCI ANTHONY TESTO in Bridgeport, _Conn-

ecticut, who furnished

the following information:

Recently ANGELO CULMO, allegedly the "head man" of the

rackets in Ansonia, Connecticut, died and there was con-

sternation as to who would replace him.

On December 22,

1962, the son of ANGELO CULMO and NICHOLAS PATTI, also

from

the Ansonia, Connecticut, area, came to the informant's

place of business along with

Several tele-

phone calls were made from informant's telephone by PICCOLO

who remarked to the informant that he was straightening out

the Ansonia situation, as to who should have control.

In-

formant believed the calls were to New York.

It was determined that only two toll calls to New York

City were made on December 20, 1962, from informant's

phone

and both were to New York, Number 212 - RE 7-1588.

The New York Office determined that RE 7-1588 is listed to

302 East 78th Street. New York City

76th Street, New York City.

FATE TEACHING TETHER

In January, 1963, NY 3864-2-TE advised ARCÜRI is a "Captain"

in the CARLO GAMBINO

family of LA CAUSA NOSTRA..

Additional investigation conducted in this matter by the

New Haven Division Indicated that ANGELO,CULMO, JR., 1s In

control of the rackets in Ansonia, Connecticut.

From the above it is highly conjecturer that PICCOLO 1s

associated with the GAMBINO family and/in the LUCHESE

family.
