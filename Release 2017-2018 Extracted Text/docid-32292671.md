NOTE: Dominic "Butch" Blasi, described as the number one boy of

Chicago top hoodlum Samuel M. Giancana, has orderda new Chevrolet

with specified equipment which will have to be installed at the

factory.

Chicago advises this automobile when received will be

used for meetings between Giancana and his associates and

recommends that a C.A.T. unit be installed before delivery.

However, Chicago also advises that there will be no access

to

2 this vehicle after the original installation. Authority for

this installation is therefore not being granted inasmuch as

inot having access to the car there would be no opportunity to

service the unit and furthermore it appears that in the event of

disposition of the car the Bureau would lose control of the unit.

In addition, we already have microphone coverage of Giancana's

activities at his headquarters in the Armory Lounge at River

Forest, Illinois (U)
