FOR JACKSONVILLE

One color photo of SANTO TRAFFICANTE taken in

February, 1967.

ADMINISTRATIVE:

Information from records of the General Telephone

Company, Tampa, Florida, was made available by Mr. ALTON M.

BRYANT, Security Director.

On 4/10/67, OM 148-PC, an admitted member of La

Cosa Nostra, advised

he had recently observed a card in the

possession of LEW FARRELL in Des Moines, Iowa,

and that the

card contained the name GEORGE POLERA, President, American

Tallow Company, Oak Hill, Florida. He related that POLERA

was a personal friend of

FARRELL's and believed legitimate,

however,

had

an arrangement with SANTO TRAFFICANTE whereby

POLERA lists TRAFFICANTE as employed by him and indicating

payment in salary to TRAFFICANTE of $25,000 to $30,000 per

year.

He advised that this is done merely so that TRAFFICANTE

will have a front for the money he receives in the rackets,-

and that POLERA does pay Social Security for TRAFFICANTE.

On 4/27/67, SD 1064-C-TE advised SAS EDWARD MARI

and JOHN D. ARMSTRONG that La Cosa

Nostra member JIMMY

FRATIANNO, originally from Cleveland, had been observed in

the Los Angeles area meeting with former Cleveland hoodlums.

He stated that the hoodlums meeting

with FRATIANNO included

FRANK JOHN VELOTTA (FBI No. 313999C) is attempting to get a

criminal felony charge outstanding against him in the State of

Florida dropped or "fixed" ánd that VELOTTA apparently

believes that TRAFFICANTE could get the State charge "fixed."

He related that FRATIANNO has indicated that TRAFFICANTE, Boss

of the Florida ICN family, is an old friend of the informant's,

and, therefore, VELOTTA hopes to obtain the informant's help

with TRAFFICANTE.

On 4/25/67, TP 120-C advised SA JOHN A. AMBLER that

apparently TRAFFICANTE uses names other than his own, as on

occasion has seen different laundry marks on TRAFFICANTE'S

shirts.

He stated one mark; which has been seen and is recalled,

is "GAR." He stated that many of TRAFFICANTE's shirts are

apparently custom-made and were made in Switzerland, and that

the unique watch, which TRAFFICANTE recently gave to his wife,

was also made in Switzerland. He related that on an occasion

in April, prior to the newspaper account appearing in the

Tampa paper reflecting that TRAFFICANTE was in New York, a

telephone call had been received one afternoon at the TRAFFICANTE

residence, and that the call was made

by. TRAFFICANTE and was a

long distance call, but that the origin of the call was not

known.

He remarked that TRAFFICANTE left instructions with

the person taking the call that his cousin would be at the

house and would leave a package. He related that later the

same afternoon a white male approximately fifty years of age,

short, stout build, balding; wearing glasses, and believed to

be either Italian or Latin, appeared at the front door of the.

TRAFFICANTE residence in Tampa, and that when the door was

answered, this individual advised that he was SANTO TRAFFICANTE's

cousin, and that he had a package for SANTO. He remarked that

this person then took a large roll of bills bound by a rubber .

band out of his pocket and handed them to the person answering

the door.

He stated that apparently this individual had

parked his car some distance away from the residence, as there

was no car observed in the vicinity when the doorbell was

answered.

TP. 120-C stated that later in the afternoon Mrs.

TRAFFICANTE came back to the residence and wanted to know if

someone had been by and left a package. He related that he

has

no way of knowing the amount of money contained in the

roll; but from a quick glance, noticed that most of the bills

appeared to be twenties and hundreds.

TP 120-C is of the

opinion this particular individual has never been at the

TRAFFICANTE residence previously, and that, in addition, just

before SANTO TRAFFICANTE appeared in New York, both he and

Mr's,, TRAFFICANTE were in Tampa, but both were

TRAFFICANTE residence for a short period of

that during this absence, it was noted that there was a sum

it was

absent from the

time:

He stated

of money in the house in excess of $7,000.00, consisting

primarily of $100 bills. He stated he does not know how

much more was in the pile of money, as he had stopped at

$7,000.00, due to the fact he was fearful the TRAFFICANTES

in the te he

might return at any moment.

the only occasion when he observed such a sum of money in

the residence, although he knows from actions of the TRAFFICANTE

immediate family that there are large sums kept inthe house.

INFORMATION SET OUT ABOVE SHOULD BE HANDLED IN A

MOST CIRCUMSPECT MANNER AND IS NOT TO BE DISCUSSED WITH ANY

INDIVIDUAL OUTSIDE THE BUREAU.
