MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for the Meeting of Friday, January 25, 1363, 4 p.m.)

FROM

:

SUBJECT:

Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

United States Policy Toward Cuba

United States Policy

On November 20, the President set forth the broad guide-

lines of United States policy with respect to Cuba in the

following words:

"As for our part, if all offensive weapons systems are

removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in

the future, under adequate verification and safeguards,

and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive

communist purposes, there will be peace in the

Caribbean.

And, as I said in September, 'we shall

neither initiate

nor permit aggression

in this

hemisphere.'

"We will not, of course, abandon the political,

economic and other efforts of this hemisphere to halt

subversion from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that

the Cuban people shall some day be truly free. But

these policies are very different from any intent to

launch a military invasion of the island."

Objectives

Accordingly, the objectives of United States

policy with respect to Cuba are:

1.

Protecting the security of the United States

and the other states of the Organization of

American States (OAS) by assuring that

offensive weapons are not reintroduced into

Cuba;

2.

3.

Removal of remaining Soviet forces from Cuba;

Preventing Cuba from taking any aggressive

military action against other Caribbean states;

4.

Reducing the capabilities of the Castro regime

to direct and support subversion and insurrection

within the other Hemisphere states;

5. Encouraging and supporting any developments within

Cuba that offer the possibility of divorcing

the Cuban Government from its support of sino-

Soviet Communist purposes;

6.

Encouraging and supporting any developments

within Cuba that offer the possibility of

replacing the Cuban Government with a regime

that would break with the Sino-Soviet Bloc,

it being understood that our ultimate

objective is replacement of the regime by

one fully compatible with the goals of the

United States;

Maximizing the cost to the Soviet Union of

supporting the Castro regime;

8.

Maximizing the political isolation of the

Castro regime from other free world states,

and especially from states of the DAs.

Whenever possible, U. S. actions against Cuba

should be multilateral, preferably based upon

the Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact)

or on resolutions adopted by the Crganization

of American States. The newly-won hemispheric

solidarity on the Cuban issue should not be

jeopardized by seeking DAs actions of margina

value and which might split the hemisphere

appropriate U. S. combat elements and/or

logistical support, the wide variety of

military contingencies that may arise from

pursuit of the foregoing objectives; and

10. Producing comprehensive intelligence related

to the above objectives.

Supporting Actions

A. To achieve the foregoing objectives, the

U. S. Government will be prepared to increase

the political economic, psychological and

military pressures, as appropriate opportunities

present themselves or can be created.

existing programs and upon the development

of new programs related to the foregoing

objectives will be forthcoming.

1. In addition to current covert program, such

as intelligence collection, recruitment of

Cuban officials as agents, radio broadcasts,

support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC)

and other exile group activities and infil-

tration of propaganda materials:

a. Intensify covert collection

of intelligence within Cuba, especially

within the regime;

b.

Support the efforts of certain Cuban

exiles, who are associated with

the original aims of the 26 of July

Movement and who believe that the

Castro regime can be overthrown from

within in order that they may:

1) cause a split in the

leadership

of the regime at the national or

provincial levels; and 2) create a

political base of popular opposition

to the regime; and, 3) secure

intelligence;

C.

Assist Cuban exiles in developing a

capability to launch balloons carrying

leaflets and other propaganda materials

from international waters into Cuba.

Launch propaganda balloons after an

operational capability has been

established.

2.

With respect to the actions listed below,

the results of Mr. Donovan's imminent

negotiations with Fidel Castro for freeing

the 20-odd American prisoners should first

be ascertained. If these actions were taken

before the conclusion of the negotiations

they could jeopardize the release of the

Americans.

3. If these negotiations fail, or when the

prisoners are recovered, proceed on the

following timetable:

4.

Inform NATO and OAS twelve hours in advance

of the proclamation of the four point

shipping orders. (The proclamation calls for

the orders to go into effect in five days).

These orders:

a. Close United States ports to all

vessels of a country whose vessels

engage in carrying arms to Cuba;

b. Close United States ports to any ship

which has carried goods in the Bloc-

Cuba trade within 120 days of the time

it seeks to enter a United States port;

c.

Prohibit all United States flag ships

and all ships owned by United States

nationals or residents from entering

any ports of Cuba and from carrying

any goods bound to or from Cuba; and

d.

Prohibit any cargo sponsored by any

department of the United States from

being shipped on vessels owned or

between Cuba and the Soviet Bloc.

At the termination of the U. S. Chiefs of

Mission Conference - January 20-30, or at

a later date dependent on the Donovan

mission, Assistant Secretary Martin, or

another

representative of the President

will visit the Presidents of Chile, Mexico

and Brazil to convey to them the importance

President Kennedy attaches to maintaining

hemispheric solidarity by their supporting

the following resolutions:

a.

An OAS resolution condemning Cuba for

its actions which continue to endanger

the peace, deploring refusal to allow

inspection, condemning the presence of

Soviet troops, recommending continued

surveillance and continued vigilance

against subversive activities, and

terminating the invocation of the Rio

Treaty on the missile crisis, together

with

b.

3) denial of Soviet over-flights and

6.

After obtaining the maximum possible

support of the key countries of Mexico,

Chile and Brazil, the other OAS

members will be approached in Washington

and in their respective capitals,

simultaneously. It should be possible

for this consultation and OAS action on

the resolutions to be completed within

ten days. Prior to formal COAS approval

of the resolutions, we will inform our

NATO allies of the impending OAS action.

7.

At the first NATO meeting after formal

OAS action on the resolutions, we will

request that NATO include Cuba on the i

list of countries to which shipment

of COCOM list (strategic) items prohibited.

8. After NATO decision on our COCOM request,

we will seek to get agreement from Free

World industrial nations to prevent

shipping of critical spare parts and

equipment to Cuba, not on the COCOM list.

9.

In addition to the four point shipping

resolutions, and action under Section

107 of the Foreign Assistance Act, continue

to press Free World nations to keep their

shipping out of Bloc-Cuba trade.

Contigency Planning

New opportunities for accomplishing our

objectives may arise either as a result of Bloc

action in other parts of the world; as a result

of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile actions)

by the Castro-Communist regime itself; or as a

result of uprisings or internal conflict within

Cuba.

Our contingency planning, which will be

undertaken immediately, should include preparations

for increased multilateral and/or bilateral

political and economic measures, large scale use of

Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive

air activity including both high and low level

flights primarily directed toward surveillance

and collection of intelligence, and which may also

have the effect of embarrassing the Castro

government and keeping the Castro forces on .

continual alert;

retaliatory measures, as

appropriate, including the imposition of a

POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in

other countries; severance of communications

to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping

destined for Cuba and on key installations to

Cuba; intensive naval pacrols; anc, ultimately,

the use of U. S. military force.

enters. s.

To the extent

feasible, U. S. military forces employed against

Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily-

trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of

those Latin American nations desirous of

participating in the U. S. effort.

Our programs should be designed to encourage

the Brigade members to melt back into the exile

community and engage in constructive pursuits

pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer

them some special assistance but not to the extent

that they become a perpetual privileged class

within the community: Presidential action on their

behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

Existing programs will be reviewed and further

recommendations made as necessary. Planning for the

variety of contingencies related to Cuba will be undertaken

at once.

In addition to current covert programs such as

intelligence collection, recruitment of Cuban officials,

support of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) and

other exile activities, infiltration of propaganda

materials,

and radio broadcasts, the following are

recommended for approval and immediate initiation:

a. intensified covert collection of intelligence

within Cuba, especially within the regime;

b.

support of Cuban exiles who are seeking to

return

i the 26 of July Movement to its

original aims.

NOTE: It should be noted that approval of the

foregoing actions may impair our ability

to accomplish objective b. (Removal of

remaining Soviet forces from Cuba) because

taking these actions could provide the

Nevertheless, approval

of the foregoing actions is recommended.

In iddition to these immediate actions, we should make

preparations now so that we are able to seize opportunities for more

positive action towards our ultimate objective of the overthrow of

the Castro/ Communist rogime.

These opportunitics may arise

either as a result of Bloc action in other parts of the world, as a

result of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile acts) by the Castro/

Communist regime itself; or as a result of uprisings or internal

conflict within Cuba. We should prepare contingency plans to deal

with these situations.

Our contingency planning should include preparations for large -

scale use of Cubans inside Cuba; more extensive air activity including.

both high and low level flights primarily directed toward surveillance

and collection of intelligence, and which may also have the effect of

embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the Castro forces on

continual alert; retaliatory measures, as appropriate, including the

imposition of a POL, blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in other

countries; severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of

sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key installations in

Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately, the use of U.S.

military forces.

We should be in

a position to respond with open military support

(to include such items as materic!, advisors, training, and Special

Forces support and, if necessary, up to the full range of military

forces), to a request for ascictanso from any anti-Castro/ Communist

group or groups in Cuba which deconstrate an ability to survive,

which threaten the present regime, and whose aims are compatible

with those of the U.S.

To the extent feasible, U.S. military forces employed against

Cuba should be accompanied by U.S, militarily-trained free Cubans

and by the armed forces of those Latin American nations desirous of

participating in the U.S. effort.

Our ultimate objective with respect to Cuba remains the

overthrow of the Castro/ Communist regime and its replacement

by. one compatible with the objectives of the U. S. and, where

possible, sharing the aims of the Free World.. To achieve this

objective, the U.. S. Government will apply increasing degrees of

political, economic, psychological and military pressures, as

appropriate opportunities present themselves or can be created,

until the Castro/Communist regime is overthrown. Our immediate

objectives are to isolate the Castro/ Communist regime from the Free

World and from the Bloc; weaken it economically; promote internal

dissension, erode its domestic political support; frustrate its sub-

versive activities; negate its influence in the hemisphere; increase

the cost to the Bloc. of sustaining the regime; and obtain the withdrawal

of Russian troops from Cuba.

Isolating, undermining and discrediting the Castro/Communist

regime through the exercise of all feasible diplomatic, economic,

psychological and covert actions may achieve the immediate objectives

and could create propitious conditions in Cuba for further advance

toward our ultimate objective.

We should be in a position to respond with open military sup-

port. (to include such items as material, advisors, training, and

Special Forces support and, if necessary, up to the full range of

military forces), to a request for assistance from any anti-Castro/

Communist group or groups in Cuba which demonstrate an ability

to survive, which threaten the present regime, and whose aims are

compatible. with those of the.U.S.

Invasion of Cuba by U. S. military forces, as distinguished

from military support upon request of indigenous forces, should

not be undertaken in the absence of aggression or other Castro/Communist

and/or Soviet actions that threaten the peace of security of the

hemisphere. This does not preclude appropriate U. S. retaliation

for isolated hostile acts by the Castro/Communist or Soviet forces.

and military actions. Such actions might include leaflet dropping;

propaganda urging sabotage, strikes, and opposition to the regime;

psychological operations urging defections; large scale training of

Cubans in the U. S. and the use of such Cubans inside Cuba; extensive

air activity including both high and low level flights primarily directed

toward surveillance and collection of intelligence, and which may also

key installations in Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately,

the use of U. S. military forces.

In addition, this course of action would involve a hroad gamut

of carefully timed political, economic, psychological and covert actions,

such as OAS sanctions, Caribbean security arrangements, intensified

surveillance of and publicity concerning Castro/Communist subversive

activities in Latin America, application of Four Point shipping restric-

tions and other economic sanctions, and a series of actions designed

to obtain, to the greatest extent possible, multilateral approval of and

participation in the campaign to unseat the Castro/Communist regime.

This course of action has the advantage of attaining the

objective more rapidly and under more controlled conditions than

the alternative stated by the Coordinator. Indeed, this may be the

only course of action that will accomplish the ultimate objective.

It involves greater risks; and, in the short run, a greater expenditure

of money and material and far greater numbers of personnel.

From the standpoint of international politics, the U. S.

will probably be subjected to criticism for aggression from the

uncommitted nations. It is difficult to predict the reaction of

the Latin American governments. They may attack the U. S. for

"intervening" or they may react favorably (as they did during the

missile crisis).: To a large extent, the reaction of the nations

%

throughout the world, and particularly the Latin American nations,

will depend upon how adroitly these actions are handled. For

example, there may even be advantages to the fact that our active

policy and the courses of action under it may eventually become

/impossible to conceal. If properly handled, the overt aspects of

this policy may serve not only to mitigate any unfavorable reactions

from other countries, but also to gain, particularly in Latin America,

increasing appreciation of the threat of Castro/Communist Cuba.

The active pursuit of our objective will make it clear that

the U. S. will not permit the maintenance of a communist base in

the hemisphere. From the standpoint of military posture, the

more active approach may be subjected to counteractions from

the Sino-Soviet Bloc elsewhere. As we increase the pressures

on Castro/Communist Cuba and the extent of our commitment.to

overthrow the regime, U. S. prestige becomes more deeply

involved. The further we progress along this route, the more

significant will be the loss of U. S. prestige if we alter or abandon

it.

The successful execution of this policy will require careful

timing and coordination of our actions and the development of detailed

plans. While such plans would be designed to bring about the over-

throw of the Castro regime within a given time frame for planning

purposes, they would have to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate

changes to the international situation.

In any case, at crucial points along the way, it will be neces-

sary for the highest levels of our Government to review the actions

already taken and those contemplated and to assess the advantages

of continued and escalated activity against the disadvantages and

dangers of such activity.

Commitment to this course of action does not exclude the

possibility of actively pursuing the isolation of the Castro regime

from the Bloc.

Coordinator's Recommendation

I do not concur in the policy recommended by the Coordinator.

The objectives stated in the Coordinator's paper do not sufficiently

commit the U. S. to the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime.

¡The Coordinator's paper depends too much upon events outside the

control of the U. S. Government and does not sufficiently contemplate

the creation of opportunities to effect the downfall of the Castrol

Communist regime. The specific actions recommended in the

Coordinator's paper are consistent with the policy recommended in

this paper and, in many cases, would be among the initial steps that

would be taken in executing that policy.

Recommendation

I recommend that the policy stated above be adopted as the

United States policy toward Cuba:

"As for our part, ll all olfensive weapons systems are

removed from Cuba and kept out of the hemisphere in

the future, under adoquate vorification and safeguards.

and if Cuba is not used for the export of aggressive

communist purposes, there will be peace in the Caribbear.

And, as I said in September, we shall mither initiate

nor permit aggression in this hemisphere'

"We will not, of course, abandon the political, economic

and other offorts of this hemisphere to halt subversion

from Cuba, nor our purpose and hope that the Cuban people

shall some day be truly ire®. But these policies are very

difforent from any intent to launch & military invasion of

6. Maximising the cost to the Soviet Union of supporting

the Castro regime;

7. Maximizing the political isolation of the Castro regime

from other free world states, and especially from

states of the OAS. Whenever possible, U.S. actions

against Cuba should be multilateral, preferably based

In addition to these immediate actions, we should make

preparations now so that we are able to seize opportunities for more

positive action towards our ultimate objective of the overthrow of

the Castro/ Communist regime. These opportunities may arise

either as a result of Bloc action in other parts of the world, as a

result of aggressive moves (or isolated hostile acts) by the Castrol

Communist regime itself; or as a result of uprisings or internal

conflict within Cuba. We should prepare contingency plans to deal

with these situationg

Our contingency planning should include preparations for large -

scale use of Cubans inside Cuba; more extensive air activity including

both high and low level flights primarily directed toward surveillance

and collection of intelligence, and which may also have the effect of

embarrausing the Castro government and keeping the Castro forces on

continual alert; retaliatory meacures, as appropriate, including the

imposition of a POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in other

countries; severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of

sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key installations in

Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and, ultimately, the use of U.S.

military forces.

We should be in a position to respond with open military support

(80 include such items as materill, advisors, training, and Special

Forces support and, if necessary, up to the full range of military

forces), to a request for assistance from any anti-Castro/ Communist

group os groups in Cuba which demonstrate an ability to survive,

which threaten the present regime, and whose aims are compatible

with those of the U.S.

To the extent feasible, U.S. military forces employed against

Cuba should be accompanied by U.S. militarily -trained free Cubans

and by the armed forces of those Latin American nations desirous of

participating in the U.S. effost.

ALTERNATIVE II

United States Policy

1. Our ultimate objective with respect to Cuba is

the overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime and 'its

replacement by one compatible with the objectives of the

U.S. and, where possible, sharing the aims of the Free

World. To achieve this objective, the U.S. Government

will apply increasing degrees of political, economic,

psychological and military pressures, as appropriate

opportunities present themselves or can be created,

until the Castro/Communist regime is overthrown.

2. Our immediate objectives are to isolate the

Castro/Communist regime from the Free World and from

the Bloc; weaken it economically; promote internal

dissension, erode its domestic political support;

frustrate its subversive activities, negate its influence

in the hemisphere; increase the cost to the Bloc of

sustaining the regime; and obtain the withdrawal of

Russian

troops from Cuba.

3. Isolating, undermining and discrediting the

Castro/Conmunist regime through the exercise of all

feasible diplomatic, economic, psychological and

covert actions may achieve the immediate objectives

and could create propitious conditions in Cuba for

further advance toward our ultimate objective.

4. We should be in a position to respondwith open

military support (to Include such items as materiel,

advisors, training, and Special Forces support and,

if necessary, up to the full range of military forces),

to a request for assistance from any anti Castro/Communist

group or groups in Cuba which demonstrate an ability to

survive, which threaten the present regime, and whose

aims are compatible with those of the U.S.

5. Invasion of Cuba by U.S. military forces, as

distinguished from military support upon request of

indigenous forces, should not be undertaken in the

absence of aggression or other Castro/Communist and/or

Soviet

SECRET

## Page 53

Soviet actions that threaten the peace or security of the

hemisphere. This does not preclude appropriate U.S.

retaliation for isolated hostile acts by the Castro/

Communist or Soviet forces.

6. To the extent feasible, U.S. military forces

employed against Cuba should be accompanied by U.s.

militarily trained free Cubans and by the armed forces

of those Latin American nations desirous of participating

In the U.S. effort.

7. Intensive, comprehensive and continuing

intelligence

gathering in depth on Cuba should be identified as a primary

objective of the national intelligence effort.

8. Whenever possible, U.S. actions against Cuba

should be multilateral, preferably based upon theiTreaty

of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Pact) or on resolutions

adopted by the Organization of American States. The

• newly-won hemispheric solidarity on the Cuban issue

should not be jeopardized by seeking AS actions of

marginal value and which might split the hemisphere.

Overt and covert annexes of specific actions in m

support of this policy will be prepared.

Discussion

The active pursuit of our ultimate objective in-

volves a phased and controlled series of political,

actions might inclyde leaflet dropping; propaganda urging

sabotage, strikes, and opposition to the regime; psycho-

logical operations urging defections; large scale training

of Cubans in the U.S. and the use of such Cubans inside

Cuba; extensive air activity including both high and low

level flights primarily directed toward surveillance and

collection of intelligence, and which may also have the

effect

effect of embarrassing the Castro government and keeping the

Castro forces on continual alert; retaliatory measures, as

appropriate, including the imposition of a POL blockade;

barrassment of Cuban officials in other countries;

severance of communications to Cuba; major acts of

sabotage on shipping destined for Cuba and on key

installations in Cuba; intensive naval patrols; and,

ultimately, the use of U. S. military forces.

In addition, this course of action would involve a

broad gamut of carefully timed political, economie, psy-

chological and covert actions, such as OAS sanctions,

Caribbean security arrangements, intensified surveillance

of and publicity concerning Castro/Communist subversive

activities in Latin America, application of Four Point

shipping restrictions and other economic sanctions, and

a series of

actions designed to obtain, to the greatest

extent possible, multilateral approval of an participation

In the campaign

to unseat the Castro/Commist regime.

This course of action has the advantage of attaining

the objective more rapidly and under more controlled

conditions than the alternative stated by the Coordinator.

Indeed, this may be the only course of action that will

accomplish the ultimate objective. It Involves greater

risks; and, In the short run, a greater expenditure of

money and material and far greater numbers of personnel.

From the standpoint of international polities, the

V. S. will probably be subjected to criticism for

aggression from the uncommitted nations. It is difficult

to predict the reaction of the Latin American governments.

They may attack the U. S. for "intervening" or they nay react

favorably (as they did during the missile crisis). To a

large extent, the reaction of the nations throughout the

world, and particularly the Latin American nations, will

depend upon how adroitly thee actions are handled.

For

example, there may even be advantages to the fact that our

active policy and the courses of action under it nay

eventually become impossible to conceal. If properly

handled, the overt aspects of this policy may serve not

only to mitigate any unfavorable reactions from other

countries, but also to gain, particularly in Latin

Americe, increasing appreciation of the threat of Castro/

Communist Cuba.

The active pursuit of our objective will make it clear

that the U. S, will not permit the maintenance of a

coumunist base in the hemisphere. From the standpoint of

military posture,

the more active approach may be

subjected to counteractions from the Sino-Soviet Bloc

elsewhere.

As we increase the pressures on Castro/Communist

Cuba and the extent of our conmitment to overthrow the regime,

U. S, prestige becomes more deeply involved.

The further

we progress along this route, the more significant will be

the loss of U. S. prestige if we alter or abandon it.

The successful execution of this policy will require

careful timing and coordination of our actions and the

development of detailed plans. While such plans would be

designed to bring about the overthrow of the Castro regime

within a given time frame for planning purposes, they

would have to be sufficiently flexible to accommodate

changes to the international situation.

In any case, at crucial points along the way, it will

be necessary for the highest levels of our Goverment to

review the actions already taken and those contemplated and

to assess the advantages of continued and escalated

activity against the disadvantages and dangers of such

activity.

undertaken immediately, should include preparations

for increased multilateral and/or bilateral

political and economic measures, large scale use of

Cubans who are now inside Cuba; more extensive

air activity including both high and low level

flights primarily directed toward surveillance

and collection of intelligence, and which may also

have the effect of embarrassing the Castro

government and keeping the Castro forces on

continual alert;

retaliatory measures, as

appropriate, including the imposition of a

POL blockade; harrassment of Cuban officials in

other countries; severance of communications

to Cuba; major acts of sabotage on shipping

destined for Cuba and on key installations to

Cuba; intensive naval pacrols; and, ultimately,

the use jof U. S. military force.

To the extent

feasible, U. S. military forces employed against

Cuba should be accompanied by U. S. militarily-

trained free Cubans and by the armed forces of

those Latin American nations desirous of

participating in the U. S. effort.

COURSES OF ACTION

(1) Continue the COAS/OC in being under the Rio Treaty but

take no further action at present.

Considerations:

The Rio Treaty was invoked and the COAS/OC brought into being

for the specific purpose of considering the October missile crisis.

If the purpose is considered fulfilled, the COAS/OC should either

be terminated or its authorization enlarged to deal with changed

circumstances.

(2) Under the Rio Treaty seek a resolution in COAS/OC which

condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to endanger the peace,

deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns the presence of

Soviet troops and recommends continued surveillance and continued

vigilance against subversive activities.

Considerations:

This would promote U.S. objectives vis-a-vis Cuba and would

represent one feasible, approprite, immediate step following the

conclusion of the U.S.-Soviet New York talks.

Although the language would have to be negotiated, it is

believed that unanimity or near-unanimity could be obtained.

Recent statements by Cuban leaders calling for armed insur-

rection in Latin America would be exploited in this connection.

It could be criticized for not constituting sufficiently

vigorous action on the problem of Soviet troops, but it would put

the OAS on record against their continued presence in the heris

phere and dramatize Castro's continued military subservience to

the Soviet Union:

(3) Terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This

would still leave COAS with its responsibilities under Resolutions

II and VIII of Punta del Este (Which provided for a Special Consul-

tative Committee on Security and a Special Committee to study the

further suspension of trade.)

Considerations:

This step could be considered logical, since the COAS/OC was

called Into being to deal only with the October missile crisis.

Taken

-3-

Taken by itself, this course of action might raise doubts

concerning the inter-American legal basis under which we are

continuing our surveillance.

Psychologically, if this were the only action taken, it would

appear as though the OAS considered the crisis over, the presence

of Soviet troops unimportant, and its principle of verification

surrendered (on-site inspection and re-introduction of offensive

weapons

(4) Combine (2) and (3).

Considerations:

This combination of actions is feasible and is likely to

obtain unanimity or near-unanimity.

The termination of the COAS/OC makes strong language in the

resolution more acceptable to the "soft" minority.

Termination of the OOAS/OC, even accompanied by the proposed

resolution, is open to some of the criticism indicated under (3)•

Much of this could be mitigated if, however, the action is accom-

panied by the action suggested in (9), which imposes economic

sanctions.

(5) Seek to enlarge the basis on which the Rio Treaty was

invoked to encompass the presence of Soviet troops and seek a

resolution in COAS/OC calling for their withdrawal.

Considerations:

With adequate consultation and preparation, we should be able

to obtain a substantial majority.

Such action would give a better basis for urging such addi-

tional steps as (6) and (7) and (8).

It would seem undesirable to take this course by itself unless

we seriously contemplate taking some additional strong enforcement

action.

(6) In addition to (5), seek authorization under the Rio

Treaty for collective action, including the use of armed force,

to bring about the withdrawal of soviet troops in Cuba if the

OAS call is not heeded.

Considerations:

SECRET

NN 50955 DocId: 32276061 Page 106

## Page 107

SECRET

Considerations:

This action should be seriously considered only if we are

determined to use all possible means to obtain removal of Soviet

troops.

While it should be possible with adequate consultation and

preparation to obtain a substantial majority for further political

and economic sanctions to help bring about the withdrawal of Soviet

troops, it would be difficult to obtain the necessary 2/3 majority

for authorization of the use of armed force.

(7) Seek a resolution in the COAS/OCto sever all diplomatic

and consular relations with fuba (probably possible only in con-

Junction with

or

(11)•

Considerations:

This would be consistent with general U.S. policy to increase

the isolation of Cuba, but contrary to some present policies

encouraging the maintenance of certain diplomatic missions in Cuba.

Although we could probably obtain the necessary 2/3 vote for

such action (particularly if couched as a recommendation) it would

be stoutly resisted by Mexico and Brazil and opposed by Chile,

Bolivia and Uruguay, whose contrary arguments would have some appeal.

Probably no more than maximum of 15 votes could be obtained

for this.

(8) Seek a resolution in the COAS/OC to sever all economic

and commercial relations and all communications with Cuba

(probably possible only in conjunction with (5) or (11).

Considerations:

The severance of all economic and commercial relations would

go beyond our current embargo on trade with Cuba which provides

for the exception on humanitarian grounds of the export from the

U.S. to Cuba of certain foods, medicines, and medical supplies.

Such action would expose us to charges of inhumanity and would

probably nullify our public statements that we have no quarrel

with the Cuban people.

A number of telecommunications between Latin America and

Europe are routed through Cuba. Prohibition of these services

would interrupt communications vital to many of our Latin American

friends. Further, U.s. communications with Cuba should be main-

tained to facilitate the transmission of messages in the national

interest and those for humanitarian reasons.

These

SECRET

50955 DocId: 32276061 Page 107

## Page 108

SBORST

-5=

These considerations would make it extremely difficult to

obtain a 2/3 majority in the COAS/OC.

(9) Seek resolution in COAS under Resolution VIII of Punta

del Este which would recommend:

(a)

extension of arms embargo to all items of trade except

food and medicine (Fall back position: extension of

arms embargo to all strategic items);

(b)

(c)

prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed

items and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;

denial of over-flights and transit rights to Soviet air-

craft on bloc-Cuba runs. (Points (b) and (c) could also

be added to No. (8).)

Considerations:

This is feasible and consistent with our objectives, and could

be taken independently of other steps.

With adequate consultation and preparation, near-unanimity

should be possible. Brazil would probably not go along.

The actual

effect of extending the embargo so far as Latin America is concerned

is more psychological than practical because Latin American countries

ship little except food to Cuba.

But it would show forward movement

and would provide a useful argument with our allies if it included an

appeal to other Free World nations to take similar steps.

It would offer a helpful (though not necessary) basis for U.S.

unilateral steps in controlling shipping, implementing 107 of the

Foreign Assistance Act, and for urging other states to control Soviet

flights to Cuba.

(10) Intensify through COAS and SCCS programs of recommended

controls over subversive activities. Seek COAS resolution warning

Castro that continued subversive activity may result in action

under Rio Treaty.

Considerations:

The course described in the first sentence of (10) is being

presently pursued under the decision taken at Punta del Este and

should be continued. However, it would be difficult to get unani-

mous or near unanimous support for the warning resolution because

of the reference to the Rio Treaty.

(11) Invoke Rio Treaty on basis of Castro's continued

subversive activities.

Considerations:

If we desire to institute more vigorous collective sanctions vs.

the Castro regime for its subversive activities, it would be neces-

sary to invoke the Rio Treaty since the present functions given the

COAS and Special Consultative Committee on Security (SCCS) under

Resolution II of Punta del Este provide authority only for surveil-

lance and recommendations to governments for control measures.

The primary threat of Castro is his subversive activities in

the hemisphere.

Should the level of Castro-directed subversive

activities in the Hemisphere increase appreciably, this would become

a more feasible and desirable course. This becomes an increasing

possibility in view of Castro's recent speech inciting insurrection

in Latin America.

The basis of any such action should consist of the production

of hard evidence of the direct involvement of the Cuban regime in

subversive activities in the hemisphere.

There is, however, in-

sufficient hard evidence available at this time to obtain COAS

action. (A U.S. project to collate all available evidence is under

way .)

(12) Assign the functions and operations of the Advisory

Defense Committee (ADC) to the Inter-American Defense Board (IADB).

This could be done:

(a) by amending the OAS Charter to assign ADC functions to

the IADB;

(b) by the COAS seeking the advice of the IADB; or

(c)

having the OAS member governments designate their

representatives on the IADB to serve also on the ADC.

Considerations:

As to (a), the proposed amendment would have to be referred

to the Quito Conference (whose date has not been set). Moreover,

amendment of the Charter is a difficult and tortuous process and

requires ratification by 2/3 of the member governments.

As to (b), this is a feasible course of action which the

cons/OC could take without specific authority. It might be diffi-

cult, however, depending on the circumstances, to persuade the

Council of the desirability of such action.

As

As to (c), member governments could take this course on an

individual basis, but it would be necessary to convince them that

"exceptional circumstances" prevailed which would justify this

action under the OAS Charter.

COORDINATOR'S RECOMMENDATION

In selecting the optimum combination of actions to take with

respect to the OAS, the political feasibility and international

complications were

key factors which I have carefully considered.

Courses of action (2) (3) (4) (9) (10) and (12) would advance

us toward our objective, would be politically feasible, and would

involve minimum adverse

international effects.

We could probably

obtain a near-unanimous vote in the OAS for these courses except

(10) and (12) •

Courses (2) (5) (6) (9) (10) (11) and (12) would advance us

considerably further toward our objective, but (6) and (11)

particularly could create a split in hemispheric unity, and would

involve adverse international effects, including a probable acute

confrontation with the USSR.

I believe courses (1) (7) and (8) will not serve our best

interests at this time.

I recommend that we take immediately courses (4) and (9)•

Course (4) calls for (a) a COAS/OC resolution under the Rio

Treaty which condemns Cuba for its actions which continue to

endanger the peace, deplores refusal to allow inspection, condemns

the presence of Soviet troops and recommends continued surveil-

lance and continued vigilance against subversive activities, and

(b) terminate the COAS/OC on the missile crisis. This would

still

leave COAS with its responsibilities under Resolutions II and VIlI

of Punta del Este which provided for a Special Consultative

Committee on Security and for the COAS to study the further sus

pension of trade.

Course (9) calls for a resolution in COAS under Resolution

VIII of Punta del Este which would recommend:

(a) extension of arms embargo to all items of trade except

food and medicine (Fallback position: extension of

arms embargo to all strategic items);

(b)

SECRET

## Page 111

SECRET

-8=

(b) prohibition of AR ships from transporting embargoed items

and deny use of ports to ships in Bloc-Cuba trade;

(c) denial of overflights and transit rights to Soviet air-

craft on Bloc-Cuba runs.

(d)

a call upon other Free World nations to take similar

actions.

Rationale

The steps I recommend would start movement forward towards our

objective, carrying the OAS with us, without committing us to any

further action.

After these initial measures are in effect, we should assess

the situation and determine the

feasibility of moving forward with

any of the remaining courses of

action, or any new courses which

may be opened to us by events.

I believe we should develop our pressures steadily and gradu-

ally, bringing the OAS along with us, and keeping the situation

under constant review for the optimum opportunity to initiate

coting oron tone

additional measures.

I do not believe we should take a track now which will break

hemispheric unity.

We may need unity later in an emergency.

Neither do I believe we should push the OAS into probable

acute confrontation with the USSR at this time.

Both of these prices the U. S. may find it necessary to pay

for action at a later date but not now, in my opinion.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL'S EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

(Prepared for the Meeting of Thursday, January 24, 1963, at 10 a.m)

FROM : Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

SUBJECT:

Cuban Brigade

PROBLEM

To determine the future of the Cuban

Brigade (participants in the Bay of

Pigs invasion recently released from

Cuban prisons), and other Cubans wizo

participated in or trained for the

invasion. To determine the future of

existing Cuban training programs.

DISCUSSION

Approximately 1500 Cubans participated in the Bay

of Pigs invasion (known as Brigade 2506), the great

majority of whom were captured. In December 1962 over

1100 were released.

A decision on the future of the Cuban Brigade and

other Cubans trained militarily by the U. S. must logically

proceed from whatever over all policy the U. S. adopts

toward Cuba.

A trained Cuban Brigade would be of relatively

marginal military value because of its quantitative

limitations and restricted military capability, but its

## Page 113

SECRET

→ 2=

politico-psychological value as a symbol of Cuban

resistance to Castro/Communism may more than compensate

for its limited military utility.

Any moral responsibility to the Brigade must be

weighed.

COURSES OF ACTION

Three courses of action appear

feasible with respect to the

Brigade's future.

(1) Induce the Brigade to disband as a military

unit, with no further U. S. special assistance.

If this policy were adopted, Brigade members and

their families would be eligible for the benefits now

accorded to all needy Cuban refugees in the Miami area

(approximately 105,000). These benefits are equivalent

to those received by American citizens in Dade County,

Florida who are in need. The principal ones include:

financial grants of up to $100 per month for a family

and up to $60 a month for an individual; hospitalization

and out-patient facilities at county

and private hospitals

for acute illnesses; distribution of surplus food commodities;

employnent counseling; resettlement, including transportation

and a transition grant; foster care for unaccompanied

children; special English and refresher courses for doctors

and lawyers at University of Miami;

a student loan program

for Cubans attending U. S. universities provides

up to $1,000 a year; supplemental assistance to Dade

County, Florida, is provided by HEW to cover 50 percent of

cost of educating Cuban refugee children in primary

and secondary schools; payment for a substantial part

of special language courses and vocational training; and

physical examinations and inoculations at time of

entry into the U.S.

DOD has a program providing for enlistment in the

U. S. Army of those Cuban nationals between the ages of 18

and 30 who pass entrance requirements. (A similar program

for the Navy covers ages 18-26). The program provides

20-22 weeks of training at the conclusion of which they

are transferred as individuals to U. S. Reserve status.

They are not required to know English. A two week period

for resettlement is also provided at the termination of

the training.

Another DOD program enables former officers

of the

Cuban Army, Navy and Air Force to volunteer on a highly

selective basis for programs in the U. S. Armed Forces.

Training periods are from 20 to 36 weeks. English is

necessary.. The officers are in civilian status. They

receive a salary from the Cuban Revolutionary Council and

a per diem through DOD from AID funds which are no longer

available.

Considerations:

This course of action would provide the simplest and

most economical way of disposing of the problem, provide

equal treatment for all eligible Cuban refugees; equivalent

to benefits offered to American citizens.

Individual Cubans could continue to be accepted for

service in the U. S. Armed Forces and their language, skill

and country knowledge could be distributed through various

U. S. units which might be used in an invasion.

The unsatisfactory aspects of this course are that

it would appear to run counter to expectations of the Brigade

as a result of Administration statements and actions; it

would result in substantial loss of whatever "mystique"

the Brigade possesses, which might be useful in unifying

Cuban refugees; and a phasing out of this kind would

probably engender some adverse political reaction

domestically as well as from the Brigade and its

sympathizers. Also it might have an undesirable effect

on opinion in Latin America and other parts of the

Free World concerning the determination of the United States

SECRET

NW 50955 DocId: 32276061 Page 114

## Page 115

SECRET

to unseat the Castro regime, and would lend weight to

arguments that the U. S. may be leaning toward coexistence

with the Castro regime.

(2) . Train the Brigade and Cubans in training as a

unit.

Maintain and support them as a military reserve

component of the U. S. Armed Forces.

Considerations:

Under this course of action whater "mystique" the

Brigade possesses in the anti-Castro community could perhaps

be exploited in the struggle for Cuban liberation, and used

to bring about greater unity in the Cuban anti-Castro exile

community.

It would constitute an immediate political and

psychological advantage by demonstrating to the Cubans

within Cuba, to the Cuban exile community, and to Latin

Atericans, the U. S. determination to establish a

striking force symbolic of U. S. intent to overthrow the

present Cuban regime.

It would satisfy one of the principal desires expressed

by top Brigade leaders and would promote prestige and esprit

among its members. It would appear to be in consonance with

the statements and actions of the Administration in

connection with the future of the Brigade.

But it would inevitably become a focal point for

Cuban exile political activities in the Miami area, and

morale, discipline and esprit would be difficult to

maintain over the long term without early employment to

retake Cuba. It could generate domestic political and

military criticism by incorporating organized alien groups

in the U. S. armed forces reserve component. There is a

SECRET

risk that an impulsive, irrational act by Brigade members,

as members of the U. S. reserve forces, could be a source of

serious embarrassment to the U.S.

(3) Tailor a special civilian and military program

Ior Brigade members. Encourage the Brigade to continue

as a "fraternal" unit similar to the "Flying Tigers".

Encourage those Brigade members who enter the current

military training program for Cubans to establish a

Brigade military reserve component which other U.S.

militarily-trained Cubans could join.

Under existing authority, HEW could provide the

following additional benefits for Brigade members in

need, over and above those now offered: special employ-

ment counseling and placement service; extended student

loans to provide for all institutional costs such as

tuition, books, etc., even if this exceeds $1,000 per

year (living costs to be provided by another agency);

expanded vocational training in the Miani area; increased

financial assistance to needy persons while in training;

increased distribution of surplus food (with approval

of the Department of Agriculture).

The following additional programs could be under-

taken by HEW upon Presidential determination that such

action would contribute to the defense and security

of the United States or advance its foreign policy

interests: scholarship grants for students; loans for

vocational training anywhere in the United States; an

expanded training program similar to a G. I. Bill of

Rights, in the United States and/or abroad. The cost

of these

additional programs, assuming an expenditure

of $2,500 per person per year would be about $2.5 million.

-7-

Establishment of additional programs, after a

Presidential determination, would increase costs even

more, and be subject to wider criticism as "unnecessary"

privileges for Brigade members.

COORDINATORS'S RECOMMENDATION

1. I recommend course (3), a specially tailored

program for Brigade members.

2.

I recommend against a Presidential determination

providing broader privileges for Brigade members.

3. I recommend no change in existing U. S. military

training programs for Cubans, except that a Brigade reserve

unit should be authorized and other Cuban reservists should

be permitted to join.

4. I recommend that the Brigade be induced rather than

forced to accept this proposal, and intend to arrange

consultation with them immediately if this course of

action is approved.

Rationale

Lacking an immediate military use for the Brigade we

should disband the Brigade as such. Since we may, in the

future desire the presence in the U.. S.. Armed Forces of

militarily-trained Cubans, we should encourage Brigade:

members to enlist in the existing military training

program for Cubans and to enter a U. S. Reserve Unit

thereafter®

Our programs should be designed to encourage

the Brigade members to melt back into the exile

community and engage in constructive pursuits

pending the liberation of Cuba. We should offer

them some special assistance but not to the extent

that they become a perpetual privileged class

within the community: Presidential action on their

behalf would single them out unnecessarily.

I feel that the

statements of the vice director

of TASS as reported by

are a good

resume of the situation, i.e., a) Soviet leaders have for

some time felt perplexed with

regard to Castro's character

and person because he is reluctant to be "guided" docilely by

b) The USSR will continue to give all its economic

support to Cuba because otherwise its

prestige would suffer a

grave blow particularly in Latin America.

Also excluded, it appears to me, is the possibility that

she revolutionary regime of Castro can be changed into a

"Titost" regime.

It is comprehensible that,

reported, some

"non-aligned" countries and even some

Latin American countries desire such a change and are doing

everyching possible to provoke

It is also possible that

Cubins share these sentiments.

in my opinion, it

is impossible that such a change can take place while Castro

is in power.

so I pointed out in my previous report,

not in Castro's temperament to become

"non-aligned"

imitate anyone, and even less to take Tito as a model.

Cherefore Castro would have to be eliminated, and this

possibility seems very remote.

subversive propaganda in the whole continent, as demonstrated

by the fact that all the states of Latin America (including

Mexico, are taking strong measures against the dissemination

of this propaganda.

But it is doubtful that today Castro can

do much more and that he constitutes a real menace to the

security of other countries, if only because he lacks the

necessary funds.

I tend to share the opinion of the

Ambassador to Brazil that the Cuban leaders are trying to

concentrate all their subversive efforts in

one country, and

that they have selected Venezuela for various reasons, includ-

ing the uld ill feeling between Castro and Betancourt. I note

in passing that, according to what was told me by

during the recent meeting of the OAS the

It would certainly be highly desirable if a serious

pressure action on Cuba could be exercised within a durely

Latin American framework as pointed out by
