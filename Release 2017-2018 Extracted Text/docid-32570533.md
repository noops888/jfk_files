WALLACE SHANLEY, Miami, advised SA WILLIAM MAYO DREW,

that saubentor was being utilized as a source

prosecutable case.

on 7/27/63 Mr. SHANLEY was recontacted

relative to the interest of U. S. Customs in the cache

of explosives which was believed located at a house

near Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana.

Mr. SHANLEY

answered that the case was not workable from Miami

since the subjects at Miami might take no action for

an extended period, and Customs as a matter of policy

did not handle cases involving explosives wherein the

explosives would be under the control or within the

knowledge of Customs and at the same time present the

considerable danger which explosives constitute.

He

stated that the Customs Service makes every effort to

avoid being a party to the moving of explosives, as

when done by subjects of a case with knowledge of

Customs, and therefore he believed the matter of the

located

explosives

should be turned over to the local

authorities in Louisiana for seizure action.

on 7/26/63 MM 639-S advised that on that same

date he talked with SAM BENTON, of Miami Beach, and

BENTON Informed him that he had 2,500 lbs. of dynamite

in Mississipp1 which he would like to sell for TNT.

BENTON told the source that he would like to locate

B-25 and also American pilots. BENTON told the source

that the cubans with whom he is dealing did not truat (xle

that BENTON was In touch with his office,

for a plane and that the group intended to go

through with the raid on Cuba.

Mr. SHANLEY said he

believed that BENTON would inform his office if the

bombing operation was undertaken.

The foregoing information from MM 639-S

is not included in the body of the report inasmuch as

In interview of MIGUEL ALVAREZ on 8/1/62, he

stated that SAM BENTON's late model Pontlac, confiscated

by Customs at the time of the seizure of the plane and

whereas the Ford Thunderbird belonging to the aunt of

During the Interview of VICTOR ESPINOSA on

whom he bought the explosives.

told Customs to keep the car.

On 7/31/63 Mr. SHANLEY, Of U.S. Customs, stated
