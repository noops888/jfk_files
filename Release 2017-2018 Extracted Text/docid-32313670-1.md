DALLAS, TEXAS 75219

May 31, 1972

Catholic Senator M. Mansfield

U. S. Senate

Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Mansfield:

As a catholic and head of all official majorities -- church,

party and State for 16 years you are aware of the secret briefings

of priests, rabbis and preachers, by Billy Graham and Mr. Kissinger

in the White House. The briefings cover the secret policies of the

U. S. Senate.

Briefings work both ways -- State to church and church to State.

Dr. Criswell, from his pulpit, told Graham, Kissinger and the public,

after the briefing, that he had changed his position and beliefs on

State issues.

The constitution provides for freedom of religion, free beliefs

and speech, separate from the State.

You and your majorities with McGovern (supported by Vice-President

Humphrey and your coming Whip, Eddie K.) signed the Senate's Tonkin

Sea'd Declaration of War, directing the President' action. All sign-

ers are well aware of the statement in the document which says,

resolution shall expire when the President shall determine that the

peace and security of the area is reasonably assured by international

the are go reason

"This

conditions created by action of the United Nations."

This statement can be correctly paraphrased in a dozen different

ways to properly answer all questions about the bloody jungle war

in Asia - its beginning without public

and military support and its

ending in military retreat and defeat.

If it means what it says and what 80 signatures confirm, all

the diatribes and propaganda by senators and their booby tube

generals, are hog-wash regarding Vietnam and Israel.

Your explanation would be the official one since four presidents--

dead, assassinated,

ditched and rattling on, are too short-termed to

be consistent in the public's eye.

There are plans and consistency

and you would know them. All is not so incredible, but more serious-

with the shooting of a president and two presidential candidates.

I will be happy to help educate the public -- by distributing

your reply.

Sincerely,

Edwin A Hather

CAESAR

The only country in all of history with a Constitution that protects

freedom of religion and one's personal rights of belief and speech --, pro-

tecting them as the church separate from the State.

In return, not one of

500,000 priests, rabbis and preachers is protecting the Constitution - the

right of free beliefs and free speech.

(Add 75 as

the possible exception).

DI. Criswell with 40 pulpiteers, Dr. Elliott with 60 and DI. Wn. R.

Bright,

were given top secret briefings in the White House.

Criswell

made

the release that his group was briefed by Billy Graham and

Kissinger.

Do you go to

a church and tithe a pulpit that has not been briefed

in the White House? Why?

do for the

Chief of State, present and

future.

Police States have always briefed their State Pulpiteers. If they

did not go along they were, and are, defrocked.

Criswell, after the briefing, told Graham and Kissinger, for his

pulpit, and the public,

in a press

release,

that he had changed his views

on State issues -- describing the issues and the changes -- to so commit

and use his pulpit.

Graham who came, and went, from the White House, spending a week there

when IBJ was campaigning,

now has a permanent Washington suite in the White

House with Nixon.

He has much

in common with Khrushchev who said, "There

are not two parties in America."

CAESAR Caesars Ecumenicalization, then made the Ecumenicalized grab

of the Holy Land with his 500, 000 pulpiteers, armed with the Lord's return

and all the money that the pushers and suckers can part with.

He is the

same CAESAR that has destroyed every nation.

Pushers, suckers and Sunday

kneelers have the same conviction,

that of their pulpits, that all is Satan

and they are in the right place and pew. All is

not Satan but CAESAR.

Catholic Senator M. Mansfield, for 16 years, has controlled every

national official majority--church and State--the

US Senate coalition

catholics, jews, protestants, athiests and isms.

and incredibility,

as they are touted to be -- four presidents -- dead, assassinated,

and rattling on, are not what they are touted to be.

There is a plan and

consistency, the Mansfieldized ECU Senate -- "Crusade in Europe",

"Crusade

in Asia",

and "Crusade in the Mid-East"

With the ECU-ed Holy Land grab

a total military victory in six days, June 1967, came the complete change

of feathers exposing the bloody jungle war as the detoured-diversion from

the four foreign ECU tithed cities -- Rome, Tel-Aviv, Geneva and Moscow.

Marcus, Loeb and Rothchild, with their membership in tens of thou

"Israel is not a jewish State--not a State

of jews."

zionists,

with their membership in hundreds of thousands,

"Israel is a Jewish

State--a State of Jews."

No one has said that

Israel is of CAESAR -- the

land of ECU and its capitol Jerusalem--the land of the Balfor Treaty, the

UNO, Truman, NIXOn,

McGovern and Humphrey--the 5lst state protected by

their commitment of all youth and all weapons, of all the other s0 states.

Mansfield with his majority, to include

McGovern (with the support

of VP Humphrey

and the Whip to be, Kennedy)

signed the Senate's Tonkin

Declaration directing the President's action.. They signed what you read

in Section 3, directing:

"This resolution' shall expire when the President

shall determine that the peace and security of the area is reasonably

sured by international conditions created by action.of the United Nations."

Correctly para-phrased a dozen ways it gives the proper answer to all

questions about the bloody jungle war in Asia--its beginning without public

and military support and its ending in military retreat and defeat.

on top of, and among sub-standard people with no arms, abiding and abetting

pot, crime, arson, immorality,

"pigs", hi-jackings, yeace corps, Superstar,

no school prayer,

God is dead, Ecumanicalized revolution and its propitious

grab of the Holy Land -- who but CAESAR?
