Government protesting the detention in this capital 'of a Mexican

woman employed at the Cuban Embassy in the course of the

investigations surrounding the assassination of KENNEDY:

The above-mentioned note, the text of which was revealed

in Havana, was written in extremely violent terms. The

â€¢ Mexican Government does not contest the fact that the

employee was detained and a house search made on the say.

assassin had been here and had visited the Cuban Embassy as

the search in the home of the employee of the Cuban Embassy

was carried out with a certain brutality, which, moreover,

is usual in such cases here..: The aspect

Cuban Government

order of the official candidate for the Mexican presidency,

at the time still the Minister of the Interior, who, as I

reported in my
