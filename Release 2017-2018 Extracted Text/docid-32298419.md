PG 92-236

ADMINI STRATIVE:

On 7/27/71, PG878-C-TE advisen: 1

Yesterday SONNY

telephonically contacted

informant and said that KELLY MANNARINO wanted to see him.

Informant

met with MANNARINO at the latter's ranch in Allegheny

Township,

Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on the morning of

7/27/71.

MANNARINO said he has a friend "out west" who is in

trouble, and 'Timay have to help him."

MANNARINO wouldn't tell

informant anything more but merely insisted informant keep

himself instantly available to leave to "do a job" for this

unidentified friend ofhis.

MANNARINO said informant could

take along a partner of his own choosing or he could take

SONNY CIANCUTTI.

MANNARINO turned to CIANCUTTI and said,

"You go with him and get dirty; it's about time." Informant

has no additional information at this time.

MANNARINO then asked informant if he knew GALLO in

New York, and informant said he only knows what he reads about

GALLO in magazines.

MANNARINO asked if informant knew what

GALLO looks like, and informant said he has only seen magazine

photographs of GALLO.. MANNARINO then said, "He may come up

next;" and MANNARINO said no more.

From his conversation with MANNARINO, during which

he did not ask any questions since so doing would be

uncharacteristic, he can only surmise that MANNARINO may have

been talking about a "hit" for his friend "out west" or a

"muscle job" or a "burglary," but there is no

way of being

sure without more information. Informant will try to get

additional information from CIANCUTTI if possible.

PG T-2 is PG 1105-PC.

PHIL (LNU) and

FREDDIE (LNU), both from Indiana County

and the latter an official with the local of the Iron workers

Union.

Then he heard that BAZZANO was going into some sort of

a deal with PHIL to operate a hotel in that area.

Somebody

went to KELLY MANNARINO and falsely informed him that informant

had a silent piece of PHIL's share of the new venture and that

informant hoped BAZZANO was not going into the deal with the

idea of fleecing PHIL.

Shortly thereafter, MANNARINO brought

in BAZZANO, sat him down and told him that he should either

operate the hotel deal on the square or not go into it at all.

Reportedly, BAZZANO assured MANNARINO that his intentions were

strictly legitimate.

E. LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE

On January 25, 1971, PG T-3 advised:

GABRIEL "KELLY" MANNARINO reputedly owns 51% of a

firm known as Paragon Plastics in the New Kensington - Allegheny

River Valley area and the other owner is allegedly NEIL HAGEAL.

Some of associates of MANNARINO and individuals that work in

his organization are "SPEEDO" HANNA, who is a torpedo, and

also an individual known as "BAD EYE", who is married to

HAGEAL'S sister.

This information is just rumor among gamblers in

the New Kensington area, and it is known that when he is in

town, MANNARINO spends no time at Paragon Plastics and con-

tinues to actively operate Catoris Candies, Inc.

F. TRAVEL

On January 15, 1971, RAYMOND ECHEMENT, Deputy U.S.

Marshal, Pittsburgh, telephonically advised SA THOMAs G.

FORSYTH g

11!, that GABRIEL MANNARINO had just boarded United

Airlines Flight Number 905, which departed Pittsburgh at

9:00 a.m., Eastern Standard Time, en route to Ft. Lauderdale,

Fla.

He

Said MANNARINO, traveling under his own name, had

a male traveling companion, no description obtained, who was.

traveling under the name S. MANNARINO.

• It is noted that SAMUEL MANNARINO, subject's brother,

has been dead for about four years, and no other MANNARINO

is known to have a first name commencing with the letter "s."
