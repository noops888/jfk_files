in buying

this film through CI.

that MIKE COPPOLA of Miami

who 1s also worth a million or so dollars, is a "secret

partner' of LOU CHESLER's.

CI advised that COPPOLA owes a

favor to a friend of CI, in view of which CI had asked this

friend to have COPPOLA contact LOU CHESLER to ascertain

whether CHESLER might be interested in buying the f1lm.

MM: 722-C advised that while in New York City,

he and a friend had telephoned CHESLER's residence on Long

Island, asked to speak to CHESLER, but they were told that

CHESLER departed New York for Nassau, Bahamas Last week. wh

said that he understood from various sources around New York

City that CHESLER has been traveling between New .

York city?

and Nassau rather frequently during recent weeks, reportedly

having an interest in setting up some gambling casinos in

the Bahamas.

CI heard that the story had been circulated

around New York City that Princess MARGARET of England and

her husband ARMSTRONG JONES might come to the

permanently;

that both of then like "to play" and gamble;

and that CHESLER and others interested in setting up gambling

establishments there

feel that under these circumstances 1t

will be relatively easy to obtain permission to open

gambling casinos in Nassau and the Bahamas. While In New

York City, he also heard that LOU CHESLER would be in Miami

Beach next week (week of May 14, 1901), and although he has

not heard definitely from his friend who was to contact

COPPOLA, CI expects to learn when CHESLER arrives in the

Miami area and where he will be staying.

CI said that LOU CHESLER formerly had an apartment

and

stayed at the Harbor Island Spa, had one or more

automobiles available at all times, and in the past had

kept a large boat docked at the pier at the Harbor Island

Spa.

MM 675-C advised on January 20, 1961, that he the

informant made bond for all the individuals arrested in the

gambling raid on December 14, 1960, at the Mid-Town Social

Club and further MICHAEL COPPOLA paid him $770.00 cash from

a large roll of bills he had to cover the bonds of all

those arrested in the club.

The informant advised that as far as he knows he

and COPPOLA are the only two that know COPPOLA actually

paid for these bonds, although, some individuals suspect

COPPOLA.
