1. As per reference D Heddquarters concurs in chis program and has offered

to forward requirements If JMWAVE so desires. Since this approval was obtalned

from Headquarters, I have taken the following steps: (A) requested and obtained

some requirements

from IS to be used. in this program and (B) through PASSAVOY

have requested

some basic informalion as to specific facilities for use in this

program. AMBUD-1 is to advise us on the following matters: if the Hotel Monroe,

fer, which AMBUD receives approximately $800 per month, has space available for

AMBUD-1 has,

the group members of AMBUD to each appoine

useful information and to make AMBUD a useful organization with a purpose in mind--

& purpose wich a practical and visible ends. AMBUD is a large organization composed

of a númberc8hbifeups and Individuals which also has affiliates who are rot actual

this vast reserve of manpower, there is every reason to believe competent

interrogators can be found, although most of them would naturally need training in

Interrogation and reporting

techniques, which factor can be surmounted. In addition

to the AMBUD personnel supply, there is also a vast, untouched number of sources tar

of information

1a the WAVE area. For example, part of each plane load shie uf exiles

which arrives from CUba is

released by Imigration; the remainder (about 2/3) are

sent to CAC. Of that number all are screened at CAC and about ½ are actually

Interrogated

at CAC due

the lack of personnel to handle any more cases. In tha

ramale addicion, no

women arriving from Cuba are interrogated at CAC. Therefore,

the number of

persons who are potential sources of information avallable to AMBUD

would be approximately 2/3 of all tcose arriving from Cuba, plus all the women.

As a result, I plan to make up

a chart,or table of organization, of an actual

interrogation center for this purpose,

In addition, I will make an estimate

of any addidonal expenses which might be involved in the near future. Since I

have had actual KUBARK

experiance in an interrogation center, I believe I am

at least somewhat. qualified to make certain suggestioas. (FYI: in the

KU BARK/

Interrogation Center created for the interrogation of

repatriates from the USSR, I was chief of the CE Section. In additdon, l'trained

4. An interrogation center of the type I have in mind, after serious consideration

of the personnel, facilities and sources available to AMBUD,

should put AMBUD on

the operational map, so to speak, and should also do credit to JAVE. This centert

would dot be in opposition to, or in competition wich CAC, since the sources tapped

would be those they are not physically able to handle and the women who now are

under no one's jurisdiction for such masturs purposes.

5. At your convenience I woulfilike the opportunity to discuss cals program

with you and to also talk about the/requirements for passing to AMBUD.
