1 - Mr. RoSaCK

A source of the Bureau who is serving as

Public

Relations Director for Robert M. Shelton,

Imperial Wizard,

Den

United Klans of America, InC., Knights of the Ku Klux Klan,

has furnished information obtained by him during his contacts

with Shelton.

According to Shelton, about two weeks before the

assassination of former President John F. Kennedy, he was

in contact with James Venable, a leader of another Klan

organization.

Venable told Shelton that he was in contact.

with Lee Oswald and that Oswald had been active in some

bombings in Alabama.

Venable offered the services of Oswald

to Shelton and stated he could be used by both groups.

Shelton stated he declined Venable's offer and that this

declination was made in the presence of Calvin Craig (Grand

Dragon of Shelton's organization) and Bob Thömpson (Vice

President of Shelton's organization and a racial informant).

Shelton also stated that according to Venable, Oswald was in

Atlanta, Georgia, at a time when former President John F.

Kennedy

was scheduled to speak before a Georgia Tech group.

This speaking engagement was canceled and he did not appear

in Atlanta; however, there was some picketing activity in

Hurt (phonetic) Park, Atlanta, and the source got the impression

the Atlanta newspapers at this time contained information or

& photograph that will prove Oswald was in Atlanta at that time.

Shelton further claims that he saw a registration card for

Oswald while he was staying in one of the Marriott Motels in

Atlanta.

Shelton told his Attorney,

Lester Chalmers,

touch with Congressman Edwin D.

Willis, Chairman of the abo

to get

captioned Committee.

According to our

Chalmers cor

tacted Congressman Willis and arranged to meet him in. New Orleans

on the evening of 11-5-65. Chalmers intends to present

Shelton's story to Willis but not to make any recommendations

to Willis as to what he should do. If Willis wants to talk

personally with Shelton, he will make him available

at the

time and place set by Willis.

Memorandum to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE:

HOUSE COMMITTEE ON UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES

KLAN INVESTIGATIONS

SAC, Ponder of the Atlanta Office advised on 11-5-65

that Robert Thompson,

our informant, stated that no meeting

such as Shelton described ever took place. SAC Ponder further

advised that at the time of President Kennedy's death, there

were numerous

allegations that Oswald had been in Atlanta

and these allegations were given considerable newspaper

publicity.

The allegations were thoroughly and completely

investigated by the Bureau and found to be false.

believed Shelton was aware of the newspaper publicity con-

cerning Oswald being in Atlanta; therefore, he concocted

the above story.

It is to be noted that Shelton according

to 'a Washington Field source believes Venable is furnishing

information to captioned Committee concerning his (Shelton's)

organization.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of

the above, no action should be taken in

this matter®
