"My Adored Turrocckka:

"I received your letter from Washington and the one

you wrote me when you returned to New York.

I received them

today, and one bears the date of the 7th, thus it took 10 days

when It should have taken 3 at the most, it is a scandal and a

shame.

But we can only tolerate the law of the stronger. I

have received notices from Washington and they are very

pessimistic.

It seems there have been persons who have made

declarations against you and have sworn, Gringo style, to their

declarations. Also they do not forget your expressions and

opinions, that you have foolishly and unwittingly made so

many times in public.

And it seems that all of those personages,

high personages, to whom you used to say you were related, have

said these were your lies, and that they deny being your

relatives even remotely, nor do they even care for being your

friends.

How much I regret this life of mine and the bad part

1s I do not know if 1t will have a solution or when. I do not

know what to say or to whom to turn.

"I am completely certain that the friends whom I have

trusted the arranging of this matter are true friends of mine

and

that they have done with complete sincerity and interest

all that is necessary.

You already see how I was able to

obtain your permit to enter Mexico, when there exists a

Presidential Decree strictly prohibiting the entry (to Mexico)

of all European aliens.

But the matter of Washington is beyond

my reach and only you,

asking for a conscientious investigation

and asking them to clarify your situation, only you can get

something.

If you continue patiently enduring your situation

in the United States then detained you are. Now that they will

not let you leave there, you are playing the part of a coward

or culprit. Firmly demand that they show you what gives them

and if they do not have the right

that they tet reu leave that country and let you go wherever

you please.

It seems that neither do they like your economic

situation,

that is to say that you do not receive income from

employment business and naturally the poor things cannot obtain

from you the corresponding taxes.

I think that is the only

reason for they do not have the right, nor is it their business,

"If your income 1s from practicing the noble profession of

gigo1o or hiring yourself as a Sodomist. I am sad and furious,

and disconcerted. I could come to join you there or at least

we could spend some two or three months together. From the

Embassy (Mexican in Washington) they will give me telephonically

the visa and airplane priority. This they have promised me

formally, but unfortunately my economic

situation at the present,.

what with the construction of the house

and the payment I have

just made for the College will not permit me to be able to make

the trip to spend a few months with you, something which I

desire with all the forces of my body and sould, and which would

make me very happy. But I am seeing if soon they pay me a

mortgage, and my adored if I have a l1ttle money I will go to

give you

all my life in my kisses. If you could see how unhappy

I feel.

I cry so much thinking that even the 'Morito' has

the happiness of being with you, unless in his ignorant brutality

he should know the happiness he has, and of which I am so

cruelly deprived. I kiss you a thousand times, adored, write

me and love me.

My adored one, light of my eyes, I want you desperately,

"Baby mine, I am now ready to have a son by my

wonderful man that you are, but yesterday over the telephone

you asked me this with such seriousness and urgency, that

really I do not know what to do.

While you tell me that you

little woman turn (or

go) crazy when you make her yours, I

eight years of being married.

happen to me, but no matter, life of mine, what better proof

could I give you of my love, than to die for you, suffer unto

death?

"My adored one, when you have the money for me, please

•deposit It in the Bank of Julio Beache on Wall Street, deposit

1t in my name, telling them to communicate by direct wire with

the Leishman Bank here in Mexico, and put at my disposal here,

Immediately, the amount that you deposited there, that way I

can receive it the same day.

"You know, that you should not be surprised that the

ambassador does not answer you, nor will he answer you, I will

explain later the reasons, but two or three days ago,

I sent

him a letter, like the ones I can write when I want to, and I

am certain that I am going to make him ashamed of his conduct,

after all he offered me here.

In the first place,

I am certain

that Duhart has influenced him with his black opinion of you

that he has, I do not know why, and in the second place there

are certain

personal and egotistical motives that make him act

like a fool, like there was nothing he could do to arrange it.

I do not think that they will giver you a permit to leave,

I again insist that you do not need it.

If you accept my

suggestion, which I

assure you is a good one, for I have all

my documents in order, the line of conduct you should take is

to go to the Mexican Consulate, that they may give you documents

to enter here and calmly leave the United States. Several

persons in the same circumstances as you, have lately done this,

so heed my advice.

Naturally in Washington they told you you

needed this departure permit, but they told you this only to

cause you trouble and complications, for they know very well

that they are not going to give it to you and want to laugh at

you, when you ask for this permit to refuse you, when they know

perfectly well that you can leave the United States without

needing this permit.

In any case, the Polish Ambassador should

complain as to why and with what right they are detaining you

there.

seemed to have any real love for any of them. He was very

interested sexually in the daughter of one of his wives.

nothing regarding her beliefs or convictions.

His mother was a "pure white Russian" who died

youth in Russia.

During their Abilene days especially, LA I-4

and MOHRENSCHILDT discussed politics frequently. LA I-4

stated,

"There is no doubt concerning the strong pro-communist

convictions of GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT. " He is an opportunist

and without moral scruples.

He has contempt for the American

way of life and for capitalism and has stated that he appreciates

the security derived from a communist government.

of these discussions in Abilene, LA T-4 told MOHRENSCHILDI

that if the United States ever

would get a gun and "take care,goes to war with Russia, he

stated that if this country is ever invaded by Russia, he

would have a very good chance of coming into a top position

with the Russians.

activity, but considers him Intellectually shallow and

Incapable of originating or executing a complicated scheme.
