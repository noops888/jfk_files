She advised that she answered the telephone at her apartment

when CHARLES WHITE called to invite her roommate MAR&L7N

MILLER to dinner and since MARILYN was not present at the

time the subject invited the PCI to dinner.

During the course of dinner subject mentioned to

his brother that in the event Patsy's Restaurant became too

well-known as a place they frequented they would in the future

frequent La Scala Restaurant, (142 West 54th St., NYC).

The above information is not being included in the

body of the report in order to protect the identity of the

PCI.

Liaison has been established with Deputy Chief

Inspector JOHN J. BRADI (NA), Commanding Officer of the

Criminal Intelligence Bureau, NYCPD. The next time that

the subject visits NYC Inspector BRADT expects to obtain

confidential coverage of TOURINE, his associates and activities.

The results of all information received will be furnished

to the NYo.

Further all background information on out-of-

town subscribers to telephone numbers called by TOURINE while

recently in NYC will be furnished to Inspector BRADT.

A copy of this report is being furnished to the

Salt Lake City Office and WFO because in the past TOURINE

has visited Las Vegas, Nevada and also he is reportedly an

associate of JOSEPH FRANCIS NESLINE of Washington, DC.

'In

addition, while TOURINE was in NYC he made telephone calls

to NESLINE's home telephone and to his gambling club.
