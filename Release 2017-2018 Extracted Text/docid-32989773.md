Shortly alter arriving in Miami, 1

a highly placed extremist source, in the Miami Division, and

continued in this assignment until the Fall of 1961.

related the following information to the investigators to

the best of my recollection.

Sommersett was discontinued in late 1961 for his

personal safety and possible embarrassment to the Federal

Bureau of Investigation.

Sommersett was characterized as a

source who had furnished reliable information in the past

and, in addition, had furnished information which could not

be verified or corroborated.

Sommersett's work for the

Federal Bureau of Investigation covered a span of twelve to

Iourteen years, having started out in New Orleans Division

where he furnished information on White Slavery and local

police corruption. He later worked out of the charlotte

DiVision Iurnishing Intormation on criminal matters and

Klan activities in the eastern part of the North and South

Carolinas. Following his work in the Charlotte Division,

Sommersett came to the Miami Division where he furnished

some criminal information, possible violations of labor

to various states in the southeast including Georgia,

and leaders of White Hate

After Sommersett was discontinued, he continued

to furnish information that he felt was of interest to

the Federal Bureau of Investigation even though he was

never reimbursed for this information.

Contact with the Federal Bureau of Investigation

was initiated by sommersett and as time passed he initiated

fewer and fewer contacts. After Sommersett had been dis

continued he notified the Federal Bureau of Investigation

about a group responsible for the bombing at the home of

Donald Shoemaker, Editor of the "Miami Herald". This

information was furnished to the Miami Police Department

and Sommersett was placed in contact with the Intelligence

Unit of the Miami Police Department who continued the

bombing investigation, utilizing Sommersett and other

sources.

This later resulted in the prosecution and

conviction of two individuals involved in the bombing.

The Miami Police Department continued to use

Sommersett on extremist matters, including trips they sent

him on to other states. The extent of the information

developed by Sommersett and subsequently furnished to

the Miami Division is not clear.

Some information was

furnished; however, there was a

feeling that the Miami

Police Department was reluctant

• to furnish information

developed by Sommersett since they were utilizing him

outside of their jurisdiction.

The investigators were primarily interested in

information developed by Sommersett on or about April 3,

1968, in washington, D.C., to the effect that Martin Luther

King was to be assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. I do

not recall having received this information from the

Miami Police Department or Sommersett.

I vaguely recall

that something to this ellect did come up later, but 1

am unable to put it in any time frame and why I only

exhibited to me a memorandum, dated April 25, 1968, from

Sergeant Sapp of the Miami Police Department

Headley of the Miami Police Department. This memorandum

related a call from Sommersett to Sergeant Sapp on or

about April 4, 1968, reporting on Sommersett's trip to

Washington, D.C., where he learned of a plot to assassinate

Martin Luther King. The memorandum goes on to state that

the Miami Police Department sent Sommersett to Atlanta,

Georgia, to make contact with White Hate Groups in an

effort to develop additional information on the assassination

of Martin Luther King•

I do not recall having previously

seen this memorandum or if a copy was furnished to the

Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Following the interview, I was advised that I

would be notified in the event I am needed to testify at

an open hearing in Washington, D.C., before the House

Select Committee on Assassinations.

INTERVIEW OF

SPECIAL AGENT DAVID N. JELLISON

On March 29, 1978, I, David N. Jellison, Special

Agent with the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, was interviewed by Richard C. Wrose,

Mark spelser, and Wendy Collins, investigators, and

Peter G. Beeson, Staff Counsel, for the United States House

of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations.

This interview took place at the House of Representatives

• Select Committee Office Building, Washington, D.C.

At the outset, I identified myself as a Special

Agent of the federal Bureau of Investigation and I alsoed

names and titles of the interviewing officials.

furnished my date of birth, Social Security Number, and general

background information relating to my FBI career to date.

specifically furnished the date I commenced my assignment in

the Miami Division as June 1966. Upon arriving in Miami, I was

assigned to the investigation of civil rights and extremist

matters as they

existed in the Miami Division at that time.

In this regard, I was assigned to handling the Martin Luther King

murder investigation as leads developed in the Miami Division

in 1968 ::

I was asked to comment on any contact I had with

discontinued prior to my arrival in Miami due to his unstable

behavior and to avoid possible embarrassment to the Bureau.

I am of the opinion that for some years prior to 1966,

Sommersett had furnished reliable information to the Bureau

relating to both extremist and criminal matters. Any direct

contact I had with Sommersett was initiated by Sommersett,

and any information developed as a result was accepted at

face value and either verified or discredited, as the case

may have been.

1 on one know to

To my knowledge, Sommersett was not paid

for any information he furnished to the FBI during my tenure

handling extremist matters.

Whatever contact the Miami Police Department had

with Sommersett is unknown to me with the exception of a

bombing matter which fell under the jurisdiction of the Miami

Police Department and of which Sommersett apparently had

direct knowledge.

I was shown a memorandum by the House of

Representatives interviewing officials which was allegedly

written by an Officer Sap of the Miami Police Department on

April 25, 1968, to Chief of Police Headley, wherein Officer

Sap stated he had developed information from Sommersett on

April 3, 1968 indicating that Martin Luther King would be

killed in Memphis, Tennessee. I never met Officer Sap and

never saw this memorandum.

I do not recall Sommersett or

any Miami Police Department official relating any of the

Information contained in this memorandum to me.

Prior to the conclusion of this interview, I was

asked about several names which were unknown to me and was

interrogated about any knowledge I might have regarding an

FBI "Cointell" (phonetic) Program as it pertained to the Miami

Division. I have no knowledge of this program in the Miami

Division or anywnere else in the Bureau.

At the conclusion of the interview, I was advised

that I would be notified of any further inquiries in this

matter wherein my presence or testimony would be necessary.
