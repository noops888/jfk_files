Memorandum for the Attorney General

NOTE CONTINUED:

Inspector J.A. Sizoo contacted SAC Atlanta on

6/21/66, instructing that this technical surveillance

coverage be discontinued immediately. It was discontinued

at 1:00 p.M., 6/21/66.

The Attorney General's notation concerning Hosea

Villiams refers to an Interstate Transportation of Stolen

Motos

Vehicles case under investigation by the Bureau

wherein the principal subjeci Harold Belton Andrews alleges

he stole four automobiles for subsequent sale to the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference headed by Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI.:

It was developed by investigation one of these

stolen vesicles had been in the possession of Hosea Williams

who is the Director of Voter Registration for King's

organization.

Due to the ramifications involving the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference and the civil rights movement,

the Criminal Division of the Department has been directing the

prosecution in this case rather than the U.S. Attorney.

Following presentation of the case to a Federal Grand

Jury by

Departmental attorneys Andrews and one other person were

indicted, however, Hosea Willians was not indicted.

As the Bureau is aware, several highly confidential

sources

have furnished extremely valuable information

concerning captioned matter in regard to the southern Christian

Leadership

Conference (SCLC), 334 Auburn Avenue, N. E.,

Atlanta.

Recent information strongly suggests that a

number of changes in SCLC personnel and modification of that

organization's facilities tend to curtail information

available to the aforementioned sources.

The Bureau is requested to authorize Atlanta to

conduct an appropriate survey in regard to SCLC's current

facilities in order to determine changes which have occurred

and in what manner the productivity of Atlanta sources may

be increased.

The requested survey will be conducted with full

security. Appropriate recommendations will be made at the

• On 11/8/63, a technical surveillance was instituted

on the headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference, 330 Auburn Avenue, N.F., Atlanta, Georgia, a

civil rights organization headed by Martin Luther king, Jr.

Its purpose was to determine communist influence on the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference and King. It

Re:

• LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

100-438794

December, 1965

August,

1965

July, 1965

At the behest of a representative of the

American Committee on Africa, an

organization interested in African

political affairs, King ordered a tele-

gram be sent to the President over his

signature advocating an embargo be placed |

on shipments of oil

to Rhodesia.

During a conversation with one of his

associates, King discussed some of his

plans in connection with his scheduled

conference on 8/31/65 with United States

Ambassador to the United Nations

Arthur J. Goldberg.

During another conversation, there were

reférences to statements made by King

in private concerning a conference he

had with the President the preceding

week

OBSERVATIONS:

King is the foremost civil rights figure in the country

and has an international following.

A number of his key advisors

as well as some officers in the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference have been Communist Party members or affiliated with

other subversive organizations.

This surveillance indicates the

extent of intluence being exerted on King by these individuals.

It reveals the part these individuals play in policy-making

decisions with King; assistance which they render King in his

writings and speeches; and the advice and counsel they give King

in his declarations concerning United States foreign policy.

RECOMMENDAT ION:

In order that the Bureau may carry out its responsi-

oilities on uncovering.

and disseminating all information

indicating communist influence in racial matters, including the

increasing tendency to merge peace issues with civil rights,

it is mandatory that we maintain coverage of King.

Thus, it is

recommended this technical

surveillance be retained.

SAC Roney advised that the New York

Office had for monitoring purposes the availability of Rooms 2439

and 2441.

In view of the nature ot the discussion which King was

scheduled to have in New York with_Clarence Jones and Harry Wachtel,

it was felt the results of the discussion would contain considerable

intelligence information. New York said that through other informa-

tion which they haye developed, it appears the meeting will actually

be. held in Wachted'sfoffice, but New York still strongly recommended .

use of microphone coverage in the rooms occupied by King's party

as the results of the meeting in Wachtel's office would later be

discussed in the hotel rooms.

In view of king's continued contact with (Clarave Jones,

who is King's conduit for contact with communist Stanley Levison

and'in view of other activities of King, it is considered highly

desirable that New York place microphone coverage on these rooms

if this can be done with full security. Roney/assured me full

security would be available land that the individuals involved will be

under physical surveillance so the microphone installation could be

made during the conference in Wachtel's office.] New York contemplated

use of two asp instruments, which would not involve running wires out

of the rooms and which instruments can be installed with full security.

ACTION:

Under the circumstances, I authorized New York to go ahead

vith the installation provided it could be done with full security

relating to communist influences on the racial Situation in the

United States.

King, as far as the general public is concernea,

is one of the outstanding civil rights leaders. It is felt that

this installation should be continued.

fue

This installation has in the past turnished

considerabler

information regarding the influences upon King and the SCLC by/

individuals-_connected.with the communist movement

A great deal f

of this information has not been available from other sources. It

is extremely urgent that such information continue to be available

to the Bureau, particularly in view of King's prominence in the

civil rights field and his contacts with high Govermment officials.

The Bureau's

responsibility in obtaining such information cannot

We are currently conducting intensified investigations

on the SCLC and King because of these communist influences.

An

example of valuable information obtained was information indicating

that King was to unleash a public"attack upon the Director in April!

Another example is that information was obtained indicating

that the SCIC was attempting to have a woman allegedly employed by

President Johnson intercede with the President to have the Director

issue a public statement to the effect that the SCLC and King were

not influenced by_communists.J Intelligence

e being received from this

source

does not

involve matters being considered for prosecution.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the above installation be continued.

coverage of Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)

convention to be held at Savannah, Georgia, 9/29-10/3/64 and

in particular activities of Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., leader

of the SCLC.

Savannah recommends authority be granted to install

such coverage for the purpose of determining the extent of

communist infiltration or influence in the racial movement.

King will occupy a suite in the Manger Hotel, Savannah,

Georgia, consisting of rooms 901 and 902. Room 903 has also

been reserved for an aid to king. It is expected that conterences

with King at the hotel will be held in room 901 which is a sitting

room. Savannah expects to obtain the coverage from room 1002 which

is located directly above room 901. The floor on which room 1002

is located consists mostly of Salesmen's sample rooms and sleeping

rooms are assigned on this floor only when necessary. Savannah

advised that security can be assured.

Coverage will be required for four days and three nights

/ and will be effected by radio communication with no visible connection

between the two rooms.

It is expected that attempts will again be made to exert

influence upon the SCLC and in particular on King by communists.

Such coverage is desirable and it is expected that valuable infor-

mation will be obtained relating to this investigation.

The SCLC

lis currently under investigation to determine the extent of

communist infiltration, domination, and/or control.

Since this

communist influence has in the past been exerted mainly upon king,

such coverage is extremely important 26a a in 27:=

Reconmendation by Assistant Director:

(If this surveillance involves cryptanalysis, include statement that decrypted material is or is not sufficiently

important to continue decrypting.)

AT 1384-SuaAT 1385-S* and A 1386-S* are technical

surveillances covering activities of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC) at 330 Auburn Avenue, N. E.,

Atlanta, Georgia.

These are actually additional lines installed

to supplement other coverage of the SCIC.

Original authoriza-

tion was given by the Attorney General 10/21/63 for this

coverage.

The 'SCLE and its leader, Martin Luther King, JX.,

are subjects of intensified bureau investigations since it

has been determined that communists and communist sympathizers are

exerting a great deal of influence over this organization.

Since these additional lines have been installed

they have provided extremely valuable information regarding

the scic and the activities of King This information includes

SCIC involvement in civil rights matters; travel plans of king;

plans of the SCIC regarding training civil rights workers;

complete itinerary of King's trip to Amsterdam, Holland; con-

tacts of King with female companions; and information concerning

forthcoming SCLC convention to be held at Savannah, Georgia,

In view of the above, it is recommended that these

additional lines be continued since they have furnished

extremely valuable information since authorized. Justifica-

tion for these additional lines will henceforth

be handled in

connection with other installations in operation.

SECURITY MATTER - C

540

I received a telephone call Friday, 8/21/64, from SAC

• Bachman concerning technical coverage on King

in Atlantic City.

You had previously instructed that he explore

the possibilities

of putting technical and microphone coverage on him there.

Bachman advised that he had made a preliminary security

check and that suitable reliable contacts were available at the

hotel which would make possible a microphone inscallation, thouga

it might be necessary to take the hotel,

manager into contidence

to the extent of identifying King

as the individual in whom they

were interested. Bachman advised that as to the technical

installation, a

preliminary check revealed this could be done.

He noted that

a suite of 3 rooms had been set aside at the Claridge

for the use of King and others traveling with him.

ACTION:

I told Bachman to go ahead with the microphone

installation it this coula be

that

interest in king, and that neither the manager/hor anyone else

would have knowledge of the nature of the coverage.

I further

pointed out that it would be necessary that Newark be in a

position to assure full security from a technical point of view.

I also authorized Bachman to go ahead on the telephone

installation provided this could be done with full security.

It should be noted in this connection ve already have authority

from the Attorney General to cover any residence which King may

use with a technical telephone installation.

By letter dated 6/30/64 the Atlanta Office requested

on the facilities of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

providing additional coverage

or the SCLC and its leader Dr.

Martin

Luther King, Ji.

Il approved, Atlanta desires to utilize

SA William F. Kusch of the Miami Office to installthese surveillances.

Atlanta also requested 2 recorders for use in conjunction with these

installations.

On 10/21/63 the Attorney General approved

installation of

tesurs on the SCiC at its current address or at any

future address

to which it may move.

There are currently 4 tesurs

in operation on

the SCLC which were installed 11/8/63. With the addition of the

additional surveillances there would be in operation a total of y

Itesurs.

The 3 additional surveillances are desirable to provide

coverage of additional telephone service recently secured by the ScLC.

are subjects of

intensified Bureau investigations inasmuch as

The SCLO and Martin Luther King, it has been determined

• that comunists and communist sympathizers exert a great deal of

influence over this organization; The 4 surveillances already in

operation have provided extrenaly valunble informacion regarding te

activities of the SCLC and King, nuch of which is not available through

The surveillances have been most yaluable in

another out easie comest tiltration and donination of

both ung and the BCLC.l

Atlanta desires to utilize SA Kusch to install these

additional surveillances, it approved, since the Agent trained for

this purpose in the Atlanta Office is known to ling as well as other

, employees of the SCLC and full security can be assured only through

having an Agent unknown in the Atlanta area handle the installation.

'SA Kusch has handled matters of this type in the past.

RE:

COMMUNIST PARTY, USA

NEGRO QUESTION

COMUNIST INFLUENCE IN RACIAL MATTERS

100-3-116

Atlanta anticipates that the services of an additional

investigative clerk will be required during normal office hours of.

the SCLC to insure full coverage in the event the additional tesurs

are authorized.

..:=

OBSERVATIONS:

Since the Attorney General has already authorized technical

coverage of the SCLC and, King,

additional authority is not necessary

since this is merely an extension of current coverage brought about

by additional telephone service within the SCLC.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That the attached letter to the Atlanta Office be

approved advising that additional coverage requested is authorized

and that the Atlanta Office will be advised by separate communication

concerning the utilization of SA lusch to handle the installation and

the additional equipment requested from the Laboratory.

2^ That this memorandum be referred to the Administrative

Division for a determination as to whether SA Kusch is available and

to: the Laboratory in order that the equipnent requested may be

furnished to the Atlanta Office.. It is suggested that the Administrative.

Division coordinate its findings regarding the availability of sa kusch

with the

Auburn Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia. Authorized 10/15/63;

installed 11/3/63.

During the past three

months this surveillance has

continued to supply a large volume of extremely valuable

Information concerning the ScIC and its leader, Martin Luther

King,

JI., who are the subjects of intensified

Bureau inves

tigation because of communist influences bearing upon he

organization and ling.

Examples: On 3/22/64, 6/1 and 26/64

Information received concerning travel plans of King and

other SCIC people. On 3/30/64 and 4/21/64 vital informa-

tion obtained concerning association between King, aid

Stanley David Levison, an extrenely close communist advisor.

On 4/14,15,28/64 and 6/1/64 information obtained concerning

financial operations of the sCIC. On 4/7764 advance inior-

mation obtained concerning King's presence at a Chicago

civil rights rally in Juney 1964 On 4/24/64 information Ob-

tained concerning a conversation between King and his secre-

tary regarding King's puntic attack on the Director.

On

5/13,22/64 and 6/6,10/04 information obtained concerning

activities and plans of the SCIC in connection with the

St. Augustine, Morida, racial situation.

On 6/25/64 we

learned that an SCIC officer was actompting to have a woman

allegedly employed by President Johnson intercede with the

President to have the Director male a public statement that

the Scic and ling are not influenced by conmunists.

The continuing heavy flow or extremely valuable

intelligence iron this source indicates the desirability

of continuing this source for

an additional three-mouth

period.

This is recommended.

Re Bureay routing slip dated 3/20/64, questioning

slip is attached and there is also attached a,copy

of an aintel from San Francisco to the Bureau dated 2/25/64,

setting forth in chronological order the events which occurred

on this special assignment in Honolulu, the difficulties over-

come, and the reasons for the various expenditures made.

The purpose of this present memorandum is to further

explain the nature of some of the expenditures and the reasons

therefor.

It must be understood, that the five Agents involved

in this special assignment were under instructions that under

no circumstances could they be "made" by the Subject and members

of his party, and that under no circumstances could they be

identified by the Subject and his party or anybody acting on his

behalf as FBI Agents.

At the conference in Assistant Director Sullivan's

Office on 2/3/64, based upon the previous experience of the

Washington Field Office at the Willard Hotel under somewhat

similar circumstances, it was agreed that for effective operation,

it was necessary

to survey the construction of the hotel building

involved as fan in advance as possible in order to determine the

effectiveness of our technical equidment. It was also agreec

that if at all

possible it would be necessary to get rooms adjacent

to the subject's in order that our technical transmitting equip-

ment be most effective.

Based upon the experience of the

Washington Field Office, it was planned that "towers" or listening

Inests be set up in hotel.roons next to the subject and that once

the Arents were put in these

towers they were to stay there to

provide security for the equipment, to provide security for

themselves (so they would not be seen), and that one or more of

them ordinarily would leave the room only when the Subjects

were known to be out of their room or were sound asleed.

This

practice was followed in Honolulu and the rooms rented were

definitely not for the personal convenience of the Agents and

were occupied under the conditions outlined above.

As seen beginning in the last paragraph on page 3 of

the attached copy of the airtel, it was extremely difficult.

SAS HARRY F. CLIFFORD, JR.

and FORDYCE G. LYMAN even

get into the Hawaiian Hilton Village Hotel where the Subject

was to be quartered in order to experiment with

the equipment.

As noted on pages 4

and 5 of the attached airtel, it appeared

for a time as if it would be impossible to obtain space immediately

next to the Subjects and, therefore, when SAs ALBERT P. CLARK,

ROBERT U. MANN, and RICHARD E. STEPHENS arrived in Honolulu on

Saturdays 2/15/64, a room was obtained for them as close to the

the Subject was eventually to be quartered as

Confidential Bureau equipment was put into that room,

experimented with, and guarded in the same manner as noted above.

When information was received that the Subjects were

going to eventually move to the Kahala Hilton Hotel a new problem

presented itself.

SAC PRICE of the Honolulu Office explained

that this was the newest, most expensive, and most luxurious

hotel in the Hilton Chain.

On 2/13/64, SAs CLIFFORD and LYMAN determined that it

would be necessary to make a survey of the construction, room lay-

out, etc. of the Kahala Hilton Hotel with special emphasis on

so-called "common walls" in which the electrical and telephonic

installations on rooms side by side backed into each other. They

went out to the hotel with the

plan that one would try to

appear

as a guest of the hotel who was meeting the other as a

friend

of the guest. On arrival at the hotel they determined that the

vast ornate lobby was totally unoccupied, that the halls had

little or no traffic in them, and that the hotel had as its

guests wealthy

one time of his first view of the lobby and public views of

In carrying

out their plan, therefore, they

One would go up in an elevator, prowl the halls

discreetly as much as possible, looking for an open door where

a maid was making up the room and saunter into the room,

This same technique was

no have a den nether three Agents arrived and this accounts

ion the expenditures on 2/13, 16, and 11/64, which we believe

were fully justified in order to

maintain discretion, elude

the security force we knew to be at the hotel, and still

prepare ourselves for what we knew would be a tough nut to crack.

Page 6 of the attached airtel sets forth the infor-

mation that the

principal Subject was located in Room 405 of the

ocean tower building of the Hawaiian Village Hotel and also

occupied Room 404 for members of his party. Room 405 was a

corner room with balconies on two sides.

Room 406, which was

occupied by Agents, was on one side and Room 403, which was also

occupied by Agents, was on the other side of Room 404. All of

latter rooms

had one balcony each on the outside of the

building. It was necessary to rent these rooms for official

business and occupy them at all times on a 24-hour basis, not

only to protect our equipment, but to effect the actual

installations made.

The five Agents involved were spread very thin inasmuch

as at no time were Rooms 404 and 405 left unassigned to

occupants.

Both these two rooms were occupied when the Agents

were ablelto get rooms

along side them and there was actually

an overlap in technical occupancy due to the time element before

the previous occupants got out and the subject and his party

moved in. Therefore, the installations had to be made while the

:

rooms were technically occupied, but in the absence of the

actual occupants.

The very limited manpower was deployed as

The two technical Agents entered Room 405 and made

the actual installations. One Agent stood on a chair inside

the door of Room 406 and viewed the hall leading from the

elevators through the Jalousie transom.

on a chair inside Room 403. and looked

balcony leading to an outside stairway in the other direction.

The fifth Agent was in the lobby near the house telephone in

an attempt to give warning should the Subjects head for one of

the many elevators or the stairway.

The service provided by this hotel in this crowded

resort area is quite different than encountered in a continental

Besides cleaning the rooms once a day, the maid enters

the room in the early evening and turns down the beds. In

addition, she or the security force makes a room check twice a

day to be sure that everything is in order.

. Each time the maid

enters the room, she merely knocks on the door, puts a master

key in the door, and opens the door..

We anticipated, therefore,

that the rooms occupied by us would be checked four times a day.

We had to have Agents in the room at all times and, therefore,

the particular Agent in the room at any given time

feigned

illness and insisted that the room not be cleaned up, but that

he would handle it himself.

Once the Subject moved into Room 405 we realized that

we could not be seen as occupying adjoining rooms in the Hawaiian

Village Hotel and later be seen as occupying adjoining rooms at

the Kahala Hilton Hotel.

This was particularly true of

SA CLIFFORD who is easily identified because of his white hair.

Therefore; once SA CLIFFORD moved into Room 406, he did not

leave the room until he departed for Los Angeles

on Bureau

instructions except to duck down to the open-air lobby late at

night to make emergency telephone calls tò the Honolulu Office

with instructions to call Los Angeles and the Bureau from a

public telephone

booth.

the time of the entrance of

the Subjects at 2:12 D.m.s 2/18/64 until 11:45 D.m, that night

With regard to the Bureau's inquiry concerning the

Kahala Hilton Hotel, on Wednesday morning, 2/19/64, SAS CLARK,

wait, and LIMAN were

dispatched early in the morning to the

Kahala Hilton Hotel to provide coverage of the Subjects in

advance because the latter were expected to move to the Kahala

Hilton Hotel at noon time on Thursday, 2/20/64. As noted at

the bottom of page I of the attached copy of the airtel; we

were able to effect an arrangement with the hotel whereby rooms

would be allocated as we desired, four to the Subjects and

three to ourselves.

We made this agreement with the hotel

which was 75% occupied: That if their occupancy reached the

point whereby they would lose payment for one night for the

lour cons ceserved for the following night for the subjects,

we would reimburse the hotel for these four rooms at whatever

rate the rooms were rented for. With regard to the other three

rooms, our three Agents would check into those rooms expecting

• to occupy the rooms the night of the l9th and would pay

regular rate for the occupancy. These seven rooms ran from

$27,00 per day to $40.00 per day with an estimate average rate

o= $35.00 per day or an overall cost of $245.00 a day, if it

had become necessary to pay for them.

As noted at the bottom of page 7 and top of page 8

of attached airtel, Agents worked all day and all' evening.

making installations and then had to work all night removing

the installations. Therefore, they did not occupy the rooms as

normal guests and certainly it was not for their personal

convenience. Because of the quality of the SAl Contact at the

hotel and because no demand had been made for these rooms by

other guests or potential guests, the hotel suffered no monetary

loss and did not charge us for the four rooms set aside for

the eventual occupancy of the subjects, nor for the three rooms

utilized, but not really occupied by the three Agents.

* In the mean time, SAs CLIFFORD and. STEPHENS remained

In Pooms 403 and 406 at the Hawaiian Village Hotel and monitored

the combined installations.

They did not leave these rooms until

Thursday morning, 2/20/64, when the other three Agents returnec

iron the Kahala Hilton Hotel with the equisment, helped pack

it, and sent SAs CLIFFORD and LYMAN to the airport to hurry to

I Los Angeles.

After SAs CLIFFORD and LYMAN depärted for Los Angeles

on Thursday, 2/20/64, SAS CLARK, MANN, and STEPHENS cleared the

equipment out of the

rooms occupied by the Subjects and out of

Pooms 403 and 406 occupied by the Agents to monitor and surveil

the subjects, and took it down to the field office in order

to begin packing it for shipment. It is noted that they paid

cash for the room rent of Room 406, which they retained,

the nights of 2/21/64 and 2/22/64 because the Bureau equipment

had been removed and security precautions were no longer

necessary.

They then "mopped up"

the operation and returned to

The nights of 2/21-22/64

were the only nights where it could be said that the room was

occupied for the Agents personal convenience because no Bureau

equipment was installed in the room and in this instance the

Agents paid for the room each night in cash.

The Bureau has acknowledged that this assignment was

successful as far as it went and the only way to handle it was

the manner in which it was handled, by getting first near the

Subjects, then next to the Subjects, and working around the

clock where necessary.

It is hoped that this fully explains the reason for

the highly confidential, but absolutely necessary expenditures

made.

King arrived in Detroit sometime

They are to be in Detroii

all of today (3-19-64) and until late

alternoon of tomorrow (3-20-64) when they

w1l1 likely fly to the Canton-Akron (Ohio)

airport.

King is scheduled to speak at the

"Central Church," Detroit - probably today

(19th) although there is possibility 1t

might be the 20th.

Arrangements mad

viously stayed in Detroit.

(b) Pretext calls to selected first-rate

hotels - he always goes first class.

(c) Pretext to "Central Church."

(d) There is likely news publicity on his

presence in Detroit and same may reveal

where he is staying. Under no circumstances

should any request be made of any news media

contacts no matter how established and

reliable they may be.

(3) Once it is determined where King is

staying, does that hotel have an established

reliable source?

We must deal through

only one person

at the hotel.

(1) Will it be possible to effect necessary

coverage on King's room? Consider use of

the remote-type equipment. Will you be able

to get a near-by room from which to work

it remote-type equipment is used?

(5) Imperative that only the most proficie

personnel be used. Pick your very best me

for this type of operation without regard

what squads they may be assigned to.

(6)

Be alert to the possibility that King w

be given police protection as he has in the

stan 15 ty

past in which event it may dictate actions

you will take, especially if the police are

stationed near his hotel room.

(7)) Take no positive action as to any

installation without receiving prior Bureau

authority.

This phone call, however, may be

considered as authority for necessary survey

(8) While there is no indication that the

following two individuals are to be in

Detroit, be alert for their presence as they

other is Reverend Logan Kearse of Baltimore:

Both are Negroes and Kearse has been known

to lact as

(9) Il developments are favorable and a

"party" comes off with good coverage by the

Bureau, we would consider, if all circum-

stances were favorable, having such a party

raided by the police.

However, this would

require diligent planning and prior Bureau

Buthority

While it is not likely this

will come

to pass in Detroit, it is worth

keeping in the back of the mind.

The specific question raised in Bulet 3/12/64

concerning the reason why a tape recording was

furnished to the Bureau and the disposition of same

is answered as follows.

The office mistakenly thought

that Bureau officials mighi be interested in listening

to this particular recording. It is requested that

this tape be returned to the Atlanta Office.

Based on Bureau comments in this general

matter the ASAC and myself have held a lengthy

conference with those individuals,

including the

supervisor of the squad, responsible for this case and

technique in the Atlanta Office. A complete airing of

procedures that are to be followed in maintaining

this installation, approprinte dissemination of

significant infornation,

rocossary investigative

and paper work procedures have been reviewed. It is

The only positive observation that

this

office can furnish

at this time is that in view

"""of the fact that the experience on this

surveillance

now covers approximately a five-months period,

it is felt that a worthwhile

• evaluation based on

the experience to date would

serve a specific

purpose at this time. It is suggested that this

be accomplished by a conference of the necessary

Bureau officials and two representatives from

this office made up of either the SAC or ASAC

and the supervisor directly responsible for this

activity. In view of the

direct relationship

coverage being afforded in the New York"

area in this general subject matter it would

appear that the appropriate representative or

representatives of

that office could also

profitably attend such a one day conference.

In the absence of the Bureau's opinion

or an observation on the above this office will

continue to stringently control this installation

the

For tensons given by your office,

that this

The Bureau

recognizes that the obtaining of infor

matlon from these sensitive sources requires noticulous care

gested that if your office

recomnended that King hire Hunter Pitts O'Dell as an administrative

assistant.

King, acting upon this advice, hired O'Dell in this

OBSERVATIONS:

King's duplicity is amply illustrated in his public

announcements concerning O'Dell's lack of connections with the SCLC

as mentioned above, O'Dell was observed

willingness to
