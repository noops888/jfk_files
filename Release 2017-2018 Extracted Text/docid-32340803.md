Character:

ANTI-RACKETEERING

Synopsis:

Subject currently residing 47 Lockwood Place,

Clifton, N.J., with his wife.

Contact with logical sources

who would normally have knowledge of subject's activities have

failed to reveal that the subject has returned to active

participation in the rackets.

Subject's U.S. Parole Office

case

worker considers subiect a model parolee.

DETAILS:

Periodic observations during the months of June

and July, in the vicinity of the subject's residence,

Lockwood Place, Clifton, New Jersey, have failed to reveal

any indication of illegal activities being

conducted therein

It was further noted that the subject still engages in early

morning walks when the weather is permitting.

MIKE ARDIS, President, Local 945, IBT, Clifton,

New Jersey, has been

missing for three weeks..

Prior to

this,

NKuTel contacted ARDIS on two occasions.

During both of these

contacts, ARDIS requested source to get him a revolver.

ARDIS

indicated that he needed a gun because of his fear of "wise

guys"

,but did not further elaborate. ARDIS indicated that he

wanted to step down from thepposition of President of Local 945

and take over the Welfare-Pension Office of the Local.

ARDIS

also advised that he desired to do this as soon as possible,

but was being pressured to stay on as president by TONY PROVENZANO

and SAL BRIGUGLIO. PROVENZANO and BRIGUGLIO desired to put one

of their men in as president and did not want ARDIS to step

down until this could be accomplished.

NK T-1 stated that SAL BRIGUGLIO continues to work
