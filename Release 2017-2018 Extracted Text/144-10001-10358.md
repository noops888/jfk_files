I attended all the ceremonies, the procéssion, the mass, the

burial, the reception by the KENNEDY family, and the reception by

the President. I saw the Secretary of State for Foteign Affairs

from

who assured me that

will send us an acknowledge-

ment to our request for recognition, but he is notablé to give

an approximate date.

He will remain inNew York to attend la

meeting of] the Security Council.

Therefore, I asked

will be in a few days. I have also asked WAHLEN, Head of the Swiss

Department for Policy, which is the same as the Ministry of Foreign

receipt it this has not yet been dóne.

At the customary presentátion

getting better.
