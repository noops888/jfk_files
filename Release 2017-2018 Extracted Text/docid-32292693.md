CHICOFSKY stated that he believes that JOHN KELLEY

was involved in the robbery of the VA Hospital and he said

this because CHICOFSKY claims that on several occasions in

the past KELLEY, who CHICOFSKY says believes the Post Office

which enables them to ascertain the whereabouts of this

car, has intentionally left his car in downtown Boston,

of' age;

5'7" to 5'8"; stocky build;, approximately 160 lbs.;

very dark complected and appeared to be an Italian and

CHICOFSKY said that this individual would get

in to the back seat of the car and KELLEY would sit in the
