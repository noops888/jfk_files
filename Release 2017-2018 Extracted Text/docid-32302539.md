•C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH III:

Within the past ten days THOMAS ANTHONY "SONNY" CIANCUTTI

has opened a travel agency on Fourth Avenue, New Kensington,

Pa.

The name is something like Holiday Travel Agency

but its exact name and address will be obtained.

informant's opinion, this agency creation was undoubtedly

decided upon by the

MANNARINOS,

since "SONNY" CIANCUTTI

is one of their newest trusted

lieutenants.

Pittsburgh will develop more complete information regarding

the above travel agency.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
