Lopol Coun.-

Morris Cunningham, Washington representative of the

Dinastor Sor'y -

Memphis Commercial Appeal, called Inspector Bowers during the

afternoon of 10-30-74 from Memphis, where he is covering the James Earl

Ray hearing in Federal District Court. Cunningham said Ray had testified

to having sent a letter to Senator James O. Eastland (D-Miss.) shortly after

he had been sentenced to prison for the King slaying. Ray allegedly said

that he told Senator Eastland in the letter that he personally did not shoot

King, but was partially responsible for his death. (News reports, 10-30-74,

on the hearing corroborate this and indicated that Ray's letter to Senator

Eastland was read into the record.)

Cunningham said he called Senator Eastland at his residence in

Mississippi and asked him about this matter. Eastland recalled the letter

and said he advised Cunningham about it when it was received, however,

Cunningham does not recall this. He said Eastland had told him he had

forwarded the letter to the FBI as he does many similar letters he receives

from prisoners. Cunningham said Eastland suggested he call Bowers to

determine if the FBI could locate the letter and to tell Bowers that he,

Eastland, approves furnishing contents of the letter to Cunningham.

Bowers pointed out to Cunningham that we were precluded from

-5.

doing so under Department regulations. It was pointed out to him, however,

that should Senator Eastland desire, a copy of the letter, if located, could

be made available to the Senator's office and the Senator could release the

letter if he wishes. Cunningham said that should be satisfactory with him.

He was told he would be advised as soon as this matter could be checked out. He

can be reached through the news room of the Memphis Commercial Appeal,

area code 901 526-8811 in Memphis.

REG 544-38861-596%

This matter was checked with Courtney Pace, Administrative

McDermott to Jenkins Memo

. Re: MURKIN

He said that should we find the letter in question and furnish a copy to

him, he would be glad to handle the matter with Cunningham for the Senator.

Bufiles reflect that Senator Eastland made a copy of Ray's letter

available to Inspector Bowers on 3-17-69. Accordingly, a copy of Ray's

letter, see attached, has been made available to Courtney Pace on 10-31-74

so that he can handle the matter with Cunningham.

MI. CHARLIE QUITHAN STEPHENS, Room 6-B, second floor,

1222 S. Main Street, furnished the following information to

Lleutenant J. D. HAMBY, Homicide Bureau, Memphis Police

Department, and SA FRAYKLIN L. JOHNSON:

HE. STEPHENS, who stated he 19 46 yeara of age,

and his wife occupy 2 rooms in thr north wing of a rooming

bouse, the address of nhich is 4224 S. Main Street. This

rooming house actually covera the second floor of 2

separate buildings, Mr. STEPHENS' room being located in the

north building in the southeast corner of the north building.

Sometime in the late afternoon of April 4, 1968,

he and hig wife were in their room. His nife, who has

recently been in the hospital for an extended period of

time, was In bed in their combination of living-bedroom.

He was in the kitchen, which is east of the living-bedroon.

He was repairing a radio on a table located at the north

wall of the kitchen.

Immediately north of him 1s a common

bathroon which is located at the east end of an east-west

hallway in the north building.

While he was repairing the

radio, he heard what he 18 certain was a shot, and he 1s

certain that shot came from the bathroom from a point

within just a low feet of where ho mas sitting. He has so

way of knowing the time but can only estimato it was sometime

between 5:00 and 6:00 PM.

Upon hearing this shot, he walked out of the kitchen

through his l1viag-bedroon and opened the door leading onto

the hallway and observed a man running west dom this hallway

and this man was carrying a large bundle of some kind. He

would estimate that this bundle or package mas at least

3 or 4 feet long and 6 to 8 inches thick.

Although he saw the

man and the bundle only momentarily, he grinnd the impression

that the bundle was wrapped in sonothing, posslbly a newspaper.

This man continued running to the end of

the hallway turning

CARPENTER recalls that he wrote on the box in which he

placed the binoculars the prico $39.95 and the amount of

tax which was $1.60 and

of $41.55. He placed the sales slip and the box with the

binoculars in it in a gray paper bag which bears the name

of York Arms on its side. The binoculars were in a leather

or similar type carrying case. The store does not record

Mr. CARPENTER recalls that the individual reached

1nto his right front pants pocket to get the money with which

to pay for the binoculars.

The money was not in a billfold

or a money clip.

The customer withdrew two $20 bills from

a roll which contained several other bills, at least two of

which Mr. CARPENTER believes were $20 bills.

The customer

also took a $1.00 bill from this roll and then reached into

his other front pocket with his left hand and secured two

quarters and a'nickel, making a total of $41.55 for the

payment. After purchasing the binoculars, the customer

walked from the store and Mr. CARPENTER told him to "hurry

Mr. CARPENTER does not recall ever having seen

this individual before in the store or elsewhere, but feels

able to recognize him.

The customer, while in the store, did not ask to

see any other merchandise such as rifles or guns or :'

ammunition of any kind, and made no inquiry at all concerning

any other merchandise.

Mr. CARPENTER stated that when the customer entered

the store CARPENTER was near the front of the store talking

to Mr. VERNON YORK. Further back in the store he believes".

CHARLES GIBSON was near the cash register, and Mr. HUGH

BADDLEY, a clerk, was also somewhere in the store. He belleves

also that possibly Mr. CORDRA YORK, JR., may have been in

the store, but he does not know whether

or not any of these

individuals took notice of the customer.

Mr. STEPHENS, who stated he is 46 years of age,

and his wife occupy 2 rooms in the north' wing of a rooming

house, the address of which is 422} S. Main Street. This

rooming house actually covers the second floor of 2

separate buildings, Mr. STEPHENS' room being located in the

north building in the southeast corner of the north building.

Sometime in the late afternoon of April 4, 1968,.

he and hig wif)were in their room. His wife, who has

recently been in the hospital for an extended

period of

time, was in bed in their combination of living-bedroom.

He was in

the kitchen, which is east of the living-bedroom.

He was repairing a radio on a table located at the north

Immediately north of him is a common

bathroom which is located at the east end of an east-west

hallway in the north building.. While he was repairing the

radio, he heard what he is certain was a shot, and he is

certain that shot came from the bathroom iron

a point

within just a few feet of where he was sitting. He has no

may of knowing the time but can only estimate it was sometime

between

5:00 and 6:00 PM..

Upon hearing this shot, he walked out of the kitchen

through his living-bedroom and opened the door leading onto

the hallway and observed a man running west down this hallway

and this man was carrying a large bundle of some kind.

He

would estimate that this bundle or package was at least

3 or 4 feet long and 6 to 8 inches thick.

Although he saw the

man and the bundle only momentarily, he gained the impression

that the bundle was wrapped in something, possibly a newspaper.

This man continued running to the end of

the hallway turning

left (south) and apparently thereafter ran down the stairways

onto the street, although he could not actually see the man

going down the stairway.

It immediately occurred to Mr. STEPHENS that

this was the same man he had seen earlier in the afternoon,

possibly around mid-afternoon, standing at the door to

room 5-B which is located inmediately west of Mr.

STEPHENS 5 living-bedroom. He stated that around' nia-

afternoon he had seen a man with his. BRalei standing in the

hallway at the entrance to room 5-B locking into room 5-B.

He saw the man's left side. The man had nothing in his hands

at the time. He assumed this was some new guest looking

at a room.

Mr. STEPHENS stated that he and his wife remained

in their room the rest of the afternoon. He pointed out that

he, Mr. STEPHENS, is a disabled veteran who has been treated

patient.

Sometime after seeing thisman with Mrs. BREWER, he.

heard someone in room 5-B and

assumed the man hehad seen

had rented the room next door.

He stated that he recalls

on several different occasions hearing footsteps in this room

and also leaving from this room past his (Mr. STEPHENS's)

room and into the common bathroom at the east end of the

hall. He was also very much aware that when the person went

from room 5-B to the bathroom, that person remained in the bath-

room for a considerable period of time. He pointed out that

this 1s particularly noticeable since this is a comnon bathroom

which must be used by a number of different tenants.

He

also specifically recalled that only on one occasion did

he hear the commode being flushed and he mas therefore curious

as to why this person was spending so much time in the bathroon.

He stated that on the last occasion that someone

went fron number 5-B to the bathroom prior to the time he

heard the shot, he would estimate that that. person remained

In the bathroon for at least 20 to 30 minutes. During

this period he heard no noises coming from the bathroom.

He also specifically recalls that during this same period,

had knocked on Mr. STEPHENS's door and somewhat i angrily

Inquired as to who was staying in the bathroom so long.

that Mr. STEPHENS heard the above described shot which he

was certain cane from the bathroom. He stated that immediately

after the shot was fired he heard some people located across

the street, east of the building where he lives, screaming..

Due to the excitement of the moment, the fact that people

across the street in the vicinity of the Lorraine Motel

were screaming, and the fact that his hearing is not the

best, he did rit hear any additional noises coming from the

bathroom. He pointed out that he would expect to hear a

"scuffle" coming from the bathroom if the man in the bathroom

had fired

the shot that killed MARTIN LUTHER KING, but he

cannot recall hearing such a-"scuffle." He stated that he

simply has no way of knowing whether the man came out of the

bathroom, went into room 5-B and then ran out of 5-B down

the hall toward the front of the building, or whether the man

* in the bathroom ran directly from the bathroom down the

hallway toward the front of the building. He stated he did

hesitate a few monents after hearing the shot and hearing the

screaming outside before he went to the door and looked down

the hall to see the man running carrying something in his hand.

Mr. STEPHENS advised that the only people in the

north building of this rooming house at the time of this

Incident were (1) Mr. STEPHENS, (2) Hr. STEPHENS'S MilO,

who was in bed and who was never in a position to observe

anything, (3) Mr. WILLIS ANCHUIZ (phonetic), above, in room

4-B, who came out of his room and was seen by Mr. STEPHENS

at the same time Mr. STEPHENS saw the man running down the

hall, (4) Mrs. JESSIE LET-NITTER, a deaf and dumb lady who re-

sides -in room 1-B toward the front (west) of the north wing

or north building, and (5) the unknown man who had occupied

room 5-B who was running down the hall as previously stated

Mr. STEPHENS stated that Mr. ANCHUL made some remark

to the unknown man who was running down the hallway and the

and he is certain that there was no conversation in 5-8

footsteps which would indicate to him there was ever more

table which was against the wall that was adjacent to the

bathroom which was used by all tenants on his floor. As he

was working on his radio he could hear the man in the next

apartment to him, Apartment 5B, leave his room several times

and go into the bathroom.

an undue

length of time in this bathroom.

At about 6:00 p.m.,

as sounding like

a gunshot come from the bathroom. Upon hearing

his radio to his door that led to the hallway. He stated this is

only a distance of about 10 to 12 feet.

upon opening the door

he saw a man leave the bathroom carrying a package of about three

feet long and wrapped in what appeared to be newspaper.

He saw

need a stove and

refrigerator but only wanted a sleeping room.

Mrs. BREWER

then showed this individual Room 5-B, and he put his head in

northeast portion of the hallway which is located in the same

hallway as Room 5-B.

She and this individual then returned

to her office.

The individual stated that his name was JOHN

put his hand into his right trouser pocket and withdrew a

twenty dollar bill and two quarters and handed the money to

her.

She gave him change in denominations of one ten dollar

When WILLARD arrived at the

rooming house, Mrs. BREWER did not notice any luggage in his

possession, nor during the brief conversation with HILLARD

did he volunteer any information concerning his home residence,

line of business, or mode of transportation.

might assist in identifying the guest who

used the name of JOHN WILLARD.

She stated as she has

discussed the matter with her husband ald thought more

about it, the one thing which impressed her most about

the appearance of this individual was the fact that when

she first cracked open the door to her room after this

man knocked, she observed that he was standing at the

door with an unusual smile on his face. She went on to

state that she would describe the smile as a "sneer" or

a "smirk." She stated that she cannot be more specific

other than to state that she was impressed by this

expression on this man's face, as though he were trying

to smile for no reason. She stated that she did not

interpret the smile as

an effort to be flirtatious.

She also stated that her initial impression

of this man was that he did not "fit in" with other

tenants in this rooming house..

She pointed out that this

rooming house is located in a poorer section of town

where most of the tenants are older people or others

with limited income, a number of whon are alcoholies,

and this man was clean and neatly dressed, giving the

Impression that he could obtain lodging in nicer

surroundings.

Mrs. BREWER at this time attempted to recall

the words used by this person. As she recalls, when she

went to the door and cracked open the door, leaving the

chain fastened,

the man's first words were,

"Do you have

a room for rent?" She answered in the affirmative and

asked him whether he wanted a roon by the week or by the.

month.

He replied, as nearly as she can recall, by

stating simply, "By the week." At this point she

unfastened the chain

which secured the-partially opened

door and walked directly to Room 8 located in the south

wing of this rooming house.

She stated that the man

followed her to the room and looked inside the room but

never actually entered the room, at which time his words,

: 14

as nearly as she can recall, were, "Hell, I don't need the

stove and refrigerator since I won't be

doing any cooking.

I was thinking nore of a sleeping roon."

At this point sixs. BREFER explained that the

only vacant "sleeping room" (or room with no stove

and

refrigerator) which she had in either wing of the

rooming house was Room 5-B in the north wing.

She

therefore innediately walked from Room 8 in the south

wing across the enclosed walkway which connects the

and thereafter to Room 5-B. Again she walked in front

of the man. As soon as she opened the door to Room 5-B,

the man imnediately stated that he would take that room.

She then walker, to her room in the south wing of the

building, followed by the unknown man, who paid her

$8.50, as outlined previously by her, for the rent of

Room S-B Ior one week in advance.

Mrs. BREWER stated that most of the rooms in

this rooming house can be secured only with the use of a

padlock, and after showing this individual Room 5-B, she

removed

the padlock from the door and took the padlock

with her to her room.

She stated it is necessary that

tenants put up a deposit if they secure the padlock, but

this tenant did not inquire as to how he could lock the

door and did not request the padlock and a key.

She also

added that she did not explain to him the method of

locking the door or that it was necessary that he put up

a deposit in order to obtain the padlock.

She stated at this point that she had been

somewhat unnerved when she first looked at this man, at

• -9

which time he had the unusual snile on his face, or

appeared to be "sneering" at her, and thereafter she made

a point of having as little to do with him as possible,

always. walking in front of hin and avoiding all

unnecessary conversation or dealings with him.

Mrs. BRENER was asked whether she now feels

that she could identify this man if she sees him again.

She stated that she thought she might be able to identify

this man if she sees hin again. She stated the man used

no slang or unusual expressions and she could not associate

his accent with any particular area, adding he had no

particular accent.

She also stated that she is positive she has

never seen this man before.

She pointed out that she has

only been handling the rental of the rooms at this

rooming house since March 12, 1968, hotever, and she

would have no way of knowing whether he stayed at this

rooming house

prior to that time.

She

stated that at the time she becane the

landlady at this rooming house, Room 5 '8 was occupied

by an elderly man by the name of COMMODORE STEWART.

This man was ill as of March 12, 1968, and she believed

that it was on March 12, 1968,

that he was taken to a

Memphis hospital. A couple of days later, probably on

either March 13 or 14, 1968, this man died.

The room

had not been rented fron that time until the time the

stranger using the name of JOHN WILLArd rented this room.

She, understands that a number of different

persons have acted in the capacity of rental agent for

this rooming house in recent months, including Mr.

• ;

HYATT MADDOX, who is now a clerk at

the Tri-state Hotel

Located nearby, Mr. Maddox never having lived in this

rooming house, however, and apparently having acted ae

rental agent for only a short period of time. Another

Individual who bandled the rental of rooms in this

rooming house was H. R. THOUPSON, CANADI

" who never lived in the rooming house.

One other rental agent at this rooning house prior to

the time Mrs. BREVER assumed these duties was w. V.

SAtiONS, who she understands is now at the Madison Hotel

In Memphis., She is sure that Mr. SANYONS was the rental

agent in January 1968, based on copies of receipts in

her receipt book. She recalled that Mr. SAMHONS stabbed

his wife while he was rental agent at this rooming house

and the matter received publicity.

Mrs. BREWER advised that sost of the occupants

of rooms in this rooming house are more or less permanent

tenants,

although she does occasionally rent a vacant'

room to

transients for only one night....

Mrs. BREMER advised that there are 10 separate

apartments or

rooms in the south wing of this rooming

house and six separate apartments or rooms in the north

wing.

The six rooms in the north wing are referred to as

I-B, 2-B, etc., whereas the rooms in the south wing have

She furnished the following information concerning the

status of these rocus as of April e, 1968, when the man

using the name JOhN WILLARD checked into Room 5-B:

Mrs. BREWER added, however,

that due

to Mr. MESSER's age

and his

physical and mental condition, Mr. MESSER

still does not understand what actually

occurred and continues to ask what all the

excitement was about when police officers

and FBI Agents questioned occupants of the

building.

believed to be Mapleton, Georgia.

SPAIN, accompanied by

SPAIN returned it to his residence in Birmingham, Alabama.

In the Spring of 1967, SPAIN gave the gun to his

father in partial payment of a debt he owed to his father.

SPAIN was later told by his father that he had sold the

gun after placing a want ad for it in a Birmingham newspaper.

SPAIN was not present when his father sold the gun and

therefore did not see the purchaser.

WALTER WON SPAIN,

Alabama, furnished the following:

Birmingham,

gave at. shall a 38 caliber liberty snub-nose revolver,

wnich his son had purchased in late 1966 or early 1967 from

a gun dealer near Atlanta, Georgia. His son owed bir. SPAIN

some money and the gun was a partial payment of this debt.

In the fall of 1967, after having been hospitalized

1n August, 1967, at Huntsville, Alabama, for an illness and

being in need of money to pay bills, Mr. SPAIN sold many

personal items by means of placing want ads for these items

in the "Birmingham News." Among the itens sold was the .38

caliber Liberty snub-nose revolver.

Mr. SPAIN recalled he

placed an ad for this gun in a sunday paper, and that same

Sunday he received a call from a man who asked about the gus,

the price, and the directions to get to SPAIN's residence.

The caller said he was in the western section of Birmirgham.

Akout an hour after this call, and while SPAIN's wife and

daughter were at church, a man came to the iront door and

said he had called about the gun. He looked at the gun,

stated he had been looking for a gun of the same type,

and

when told again that the price was $65.00, he gave SPAIN

two twenty dollar bills, two ten dollar bills, and a five

dollar bill, after saying he would take it.

SPAIN did not

give the man a receipt for the money, nor did he record his

name or see any identification of the man, and he did not

obtain any information as to his rare.

the gun in his hand. SPAIN furnished neither annunition nor

any papers for the gun.

When the man first arrived, SPAIN observed he had

any further attention to the car.

SPAIN did recall the

buyer saying he lived in the western section of Birmingha»,

The tuyer said he santed the

gun to keep around his house.

Mr. SPAIN described the buyer as a whito male, about forty

to forty-Ilve years. of ago, 5'8" or 5'9" tall, 170 to 175

pounds, dark bair slightly graying at the temples, with a

local

Alabama, accent.

The man was wearing a sport shirt

and slacks, colors unrecalled, and he did not have glasses.

Mr. SPAIN was shown five different photographs

Of JAKES EARL RAY, and he chose one which had been taken in

California during January or February, 1968, as "resembling

the man" who bought the revolver; however, Mr. SPAIN would

not make a definite identification of the

photograph of RAY

as the buyer.

Mr. SPAIN recalled he was contacted by FBI Agents

• on April 7, 1968, and shown an artist's conception of an

irdividual

the FBI was attempting to locate.

At that time,

he advised Agents the drawing reminded him of someone he may

have seen previously, but was unable to furnish any other

identifying information. After viewing the photographs of

JAINS EARL RAY and being questioned about the sale of the

revolver, SPAIN said he was now able to connect the sale

of the revolver with the drawing in that the person depicted

in the drawing reminded SPAIN of the person to whon he had

sold the revolver.

Dear Senator Eastland;

I read in the local newspaper where your committee is considering

' Investagating the Dr. King case. I would like to inform you and the

committee that I would cooperate in any such hearing. However, at

the time I am going to attempt to get the guilty plea set aside, I know

that the odds against having this done are greatly against me. But I

think due to the unusual circumstances in the guilty plea it mite be

possible.

I personaly did not shoot Dr. King but I believe I am partly

responsible for his death. I will briefly attempt to explain why I

entered the guilty plea. At the time Mr. Pery Foreman aggred to

take over the defense from Mr. Arthur Hanes we had a verbal

agreement that their would be no guilty plea, as I wanted to try the

case in court. I had every reason to believe during the first two

months Mir. Foreman was on the case their would be a trial, during

that period Mr. Foreman had me sign a new contract with him and

Mr. Huie giving Mr. Foreman all the money from any of Mr. Huie's

money making ventures. (I had sign another contract with Mr. Huie

and Mr. Hanes) Shortly after this Mr. Foreman came to visit me

and he had a picture for me to look at. This picture was about

-8 x 10 in. Ms. Foreman said Mr. Huie had given him the picture

and that Mr. Hule had got the picture from someone in the federal

government.

The picture contain 2 or 3 men followed by two or &

policemen. Mr. Foreman described on of the men in the picture

as an 'anti cornmunist cuban refugee who was arrested at the time

president Kennedy was shot. "The arrest took place in Dallas I was

told" I was asked it I would identify the man if he was brought to

Memphis. I said no, althoe he did look similar to the person I was ..

• involved with.

Alter I wouldn't identify this man, about all I was told

was that I would go to the electric chair iT I went to trial. I was even

told my family wanted me to plead guilty, but I found out this was not

80.

But I did not plead guilty for the above reasons. I did so because

I did not want to go to trial with a lawyer who thought he was going to

lose. I believe if you think you will lose you proably will. On the day

before I plead guilty I signed another contract with Mr. Foreman. In

this one I agreed to give him $165, 000, he agreed to give my brother

woo. 00 in the event i wanted to hire another lawyer to reopen the

case. Mr. Foreman wrote into the contract that if I embarres him

(disagreed) in the court room he could withdraw, the old contract •

'would go into effect and I would be without funds to hire another

attorney. Getting back to Mr. Huie for a minute, while Mr. Hanes

was my attorney Mr. Huie asked me through him about public figures

and various organizations. I got the impression that he thought their

vas a conspiracy but he wanted to name the conspirators. And i

sometime

felt that my attorneys were working for him instead of

in closing I would like to say if I can't get the case reopen,

their should be an invegestion, as I have signed over $200, 000 to

attorneys and not 1/20 os the witnesses have been interview. No one

went to Los Angeles of New Orleans where I think much of the

evidence lies. Mr. Foreman said in open court that he didn't

trust investigators, and the one Mr. Hanes hired never left Memphis.

I would also like to say that despite what the papers and book writer's

quote me as saying, I have no intention of discussing this case with

anyone 'verbaly' until it is closed. Il I have anything to say I will

say it in court or to lawyers, or in letter form like this letter.

Sincerely, James E. Ray.
