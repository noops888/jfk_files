The investigative period of this report is

extended to include investigation by auxiliary offices

not received at time of last report.

Mr. BILL BARRETT of the

IRS office, Miami,

on October brida, telephone 350-5221, stated he

had a case on BROWDER relating to his 1969 and 1961 income

tax. Mr. BARRETT desired to be advised when BROWDER is

apprehended.

By communication dated August 6, 1969, Los

Angeles advised the following:

It is believed by the Los Angeles Office that

SID SHINE, mentioned in this report, was the informant

of Sgt. FRANK WHEELING, LoS Angeles Police Department, who

in early July, 1969, advised that he had seen BROWDER

at the airport, Atlanta, Georgia.

Per information received from ED HOSKINS,

PCI (protect), Mand ttle + 1763

o, the following

investigation was conducted:

On September 17, 1969, SA RICHARD B. KELLOGG of

the West Palm Beach (Resident Agency) Office advised he had

on that date received a phone call from a Miami bondsman

named DEL HOSKINS.

HOSKINS related that he had seen in the

Miami newspaper that EDWIN H. BROWDER, SR., had died and was

to be buried on September 18, 1969. HOSKINS advised SA

KELLOGG he, as well as many other bondsmen in the Miami area,

at one time or another had been contacted by ED BROWDER,

JR., who frequently got into trouble with the law and who

contacted *he bondsmen periodically to get him out of jail.
