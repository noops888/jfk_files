Interview:

At the above time and date, Donald Paul Eden was inter-

viewed at his place of business, Eden Galleries, Ltd., 1285

North King Street, Hampton, Virginia

:23669. (804-722-7497198)

Mr. Eden is a retired major who was a Liaison Officer to Head-

quarters TAC (Tactical Air Command) for Air Force Security

Service, Langley Air Force Base, Hampton, VA. It was his duty

to provide intelligence to Tactical Commands in addition to

coordinating plans and giving guidance to other TAC units.

During the interview, Mr. Eden stated that his informa-

tion is secondhand and not of personal knowledge as previously

reported to the Committee on September 16, 1977 by Mr. Michael

A. Rorer. Further, he stated that sometime in 1969 or 1970,

he was engaged in an informal discussion with a captain (name

not recalled at this point) who was "r.i.f.'ed" out of the

service between 1970 and 1971. This discussion was related to

who was, in fact, behind the Kennedy assassination. Mr. Eden

indicated that the Captain's contention was that the "soviet

Union and Cuba were behind the assassination". In order to

support this contention, the Captain told Mr. Eden that just

prior to the assassination he was assigned to the Special

Intelligence Command of the Air Force Special Security Office

(AFSSO) at Langley Air Force Base. The Captain continued that

sometime between Sunday and Tuesday, the week of the assassina-

tion, while serving as duty officer, he saw a message which

was

intercepted on the Moscow to Mexico City link to be

relayed to Cuba (or Soviet Embassy to Mexico City Embassy to

the Cuban Embassy). The intercepted message specified "some-

thing about Kennedy, Dallas and Oswald" and specified the

"actual date". In addition, the Captain said that soon after

the assassination (time unspecified but probably "days")

another message was received from the Command Center addressed

to all personnel to destroy any and all records pertaining

to the intercepted message, which Mr. Eden felt was highly

irregular. It is believed all of the records were destroyed.

Mr. Eden provided a description of the Captain as

follows:

Male, white, approximately 5'7" or 5'8", about 190

pounds, pudgy build and dark hair.

Mr. Eden could not recall the Captain's name. However, after

further discussion, it was suggested that he attempt to obtain

the name through telephone inquiries at Langley Air Force Base,

since he was known at and discharged from the Base. Mr. Eden

readily agreed and made a number of inquiries by telephone

which culminated in a conversation with Sergeant Leber. The

Sergeant had known and/or worked with the Captain and

indicated that his last name is Stanley.

He further stated

that Captain Stanley went to study at Miami University following

his

separation

from the service.
