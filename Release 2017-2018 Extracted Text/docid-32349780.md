que so ho podião mandar nas" he viil be unablo to make the mooting the nast day but

wall be at the sardin ino dura later at tho hour indioatoe.

AMEnsE artioned the

C/D and AMNOP not to loave uny mossages for him with his mald.

18, One problem which had boen bothering ALlIESS sinco AMNIP IIFHt nado contaot

canoeined the advisability of roporting to hla ruperlors that AMNIP had contaotod

He brought this up repeatodly; saying that le felt he must report the contaot

to dover himael! in ouse the two had been suen rogather, however he mie olearly

undooided. At one point he said, "il I do raport it boloro I 80 to Cuba they u1l1

probably nover bellevo that AMNIP did not rocruit ma and might keep m in Cuba!"

after this thought had ocourred to him he opined that he should probably report

the conteot to Voge after his return from Cuba.

Both the C/0 and AMNIP adviaod him

not to roport the contaot and at the very end of the meeting. he seemed to have

nocopied thla advice.

As he was walking away

from the table he turned around,

cane baak to AMNIP and said, "please, for dod's sako, don't mention a vord of this

to anyone."

Althourh only a partial suocess at beat, the meeting soened to go woll.

AMNIP toid the C/O later that he felt that the case was much more promoing than

the LookE ouse at the same stage when LIOOZE asked for two months to think things

through. AMNIP also noted as a good sign the laot that AMSESS was very friendly

with the c/0 whereas AMNIP had expeoted AMSiSS to be somerhat standoffish in his

intrial dealings with a KUBARKER.

20. The C/0 represented himself as coming from ERMETAL.

This fiotion was

supportod by appropriate prups such as book matches, which Amsass noted, as weil

as by AMNIP's remarks.

At the same tine the C/O displayed considerable knonlodgo

of Maxioo Clty and goings on 1n Habana and the Cuban Embassy, this as done in an

offort to convinco AMSEB8

ronto that many of AMBRos, "I the omnicolende of XUBARK and to rointoros the stato

oolleagues were already cooperating. A number of

questions vero phrased in such a way as to causa AMsE88 to ballove that the

information in the C/O's possession came from sources in Habapa.

AMSESS conveyod an improssion of sincerity to both the C/0 and AMNIP.

Ho 18 a strong personality, quite sure of himself. and ready to fade the consequences

of hia aota.

He has a well-developed sense of humor.

The information he provided

natos him a tantallzing prospect for future development since he 18 obvioualy in a

much bottor position than INTAMIL-9 to furnish information of value. Much of the

information ho suppilod 18 confirmed by other sources and no evidence can be found

of doooption. AMNIP fools that AMSESS would not have imparted so much detail had

ho not already made up his wind to cooperate and that with the continued exeroise

of patience in doaling with AMSESS his recruitment would appear to be assured.! At

chio time AMBESS cannot be considered as rearuited.

He expoots to remain at his

present poot unt1l june 1965 and the station hopes to persuade him to cooperate in

plass and socopt transfer to Habana after the completion of his tour. The matter

of Minandial compensation has not yet been broached.

22. Depending on the outoome of the November meeting, the station may wish

to bring the father of AMSEBS' wife to Mex100.

Il he 1s unable to obtain a Mortoan

v1oa by hls oun offorts, 1t 18 felt that he should probably ba brought to Mexico on

PLoTto Ridan doomentation Biaoe station efforts to obtain him a visa through Maxioan

It 1e requested that ANNIP be nade available to the Station for the follon
