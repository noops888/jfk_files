CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY

WASHINGTON 23, D. C.

Applicant Information

Sheet No, 1

To all persons applying for employment

With the Central Intelligence Agencya

The paper lo the first step in applying for employment or consultant

status with the Central Intelligence Agency. No application may proceed

beyond this first step if the applicant is not in agreement with the

conditions stated below.

General Considerations:

1. The Nutional Security Act of 26 July 1947 (Public Law 253, 80th

Congress) which Greated the Central Intelligence Agency places upon the

Agency the responsibility:

"to advise the National Security Council In matters concerning

such intelligence activities of the Government departments and agencies

as relate to the national security:

b. "to make recommendations to the Notional Security Council

for the coordination of such intelligence activities of the depart-

ments and agencies of the Government as relate to the national

security:

c.

"to correlate and evaluate intelligence relating to thes

national security, and provide for the appropriate dissemination

of such intelligence within the Governments

d"to perform, for the benefit of the existing intclligence

agencies, such additional services of common concern as the National:

Security Council determines. can be more efficiently accomplished

centrally: S

06.

"to perform such other functions and duties related to

intelligence affecting the national security as the National Security

Council may from time to time direct!

---

## Page 80

The special charäcter of this national responsibility requires the Agency

to.maintain.corréspondingly special employment criferia which may.be

different. from the routine or normal employment standards of other Govern

ment departments and agencies which do not have the highly sensitive rest

ponsibility borre by the Central Intelligence Agency. It follows that the

investi

ration

or applicante

pre requisite to their acceptance is a time

consuming process which in addition to loyalty and security checks-

includes

uation of competence, physical and emotional fite and

a vai

Lity

of a suitable position at such time as employment may be offered.

This is called clearance" of an applicant.

estigation of an applicant may reveal something which prevents

bis clearance

perhaps something of which the applicant is genuinely unaware

perhaps something which only the speciel employment criteria of the agency

make unacceptable. In any event, adverse findings by the Agency are con-

clusive and final'so far as the Agency is concerned, and no statement of

specific reasons is made to the applicant.

3. Employment by the Central Intelligence Agency is not a right upon

which an applicant can insist, Offer of employment which is subject to full

Clearance does not constitute a commitment on the Agency's part giving an

unsuccessfuf applicant grounds for any claim against the Agency, Acceptance

of employment upon the condition of elearance is at the applicant's risk.

faken with the knowledge that a very substantial percentage of applicants

are hot cleared.

Statement of Understanding

and Agreement

I have read, understand, and agree to the foregoing General Conside

erations. If not accepted for employment by the Central Intelligence

Agency, I will make no claim or demand in conflict with those consid-

erations.

I have also seen and read Applicant Information Sheet No. 2:
