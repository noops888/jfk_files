involved in making small cash loans to small businessmen who

need short term cash to pay their bills.

He gets five to six

percent interest per month for these loans.

clothing outlets:

He is married and has a child, and works 12

hours a day. He is still involved in right-wing politics, ano

MM: 92-88

TRAFFICANTE, in the past year, has been making

frequent trips to Panama and South America and has been

harassed and incarcerated in several instances.

Every time

he goes to Costa Rica, he goes through Panama because it is

the same price ticket

"brother of TRAFFICANTE was recently sentenced to

eight years in Tampa federal court on a bookmaking violation

The

case is being appealed but the TRAFFICANTEs feel that

there is very little chance of a reversal because the sentencing

judge has since been appointed to the 5th Circuit and now sits

on the appellate court:

The health of SANTO TRAFFICANTE has improved somewhat

He still suffers from shortness of breath on occasion and takes

valium for this

symptom

He still has continual facial cancers

which are removed as they occur

Former attorney for TRAFFICANTE, FRANK RAGANO,

recently appeared on the 90 minute DAVID SUSSKIND show about

JIMMY HOFFA. RAGANO 1s allegedly negotiating in Hollywood

with the rights to "The. Jimmy Hoffa Story":

RAFAEL GARCIA BANGO, former Cuban associate of

TRAFFICANTE, arrested in Spain several years ago accompanied

bY ELSITA ARIAS, and who was sentenced to a long prison term

in Spain for possession of counterfeit U: S. bills, was

released from Spanish prison' on intercession by his brother

JORGE GARCIA BANGO, Cuban Minister of Government.

On return

ing to Cuba, however, RAFAEL GARCIA BANGO died. ELSITA ARIAS

is the same ELSA GONZALEZ who recently gained fame in Miami as

the Internai Revenue Service (IRs) source In Operation Leprechaun.

On 1/26/76, MM 2729-PC advised RAUL GONZALEZ JEREZ,

former owner of the

Club 21, is back in Miami,

living in Key

Biscayne and isbig in sports betting and bolita activity

He is a long time close associate of LN figure SANTO:

TRAFFICANTE, JR. He is allegedly taking unlimited sports

bets sometimes as much as $10,000 to $20,000 on a game.

Source will attempt to obtain the telephone number used

by GoNZALEz and get more information.
