sources who can furnish information concerning subject's

activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is to be noted that Captain ALFREDO GUERRA Y

AQUIAR, a relative of PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ, FAR defector, 1s

the source from whom Colonel ERICKSON NICHOLS, Air Attache, United

States Embassy, Havana, apparently obtain his information

upon which this case is predicated. GUERRA was formerly in

the Intelligence Section of the

• Cuban Air Force. He is

still known to be connected with the Cuban Government.

As the communications received by this office from the Bureau

do not precisely show that GUERRA was the Air Attache's

source, the basis for this investion is being attributed to

the Air Attache. . •

MM 635-S in addition to the information set forth

in the body of instant report, advised that ARTURO FERNANDEZ

DE CASTRO had recently furnished United States Customs some

information concerning some B-25 and B-26 planes in the

Miami area and claimed that United States Customs, on the

bais of his information had agreed to detain these planes. (/My

No dissemination of this report is being made to

United States Customs locally and it is recommended that the

Bureau not disseminate this report to United States Customs

on the Washington level in order to afford adequate protection

to MM 635-S - (A) les

It is felt that if United States Customs is in

contact directly with ARTURO FERNANDEZ DE CASTRO concerning

some matters that information might be inadvertently furnished

o him through interrogation by United states customs whic

rould expose MM 635-S.(dla
