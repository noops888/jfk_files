Interview:

On 12/30/77, the writers interviewed Motto at Holiday

Inn, Room 1526:

Mr. Motto is now Chief Investigator for the

Cook County Public Administrator's Office. In 1963 he was

Special Agent Robert Motto of the Chicago office of the United

States Secret Service:

We discussed with him his activities

in connection with the proposed visit of President John F.

Kennedy to Chicago on November 2, 1963.

Motto told us that he was involved in checks and

counterfeiting enforcement during this 1963 period. As if

anticipating the thrust of our questioning, he stated that

about a year or two ago a newspaperman came to see him and

questioned him about this November 1963 period. He could not

recall the reporter's name, but the man told him he was

going to make him the hero of the piece.

This put Motto on

his guard and he said he didn't tell the man anything about

his activities at the time.

"As a result, he murdered me in

the article,"

Motto said.

Motto told us that he could not recall exactly what

specific activities he was engaged in from October 30th through

November Ind, 1963, except that he went to the Air Force - Army

game at Soldiers Field on November 2nd.

"The trip

10 a cancerred.

I think they told us at the game, but we decided to Watch it

anyway," Motto said. "When I got back to the office, someone

said there had been threats," he told us. We pressed him for

information as to the identity of his informant, but he could

not recall who in his office told him. He does not recall

surveilling any Latin/Cuban types during that period, but he

does not rule out this possibility; he simply does not recollect.

The names Rodriguez and Gonzalez mean nothing to him.

Motto asked us if we had talked to Bolden yet. We

replied in the negative and asked him who Bolden was. He

launched into a vituperative discussion about Abe Bolden, the

Negro Secret Service Agent who allegedly attempted to blow

the whistle on

the Service in 1964. He was arrested in Chicago

and charged with attempting to sell file information to a

counterfeiter who had been arrested by the Chicago office.

On the day President Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Motto

was in Cincinnati, Ohio, working on a big case. He said he

returned to Chicago and helped in the post-assassination investiga-

tion - but again he was vague on specifics.

Motto: said that he had a copy of the magazine article

he referred to earlier and would send it to us when he located it.
