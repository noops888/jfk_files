named Hopps, who is known to be a "placer"

for union funds,

generally,

and for Teamsters money in particular.

RE:

JAMES RIDDLE HOTTA, aRIN S. WEINER

68-7985

According to Bureau files the Hopps mentioned above

may be identical with Stevart B. Hopps,

a millionaire manipulator of

insurance companies. This Hopps was indicted 7/13/60 by a

Federal grand jury,

Baltinore, Maryland in two counts, charging

use of the mail to

defraud in

connection with mailing

false

financial statements of the International Guarantee and Insurance

Com=

pany of Tangiers, Morocco, to Maryland State Insurance Commissioner

and the Baltimore Better Business Bureau in February, 1958.

According to information received from a confidential

source abroad, on 17X5/62, John Michael Kearney was Secretary-

Treasurer of the Intercontinental Insurance and Surety Company

in the Bahamas. According to

this source, he was born 3/20/93

at La Plato, Maryland, and had an address

Vallinta #21, Mexico, D.I (5)

During the course of the investigation outlined herein

it is important to establish the use of the mail and/or wires,

as well as

the interstate transportation of funds in excoss of

$5, 000.

In addition, it is of prime importance to ascertain

there was any fraud involved in handling of the insurance

transactions with BSIC. Based on inforation provided by Sanches,

it appears probable that Dortman,

Traurig and/or others may have

diverted certain insurance premiums

rather than applying these

funds to the purposes for which intended.

The above items are

not to be construed as all-inclusive and any other points deemed

logical should be completely resolved. This matter is to be

afforded prompt and continuous investigative attention by all

offices.

NOTE:

Bureau files contain no pertinent information concerning

Florida-Caribbean Underwriters of Miami, American and Overseas

Underwriters, or Leonard Traurig, other

than contained in captioned

case.

Information set forth herein concerning John Michael Kearney

and Intercontinental Insurance and Surety Company was obtained from

Bureau file 63-7312, which was furnished the Bureau bybStott, British

Intelligence by memoranda dated 12/15/61 and 1/15/62Js)Information

set forth herein concerning Stewart B. Hopps was obtained from

Bureau files 63-4296-47-31 and 62-71236.
