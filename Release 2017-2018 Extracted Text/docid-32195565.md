INFORMATION

CONCERNING

DN 215-S, who has furnished reliable information

in the past and is cognizant of Communist Party activities

in Denver, Colorado, furnished the following information to

SA JOSEPH C. LEARNED on 1/31/68:

JA meeting was held on January 28, 1968, at the home

o1 BOB LONs, 2061 south forest street, Denver.

The purpose

of the meeting was to attempt to form some sort of ad hoc

committee to support GARRISON in his investigation of President

KENNEDY's assassination.

It was planned that the committee

would be a loosely formed committee and would only function to

, send out press releases supporting GARRISON's actions and

protest what is believed to be an attempt by the United States

Government to "put him away" by saying that he is psychotic.

What the committee does will be determined by how GARRISON'S

case is receiving publicity.

The press release will be sent out soon reporting

that this

group believes that GARRISON should be left alone to

carry on

his investigation of the KENNEDY assassination.

DN 215-S reported that ROBERT TRUJILLO and NELLE

GARCIA, members of the CP, were present at this meeting:

DN 215-S reported that approximately 13 individuals attended

this meeting and that the majority of these

individuals have

been

active in the activities of the denver stop the War

Committee.
