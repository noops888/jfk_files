of a partnership with DRAYTON DIXON. He furnished capital

of $35,000 ($10,000 from a mortgage on his home, the rest

savings) and DIXON furnished about $26,000 to the partnership.

According to Mr. LOVIG, DIXON sold one of two houses he ownea

Mr. LOVIG pointed out that the restaurant has been

leased from CHARLES PIZZO on a ten year lease and that as

any parties other than DIXON and he, have any interest

whatsoever in the restaurant, and that he has never been

approached by anyone offering to buy a part or all of the

restaurant.

Mr. LOVIG stated that his auditor is one PHIL

SARATELLA with the Chicago Business Service and he has

complete knowledge of the financial structure of the restaurant

as he handles all books and completes the income tax returns

for both he and DIXON. Mr. LOVIG stated that if there is

any doubt as to the financing of the Country Fair Restaurant

he would be willing to make available, through Mr. SARATELLA,

all financial

records pertaining to the restaurant.
