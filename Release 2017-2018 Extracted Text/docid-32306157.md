FIGNE FIONIN

Reference is made to our memorandum in the captioned matter

dated December 1, 1959, which dealt with the question of possible

prosecutive action against Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz and those who

participated with him in the planning and execution of a leaflet-

dropping flight by a United States-based aircraft over Havana, Cuba

on October 21, 1959. Although we concluded that prosecutive action

was not warranted in the present circumstances, we noted that the

Federal Aviation Agency had under consideration the question of the

possible imposition of civil penalties under the Federal Aviation

Act of 1958 and the regulations pursuant thereto.

We are informed that the Federal Aviation Agency has revoked

Frank Fiorini's pilot's certificate by order dated May 26, 1960, and

has imposed a fine of $1000 upon Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz.' The Agency

advises that Diaz Lanz has tendered & check for $250, but pleads.

poverty and desires to pay the balance of the fine in installments.

It is understood that the Federal Aviation Agency has accepted his

check on this basis.
