20 July 1995

Note To: J. Gunn, ARRB staff

Subject: Documents for NARA (16 documents-ARRiS mito, 6/7/95)

I. Enclosed are the declassified "originals" of the 16

documents acted on by the ARRB at the 6/7/95 meeting. We

have stamped the documents "Release In Full" and attached a

revised version (draft) of the NARA identification form.

We

still need to update the index and the Oswald HRG retention

boxes that you are holding.

Also please send me a copy of

the forms you will be attaching to the documents prior to

sending them to the NARA for our records. I talked with

Steve Tilley, NARA, and he is aware that the documents will

be coming from you for this round.

The documents are arranged in the order that they

are listed in the letter from the ARRB to the DCI. Please

give me a call if there

are any questions.
