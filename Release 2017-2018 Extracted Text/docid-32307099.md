Re:

MANUEL RAY RIVERO

INTERNAL SECURITY

CUBA

This individual was an official of the Movimiento

Revolucionario del Pueblo (Peoples Revolutionary Movement) (MRP),

an anti CASTRO organization, who resigned on May 27, 1961.

In the past, he has reportedly made rather vague, conflicting

statements regarding his position on the legality of the

Cuban Communist Party (CP).

Recently, he has been mostly

active in Puerto Rieo.

The following information was submitted by MM T-1,

an eminent Cuban physician who is widely acquainted with

Cuban political leaders and who has furnished reliable

Information in the past, on February 19, 1962:

KИ1)

MM T-1 stated he had known RAY RIVERO since the

latter was born, and had observed from time to time his

leanings from one side to the other and rather unusual

and to the othe

and contradictory political statements.

• (2)

MM T-1 stated he learned in January of 1962, that

RAY was holding conferences in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

ascertained that RAY and

several of his friends, who are

engineers and architects, were holding. a

series of

conferences on democracy. RAY became Involved at one of

his conferences in a discussion in which he stated he was

Socialist.

When he was

asked

for clarification by some

of those present, he fell

into the evasive manner of

answering which has been

characteristic of the political

life and

activity of RaY.
