Documents Show FBI

Keeps 'Security' List

By EDMOND Le BRETON

WASHINGTON (AP) - The I'Bi

maintains a secret list of more than 2,200

Americans targeted for possible investi-

gation as potential security risks in

times of national emergency., according,

to documents disclosed Wednesday.

The documents. were released by Rép:

Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis. chair-

man of a House Civil Liberties subcom-

mittee, who said the FBI practice "de-

mands thorough congressional scrutiny

and public discussion."

The list is the latest in a series, of,

indexes dating back to before U.S. entry

into World War II and originally intend-

ed to identify persons to be arrested if

they were considered a national security

threat in wartime.

The FBI spokesman in August said, the

list of 15,000 persons subject to possible

detention had been destroyed after the

congressional authority for such arrests

expired in 1971. The latest list of Ameri-

cans identified for possiblei

investigation, begun in 1971, has not

been disclosed previously.

The FBI said the present list, which

contained 1,294 names as of Aug. 15, is

"an administrative aid ... (that) enables

the FBI to remain alert to individuals

who have exhibited a propensity to con-

duct acts inimical to the national securi-

ty and affords the FBI a record of indi-

viduals who would merit close

investigative attention pending legal

steps by the President to take further ac-

tion."

A memorandum from FBI Director

Clarence M. Kelley said the compilation

"serves as an extremely valuable list of

individuals who pose a threat to the

president of the United States, thereby

enabling the FBI to provide current data

to the U.S. Secret Service."

"Individuals who are included are

the national security," the memoran-

dum added.

Names on the list were not disclosed.

The FBI also said it would be impossible

to reconstruct past lists as Kastenmeier

had asked.

In releasing the Kelley memorandum

and a file of reiated documents, Kasten-

\ meier said in a statement that "although

the executive:branch does not now as-

sert the authority to suspend the Bill-of

Rights and incarcerate Americans at its

discretion, the fact that it continues to

actively maintain a list which hadrits

genesis in a plan to systematically im-

prison thousands of political dissenters

in the early days of the 'cold war' is

nfact which demands thorough congres-

sional scrutiny and public discussion."

New Orleans in previous

The Bureau has advised captioned matter pertains

to the Bureau's handling of requests from Senate and House

work of these committees, staff members may seek to inter-

view current and former FBI employees.

Recently, the Senate Select Committee (SSC) staff

has interviewed several former employees and it is anticipated

that many more such personnel will be contacted.

The FBI has pledged full cooperation with the committee

and we wish to assist and facilitate any investigations under-

taken by the committee with respect to the FBI.. However, we

do have an obligation to insure that sensitive sources and

methods and ongoing sensitive investigations are fully protected.

Should any former employee contact this office and have any

question regarding his obligation not to divulge information

obtained by virture of his past FBI employment, he should be

instructed to contact Legal

Counsel, FBIHQ, by collect call.

Your conversations with former employees must be in keeping with

our pledge.

It is believed such a procedure would insure proper

protection and also facilitate the work of the SSc.

The above procedure also applies to current employees

of this office. However, contact with the Legal Counsel should

be handled through the SAC.
