and when the strike is settled,

they sign a contract

that has 'utility",

The five barns that sign the first

contract should get a chance to change their contract to

put in 'utility,

The disucssion.continued, and was generally inaudible

because of the three individuals talking at once, but

JULIUS was heard to remark,

"560 drivers - TONY PRO" and

JULIUS apparently is referring to the fact that some of

the barns or companies have employees who are members of

Local 560 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters:

It is noted that TONY PRO, true name TONY PROVENZANO, is

an official in Local 560, IBT.

JULIUS stated, "RED MIKE gave you Local 641 men." and

making an

inaudible remark, and then stated,

An unknown number of individuals joined the conversa-

tion, and all went into the outer office.

NOONAN and FUREY

returned to NOONAN's office, and spoke in low tones:

NOONAN

Bad trouble (inaudible).

Is inaudible; however, mention is made of two shop

stewards, and, later on in the conversation, NOONAN quoted

an unknown individual, "I can't afford a strike, I'll sign

anything."

The informant was of the opinion that this

conversation was a continuation of the previous conversation

concerning the present negotiations.

With respect to the question of "utility", it is noted

that this question has been a major point with

Local 1730 of

NY 1716-C has previously explained that the members

of Local 1730 generally work under the so-called checker

system, where certain individuals are authorized to work the

Hi-Lo Machines, and other individuals are authorized to work

as checkers.

Under the "utility" system, all individuals

could be utilized as the situation warranted, either as

Hi-I:o operators, or as checkers.

On 1/25/63, NY 1716-0 advised that a meeting was

held on 1/23/63,

at Local 1730, ILA, Union Hall, and this

was a meeting of the wage-scale committee.

The informant

advised only

two. shop stewards at the meeting were holding

out against

"utility"

• THOMAS W. "TEDDY" GLEASON, Treasurer

of Local 1730, talked to these two shop stewards, and

told them they could not stop the wheels of progress,

and that if these two shop stewards continue to block

o he, GLEASON, would send them back to JIMMY.

Informant advised GLEASON apparently was referring to

the fact that JIMMY "BLUE EYES" (VINCENT ALO) had been

helpful in placing both of these shop stewards in their

union positions.

Informant also stated that CONNIE NOONAN told

one of the shop

stewards that he was getting out of line,

and that even though he, NOONAN, was a "general" in the

organization "to get utility"

he had to take orders too, and that the

orders were

The informant pointed out that this is the first

time GLEASON had committed himself for "utility", and

informant believes that outside pressure is being put on

GLEASON, as GLEASON is the real head of Local 1730.

KNOWN ONLY TO THE INFORMANI, NOONAN, GLEASCN

AND A FOURTH PARTY.

THEREFORE, EXTREME CARE SHOULD BE

NOONAN re-entered his office and is joined

by PAT LNU:
