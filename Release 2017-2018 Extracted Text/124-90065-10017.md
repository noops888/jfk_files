In part report stated Hector

bombing and does not believe him to be involved. (Report also

Miami belleved the report is complation of unverified rumors

and determined from CIA that the source was the above-mentioned

was

Interviewed 3/23/68 and in essence claimed

he had overheard a conversation between several Cubans, one of

whom

was a woman identified as Irmina Bousa.

Miami has deter= **

mined, however, that Bousa was in hospital having baby at the

time and could

not possibly have been involved in the conversa-

tion. Miami feels

may have fabricated

the story of

the conversation he overheard and that his report to cIA was

hereafter further edited by CIA priorbeing furnished to th

Miami Office.

From a comparison of the report mentioned in the

referenced teletypes, it would appear that it is identical

with the 3/26/68 CIA
