1. IK, an interesting employee

case on which we've been rather

stymied because Subject got away from

us. I frankly feel that a member of

PSD might better do the interview, but

It doesn't look as 1f 1t will work

out that way.

Tom Cole has had the

case before, I think.

4. On 5 April 1965, James Wilcott advised a representative of EAB

that while visiting with members of an integration movement, he had come

in contact with an individual who professed to be a member of the Communist

Party. Although the reasons for his contacts with these individuals are

not entirely clear, a review of Subject's statements reflects the follow-

On 10 April 1965, James Wilcott, hereafter referred to as Subject,

was in contact with one Ray Robinson Junior (NR-OS Indices), a representa-

tive of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee.

Subject to come to 1618 Corcoran Street, Washington, D. C. to meet a number

of integration movement people. According to Subject's statements, when

he arrived at this address a group of about eight people were sitting around

"drinking and smoking marijuana."" Among these was one Alex Passikloff

(NR-OS Indices), a self-admitted Communist.

After various discussion with members of the group, Subject agreed

to drive Passikloff and one Alfred Smith, a student at Howard University,

to New York City. They arrived in New York City about 5:00 a. m. on 1l April

1965, and went to the apartment of friends of Passikloff,

identified as

Joseph A. and Betty Rotandi (NR-OS Indices). The Rotandi's are also de-

scribed as dedicated Communist Party members. During this day, Subject,

Passikloff and the others visited an individual identified as Blyden Jackson

(NR-OS Indices) who is the head of a new organization called Council for

Jobs and Freedom of New York (NR-OS Indices. Subject and others also

"ended up" at the West Side W. E. B. Dubois Club in New York City. (The

W. E. B. Dubois Clubs are well identified as a new National Marxist organi-

zation, branded by J. Edgar Hoover as "spawned by the Cormunist Party,

U. S. A.")

6. There are a number of questions currently unanswered in the case

of the Subject persons.

Among these are: How long has James Wilcott

been involved in the SNCC movement?; Where was Elsie Wilcott during the

trip to New York City; and Why did James Wilcott allow himself to become

involved in this matter to the extent of going to New York City with these

persons and visiting other individuals who are allegedly self-admitted

Communists?

7.

Subject has apparently reported to his station at JMWAVE. How-

ever, it is believed that his involvement with the aforementioned individuals

is extremely serious, for the most part because of unanswered questions.

Therefore,

it is considered that he should be interviewed in depth as soon

as possible regarding his involvement in this matter. It is recommended
