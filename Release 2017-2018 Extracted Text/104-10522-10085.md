day to Mexi City by road.

On 27 Sept he went to Cuban Consulate General

to request visa to tranait Cuba because he was going to ita zo to Moscow

vla Habara.

Consul Busabio AZCUE told OSWALD that he would have to

consult his government, that the paper work required 10 to 12 days.

OSWALD, because of his Irritable character, became annoyed with AZCUE

and lalt the office slamming the door.

On

28 Sept OSWALD went to the

Consul General of the Sov Union to request a visa for Russla.

Ee said

In helping his case, that bis wife was a Sor citizen, that he was s

militant Comminist and had lived three yrs In Russia.

OSWALD told the

Soy Consul that he could verify this

quickly by calling his wife who was

at that time in New Orleans in a hotel.

The Sov Consul said he would

have to consult with his government and that ordinarily a case like thin

would take from three to four montha.

OSWALD Reain bacume annoyed as he

who 18 now hiding in place provided by CAs, We cannot quarantee ALVARADO's safety.

Wealth

of detail ALVARADO gives about events and personalities involed with OSWALD in Cub Emb.

1e striking, 3) At 1215 hrs Mexi time 27 Mov., CAS officer was admised by phone by

ECHEVERRIA that be had marrested Silvia today because he learned abe was attemptine to

leave Nex1 for Habana. Movever, Echoverría lator told LECAT that he had decided to rarrest

31lvla to avold any podsibility obs nicht eucapt to Cube and lator be unavallabla as a

witness.

Since ve had received no reply to yesterday's telegrem (MEXI TC72 - para 37 above)

ve have not requested Mexi gor to take y any action againat Silvla except to maintain

Increased surveillance of ber actívitles.

Echeverria later denied to LEGAT that he had any

specific concrete evidence that abe was about to leave for Cuba. We do not now know which

Echeverria statesents are accurats, It 18 quite possible, and even probable, that contra

dictory statements made by Echeverrla are explained by desire of COM to play down Importance

of OSWALD visit hers, Marl line st111 18 thr: OSKALD visit related solely to vian question.

Consistent with this Echeverrla stated to LEGAT that DORIICOS only Intarested in finding

out whather Maxl authoritles tried to pay a story iron 311r1a.

that according Echeverrie Silvla l0 beine taken to Attorney General's office to which

Mexi press bas easy eccess.

Possiblity of hateas corpus cannot be discounted. 4) We

have as yet found no trace of the red headed Cub negro described by ALVARADO, but are

continuing our search for hin.

5)

In addition to questions ralsed In yesterday's telegram

Washington should urgently consider feasibility of requesting Moxi authorities to arrest

for interrogation:

Eusebio AZCUS; Luisa CALDERON and Alfredo MIRABAL. The two men are

Cuban rationals and Cuban consular officers. Luida CALIERON 19 a dr secretary In Cuban

MEMO TO FBI fION WOFACT - An untested source recently furnished us with the foll Info be

allegedly received from a well known Cuba solentlot and acqualatance on 23 Nov 63, but which

he had forgotten to report. The release of the Warren Corn Report reminded bim of the inci-

dent. / The scientist said he had been at the Havana airport on afternoon of 22 Nov 63 wben

at 1700 hrs an aircraft with Mexi markings landed

and parked at far side of the field.

Two men, whom be recognized as Cuban & "gangsters" alighted, entered rear entrance of

administration bide and disappeared without going through normal customs procedures.

His

curiosity was aroused, and he was able to learn that the aircraft had just arrived from

Dallas, Texas, via Tijuana and Nex1 City. The plane had been forced to land at TiJuana due

to ongine trouble.

By combining the date, the orlgin of the fllyht, and the knom reputation

of the two men, he theorized that the two men must have been involved in assassination..

He speculated that OSWALD had acted In the pay of Castro, and that the two Cubane had been

in Dallas to organize or oversee the operation.

He told the source that he had been greatly

distressed by what he bad seen and teard and had to telll someone about 1t. He then cautioned

source not to tell anyone else about. it or they would mus both be shot by the Cubana. I

The source has passed away since fuminhing above info, thus making any follow-up on
