MEMORANDUM TO ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) COMMUNICATIONS TO FIELD OFFICES -- Communications of any

type sending instructions to field offices should be short, clear and sim-

ple. Use telegraphtype language. Reference prior communications to

avoid needless repetition of previous instructions.

(B) UTILIZATION OF LIAISON SECTION -- A reduction in the number of

Supervisors handling liaison with other Government agencies makes it

necessary that the time of the remainder be utilized most efficiently to

permit the productive handling of contacts with those agencies.

It is de-

sired that Supervisors refrain from designating mail for delivery by

Liaison unless a reason exists for such designation. Mail should and

will be delivered by Liaison if it requires discussion with or delivery to

a high-ranking official of another agency: if its sensitivity requires

special maning, ui il its contont roguires come explanation or comment.

In the absence of some such reason, mail should be designated for deliv

ery by the Courier Service or by regular mail.

Dissemination of Bureau reports and memoranda to other Govern-

ment agencies is the responsibility of the substantive Supervisor, and not

of the Liaison Section. Transmittal form 0-14 should be used whether

such dissemination is being made by Liaison, by Courier Service, or by

regular mail. Transmittal forms in the 0-14 series, sometimes referred

to as form routing slips, contain blocks to be checked which will inform

the addressee that no further investigation is contemplated, that the other

agency will be advised of pertinent developments, that the status of the

case is complete or incomplete, and that the item or items are being fur-

nished for the information of the addressee. The last notation is some-

times checked without any indication as to the status of the case or whether

further material may be expected, resulting in later inquiry from the ad-

dressee.. It is desired that when this form is utilized, it be fully executed.

If a Liaison Supervisor is being asked to pass information orally

to another agency, he should promptly be furnished an appropriate letter-

head memorandum or other communication which will confirm his oral

dissemination. Do not send serials to Liaison with a routing slip asking

"please handle" or "please pass information to --."

Affirmative contacts are being discontinued with twenty-four

agencies with which we have relatively few interests in common. Liai-

son Supervisors will, however, continue to handle urgent matters re-

quiring personal liaison with those agencies. Supervisors should con-

tinue to designate for the Liaison Section tickler copies of memoranda

discussing matters involving other Government agencies, and consider-

ation should be given to discussion of such matters with the Liaison

representative prior to preparation of memoranda in order that full facts

concerning our relations with the other agency may be ascertained.

Matters involving our relations with other agencies should be coordin-

ated, wherever possible, with the Liaison Supervisor at the outset. .

Very truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

SUBJECT: DISCONTINUANCE

OF LIAISON FUNCTIONS

ke my memorandum dated 7/15/70 in which I pointed

out that liaison was being discontinued with 65 agencies and

that six Agents from the Liaison Section are available for

reassignment. I contemplate using five of the six Agents to

some of

the existing vacancies in the Domestic Intelligence

Division which have been approved for filling.

The sixth agent

will be used to

staff the midnight to 8 a.m. Shift.

-This shift

has previously been

filled on a rotation basis by the Sections

! in the Division but the increased correspondence

engendered

¡by the reduction of liaison will not make it possible for

the

"Sections to spare a man for this shift.

certainly agree with the Director that contacts

with the agencies with which we will continue liaison can in a

great many instances be made by telephone and this was considered

in my request ior the retention vi liu'ee ageuis to porform liuison

with the agencies indicated in my memorandum. Even then, because

of the tremendous volume of business we have with these agencies,

it will be necessary for

the Section Chief and the Number One

Man to both perform active liaison functions outside the office,

visiting, as the other men do, the approved agencies.

These liaison contacts with whom we would be doing

business by phone must be developed and maintained by personal

contact and because of the substantial turnover in agencies,

new contacts must be constantly developed on a personal basis.

These remaining liaison men will also have to act as alternates

for one another during periods of leave or illness and where

emergency situations arise that require handling of an item when

the regular liaison Agent is otherwise engaged.

The liaison

assignments will be as follows:

1 118.C0:

DISCONTINUANCE OF LIAISON FUNCTIONS

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I have carefully looked into dis -

continuance of liaison functions and resultant release of Agent Supervisory personnel

for reassignment. I have reviewed the Director's instructions (pertinent memoranda

attached) and have conferred with various Bureau officials.

The Director instructed liaison be restricted to White House, Vice President

and National Security Council. Domestic Intelligence Division (DID) listed 65 agencies

being eliminated from liaison contact but also respectfully suggested continued liaison

with State, Air Force, Army, Navy, Secret Service, Internal Revenue and Civil

i Service.

DID feels that some disadvantage or possible criticism could result from

discontinuance of liaison with these key agencies.

At this point possible criticism or problems are anticipatory. Obviously

- 0:

we will be alert to such possibilities, and if problems arise, we will meet them and

:take such steps as are necessary to solve them.

We ran always modify our

procedures when it is in the Bureau's interests to do so. Furthermore, there appear

to be no question but that almost all business and necessary dissemination can be

handled by teletypes, letters, dissemination memoranda, or by telephone with con-

firmation in writing if necessary. Emergency or unusually delicate situations can

be handled by direct contact.

For above reasons, we should immediate fiscontinue liaison service

with all agencies except White House, Vice President, and National Security Council.

'Our teletype network to key agencies and our regular courier service will provide

expedite transmission. An emergency, such as a threat against the President, can

be handlec by phone with confirmation by letter. DID can prepare necessary in -

structions

and guidelines to implement our new procedures. Nine Agent Supervisors;

including a Section Chief, will be made available for other assignments:

Mr. Sullivan' also proposed one of Agents released from liaison be

designated permanent night supervisor on midnight to 8:00 Axe shiftin Did which

is presently filled on rotation basis. Sullivan points out additional correspondence

anticipated because of reduction in liaison, making it more anricult for various units

to spare men for midnight shift on rotation basis. There may be an increase but it

is impossible now to determine exact extent. DID should defer this request for 90

days to determine enemine mor

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Discontinuance of Liaison Functions

Mr. Sullivan pointed out in his memorandum (attached) that there are

'5 vacancies in DID (none at Section Chief or #l Man level -- SA R. L. Shackelford •

was promoted to Chief of Internal Security Section from Unit Chief level).'

Vacancies

are as follows: (!) Three in New Left Groups Unit, one caused by the promotion of

SA Shackelford -- replacement requested but not yet approved -- and two based on

request for additional personnel to handle sharply increased work load involving

violence-oriented groups. Two from Inspection Staff have been ordered under

transfer in. Transfers being held in abeyance. (2) One vacancy in Racial, Intelligence

Section based on request for additional supervisor to handle increased work load re

black militant groups -- approved and Agent under transfer in from Los Angeles.

(3) One vacancy in Subversive Individuals Unit caused by transfer of SAS. S.

Czarnecki to the Inspection Staff. Replacement approved but transfer in not yet

ordered.

In addition, there are 4 immediate vacancies in other Divisionsat Seat of

Government: two in Special Investigative Division and one in Crime Records

Division (Inspection Division memoranda recommending replacements attached).

« In addition, there is Section Chief vacancy in Administrative Division.

OBSERVATIONS:

Remaining functions will be liaison with Whiie House, Vice Fresident anu

- National Security Council plus supervision of Legal Attache Offices and related

: matters. These duties are now being handled by three Agent Supervisors. This is

not enough to justify continuance of Section; however, a new unit could be established

for administrative control consisting of Unit Chief and three Agent Supervisors. Unit

Chief would administer unit and also be responsible for irregular contacts with key

agencies to maintain effective relations and to resolve and avert incipient problems.

These matters have been discussed with Mr. Sullivan. While he does not

agree with extent of proposed cutbacks, feeling we should maintain liaison with

certain key agencies as set out in his previous proposals, he advises DID will

vigorously strive to effectively implement the new procedures.

If these proposals are approved, a total of nine Agent supervisors will be

removed from liaison, thus reducing approved DID Agent complement from 124 to 115.

Nine Agents being released from liaison assignment can be assigned as follows:"

for existing vacancies in DID; 2 transferred to existing vacancies in Special

Investigative Division; SA Bernard C. Rachner has been transferred to field; and

Section Chief Brennan to Administrative Division at no change in grade or salary

to replace Section Chief C. Q. Smith, who is retiring effective 7/31/70 (this has

been coordinated with Mr. Mohr and Mr. Callahan).

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, we are

discontinuing liaison contacts with all agencies except the

White House, The Office of the Vice President, and the

National Security Council. As a large volume of our work

with other agencies has been handled by the Liaison Super-

visors, we are recommending that those agencies be told that

our increased work and limited manpower require the use of

our Liaison Agents in other areas and it will be necessary

for them to utilize other means for the transaction of their

business with the Bureau.

We propose to advise the agencies that any requests

FOX.

jnformation. from Bureau files be referred to the Name Check

section by telephone or mail and that requests dealing with

matters of

Bureau policy be addressed to the Director in

viting.

rolophonic inguirios in situtions where time vill

not permit a written request and which involve Bureau policy

or current operations will be referred to the Office of the

interested Assistant Director.

Address

cards have been prepared and circulated to

all Bureau officials and stenographers covering those agencies

to whom any volume of Bureau mail has been addressed in the

past. It is not considered that address cards will be neces

saxy for the small agencies with whom we nave had infrequent

contact as a proper mailing address can be secured either by

telephone or from the Government Organization Manual.

We are carefully watching developments in the dis

continuance of direct liaison and will mate prompt recommen-

MR. FELT O

FROM . : MR. KINLEY

SUBJECT: Liaison Section

DATE: June 29, 1972

I would appreciate your observations and recom-

mendation on the following suggestion:

For many years, FBIHQ had a Liaison Section

which maintained official liaison with the head-

quarters

of other governmental departments and

agencies in Washington, D. C. The discontinuance

of that Liaison Section resulted in an attempt by

the Washington Field Office to handle many inquiries

of high-level officials of those departments and

agencies.

It should be noted, of course, that this

office of necessity maintains

liaison on

a relatively

low level with all governmental departments and

agencies to insure the prompt referral of cases and

to handle matters pertaining to the effective

operation of this office in the District of Columbia.

I feel that a reinstitution of the Liaison Section

in FBIll would place the high level fiaison with

other agencies at the headquarters level where it

would obviously be more effective.

LIAISON SECTION

You requested my observations and recommendations with regard

to the re-establishment of the Liaison Section,

The Liaison Section was broken up in July, 1970, and since that time

necessary and desirable liaison with other Federal agencies has been handled

by written communication as well as by direct contact with persons at various

levels at the Bureau with their counterparts in the other Federal agencies.

When the Liaison Section was discontinued it had grown too large and represented

a waste of manpower. 10 Agents, not including a Section Chief, were engaged

in handling domestic liaison with some 8i different agencies, many of which

obviously were of minor importance to our operations. Since that time necessary

liaison has not been handled as much by Washington Field Ofice as you indicated as

by supervisors and officials in FBIHQ. Washington Field Office's liaison with

other agencies relates almost entirely to the handling of leads and the Bureau's

routine business with those agencies.

I believe we could more efficiently and effectively handle our business

with the other major Federal agencies if we re-established a Liaison Unit of limited

size to handle only those agencies with which we have the greatest amount of traffic.

I propose we have a five-man Unit under the Chief of the existing Special Coordination

Unit (L. F. Schwartz);

SA Robert H. Haynes is currently in that Unit handling liaison with the

White House, the Vice President, and the National Security Coungil! To his

assignments we should add Secret Service;

SA John E. Manning Currently assists the Unit "Chief in handling télephone

inquiries. He could-be assigned to handle laison with the following.

Naval Investigative Service

Memo for Mr. Kinley

Re: Liaison Section

SA B. C. Rachner currently in this Unit could handle liaison with:

Department of State

Immigration and Naturalization Service

Treasury Department and related agencies with exception of

Secret Service

A 4th Agent could handle Central Intelligence Agency and related committees:

• U. S. Intelligence Board

Signal Intelligence Committee

Security Committee

Watch Committee

Technical Surveillances Countermeasures

Interagency Defector Committee

A 5th Agent could handle:

Nalional Security Agency

Atomic Energy Commission

U. S. Postal Service

Department of Transportation

Under the above proposed arrangement we would have five Agents handling

the major agencies with which we regularly need to resolve problems and handle

the greater volume of our business slating to other agencies. This Unit could be

effectively supervised by its present Chief (Schwartz) and would function under

A. J. Decker, Jr., Chief and G. A. Day, Number One Man of the Nationalities

Intelligence Section. Both Decker and Day are highly competent for this kind of

supervisin and administration, it being noted that Day is our top expert on liaison

matters, having served as Number One Man in the old Liaison Section. Two other

supervisors in the Unit (R. A. Bermingham and H. C. Flemister, Jr.) would

continue to handle foreign liaison, to which they are presently assigned, including

the supervision of Legat operations. A third Agent would need to be added for

supervision of foreign liaison to replace Rachner; who is now engaged in these

raressert good picnic rise

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Special Coordination Unit be renamed Liaison Unit and organized

along the lines indicated above with Unit Chief Schwartz; 5 Agents handling domestic

liaison; and three Agents to handle foreign liaison. If approved, this would require.

the assignment of three additional Agents to this Unit.

The supervision of our foreign liaison representatives

was not affected by the conversion in 7/70 of the Liaison

Section to the Special Coordination Unit. That responsibility

continues to be handled in the Special Coordination Unit in

the same mainer as it was handled in the former Liaison Section.

This memorandum, therefore, is addressed to the question of

the Bureau's domestic liaison pnerations.

Former Liaison Section

The objective of the Liaison Section was, through

the development of high-level contacts in appropriate U.S.

agencies, to insure that the Bureau's business with those

agencies was accomplished promptly, effectively, economically,

and with a minimum of jurisdictional or policy problems.

By the establishment of effective liaison contacts, we sought

to recognize and solve minor problems before they became

major problems requiring protracted and/expendive negotiations

between the Bureau and other agencies.

Procedures under Liaison Section

The

objectives cited above were achieved by placing

"seasoned Bureau representatives f broad experience in cortact

the Bureau either

In the former Lizison section, ten agents maintained liaison

their operations and established a close personal rapport with

high-level officials in those agencies. For example, in matters

of major importance the liaison Agent could make immediate

personal contact with. "Cabinet officers, directors of bureaus and

many other officials of the highest level..

When our investiga

tions required interviews of persons of this caliber, the inter-

views would be handled by the liaison Agents in order that the

interviews could be accomplished without delay and with a

minimum of inconvenience to the official involved.

Many of these

high-level contacts were the result of years of development by

the Bureau liaison representatives and through them we vere able

to obtain assistance which might otherwise have been difficult

or impossible to obtain. Some examples of this type of support

National Security Agency-One of the Bureau's

secure telephone systems was provided and

installed by this Agency at no cost to the

Bureau, a

savings of approximately $150,000.

Through high-lovel contacts in this Agency,

we have also

• been able to secure the results

of its technical research which might have

been difficult or expensive to obtain through

other sources.

Post Office Our close association with the

Chief Postal Inspector and his top officials

has resulted in that agency providing support

in some of our most delicate intelligence

operations looking to the identification of

illegal hostile intelligence activities in

this country.

State Department-In addition to providing

at no cost to the Bureau another secure

telephone network and making available to the:

Bureau worlawide cable facilities of the State

Department, our high level contacts in this

Department have.on many occasions assisted in:

the speed.resolution of complicated.investigative...c.

problems both in the criminal and security fields.

An. excellent example would be the support provided

by the Passport Office of the State Department in

Identifying James Earl Ray as the assassin of

Nartin Luther King.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Felt

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Military Agencies-The military intelligence

agencies have consistently provided excellent

support to the Bureau in both the security and .

criminal fields. Much of this is due to the

high-level liaison contacts developed over the

years

with these agencies. In the Yablonsky

murder case, the military provided, on very

short notice at no cost to the Bureau, an

expert diving team which was able to locate

one of the weapons involved which was an

essential piece of evidence in this crime.

Likewise, the military has been able to provide

a wealth

of deceptive information to be used

in our double agent operations directed against

soviet-bloc

intelligence agencies.

Inmigration and Naturalization Service

Through high-level contacts with this service,

we have been able to arrange vith a minimum of

compiicated paper work the speedy deportation

of persons entering the United States who are

considered to be threats to the internal security,

such as Arab terrorists sent to the United States

on assassination missions.

In many other instances: through close established

Iiaison, we were able to avoid the development of situations

in other agencies which could have resulted in operational

problems for the Bureau.

Our Liaison, for example, with the

President's Commission on the Causes

and Prevention of

Violence and the Commission on Civil Rights provided advance

information concerning possible publications or statements

by those commissions which could have reflected adversely

on the Bureau.

• Under these ; procedures, the Bureau, liaison repre-?..

sentative would be visiting the agencies assigned to him on

a fraquent basis so that officials.of..those.agoncies would

be able

to discuss potential policy problems with him

'before making them a matter of formal correspondence with

the Bureau.

In many of these situations, the Bureau liaison

representative, being fully conversant with bureau policies

and

procedures,

would immediately resolve the question to

the satisfaction of both the Bureau and the official of the

RE:

LIAISON SECTION

Special Coordination Unit

Objectives of the Special Coordination Unit, while

similar to those previously stated for the former Liaison

Section,

are necessarily. less broad and are directed more

towards

facilitating the resolution of problems raised by

other agencies than producing effective action by other

agencies on behalf of the FBI.

Procedures under Special Coordination Unit

Under the current setup, two Agents assigned to

the Special Coordination Unit are hanaling our domestic

Liaison work.

One of these is assigned to liaison with

The White House,

the Vice President, and the National Security

Council. He is

backed up by the other Agent who also attends

meetings of various intelligence committees and assists the

Unit Chief in handling inquiries from other agencies doing

business with the Bureau.

We have been able in our current system to carry

on an effective liaison operation primarily because of the

quality and number of high-level contacts which had been

developed under the previous Liaison Section system.

Although effective, this has really been a holding operation

largely

dependent upon the existing reservoir of well

developed contacts. Due to transfers and retirements in

the most important agencies with which we do business, our

established contacts have been deteriorating so that we

are approaching

the point of diminishing returns.

• situation could be reversed if we had sufficient man power

to visit the more important agencies, renew old contacts and

establish new ones.

Currently, with .the exception.of.our liaison with

The White House, the Vice President and the National Security

Council, our liaison with other egencies is primarily dependent

upon

those

agencies contacting

the Special Coordination Unit

Re: LIAISON SECTION

Costs

In measuring the cost of a domestic liaison operation,

the only measurable cost is the total salary for personnel

involved. Liaison Agents are normally selected from among

Supervisors of GS-15 caliber ($25, 583-$33, 260); that is, men

who have the ability and experience required to handle a

Unit Chief's job or a job of similar responsibility. Based

on current median salaries, there is set out below a comparison

of the annual salary cost of the former Liaison Section and

the current Special Coordination Unit. In considering these

figures, it should be recognized that the Section Chief and

Number One Man in the lormer Liaison section, and the Unit

Chief in the present Special Coordination Unit devoted only

part of their time to domestic liaison, and also supervised

the coordination of our offices abroad and the investigation

of the many "Foreign Police Cooperation" cases handled in

the United States in reciprocity for the work done for us

abroad. The former Liaison Section also handled other

matters, now absorbed

elsewhere, such as emergency planning

and the Bureau's participation in the NATO Special Committee.

such as savings in reduced paper work, savings in man hours

i consultation, savings in the elimination ot unnecessary

or duplicative investigative effort and, of overriding

importance, the increasing of our operational effectiveness

through the establishment of good will with other agencies.

These savings oifset to a considerable degree the increased

salary expenditure.

Conclusion

Although we enjoy a strong operational relationship

with other agencies, including the intelligence agencies,

wherein in many instances we have face-to-face meetings

at

the desk level with counterparts in other agencies, we

believe that from the overall standpoint the Bureau can

profit fron the assignment of three additional Liaison Agents

to this work.

We are not recommending that ve enter into

lizison functions as broadly as we were engaged in ile past

as we believe such an expenditure would not be justified.

What we are recommending is the assignment of one-half the

personnel which had previously been assigned to direct

liaison functions at less than one-half the previous cost.

I recommend re-establishment of a Liaison Section on the

restricted basis outlined above. The Liaison Section should maintain

smooth and continuing contact with top officials in the intelligence com-

munity and related departments. We would not change in any way very

effective liaison maintained by other divisions with Congress, Budget

Bureau, Civil Service Commission, Department of Transportation in

connection with hijackings and security matters, etc. This action would

eliminate any remnants of criticism concerning our liaison. We would

set up strict guidelines and carefully select our personnel to insure that

we would get the type of liaison outlined above. We would guard against

it becoming a mail courier operation.

I recommend the re-establishment of the Liaison Section

and the adding of three additional agents to implement this.

Mr. Gray's approval of the re-establishment of a liaison section

included an instruction that the section not supervise offices overseas and in

foreign countries. As this work is so basic to the responsibilities of a

liaison section, I am respectfully presenting several points for Mr. Gray's

consideration in the hope that he will reconsider this prohibition.

The supervision of the foreign offices is handled by three men

who review the correspondence with our Legats. resolve their numerous

problems and handle their many contacts win visit Washington. The latter

also visit other United States agencies while here, requiring coordination which

can best be arranged by a domestic liaison supervisor familiar with the

agency in question. In addition, some of the foreign agencies with which

our Legats are deeply involved

maintain representatives in Washington.

These include RCMP, MI-5, MI-6, and the Australian Security Intelligence

Organization. These foreign representatives regularly visit the Bureau

to discuss the various requirements which have been made of them by their

headquarters. The foreign liaison supervisors simply do not have the time

to handle these persons in addition to their regular work, and this responsibility, -

which for many years was handled in the front office of the former liaison section,

is now temporarily being handled in the front office of the section to which the

foreign liaison supervisor's are attached. The processing of the requests made

by these men and the discussion of their problems with them is a matter of

basic liaison and should logically be handled by whoever will be in charge

of the new liaison section, The courtesy and attention which is given to:

the requests made by these foreign liaison representatives in Washington

Re: LIAISON SECTION

with other agencies is handled by domestic liaison supervisors dealing with

those agencies. In similar fashion the British will not furnish derogatory

information directly to the Department of Defense in connection with its

background-type investigations but require that such data be channeled

through FBI. These are just two of the instances in which a foreign liaison

.. matter becomes a domestic liaison matter and should be under the same

supervision.

Our foreign offices are necessarily closely involved in the

operations of several U. S. agencies and require domestic liaison with those

agencies. Our many problems surrounding the establishment and maintenance

of foreign offices have to be coordinated with the Department of State. It is

essential that we know and have access to the proper official at State in order

to solve problems faced by the Legats as without prodding State moves very

slowly. Our foreign offices work closely with the Central Intelligence

Agency(CIA) stations abroad. CIA Headquarters does not permit its overseas

stations to disseminate information to other agencies overseas, including our

Legats, except in unusual circumstances. They frequently, however, suggest

to our Legats that CIA Headquarters be asked for particular items.

These

can most rapidly be secured by direct request from a domestic liaison

supervisor. In a number of areas, our Legal Attaches work closely with

local representatives of the U.S. military. Leads are passed to our Legat

which are then followed up by liaison contacts in Washington with the appropriate

military headquarters.

Liaison, or, in other terms, the establishment of a harmonious

relationship, is basically the same whether practiced in Washington or Tokyo.

I feel that it would be to the Bureau's advantage to have our liaison operations

closely coordinated and directly supervised in the same area. This has proved

to be an efficient and productive arrangement in the past, and we believe that

the re-establishment of limited direct liaison in Washington should be handled

by the same

supervision which has been given to our posts abroad. The work in

both areas is primarily intelligence oriented, yet does not fall within the

normal responsibilities of the present operational sections. It is considered

that we should not leave the foreign supervision in its present area; which is

fully occupied with Arab terrorism, Chinese espionage, ard Cuban, Arab,

Chicano and Jewish extremists. A logical and economical step would be to

make the present foreign liaison supervision an integral part of the new

Liaison section. Under this arrangement, the foreign liaison supervision

would be handled as a separate and distinct unit composed of the three

supervisors.presently engaged in this. work. This unit would be completely

SUBJECT LIAISON SECTION

--

Since I think my recommendations to you may possibly be

the source of the confusion that appears to have resulted from your

order approving the reestablishment of the Liaison Section, this

memorandum is written in an effort to dispel the confusion,

When the recommendation was made to you to reestablish a

Liaison Section, I recommended you reestablish the Section but the Section

as reestablished should not operate in the same way as the old Liaison

Section had operated, according to my understanding.

Specifically, i recommended that the reconstituted Section should

have responsibility only over liaison with other agencies and should not

operate out of ine Domestic intelligence Division (DID). I suggested that

the proper location within the Bureau for the new Section might be an

appropriate topic for discussion at an ExecutivesConference meeting.

Supervision of foreign Legats, which supervision had been

included among the responsibilities of the old Liaison Section, would,

under my proposai, continue to be handled within the DID and thus would

not be handled by the reconstituted Liaison Section.

This recommendation was based on the assumption that the

foreign Legats have seen their responsibilities increased in recent years

to include the collection of political intelligence information for dissemination

to Dr, Kissinger and others. If they are going to do intelligence work. it

seemed appropriate for them to be supervised by the FBI's intelligence

division,

"s';

You ordered that the new Section not supervise offices overseas

and in foreign countries. If this order was in sny way based upon my

recommendation to you, my recommendation should not have been accepted

unless you were also prepared to order that the new Section would not,

As he requested, each Agent assigned to domestic liaison has had

prevzous liaison experience and, with one exception, each was

assigned to the former Liaison Section.

Each of these men is

currently assigned to this Division and no replacements are being

requested.

Each of the domestic liaison men has had at least

twenty years' experience in the FBI, has had wide field, experience,

and is thoroughly seasoned in Bureau policy. /Ile/fallowing arg

Section Chiêt - Graham A. Day, GS-15: I have carefully

evaluated not only the supervisors in this Division but also those

elsewhere in the Bureau who have had experience in liaison opera-

tions and I have concluded that day is the best qualified for this

position from the standpoint of experience and specialized back~

ground.

Headquarters liaison is entirely different from field

operations and requires a

thorough knowledge both of the problems

and policies of the domestic and

foreign fields and of the opera-

tions of the major agencies here in Washington with which we have

interests in common. Day has had extensive liaison experience,

having served as Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and

having handled top liaison assignments prior thereto. He is cur-

rently serving as Number One Man in the Nationalities Intelligence

Section, in which Section the present Special Coordination Unit

is located, and has continued to directly supervise both domestic

ana foreign liaison ever since discontinuance of the Liaison section.

Prion: to his assignment to Headquarters, he was security coordinator

in the Los Angeles Office, supervising more than 150 Agonts assigned

Schwartz was assigned to the previ-

with both top and working level personnel in other U. S. agencies as

well as having represented the Bureau on several of the U. S. Intelli

Prior to dissolution of the Liaison Section,

he was given a special citation by the U. S. Air Iorce in appreciation

for the liaison which he was then maintaining with that service.

Schwartz has recently been handling the numerous telephone calls from

other areas of the Executive Branch and has thereby continued his

•Re: LIAISON SECTION

For a number of years, McDonnell handled our liaison with NSA and

was directly responsible for some of the major contributions NSA

has made to FBI work.

He is widely known and respected at NSA and

other agencies with which he has dealt. He is currently SIC of a

unit within the Nationalities Intelligence Section. He had broad

supervisory experience in New York Office prior to transfer to FBIHQ,

serving as supervisor of the major case squad in the Criminal Section,

and subsequently of the Satellite Section handling Soviet-bloc

espionage matters. He later became Number One Man to the SAC of

the Espionage Division of the New York Office..

He enjoys a first-name relationship

with the Secret Service Director and has an encyclopedic knowledge

of State, including contacts at all levels. He is currently assigned

to the woreign Liaison

Desk where many State Department officials

continue to telephone him to bring up matters of interest to the

?

SUJECT: PERSONNEL CHANGES

You previously approved the establishment of a Liaison

Section and the purpose of this memorandum therefore is to submit

the names of candidates to fill the position of Chief of this Section.

On 10-11-72 available members of the Personnel Selection

Board met in my office, consisting of myself and Messrs. Walters, Miller,

Bishop, Callahan, Dalbey, Jenkins, Conrad, Baker and Bates. In view of

the pending transfers of SACs Kunkel and McDermott, I did not invite them

to attend the meeting; however, in the future I intend to utilize the services

of nearby SACs.

With the exception of Assistant Director Baker: all memhers

have recommended the following 3 employees and they are, in order of

preference, SA Graham A. Day, ASAC James J. Dunn, and SA Homer A,

Boynton. Mr. Baker recommended, in his order of preference, SA Boynton,

ASAC Dunn and SA Day.

1. SA Graham A. Day, No. 1 Man, Nationalities Intelligence Section, DID.

He entered on duty 1-4-43, is in Grade GS-15, age 60, married, 2 children,

He reported to DID 11-11-54, served as No., 1 Man of the former Liaison

Section from 3/61 until 7/70 when the section was disbanded and since 5/10/72

has served in his current position. Mr. Day's age, length of service at FBIHQ.

were carefully considered during the meeting; nevertheless, with the exception

of Mr. Baker, the others present, including me, feel that Day is without a

doubt the most qualified employee to fill this particular position. He has had

vast experience in liaison work and even in his current position has continued

: to directly supervise both domestic and foreign liaison functions. He has a

thorough knowledge of the problems and policies of the domestic and foreign

fields and of the: operations of the major agencies here in Washington: He

'is without doubt the Bureau's top expert on liaison matters andie has, many

top-level contacts in Government. It was also pointed ouf that during the

critical initial stages of re-establishing our liaison functions it is essential

that the man heading the section be exceptionally strong in this field and Day

certainly fulfills this requirement.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi

nation sustte your Committee.

Its use is lunted to official proceedings by

your Committee and the cortent may nut be disclosed to unauthorized person

Mi. Gray has approved the reconstitution of the Liaison

Section and has appointed SA Homer Boynton of the New York Office

as the Section Chief.

In line with this and pursuant to Mr. Gray's

request that Section personnel be selected who have had previous

Liaison Section experience, I have prepared the attached organi-

zational chart indicating the new personnel and their assignments.

Lach of the Domestic Liaison Supervisors, with one exception, was

assigned to the former Liaison Section; each is currently assigned

to this Division and no replacements are being requested; and each

has had at least twenty years' experience in the FBI with wide

experience both in the field and at FBI Headquarters. My memo-

rendum 9/27/7s contained full details concerning these men and

their assignnents.

The

appointment of SA Boynton has necessitated

some changes and the following is a summary of the anticipated

assignments:

that the new section Chier be given the benerit of the most expe-

Washington with which the new Section will deal. SA Day was

Number One Man of the former Liaison Section and supervised what

remained of our domestic liaison after its dissolution.

The men handling both our domestic and foreign liaison

for the Bureau have been carefully selected on the basis

of their background and experience to effectively represent the

Bureau at the highest levels of important foreign and domestic

agencies. All of these men will be meeting frecently with !!. s.

and foreign officials of the highest rank, which will include

Cabinet officers, Ambassadors and heads of important domestic and

foreign agencies.

In order to carry out their assignments in the most

effective manner, I believe that it is important that these men

be recognized as

much as possible by the officials they are con-

tacting as key representatives of the FBI. This procedure has been

followed in the past with regard to the two Bureau representatives

handling our liaison with Congress and the American Bar Association,

both of whom carry the title of Inspector. This has been found

to be highly beneficial in assisting these individuals in fulfilling

their important liaison responsibilities and I feel it should be

Re: Liaison Section

ADDENDUM ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION

.11/24/72

There are currently 36 Special Agents who have credentials with

title of Inspector. Most are Number One Men to Assistant Directors or to

Acting Associate Director or assigned to Inspection Division. About six or

seven carry the title of Inspector so as to give them stature as Bureau

representatives above the rank of Special Agent in keeping with their duties

requiring them to represent the Bureau in significant contacts in the

Congressional, diplomatic, Government agency, business, and private sectors.

Although I feel the issuance of Inspector's credentials should be restricted as

much as possible, the duties of our liaison agents are such as to quality them

for the temporary title of Inspector for the duration of their liaison assignment

and at no change in grade or salary. Upon reassignment from liaison duties

authority to carry Inspector's credentials should be automatically terminated.

ADDENDUM W. M. FELT

11-27-72:

I have carefully considered the information submitted by Domestic

Intelligence and Administrative Divisions as to the conferring of the title

Inspector on the 10 supervisors currently assigned to the Liaison Section,

However, I do not feel that the best interests of the Bureau will be served

in the long run by taking favorable action. I am convinced that to accede

to this request would result in similar requests from other divisions, many

of which would appear to be as justified as the issue currently in hand.

In the long run therefore, we would, in a sense, be lessening the importance

of the Inspector's title in the Bureau.

Moreover, I can also foresee problems in reassigning a man from

such duties and removing the Inspector's title from him. Such action would

be in the form of a demotion in accordance with the Veterans' Preference

Act which specifically states 30 days advance written notice must be furnished

to an employee if he is reduced in grade, salary or rank. If we were to

advise an employee that this title was temporary and would be in effect only

for the duration of his current assignment we would still have to abide by the

law in giving the employee 30 days' advance written notice. Therefore, in

considering all ramifications of this matter, approval is not given to the

recommendation.

First and foremost, I want to clarify a point you have raised in

your memoranda, namely that our loreign Liaison ulaces, wiüh the encepuici

We do not have the legal right to establish any foreign

offices on an operational basis. The law specifically limits foreign intelli

additional liaison offices at Manila, Philippines; Rio de Janeiro,

SUBJECT.: EXPANSION OF FOREIGNJLIAISON

On 10/12/71 I met, at their request, with Ambassador

Hymberley Coerr, Deputy Director of the Bureau of Intelligence

and Research, Department of State, and P. Glynn Mays, also

of the Department of State but assigned to the National Security

council, Under secretaries Committee, Also present was sA

Graham A. Day of this Division.

The State representatives advised that the Director's

letter of 9/20/71 to Secretary Rogers requesting clearance for

six new liaison posts abroad had been

referred to the Committee

for clearance. As part of their normal procedure, the views of

the affected Ambassadors were solicited with the result that a

number of questions were raised.

State is currently in the process

of effecting a five per cent reduction in U.S. personnel overseas

and each Ambassador was concerned with the proposed increase in

the personnel complement with which he is charged. Several

Ambassadors asked what information might be given

to the host

government and others inquired as

to why their post had been

selected.

1.:

Both Coerr and Mays appeared to be genuinely cooperative

and indicated that

they merely wanted our assistance: in preparing.

brief material which might be forwarded to the Ambassadors as

a general response to their inquiries.

They were pleased to

learn that a number of the new posts will be, in effect, acting

as regional offices, covering more than one country. No question

was raised, and of course no comment was made, concerning the

dévelopment of high-level intelligence and it was explained that,

as in the case with our other posts, our representatives will be

establishing and maintaining liaison with the police and other

investigative agencies of the countries visited in order to

expedite and insure the thorough handling of leads abroad arising

Irom the Bureau's domestic investigations.

It was explained that three of the new posts (Manila,

Rio de Janeiro and Santo Domingo) represent a reopening of

offices formerly

in existence and that only one post (New Delhi)

will be in a country not previously covered.

Dear Ax. Irwin:

Ambassador Wymberley Coerr and Mr. R. Glynn Mays

of your Department have asked for additional details with

reference to my letter of September 20, 1971, to Secretary

Rogers.

Specific questions were raised concerning the

location of the proposed new posts and concerning our

method of operation when they are established.

In goneral, our need for additional liaison

abroad stems from the constantly increasing travel abroad

of United States citizens under investigation in this

country, for example, Just five

a total of 653 persons wanted in

located through requests initiated by our legal attaches.

In Iiscal 19f1, 2uuy such persons were located. In Iiscat

1900, slightly more than 5300,000 in property stolen in the

United States was located abroad; while in fiscal 1971,..

nearly $1,500,000 of such property was so located. In

response to earlier programs aimed at reducing United States

personnel abroad, I closed our posts at lianila, Rio de Janeiro

end santo Domingo and endeavored to cover those areas by

road trip from other posts. This has resulted in inevitable

delays and in materially increased travel costs. As a

result, when the President asked that I increase our liaison

activities abroad, I

suggested the reopening of these three

posts.

Our method of operation at each post will continue,.

as in the past, to include the development and haintenance

of a close, cooperative relationship with the police and

The

MANILA, PHILIPPINES Our liaison post vas

originally opened in Manila in August,

1961, and was closed on August 31, 1969,

in an effort to reduce overseas casts:

Although relatively close to long Kong,

from which the area has since been covered,

the volume of our works in the Philippines is

such that it can best be handled by a man

on the scene as we have encountered numerous

delays in our efforts to secure information

at long distance.

The continued United States

military presence in the Philippines, coupled

•with the large number of Philippine nationals

who have become involved in difficultles in

the United States and then returned to their

home, has resulted in the continuation of a

relatively large vork load in this area.

has become apparent that prompt coverage

can only be secured through direct and

continuing liaison with the investigative

agencies of this huge country.

SANTO DOMINGO, DOMINICAN REPUBLIC

This office, originally opened lay 21,

1965, was closed March 18, 1969, as an

economy measure and coverage has been

maintained by Agents assigned to the FBI

office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It is

proposed that the Agent assigned to

Santo Domingo will initiate coverage in

Haiti. There is a considerable population

oi Dominican exiles residing in the

United States who continue to be involved

with the various puiiiivai iuctivis in the

Dominican Republic, thereby creating

problems of IBI interest in connection with

the Neutrality Act, the Foreign Agents

Registration Act and other maiters alfecting

Internal security interests. To a smaller

extent, this is also true of Haiti.

Although my request for this limited expansion

was nade at the specific instruction of the President, I

know that he would not sanction an operation which was not

economically worthwhile. You way be assured that, as in

the past, these new posts will be carelully supervised an

prompt action taken should it be determined either that

their continued existence is not warranted or that additional

assistance is necessary. I hope that it will be possible

for you to secure the requisite clearances in the near future.

Sincerely yours,

EXPANSION OE FOREIGN LIAISON

on 11/2/71 we calied Mr. R. Glynn Mays, who is

assigned by the Department of State to the National Security

Council Under Secretaries Committee, and inquired concerning

when we could expect a response to our letters of'9/20/71

and 10/14/71 regarding the opening of six additional foreign

and dressed 9/29019180

liaison posts.

Mays stated that Bureau letter 9/20/71 had been

referred to the National Security Council Under Secretaries

Committee as that group is responsible for the establishment

and alteration of overseas personnel ceilings.

Inasnuch as

each U. S. Ambassador is a personal representative of the

President

and is not subservient to the Department of State,

inquiries were sent to the six affected Ambassadors regarding

their concurrence in our proposal.

Each of the Ambassadors

responded by raising

various questions concerning such

matters as what information might be given to the host

government, FBI

as to why their particular post had been chosen. These

inquiries resulted in the visit of Ambassador Wymberley Coerr,

Deputy Director

of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

and Mr. Mays to the Bureau on 10/12/71 as reported in my

memorandum of that date.

As a result of that memorandum,

a detailed letter dated 10/14/71 was forwarded to Under

Secretary of State John N. Irwin II furnishing specifics,

concerning our overseas operations and our reasons for

selection of the posts involved..

Mays stated that upon receipt of the second letter,

individual responses were prepared and forwarded to each

the six Ambassadors who had raised questions. Replies are

still pending, and Mays said he knew no way of hurrying the

Ambassadors short of telephoning them. It was pointed out

to him that nearly a month and a half had elapsed since the

original request, which had been made at the instruction of

the President. He was asked to communicate our concern at

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON:

reii

R. Glynn Mays of the Department of State who has

been handling, on a working level, our request to expand our

foreign liaison telephoned 11/4/71. He stated that the

affected Ambassadors had been canvassed again for their

concurrence

and each had raised a number of additional questions.

He explained that basically, the Ambassadors were chafing

at a request for expansion at a time when the Government is

in the throes of additional contraction in its overseas posts,

and

he indicated that a number of the Ambassadors had pointed

out that there are existing arrangements under which FBI

leads can be handled in their territory and they do not under-

stand, based on the small volume of work they have witnessed

in the past, why FBI wishes to station a man in the territory

full time.

With reference to our request to open in Kuala

Lumpur, Malaysia, he said he would like us to authorize him

to caploro tho possibility of oponing in Singapore as za

alternative.

He stated an overwhelming percentage of the

personnel in the American Embassy at Kuala Lumpur are actually

sentatives.

Mays said that Ambassador Coerr, who had visited

the Bureau with Mays 10/12/71 to discuss

our request, had

, suggested that there be a further discussion at which the

numerous questions raised by the Ambassadors could be dis-

_cussed.

Mays asked whether Assistant Director Miller and/or

another Bureau representative could come to the Department.

of State on 11/8/71 so that other interested State officials

could participate in the discussion.

Mays was told that the

a Presidential instruction and that it had already, been 7:

He was told that we felt

no useful purpose would be served by further discussion of

operational details but that if the Department of State

had questions it desired answered, it should address them

manner.

We made no comment concerning the proposal to

are very close and we see no objection to the change).

Mays said he understood our position and would

to his superiors. He indicated that the

United

Nations Chinese problem and the Congressional action

concerning foreign aid had occupied the full time of the

top personnel at State with the result that they are not

familiar with the latest developments surrounding our

request. It is quite apparent that unless we call a halt

as we have done in our discussion with Mays today, we could

continue conferences and discussions endlessly without

achieving our objective. With reference to the implied

questioning of the volume of FBI work in the new areas, it

should be noted that our selection of the locations for the

new posts was based not on work load but on potential for

production of high level intelligence of interest to the

White House.

This has not, of course, been included in

either our letters to State or our discussion with its

SUBJECT: EXPANSION OF (FOREIGN LIAISON

As instructed, I met on 11/24/71 with Stäte Under

II; Deputy Under Secretary William

B. Macomber, Jr.; his Executive Assistant, Samuel R. Gammon;

Wymberley Coerr,

Deputy Director, Bureau of Intelligence and

Research; and R. Glynn Mays of State's Methods and Systems

Staff.

I was accompanied by SA Graham A. Day of this Division.

Mr. Irwin, who was unable to stay for the entire meeting,

stated he was most appreciative.

of

the Director's rapid and

cooperative response to his request for further discussion.

He pointed out that he has a tremendous respect for the Director

and for the organization which he has built and has instructed

his personnel at State to do everything in their power to

Iulfill the FBI request. He noted that the request did, however,

represent a substantial

problem for State and that he had

asked for discussion because of

the difficulties which State

had encountered.

State is fully aware of President Nixon's instruction

that FBI liaison activities be expanded.

The President has

also, however, instructed that the official profile of the

United States

be lowered abroad and that & five percent

across-the-board reduction in United States overseas personnel

be made.

Coming as it does on the heels of President Johnson's

fifteen percent reduction and President Nixon's earlier ten

percent reduction, this has created serious staffing problems

in each U. S. Embassy.

As the Ambassador's concurrence is

necessary before any new personnel can be sent abroad, each

of those potentially affected by our expansion was consulted

by State and each one raised serious objections. Some, as

will be indicated below, questioned the necessity for an Agent

to be stationed in their countries and several, pointing to

the current expansion of the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous

Drugs, which is also being strongly resisted, asked why one.

Justice representative could not represent both agencies.

As a result,

both Mr. Irwin and Mr. Macomber asked that we

take a hard

look at our proposals to see if some adjustments

could be made which would result in a smalder overall increase

in our overseas-personnel.

Memorandum E. S. Miller to Mr. Rosen

Re: EXPANSION OF FOREIGN LIAISON

I pointed out that there would be no possibility

of our "doubling up" with Narcotics investigators, explaining

that our functions and methods of operation are totally

different and would actually be incompatible in some areas.

noted that our modest request had actually been scaled

down before it was forwarded to State and that we had limited

each office to a singlé Agent with only one Clerk-Stenographer.

I referred to the detailed explanation for our request which

had been furnished in our letter of 10/14/71 to Mr. Irwin

and stated that we would not have made the request if we

had not felt it fully justified

and responsive to the

President's instruction. I said that we would, however,

carefully consider each part of the request once more to

see if there was any way

in which the total number of personnel

involved might be reduced.

It was agreed that following this

review, we would meet again for further discussion during

the week of November 29, 1971. Comments and recommendations

29, 1971.

concerning the specific areas follow:

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The Agency for International Development Mission

here has been withdrawn in the face of local criticism of

U.S. efforts to influence the Brazilian Police.

We have

been covering this enornous country from our office in

Argentina on a 2,500 mile round trip basis. No criticism

has been made of

our liaison contacts with the Brazilian

Police or other agencies,

and we feel we should insist on

reopening our office here. By reducing our staff in

Buenos Aires by one

Agent and one clerk (hich we intended

to do anyway)? reopening this office will result in no

Increase in personnel.

Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

There is an abnormally large percentage of Central

Intelligence Agency personnel here on both an overt and covert

basis,

and the addition of another investigative agency is

feared by the Ambassador as objectionable to the Malaysian

Government which is endeavoring to maintain a neutral position.

State asks that we let them explore the possibility of opening

in Singapore

instead of Kuala Lumpur.. Singapore is extremely

close and is

actually a better location from the standpoint

of travelers both east and west as Singapore is a normal

international aviation stop.

We believe Singapore would

be

just as good a location as

Kuala Lumpur and recommend that

State be asked

to make

"the necessary arrangements without

further delay.

As indicated in memorandum 11/29/71, we had an

appointment to discuss our expansion

further with Deputy

Under Secretary of State Macomber at 3:30 p.m., 11/30/71.

At noon on 11/30/71, Mr. Macomber's office advised that he

had been unexpectedly summoned by the Secretary of State

to a meeting which would occupy the balance of the aiternoon,

and we were asked to postpone our discussion until 12/2/71..

I stated that I was quite anxious to resolve this matter

without further delay and asked to meet with other State

representatives to discuss our proposal as originally planned. '

Accordingly, we met with Ambassador Wymberley Coerr, Deputy

Director. of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research;

Samuel R. Gammon, Executive Assistant to Mr. Macomber; and

R. Glynn

Mays of State's Methods and Systems Staff. I was

above all of the over-all percentage decreases made in other

'posts.

He said that the situation in Manila was so critical

that he would ask that we discuss it further with the Director

to see whether we might. open in Canberra, Australia,: in place..

of Manila, possibly covering. the Philippines from Canberra,

In addition, Mr. Mays said that the Ambassador in New Delhi

we had expressed doubt whether there was sufficient EBI work in

India to justify stationing a man there. Mays asked for

figures which State could use to support our request.

Forest

I stated that we were

faced with a situation in

which the President had, on September 20, 1971, asked the

' Dixector to expand his liaison operations abroad and that

here we were more than two months later without having taken

a single action in direct response to the President's

instruction.

I pointed out that it seemed to me that the President's instruction

should take precedence over any Ambassadorial question and

that I saw no point in

becoming involved in quibbling with

individual Ambassadors in efforts to justify doing what the

President had asked.

Ambassador Coerr said that he understood

our position perfectly and State would proceed to correspond

with the Ambassadors further.

He did ask that we present

the special problem of Manila for determination by the Director.

With respect to Manila, we have a fair volume of

work there now which we do not have in Australia. Further,

we do not feel it would be feasible to cover Manila from

Australia because of the distance involved, and we want to

leave our office in Hong Kong free to concentrate on the

greatly enlarged Chinese problem.

We feel, therefore, that

despite the Ambassador's objection, we should insist upon

reopening our office in Manila.

ACTION: If approved, we will inform Ambassador Coerr that

reviewed by the Director and that he feels, as he did when

he approved the reduced proposal, that it is essential for

us to reopen our office in Manila. We will also tell

As approved by the Director, Ambassador Wyiberley

Deputy Director of State's Bureau of Intelligence and

Australia, as a substitute for Manila, Philippines, and that

We are recommending that opening of our mew office

War was declared on India by Pakistan the same day.

that clearance was received from state for our office there.

'We have been watching the situation closely and it has

deteriorated to the point where we believe it would be futile

for us to station a man there right now. All commercial

airplane flights to New Delhi have been cancelled by the

Indian Government and State has advised us that they are

considering the possibility of evacuation of American

Inationals as is currently being done in Pakistan.

Our

Legats are dependent upon developing friendly relations with

the investigative agencies of the host country. Recent

statomonto by president Nicon, Secretary Rogers and

Ambassador Bush have tended to blame India for escalation

of the situation with the result that considerable hostility

has

been developed in India against the United States.

very recent demonstration around the United States Embassy

in New Delhi is evidence of this. This is just not the

time for a new Legat to introduce himself as a United States

representative to Indian agencies.

We checked with State on this and Glynn Mays, with

whom we have dealt in connection with the expansion, said

the situation is such that the Indian Government migit even

On behalf of Secretary Rogers, I wish to thank

to our ambassadors overseas to monitor and direct the

We have

recently instructed our Ambassadors in

Brasilia, Manila, and Singapore to consult with their :

respective host governments on this subject, and we

expect to hear from them shortly. Once we receive

¡Dear Mr. Hoover:

Mi. Papich has orally informed me that you wish to have the

identity of the FBI agent who was the source of certain information

communicated to an employee of this Agency,

This information regarding the disappearance of one Thomas Riha was

in turn passed to Dr. Joseph Smiley, then President of Colorado

University, Boulder, Colorado, now President of a university in El

Paso, Texas, and to the District Attorney of Denver, Mr. James

McKevitt.

In view of your personal interest in this matter, I instructed

to report to me in person.

I have reviewed this complicated case in detail withl

and have requested him to reveal the identity of his source. As a point

of honor and personal integrity,

was adamant that he

could not disclose the identity of his source. Under further pressure

from me,

maintained his position, stating that in de-

fense of it he was prepared to submit his resignation immediaiely.

éxplained that the Riha/Galya Tannenbaum cases

had been given extensive news coverage, much of it being sensational

in nature. He stressed that there was embarrassing public speculation

as to the possible involvement of the CIA and the FBI in Riha's

disappearance.

While the following is not pertinent to your request, my review

of this case suggests the advisability of a re-examination of Riha's

disappearance and past activities and, necessarily, the Tannenbaum

case.

Briefly, since 1958 we have commuricated to your Bureau

significant information which relates to Riha's involvement with

Czech and Soviet intelligence services, when he was behind the Iron

Curtain. I attach for your information and convenience copies of

pertinent reports regarding this aspect of the case.

I hope sincerely that this recent incident will not impair our

mutual efforts in making certain that we have not overlooked factors

possibly having a significant bearing on U.S. intelligence and internal

security interests. I shall pursue this matter through our respective

liaison offices.

In closing, Mr. Hoover, I wish to state

that this Agency can only

fully perform its duties in the furtherance of the national security when

it has the closest coordination and teamwork with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation.

Furthermore, it is necessary that we continue to con-

duct our business in an atmosphere of mutual respect. I trust that we

can coordinate closely any future developments or actions in these cases,

in order to prevent the airing in public of conflicts ar differences between

the two agencies. I feel strongly that there are representatives of the

news media who are eager to exploit alleged differences on a national

scale. Disturbing as this experience has been, I wish to thank you in

the interests of our common cause for having communicated with me

in such a forthright and candid manner.

SUBJECT: Elted, Thomas

I. The January 1970 receipe of information from

your Bureau that Mrs. Ruth Ann COOK,. Thomas RIHA's

mother, had mentioned runisrs uf her son's work for CIA

in letters to the SAC, Denver, caused us to verify the fact

RIHA has never been employed or used operationally by

this Agency.

2. In 1958 and 1959 you were provided information

that RIHA, when transitting Prague en route to Moscow,

was contacted by Czech Intelligence and asked to remain in

the CSR.

Later in 1958 Czech Intelligence introduced RIHA

to the KGB in Moscow and our source reported RIHA accepted

certain privileges from the KGB while asserting he would not

become a spy for the Soviets. Details reported by our source

about RIHA's KGB contacts did not emerge during a 1960 FBI

interview of RIHA.

3. This indication that RIHA may not have been truthful

in 1960, when added to our current knowledge about KGB interest

in recruiting American exchange students and RIHA's 1968 trie

to the USSR, suggests the circumstances of RA's disappearance

might be l'e-evaluated. This Agency is reopening its file on this

case in view of the information disclosed in the attachments.

On 10 September 1958

ne ran into Subject by chance at the SAS

office in Vionna an the two boarded a SAS flight

to Conenhagen

via

Duesseldorf.

During the trip Subject disclosed the

following to source which has been supplemented from

information from our files.

3.

RIHA, who was born in Prague, Czechosiovakia

17 April 1929, is one of the twenty American students

selected for the East-lest Exchange Program and will be

studying in the USSR

for the 1958-59 academic year. Files

in this Agency indicate that RIHA arrived in the U. S: on

15 July 1947 and became a citizen in 1952.

Our source informed is hacill had cone to praguels

June of this year, to see his father and other relatives:

father and mother

are divorced and according to information

in our files, his mother is listed as Mrs. Ruth cook.

address: • 2023 Etna Street, Borkeley 4, California..

5. RIHA told our source that when he arrived in Prague

he was put into a Government hotel for three days before he

was allowed to stay with his relatives and friends.

During

this time, and perhaps later, RillA was accompanied through

the city

by a guide whom he

described as a "Government

Official" name unknown, who attempted to effect Subject's

repatriation to Czechoslovakia. RIHA told our source that

this man has set up an appointment (date and address unknown)

Subject told our source that this "Government

'Official" did not mention Czech Intelligence or Security

Forces as such and that he (RIHA) is not too worried

concerning this contact. RIHA apparently feels that it

is the price he must pay in order to study in the Soviet

Union and once he gets deeply into his studies in

Moscow

he feels that he can plead that he is too busy with his

academic work to have contact with any officials.

Our

source also stated that RIHA is in some kind of correspondence

with the Czech official. We have no description or name for

the Czech official.

7. It is requested that no further dissemination be

made of this information without prior clearance from this

1. Reference is

made to our CS CI 3/751,690 of

27 October 1958 concerning an

attempt by

' a member of Czech

intelligence to effect Subject's repatriation while the

latter was in Prague in June of 1958 visiting relatives

en route to study in Moscow during 1958-59 as

an East-West

Exchange Student.

The following report describes further

action taken by the KGB in Moscow to cultivate Subject, and

was recently submitted by a sensitive and reliable source.

Sometime in December 1958, Subject again met the

Cäech Official who hau triod to have Subject ispatriaio to

the CSR in Prague last summer.

official. This Soviet identified himself only by a first

The Soviet described his work as being in the American

'Section of the NVD.

3. This Soviet Official has been cultivating Subject

(trying to see him

as often

as possible, sometimes trice a

week) since their introduction in December, by offering such

blandishments as trips in a chauffered private limousine

into. forbidden areas outside Moscow, tickets to any enter-

tainment, access to material from previously inaccessible

archives, the use of private country villas and all the

"beautiful, interesting and intelligent girls" he might want.

Subject has further been promised the opportunity of returning

to the Soviet Union for as long as he wants at any future

date. He would have to pay only his way over there; his

expenses and return trip to the US would be paid by the

Soviets.

4. Subject has taken advantage of this offer to take

several trips for sightseeing into forbidden areas around

Moscow in a private

car with the Soviet Official, and has

also taken up a few offers for entertainment.

Subject visited

one of these villas, but refused the girls on the ground that

he wants a woman to

like him for himself, and not because she

has been told to do so. The Soviet answered that "some of

them will really learn to like you for yourself, as well as

work for us," but Subject still declined to get

involved.

However, subject has recently been taken up by a soviet girl

who had previously tried to seduce another American student

and subsequently blurted out that she was put onto the latter

American by the NVD, which she has also told Subject. Subject

is reported to be responding warmly to her approaches although

he has flatly told her he doesn't trust her nor any Russian

completely.

He claims he enjoys her company but will not

have

a serious aftair with her,

is reportedly aware

that he is playing a risky game,

He has told the Soviet frankly that he cannot

Subject says he feels that the

Soviets' interest in him

is to

cultivate him as

a scholar of

possible future importance to insure that he will

always be

sympathetic to the Soviet Union.

Subject has reportedly told

several other American students of his relationship with the

Soviet Official in order to cover himself "in case anything

happened".

6. This Soviet Official has evinced an interest to

Subject in many of the American Exchange students, with the

explanation that some would undoubtedly be back in Moscow

within two years as Diplomats and that since this is his

area of responsibility, he wants to know as much as possible

The Soviet indicated that he was

quite aware of

US Embassy and what they do in the university buildings, but

knows him from group social gatherings at Harvard, as mature

and socially vivacious with a warm personality. subject is

a clever and humorous conversationalist who likes to be

surrounded by people, make new acquaintances, and develop

friendships. Subject's patriotic motivation was not known

to our source, but the latter felt that Subject was completely

"Americanized" in manners and interests. Our source would

guess that Subject has courage.

MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION CONCERNING

Pursuant to Director's request Denver District Attorney

James "Hike" McKevitt interviewed 5/5/70 as to investigation of

Riha, Czechosloval-born, naturalized, former professor of Russian

history at Colorado University, who departed Denver area 3/69

without notifying friends, associates or

estranged wife. His

disappearance has been glamorized and spiced up in

newspaper

articles by references to Galya Tannenbaum, his paramour:

"Ackevitt

stated investigation at standstill,

all leads being exhausted.

He

feels Tannenbaum may have killed subject since bad feeling developed

between them prior to his disappearance due to her forging checks

on his account.

Further, Tannenbaum probably a nymphomaniac who

had constant sexual affairs with

Riha and used this as a club over

his head to prevent disclosure of forgeries.

In Nickevitt's opinion

Rihä is dead

since he pas close to his friends and if alive would

contact them.

Investigation indicates

Riha abnormal in his sexual

dcsires and could not leave women alone.

Possibility exists one

of these involvements may have resulted

in his death.

DI. Joseph Smiley, former President, Colorado University,

where subject. employed, is now President, University of Texas,

(El Paso, Texas.

Smiley after subject's disappesrance stated subject

was alive andrel.

When challenged by Mickevitt to disclose basis

for statement he refused and

appealed to CIA, his source, for help.

After leaving Boulder, SMILEY as advised by

Dean WILLIAN E. BRIGGS, College

of Arts and Sciences,

University of Colorado, Boulder, that a letter was

received by the University purportedly written by RIJA.

In which he stated that he mould not be

returning to

the University. BRIGGS advised SMILEY that in his

opinion, the letter ras a forgery, since the signature

did not compare with that of RIJA.

•After the disappearance, SMILEY began receiving

a great many inquiries from the news media and he was

pressed for a staterent regarding his knowledge of RIJA

and whether or not he was alive.

THE FOLLOWING PAS FURNISHED BY DR. SMILEY

IN THE STRICTEST OF CONFIDENCE WITH THE UNDERSTANDING •

THAT IT WAS FOR THE INZORIATION OF THE FBI AND NOT

FOR DISSEMINATION TO ANY OUTSIDE AGENCY SINCE HE WAS

BREAKING A COXFIDINCE WITH AN ASSOCIATE IN THE DENVER

OFFICE OF THE CENTRAL INIALLIGDNCE AGENCY:

Being hounded by the press for a statement,

he contacted a source in the CIA Office at Denver since

he, SHILEY, as formerly a member of the Office of Naval

Intelligence, thinking that perhaps that agency could

assist

hin off the record with

any infornation it might

.. possess.

SMILEY vas avare that the CIA had interviered

RIJA fOllowing a trip by RIJA to the Soviet Union. The

CiA source

subsequently told Dr. SMILEY to merely advise.

of Colorado, and it appeared in print.

When the Office of the District Attorney in

Denvér instituted investigation into the disappearance

of RIJA, SMILEY was contacted by the DA's Office regarding

Dr. SMILEY again contacted

the Denver CIA Office source and was advised that he

was to state nothing and that he would be rocontacted.

Some days later, the CIA source recontacted

him and told him that he would be receiving an inquiry

from the Office of the DA in tha foru of a stateront,

and that he should agree with the statement even

though

It "was not quite the truth". SMILEY did not question

## Page 133

these instructions, since he felt that ciA knew what

should ba done in this type of case.. He received a

telephone call from the DA's Office and a statement

was read to him to the effect that the infornation

which he had received and made public to the effect

that RIJA was

alive

and well was in error.

SMILEY

told the caller that he agreed with the statement and

nothing further came of this.

Dr. SMILEY does not know what part, 1f any,.

the CIA has in this case, but since ho, SMILEY, is

himself a former intelligence agent he

did not

feel

that he had the right to question something which

might be of vital inportance to his country.

DR. SMILEY REQUESTED THAT NO HINT OR

INFERENCE BE GIVEN TO THE CIA WHICH WOULD INDICATE

• THAT HE HAS REVEALED TO THE FBI HIS CONTACTS REGARDING

THIS LATTEP WITH THE DENVER OFFICE OF THE CIA.

He stated

that though he has no evidence to

substantiate his belief, he cannot get it out of his

mind that

RIJA may have been a double agent for the

Soviets or the Czechoslovaks.

He is aware thât ons

Ars: TANNENBAUN, a Monan indicted for a number of trauds

and

a suspoct in

two arsonic poisonings, is considered

a suspect in the disappearance of RIJA.

He never knew

RIJA to be associated

with any such woman, but stated

that he was not acquainted with the personal life of

BIJA who was sonewhat of a "loner".

RIJA, when he joined the staff of the University

of Colorado, was single but in 8/68, an individual came

to visit RIJA ostensibly for the purpose of arranging

a marriage between RIJA and the man's sister.

The

intended bride was a Czechoslovakian girl who was born in.

Prague, Czechoslovakia, and this "brother-in-lay" was

entertained by a member and colleague of Ride in the

History Departient.

This individual indicated to situat

that although the "brother-in-law" supposedly did not

speak any English, and had RIJA translate every statement

Into Czech, it was apparent from the gestures and expressions

of the "brother-In-law" that he understood more than he

let on. Three weeks after the visit of this wan, the woman

who became drs. RiJA came ta Boulder, Colorado, minera sur

and Ridi vere married.

The mairiage resulted in divorce

& short time later and the girl reportedly returned to

the last coast fron whonce she cane.

there was reason ici

the IDI to suspect that there might be

SUBJECT: /Electronis Devices

Subject to Criminal Sanctions

In recent months the Department has been, contronted with serious

problems concerning the prospective or continued prosecution of naividuals

who have been the subject of prior electronic surveillance. These problems

have sometimes arisen comparatively late in the investigative or prosecutive

advised that the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted: In

other cases the problem arose after indictment (United States V. Davis,

United States V. Iohn Drew) or in the appellate stage after

trial (United States V. Black; United States v. Kolod).

Robin areas

In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable

that the Department have full knowledge of the extent of any device probler

at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to

determine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what

responses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to

produce statements.

Accordingly, I feel it is imperative for us to establish between

the Bureau and the Department (and perhaps United States Attorneys in

cases of direct referral) some sort of "early warning" system. This may

require the Bureau to set up and maintain appropriate indices with respect

to electronic surveillance and the materials derived therefrom

I have discussed this suggestion with the Attörney General and tne -

Deputy Attorney General. Both feel that the establishment of such indices

is necessary. They have suggested that I discuss the details of their

establishment with representatives of the Bureau. I should therefore

appreciate your designating an individual for this purpose at your earliest

convenience.

vassal

This is in reference to your memorandum of September 28

to the Attorney General concerning information developed through

(electronic surveillance devices. I am pleased to learn that the

Bureau maintains indices on such information which will be avail-

able to Department attorneys. However, to make effective use of

such records, I believe we should know how any such index is

constituted. Specifically, it would be helpful to know whether or

not there is a central index which will permit a rapid determina-

tion as to whether any given person was overheard, present, or

¡ referred to in the course of a convorsation.

I assume that in all cases investigated by the Bureau you

will advise the appropriate Division of the Department as early |

as possible concerning information derived from an electronic

surveillance bearing on the case or any person involved in that,

case. We would, of course, propose to set up machinery to

advise the Bureau promptly of our interest in any case which is

being investigated by another agency.

We look forward to a discussion of the general problem?

with Mr. DeLoach, but feel that such a discussion will be more

fruitful after we understand the nature and extent of your index

system and can evaluate its impact on our operations

Thank you for your cooperation.

TO

Mr. DeLoack

DATE: November 10, 1966

FRON T5. H. Gale

SLBJECT, MICROPHONE AND CELEPHONE SURVEILLANCES

In connection with problems arising out of past

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under

prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being conten-

plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request

that ve establish an "early warning system" in the form of

an index or other administrative device to

enable a check

to be made to determine if ve have so monitored the voices

of such individuals. The Department was advised that we

had such a system in operation.

In line with the Department's requirements, this

index, which is now in operation, is made up of names

individuals whose voices were monitored by microphone

surveillances, technical surveillances, or other similar

electronic listening devices since. january, 1960.

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded

a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive

interest in the las Division, with a request that these names.

be checked through our index to determine if they were the

subjects of direct electronic surveillance coverage; whether

an individual in question appears on any records, logs, notes,

memoranda, et cetera, either as a participant in

one, or as a persoa nention or docued

conversations

This new and belated

category introduced by the Tax

Division will require additional work on the part of the field

jin order that references in this category can be added to the

names already included in the index so as to answer any future

'inquiries from the tax division.

It should be noted that the

Criminal Division has never required any information concerning

the names of persons mentioned in microphone logs and has always

satisfied themselves with information concerning those whose con

versations were actually recorded. This new request appoars to

EnC.

This document is nepped in reso? ur peoust and is mo for dissemi-

mitail to pile ta

inceedings by

nation outside you'r

Memorandum to Mr. Dejoach

Re: Microphone and Telephone Surveillances

be an additional example of the Tax Division going far beyond

what is required by the courts or even by another division of

the Department. Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries

along this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary

to include in our index the names of persons mentioned in

microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions

involved, alerting those offices to this additional requirement

on the part of the Tax Division and instructing those oftices

to prepare index cards on individuals who are mentioned Ii

monitored conversations.

The field is being instructed to use a certain amount

of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as

there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject

covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in

which he may mention the name of a third party. Examples of

this would be instructions to a maid or servant to get in

touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle menial

errands such as handling dry cleaning, getting a car washed and

like situations.

Where a name is mentioned in this way, no

purpose is served by including it in this index. He are, of

course, following the Director's instructions in connection

with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the

Department and alloving Department personnel, not IBI personnel,

determine it it is relevant.

ACTION:

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices

involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that

cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned

or discussed in monitored conversations, except those in the

completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition

to names of individuals already being included as those whose

voices have been monitored.

(G) TECHNICAL AND MICROPHONE SURVEILLANCES - USE OF

INFORMATION FROM ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN CRIMINAL PROSE-

CUTIONS -- The Acting Attorney General by memorandum 493 dated

November 3, 1966, has transmitted to all United States Attorneys

instructions to be alert as to each prosecutive case for evidence that

might be tainted because of the use of electronic devices during the.

investigation. The instructions require that in the event the United

States Attorney believes that there has been wire tapping or other

electronic surveillance touching a particular case, he is required lo

immediately notify Mr. J. Waller Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,

Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently

handling numerous requests from the Department to check the names of

various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all

persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It

is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys

and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the

request of the Department.

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys by the

Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the

various investigative agencies at the field level, it is quite likely that

some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States

Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field offices requesting

that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furnished, the

Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all'pertinent

details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have

been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office

not participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

• The instructions issuca to me omea stares autoreys oy tre

• Acting Attorney Gen

il are as follows:

"You will recall that in May 1960 the Department advised the

Supreme Court oi facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,

October Term, 1965, No. 1023. Its memorandum in that case staied

in pertinent part:

'Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion

that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and

his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness

of his trial; we have no doubt that in the circumstances

outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.

We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, in a

district court, the question whether other conversations {i. e.;

conversations not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate hearing, the government

proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made.'

"This Department must never procecd with uny investigation oi

case which includes evidence illegally obtained or the iruits of that

evidence.

No investigation or case of that character shall go forward

until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in

a position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or

unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing

to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each

investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine

whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching

a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases

and mätters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-

mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall

in this category.

"Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the

investigating agencies. Special attention must be given to these. But,

it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort io

ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present

the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means

of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same

person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or

State agencies and the iniormation supplied to you may in fact come

from more than one source. You should be particularly attentive

to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements

of organized crime.

"HH 55322' DocId: 32989714 Page 189

## Page 190

"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--

in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is

addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation

was conducted prior to July, 1965.

Present practice,. adopted in July

1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the

installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the

interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all

instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence

affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the

Attorney General must be obtained in each instance when this

exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be

available for investigative or litigative purposes.

"If you have any reason whatever to believe that there has

been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,

you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry

may be pursued by the Department."

the concopt of standing with respect to elecüronic surveillance and

held that an irdividual has standing not only with respect to his own

overheard conversations but also with respect to overhearings on

premises in which he has a propretary interest, even though he was

noü present at the time of the conversations. Because of this decision,

iü will be necessary in future sequests for electronic surveillance

information to ascertain whether or not there was coverage on premises

in which the subject had a proprietary interest.

Accordingly, it is

requested that you advise as to each of the individuals on the

attached

list:

• (a) Whether the named individual appears to be present at,

or a participant in, conversations overheard in any electronic surveillance

by your agency.

(b) Whether an electronic surveillance was conducted on any

premises of which the named individual was the owner, lessee or licensee.

(c) If the individual or the premises of which the individual

was owner, lessee or licensee was the subject of an electronic surveillance,

diả the

If your records indicate that the individuals have used names

Re: Microphone and Telephone Surveillance

Henceforth, when an application for court-approved electronic

surveillance is being prepared by a field office for a telephone and/or.

microphone surveillance, a blue card should also be prepared and submitted

on each individual on whom the application is being prepared, that is to say,

the principals, along with the initial submission of the application to FBIHQ

› for' filing in the special indices at FBIHQ.

Each field office is also being requested to review their prior ;

court-approved electronic surveillances and promptly furnish FBIHQ a 3x5

blue card on each principal for filing in the special indices.

Each office is reminded of the necessity to comply with existing

Bureau policy and request a search of the FBIHQ special indices regarding

all the principals in their application for a court-approved electronic surveil

lance prior to the submission of same to FBIHo.

FBIHQ is also receiving an increasing number of requests from

the Department for electronic surveillance information on individuals appearing

before Federal Grand Juries or defendants in criminal prosecutions. Therefore,

it is imperative the special indices at FBIHQ contain the names of individuals

who were monitored in conversations covered by our electronic surveillances

and be current.

All SAC's are reminded of the necessity to handle the sources on

a need-to-know basis in order to afford maximum security for this type of

surveillance. Compliance with these instructions must be closely followed.

This matter was coordinated with

Intelligence Division.

FBIHQ Is also receiving an increasing number of requests

from the Department for electronic surveillance information on individuals

appearing before Federal Grand Juries or defendants in criminal prosacu

tions. Therefore, it is imperative that the special indices at FBIHQ

contain names of individuals who were monitored in conversations covered

by our electronic surveillances and be current.

You are reminded of the necessity to handle these sources on

a strictly needuto-know basis in order to afford maximum security to this

type of surveillance. Insure that appropriate administrative procedures

are established in these matters. Your submission of special indices

UBJECT:

INVESTIGATION OF KU KLUX KLAN AND OTHER HATE

GROUPS

=.

has proposed that the develonment of informants in the Ku Klur

Klan (KIs) anci other hate groups as weil as the investigation ana penecration of these

organizations from an intelligence standpoint be transferred from the General

Investigative Division to the Domestic Intelligence Division (DID). He bases his

recommendations on the premise that organizations like the inK and supporting

groups are essentially suoversive in that they hold principles and recommend courses

of action that are inimical to the Constitution as are the viewpoints of the Communisi

Party. He does not maintain that the actions.of the hate groups constitute the same

menace as the Communist Party inasmuch as they are not controlled by a foreign

power.

He feels that the DID over the years has developed wide experience in the

penetration of subversive organizations through informants, anonymous sources,

sophisticated microphone and technicai surveiliances, interview programs of

a highly specialized nature, etc., and that his division could put this experience

to excellent use in penetrating the Klan and other hate groups.

_feels that the DID would be in a position to launch a

disruptive counter-intelligence program against the Klan and other hate groups

with the same effectiveness that they are now doing insofar as the Communist Party

is concerned. He also proposes an immediate series of regional conferences to

Instruct pertinent fieid personnel and to devise imaginative, aggressive and highly

specialized programs to carry out the responsibilities in question. He states the

Communist Pariy is increasing its activities in the field of racial mtters and

civil rights, direcüng more and more of its fire against the KKK and similar

organizations to contuse the issue. He feels that because of the stepped up

activitics of the Communist Party in this arca it would help prevent maried confusion

from developing in the areas of activities being handled by the Generai Investigative

and Domestic Intelligence Divisions if the DID assumes these responsibilities.

The functions in question were formerly handled by the DID up until 1953

when they were transferred to the Generai Investigative Division. This matter wa

and feels

at while the proposed transfer of functions from the General Investigative

tivities of the Klan and hate groups and the entire civil rights field of investigation.

a feels this argument has even more strength today than in 1958, because, over-

tegration and civil rights.

community where the crime occurred; i.e. informants and sources in the Klan, hate

groups, subversive organizations, but also sources not connected with any group,

who will report potential violence and indiviauals prone to violence. We are following

the policy of aggressively seeking out persons addicted to violence even though they

nave not violated a Federal-law as yet. He feels that the Division that is going to

Investigate these cases should forge the necessary tools to use for this purpose.

does not feel that the transfer of this responsibility will be helpful to the

Bureau from an investgative stancooint nor in meeting the heavy resporsibilities we now

nave in this area.

VIEWS OF THE INSPECTION DIVISION:

feels there is certainly some merit and logic in.

reasoning and it is felt instant issue is not one that is completely blacis or white.

Under the present setup there is coordination and daily exchange of

nformation between Domestic Intelligence and General Investigative Divisions

in that both Divisions insure that communications and other matters of information

ire brought to the attention of each other as they arise from matters for which

ach Division is primarily responsible. Howavar, it seems the real issue today

ust as in 1958, is where coes the weignt.of the interest lie in the raciai question.

in 1958 it clearly lay in the General Investigative Division because, according to

formation available to the Bureau at that time, in practically no instances had

acial incidents been caused or inspired by Communist Farty elements aithough

he Party naturally sought to capitalize on incidents aiter they occurred. Also,

n 1958, it was felt that consolidation would streamline certain operations.

Today it seems clear from information developed by Domestic

ntelligence Division that the Communist Party now has evidenced a definite interest

o the racial probiem, is becoming deeply enmeshed therein, and appears to be

xploiting it to an ever-increasing extent. Although prosecution for civil rights

und other criminal violations is still an ultimate objective, there is cefinite

leed for an intelligence type penetration of these racial and hate groups so as

o keep abreast of and thead of their plans and activities. This seems more

properly the function of the Domestic Intelligence Division.

Analysis was made by

relative to coverage of the Klan and other

late groups. The General Investigative Division has been putting a great dcal of

pressure on the field to increase informant coverage. They have recently instructed

he field to conduct surveys relative to instituting technical coverage on certain key

Slan figures, la ve interviewed at least once all inown Klan memoers, all Klan

caders have been investigated from intelligence standpoint and recommencations

lave been made that intelligence type cases be opened on each Klan member. A

icekly progress airtel is being obtained from field concerning informant development.

However, undoubtedly additional coverage is needed particularly in the Klaverns

Memo for Mir. Tolson

Re: Investigation of Ku Klux Klan and Other Hate Groups

the fact that the DID has had broad experience in the penetration of subversive

organizations and has achieved noteworthy results in infiltrating the Communist

Party and Soviet intelligence operations. It is felt that unquestionably this

experience and know-how could be put to good advantage in penetrating the Klan

and other hate groups.

The Inspection Division feels that the advantages in having the

direction of all informant and intelligence matters in the racial field in one division

as outlined by

and

outweigh the advantages of having the

hate group informants and intelligence functions with the substantive civil rights cases.

Under the proposed transier of phases of the racial problem to Domestic Intelligence

Division there will still be definite responsibility in both divisions,

to retain responsibility for supervision of substantive civil rights violations and

other criminal violations. This dual responsibility, however, should pose no

problem because there are numerous ekamples of it successfully being handled

in the Bureau today. In this regard it will be noted that the acministrative handling

of the entire criminal informant program is handled by the Speciai Investigative

Division which includes the informants being utilized on General Investigative

Division cases. It will also be noted that the Special Investigative Division handles

the informant and intelligence aspecis of organized crime. However, the General

Investigative Division nanciles key substantive violations such as Bankruptcy,

Extortion, Assaulting a Federal Officer, and Theft from Interstate Shipment

violations committed by members of the organized criminal syndicate utilizing

Criminal Intelligence informants. It is understood that there have been no in-

soluble provlems in this regard and it is felt that there should be no insoluble

problems in the coorcination of racial intelligence and informant information

between the General Investigative Division and the DID.

In any event there will certainly be no lessening of pressure and.

supervision on the field if the se functions are transferred. The same Agents

in the field will be working the cases and developing the informants. However,

it is felt that the DID should be given a chance to demonstrate whether their

broad knowledge of and experience in penetration techniques and infiltration

tactics can possibly increase our penetration oi these hate groups. It is felt

that a study of counter-intelligence and disruption tactics against the iSlan ceriainly

merits further consideration. It is aiso felt that the proposed series of field con-

ferences on this problem should be favorably considered.

OBSERVATIONS

Agent personnel and supervisory functions have been analyzed and dealt with

in the foregoing proposed reallocations; clerical functions have not. It is suggested

that clerical functions and personnel no simply move with the Agent desks and

units to which they are attached. Questions of space also häve not been covered

and it is readily apparent that a substantial portion of the functions and personnel

suggested for transter to Training Division might feasibly operate at Quantico

(e.g. Library, Special Productions and Publications Unit). Five units of Training

Division. are now located at Headquarters and the Research Unit of Research and

Service Section proposed herein for transfer to Training Division, likewise should -

remain at Headquarters. Accordingly*

formerly in the

Front Oilice of Crime Research Division, has been proposed for transfer to Training

Division in order to act, during this transition period, as a special coordinator

of functions that may be divided between Headquarter's and Quantico.

Na.,

The questions of adequacy of clerical personnel, space reallocation, and

WME;crt

12 This appears logical and feasible.. If snags develop we can

readjust. I agree that the Research and Service unctions, which will remain

under®

shouid be reassigned to the Training

Divisions i do not believe that this Section should be transferred to Quantico,

however, because there is daily need for access to files and other material

at Headquarters and occasional contacts with the puolic. Furthermore, there

is no available space at Quantico except in the Library Building. Accordingly,

 recommend that the FBIHQ Library be moved into the Library Building ai

Quantico. We would need to retain at FBIQ the telephone directories and

encyclopedias which are used on a daily basis by other Divisions. The

space into which the FBIH? Library was to have been moved in the Sth and D

Guilding can be used and in fact is badly needed by the Domestic Intelligence

Division which is very crowded.

I recommend that you approve now the transfer of functions and

that any necessary realignment of personnel be considered by separate

memoranda.

A survey has been made of the library, its books, facility and

corridor at FBl Headquarters and has a staff of the following:

.

From a survey of the books, all books can be removed from the

library to the library at Quantico with exception to certain reference books

and out-of-town telephone directories which are necessary to be maintained at FBI

Headquarters for ready-reference purposes by the Bureau staff at Headquarters.

from the survey, it was determined these books can be maintained iu two rooms"

presently occupied by the library, thus freeing four rooms us surplus spade."

• In the library is a lending library which has about 100 members.

These members pay $1 every six months for membership dues and have the privilege

of using the library. Because of the minor use of this lending library, I am proposin

From the survey, I believe that the two library technicians, who are

Since practically all of the library will be transferred to Quantico,

it will be necessary to transfer certain employees of the library unit.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That all the books with the exception of the reference books,

at Quantico.

(2) That authority be granted to gradually phase out the lending

SUPERVISORY REORGANIZATION OF

Reference is made to the memorandum bf. Mr. Walters to Mr. Fel:

dated 12/14/72, in captioned matter. A review has been made of the units assignes

to the Training Division from the former Crime Research Division, particularly

the Research and Service Section.

As you know,

, has retired. I believe we can consolidate the Training Progra=s

Processing Section and the Research and Service Section at FBI Headquarters

into one section, calling it the Training Programs Processing and Research Sector.

This would eliminate one section chief.

As you know, we have recommended and it has been approved that te

Library in the Crime Research Section be moved to Quantico. It is my proposal

with the Research Unit leaving three units from the iormer Research and Service

Section; namely, the Research Unit;

Special Productions Unit and Publicatiors

Unit.

I have discussed with Mr. Callahan the transferring of the Suggestic=s

Forms, Reports Management, Manuals and Chief Clerk Matters to the Adminis==-=

Division and he is agreeable.

This would mean an addition to his division of che

Special Agent and seven clerical staff. The remaining units presently in the Irai=

Division would remain as is.

This would give the Section Chief of the Training Division stationed

at FBI Headquarters a total of 18 Agents and 53 clerks under his supervision. I

believe that current Section Chief

is capable of handling this

assignment as Section Chief, particularly if:

Report of Mecting Between Colonel

•In confirmation of our oral discussion on 17 May 1966, this

Colonel Sheffield Edwards in Washingion on 12 May 196ó. Colonel

"Edwards, as you'know, is a former Director of Security of this

Edwards met with the undersigned on 13 May 1966 and related the

following:

"Johnny" had called Colonel Edwards at 11:30 a.m.,

on 12 May 1966. He said that he wanted five minutes with

Coloncl Edwards and that he had something to tell him.

Colonel Edwards agreed and made arrangements to meet

him at the Cocktail Lounge of the Lawyers Club at

5:00 p.m.

"According to Colonel Edwards, "Johnny" arrived

promptly at the agrecd time. The Lounge at that hour

is usually deserted excent for the bar waiter. They

ordered drinks. It is Colonel Edwards impression that

"Johnny" has aged a lot since he saw him last. Coloncl

Edwards got the distinct impression that although no

was

trying to put on a good front, he looked worried gna sames

conversation but "Johnny", although friendly, was anxious

to get to the point of his visit. The following is the essence

of "Johnny's"

story as he told it to Colonel Edwards.

Colonel Edwards Ict him talk frecly and asked only a fel

questions since he did not consider it wise to interrogate

him or press him for further details.

"Johnny" said that he had been approached on the street

•in Los Angeles by an FBI agent named Dodge, who said he

wanted to talk to him.:

He said that he told the agent that he

did not want to talk to him and kopt on walking. Another

agent, named Hill joined "Johnny" and Dodge as they walked

down the street. The agents told him that the interview had

nothing to do with him personally and that they had nothing

against him. They tried to give him an envelope and a card.

"Johnny" said he told them that if they had a legal document

(such as a summone in rubpocant bo moula sonari, with di

lax, but they would have to deal with his attorney or have

his attorney present.

The agents said they wanted to talk

to him alone and said it had nothing to do with him personally.

They proposed that they meet him in a suburb in Los Angeles,

which "Johnny" said was about forty miles away (either at

this point, or later through his attorney) they told hin they

wanted to talk to him on a matter they knew he did not want

an attorney to know. They said it was a matter of National

Security. He still refused and they left him.

"They left him and whon he got back to his apartment

the envelope was there. He said he did not open it but called

• his attorney and had him open it. The envelope contained a

, picture of a woman and a child about four years old.

"Johnny" said-the child was himself at that age (Colonel

Edwards tried to get a little more detail on the envelope and

the woman, but "Johnny" was very touchy on this).

"The altorney, Jimmy,

Calimonte, has talked to the FbI

but has gotten nowhere excet! that they want to talk to

"Johnny" alone. "Johnny" julio has had considerable

H

experience in these matters) felt at the time and still feels

that this is not the orthodos approach of the FBI and he is

puzzled. He said to Coloncl Edwards that if he did talk to

the FBI, he.was not going to tell them anything relating to

National Security (this was volunteered and Colonel Edwards

did.not advise on this point either pro or con).

"After "Johnny" had finished his tale, Colonel Edwards

• askca him if he were being told this in confidence. "Johnny"

said no, that Colonel Edwards could tell anyone he wished.

In this regard, Colonel Edwards gave no advice and made

no commitment. He did tell him that he might tell his suc-

cessor (the undersigned) as a matter of information.

11.

"Colonel Edwards' estimate of this development is that

"Johnny" is in some kind of "bind" personally. Colonel

Edwards referred to pn article in the Saturday Eveninz Post

on the Mafia and Sar; Giancanna, who is now in jail in

Chicago. Colonel Edwards thinks that "Johnny" believes

that if he talks to the FBI alone, Samn or Sam's friends will

believe he is "talking" which would be fatal for "Johnny" -

he knows a lot about Sam. On the other hand, Colonel

Edwards believes that "Johnny" wants to keep square with

the Bureau.

"Colonel Edwards noted that "Johnny" barely finished

one drink, which is unusual for him. He left, saying he

was mecting his attorney, who was flying down from New

York City on the shuttle (they had flown from Los Angeles

to New York together). "

Although "Johnny" did not say so, Colonel Edivards is of the

opinion that "Johnny"

wanted this Agency to inform your Burcau of

these developments and is using this channel for this purpose. This

•information is passed to you with the request that it not be released

outside of your Bureau without prior coordination with this Office.

In addition, it would be appreciated if you would not inform "Johnny"

that we have passed this information to you without giving us an

opportunity to consider its implications to this Agency. Colonel

Edwards has indicated to the undersigned that he would be more

than willing to be interviewed by representatives of your Bureau

should you consider it necessary or desirable. Further, this Office

is willing to provide whatover support or assistance you may con-

sider desirable in any further action the Bureau may wish to take.

regarding our coverage of foreign comnunist support of

revolutionary youth activities in the United States to reach

He advised Mr. Huston such a report would

be foithcoming.

→...

Our report sets forth the traditional channel

for communist support of revolutionary activity in this

country by the established basic revolutionary groups under

foreign domination such as the Conmunist Party, USA, and the

• Socialist Workers Party. We also cover the capabilities of

hostile intelligence operations directed at the United States

Next we show the never, bolder avenues of support

and direction being utilized by revolutionaries, often

without any attempi to conceal

their purpose.

These include

inteznational conferences which in this period of history

are ostensibly for peace in Vietnan but which also have the

usual underlying goal of destroying United States prestige

in vorld affairs.

The case of international travel and

communication with revolutionary intent by lew Left and black

extronist adherents from the United States and abroad is then

set forth.

The section dealing with our coverage of the above

threats to.our internal security clearly shows our sirong

relianeo upon the use of live informants and physical surveillance

Our report shows that the fBI has been aware from

that they pose new and unique threats to our internal security.

It shows we have readjusted our investigative intelligence

efforts to cope vith the new problems created. It stresses

the fact that these movenents are developing increasingly

into hard-core revolutionary elements which will demand

still greater attention in the form of increased coverage

as it appears there will be increasingly closer links between

these movements and foreign communists in the fucure.

We have prepared a transmittal letter to Mr. Huston

Inasmuch as this document is not going

Although the term "evolutionary protest

"movement"

cannot be precisely defined because

amorphous hature of such movements, it can be said

that'revolutionary protest movements-existing wichin the

Untied States fall into two broad categories, i.e: the

reciNew Left movement and the black extremist movement.

The New Left movement, which grey out of the

CIVIl. righis struggle of the 1950s, is a loose-knit,

in'dundisciplined group of individuals who view our system of

government as irredeemably corrupt and oppressive.

Their

siated ains and objectives are simple; they are dedicated

to the total destruction of our traditional values and

denocratic system of government.

..-.

The New Left movement in this country is clearly

an integral paci of a world-wide revolutionary movenient of

??:students and young intellectuals. There is a definite

similarity oi goals, a uniformity of action from country to

country, and a rapport anong leftist organizations and

Like the. New

Left movement, the black extremist

movement in the United States can be traced to the civil rights

movement of the early 1960s and the violent response to civil

riglits agitation. This is best seen in the history of the

Student Nonviolent Coordinating

Committee (SNCC), formed in

1960 in Atlanta, Georgia.

SNCC was one of the moving forces

behind the Ircedom Riders of the carly 1900s and was the trages

Of Ku KIus: Klan violence.

In May, Last, anne

elected chairman of SNCC.

The lack of progress toward insoomatica

since the 1954 school desegregation decision helped

:to. change. SNCC from a nonviolent group to a full-blown blacis

revolutionary organization.

Other black nationalists took up

went cry for a "bloody revolution" and a proliferation

of black extronist groups seized the initiative for change fron

established civil rights organizations and now advocate outright

revolution and destruction of our form of government.

with a total

complement of

over 1,000 conmunist nationals

and.

about 1, 100 dependents.

Our investigations have disclosed

there are. over 350 known or highly suspected intelligence

officers or

agents among them, of whom about 220 are Soviet

nationals.

In addition to this open or

"legal" channel of

intelligence operations, the connunist-bloc nations ulilize

highly clandestine "illegal" networks which have no observable

contact with the communist: official establishments.

The

members of these networks who are sent here from abroad with

fraudulent

documents and ficiitious cover stories perform

intelligence colection tasks as do the communist intelligence

agents operating under diplomatic or official cover. In

tine of emergency. of wai involving the United States and

communist countries,

the "illegal" netrocks would assume the

primary collection role for comnunist countsies whose diplomats

and

atticials would be interned or expelled.

In spite of the extensive nature of communisi bloc

intelligence operations to penetraie and subveri the

United States; there is little evidence that these intelligence

gathering

services are acting as channels for communist

support of the revolutionary protest movements here.

significant exception to this statenent is the known activity

Export of the Cuban revolution is the fundamental

The Honorable Edward M. Kennedy

Chairman, Subcommittee on Adminis-

trative Practice & Procedure

Committee on the Judiciary

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In response to your letter of April 24, 1975, I am

presently able to provide you with most of the information

you have requested concerning the electronic surveillance

activities of federal departments and agencies. The in-

formation contained in this letter and the enclosed material

relates mainly to electronic surveillance conducted

within

• the United States pursuant to the criminal law enforcement

responsibilities of the federal government. It does not

include electronic surveillance that may be conducted either

in the interests of national security, or outside the United

States by federal departments and agencies other than the

Department of Justice.

As to these latter

areas, the De-

partment is still in the process of assembling and review-

ing the materials relevant to your reguest, and we are thus

unable at this time to determine what information we may be

able to provide.

I should note that in several instances

your letter requests information that is either not in the

possession of this Department or pertains to areas outside

its proper jurisdiction. Since I understand that you have

sent similar letters to other federal departments and agen-

cies, I expect that you will receive responses from them.

Nevertheless, I believe the information contained in this

letter and the enclosed material will answer in substantial

part the questions you have raised concerning electronic

surveillance..

Apart from the area of national security, electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States by federal

departments and agencies may be divided into two broad

HH

categories: consensual and non-consensual. Consensual

electronic surveillance refers to those instances in which

one, ox more parties to the communication is a federal agent;

is cooperating with a federal agent, or has consented to

the surveillance.

Tha Supreme Court has repcatedly held

that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply to consensual surveillance.

See, e.g., United

States v. White, 401 U.S. 745 (1971) ; Lopez V. White, 373

U.S.

427 (1963) ; Rathbun V. United States, 355 U.S.

(1957) ; On Lee v. Unitea States, 343 U.S..

747 (1952). Con-

gress has also excepted consensual electronic surveillance

from the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Con-

trol and Safe Streets Act of 1968, including the requirement

of a court order.

Thus, sections

2511(a) (c)

and (a) of Title

18 of the United States Code provide:

(c) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person acting under color of law

to intercept a wire or oral communication, where

such person is a party. to the communication of

one of the parties to the communication has given

prior consent to such interception.

(d) It shall not be unlawful under this

chapter for a person not acting under color of

law to intercept a wire or oral communication

where such person is a party to the communication

oI where one of the parties to the communication

has given prior consent to such interception un-':

less such conmunication is intercepted for the

purpose of committing any criminal or tortious

act in violation of the constitution or laws of

the United States or of any State or for the pur-

pose of committing any other injurious act.

Although consensual electronic surveillance may thus

be conducted without a court order, its use by federal agents

has been subject to regulations issued by the Attorney

since 1967.

The current regulations are specified in attorney

General Kleindienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 entitled

"Memorandum to the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies,

Re: Monitoring Private Conversations with the Consent of

a Party," and in a subsequent amending order issued. by

Attorney General Saxbe. Copies of the memorandum and order

are enclosed herein.

In general, all federal agencies and departments

are required to obtain advance authorization from either

the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal

Division, or Deputy Assistant Attorney General of that

Division

before any electionic device may be used to over-

heax, transmit, or record a private conversation, other than

a telephone conversation, without the consent of

all the

parties to that conversation. In exigent circumstances .

precluding a prior request for authorization - such as

imminent loss of essential evidence or a threat to the

immediate safety of an agent or informant - emergency

monitoring may be instituted with the authorization of

: the

head of the responsible department or agency or his designee.

The Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, how-

ever, must be notified promptly of any such monitoring and

of the specific conditions that precluded obtaining prior

approval.

The above procedures do not apply to consensual moni-

toring of telephone conversations.

Because they involve the

transmission of a participant's voice through a complex and

far-reaching network of wires, the common use of party lines

and extension telephones, and

the possibility of an unseen

participant permitting another person to listen

on the same

extension, telephone conversations have long been thought

not to enjoy the same expectation of privacy as face-to-face

conversations.

For this reason, supervision and control over

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations are vested

instead in the head of each federal department and agency,

who is required to adopt appropriate regulations and pro-

cedures on the subject.

These regulations usually do not

restrict consensual monitoring of telephone conversations in

any significant respect. The relevant regulations of the

Drug Enforcement Administration are enclosed herein.

WH 55322 DocId: 32989714 Page 329

## Page 330

Page 4

Hon. Edward M. Kennedy

May 12, 1975

The current regulations issued by the Attorney

General also require the head of each federal department

and agency to exercise responsibility for the security of

all consensual monitoring devices, including the maintenance

of current inventories as to amounts, storage, and users of

such equipment, and to submit to the Attorney General dur-

ing July of each year a report containing an inventory of

all

electronic and mechanical equipment designed for the

monitoring of conversations and a brief státement of the

results obtained from their use during the prior fiscal year.

All federal departments and agencies having criminal

investigative responsibilities are authorized to conduct con-

sensual electronic surveillance. These agencies include,

inter-alia; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the

Bureau of Customs, the Department of Agriculture, the Internal

Revenue Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the

Drug Enforcement Administration, the Postal Service,

the

Secret Service, the Department of Defense, the Naval Investi-

• gative Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,

and the Department of Interior. The number of consensual

uses of electronic surveillance devices authorized by the

Department of

Justice between 1970 and 1974 is set forth in

the attached

memoranda.

The total

annual authorizations

were

as follows:

1970, 512; 1971, 840; 1972, 1272: 1973, 1484;

1974, 2518.

In the first quarter of 1975, the total number

of authorizations was 1,125. In March 1975, the total author-

azed was 461. The above figures, of course, do not Include

consensual monitoring of telephone conversations.

Nor do

they include consensual electronic surveillance that may be

conducted either outside the United States or in the inter-

ests of national security.

"Apart from the area of national security and foreign

intelligence, non-consensual electronic surveillance within

the United States is conducted pursuant to a court order.

Under Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets

Act of 1968, the Attorney General may authorize an applica-

•tion to a federal judge of a competent jurisdiction, who may

grant an order approving the interception of wire or oral

ment of Justice. With the exception of the Drug Enforce-

ment Administration, no division, bureau, or agency of

this Department conducts electronic surveillance outside

the United States for any purpose, including national

security. The Drug Enforcement Administration does con-

duct electronic surveillance outside the United States in

cextain limited circumstances. This surveillance is pres-

ently undertaken only on a bilateral basis, that is, with

the approval and participation of the foreign country in-

volved. It is my understanding, however, that a predecessor

organization of DEA did conduct

non-consensual electronic

a predecessor

surveillance unilaterally in at least one instance occurring

The surveillance was initiated in connection with

•that organization's criminal law enforcement responsibilities

and was designed to obtain information concerning inter-

national drug traffickers.

The subject of the surveillance

was a foreign national, and not an American citizen or an

alien resident of the United

States.

Under its current policy, DEA does not conduct any

non-consensual electronic surveillance abroad without the

approval

and participation of the foreign country. In al-

most all cases, the surveillance is actually conducted by

law enforcement officials of the foreign country, rather

than by DEA, and is not initiated as the result of a request

by DEA. I am informed that the instances in which DEA has

been responsible in any way for electronic surveillance

conducted abroad are exceedingly few, and that in none of

these was the subject of the surveillance an American citizen

or an alien resident of the United States.

Under existing regulations, the approval of the u.s.

Chief of Mission in the host country is required before DEA

may conduct, or request a foreign country to conduct, non-

consensual. electronic

surveillance outside the United States.

In addition, I have ordered that henceforth DEA shall obtain

the prior approval of the Attorney General before conducting,

or requesting anyone else to conduct, non-consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States where the sub-

ject of the surveillance is an American citizen or alien resi-

dent of the United States.

Although the approval of the

Attorney General has not been required previously, as indi-

cated above there have apparently been no instances in

which an American citizen or resident has been the subject

of non-consensual electronic surveillance conducted abroad

bY DEA or initiated at its request.

On occasion DEA has also conducted consensual elec-

tronic surveillance outside the United States, usually in--

volving the use of a voice transmitter concealed on an

informant, a DEA agent, or a law enforcement officer of the

host country. Under DEA's current policy, this transmitter

device is used with the specific approval and participation

of the foreign country. Again, in almost all cases, the

suiveillance 15 actuully conducted by a lan enforcement

official of the foreign country; rather than by dEA, and

DEA's involvement is in general

the United States has been the subject of consensual elec-

device by DEA, or by a foreign country at DEA's request.

I have ordered that whenever practicable DEA shall

obtain the advance approval of the Assistant Attorney General

in charge of the Criminal Division, or Deputy Assistant At-

torney General of that Division, before conducting, or re-

questing anyone else to conduct, consensual electronic sur-

veillance outside the United States where the subject of the

surveillance is an American citizen or alien resident of the

United States..

Where circunstances preclude a prior request

for, authorization, DEA may conduct the surveillance, but

shall notify promptly the Assistant Attorney General

in charge

of the Criminal Division of the surveillance and the specific

conditions that precluded obtaining prior approval. This

procedure parallels that outlined

in Attorney General Klein-

dienst's memorandum of October 16, 1972 governing consensual

electronic surveillance within the United States by federal

departments and agencies. It applies, of course, only to

private conversations, other than telephone conversations,

that are sought to be monitored without the consent of

all the parties to that conversation.

For the reasons

mentioned earlier, prior approval for consensual monitor-

ing of telephone conversations is not required.

DEA has also used certain electzonic devices abroad

in order to track the location of drug shipments.

These

devices do not transmit, overhear, or record private con-

versations, but rather merely emit signals which indicate

the location of

the device.

DrA's policy concerning electronic surveillance

nas aiso been destiived in ils response to your lotter of

April 24 to Mr. Bartels.

The remaining divisions, bureaus,

and agencies within the Department do not conduct electronic

surveillance of any kind outside the United States.

I trust that the information I have furnished will

assist your subcommittee in its inquiry concerning the prac-

tices and procedures of the federal agencies in the area of

electronic surveillance.

Washington, D. C. 20510

Dear Senator Kennedy:

In my letter to you of May 12, I stated that the De-

partment was in the process of assembling the materials rele-

vant to your inquiry

regarding electronic surveillance con-

ducted within the United States in the interests of national

security and foreign intelligence.

Pursuant to a review of

this matter, I am able to provide you with the following in-

formation.

Since 1940 by directives of the President, the Attorney

General has been vested with responsibility over

electronic

surveillance conducted within the United States in the inter-

ests of national security and foreign intelligence. This sur-

veillance is authorized pursuant to the personal approval of

the Attorney General, rather than by court order.

Based on

• an examination of the relevant precedents, it is the position

of the Department of Justice that the Executive may conduct

electronic surveillance in the interests of national security

and foreign intelligence, and in aid of his conduct of the

nation's foreign affairs, without obtaining a judicial warrant.

This has been the position of the Department of Justice for more

than three decades and is supported by historical practice as

well as judicial decision.

The only two Courts of Appeals to

address the issue, the Third Circuit and the Fifth Circuit, have

held that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment does

not apply in the area of national

security and foreign intelli-

gence.and.that under. the. Constitution the President- has the

authority to conduct electronic surveillance without a court

order as part of his diplomatic and military or commander-in-

chief functions.

Ivanov v. United States 419 U.S. 881 (1974) ; United States

and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Congress also explicitly dis-

claimed any attempt to place

limitations on the President's

authority in this area.

18 U.S.C. § 2511(3). The Supreme

Court has, of course, expressly left open the question whether

the warrant requirement applies to electronic surveillance con-

ducted for national security and foreign intelligence pur-

poses.

In United States v. United States District Court, 407

U.S. 297, 308-9 (1973), however, the Court,

while holding that

the domestic security area was

subject to the warrant require-

ment, was careful to note that "the instant case requires no

judgment with respect to the activities of foreign powers, with-

in or without this country.

There is no evidence of any

involvement, directly or indirectly, of a.

foreign power."

More-

over, in the Butenko case, although the United States prevailed

in the Third Circuit, the

Department acquiesced in the petition

Ior certiorari. Nevertheless, the Court denied certiorari,

thus leaving undisturbed the Third Circuit's decision upholding

the authority of the Executive to conduct electronic surveil-

lance wilhuut a court order where national serurity and foreign.

intelligence is involved.

Under the standards and procedures established by the

President, the personal approval of the Attorney General is re-

quired before any non-consensual electronic surveillance may

be instituted within the United States without a judicial war-

rant.

All requests for surveillance must be made in writing by

the

Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and must

set forth the relevant factual circumstances that justify the

proposed surveillance.

Both the agency and the Presidential

appointee initiating the request must be identified. Requests

from the Director are examined by a special review group which

I have established within the Office of the Attorney General.

Authorization will not be granted unless the Attorney General

has satisfied himself that the requested electronic surveillance

is necessary for national security or foreign intelligence pur-

i secuty y.

poses important to national security.

In addition, the Attorney General must be satisfied that

the subject of the surveillance is either assisting a foreign

-3".

pover or foreign-based political group, or plans unlawful

activity directed against a foreign power or foreign-based

political group.

Finally, he must be satisfied that the

minimum physical intrusion necessary to obtain the informa-

tion will be used.

All authorizations are for a period of ninety days or

less, and the specific approval of the Attorney General is

again required for continuation of the surveillance beyond

that period. The Attorney General has also been directed to

review all electronic, surveillance on a regular basis to en-

sure that the aforementioned

criteria are satisfied. Pursu-

ant to the mandate of United States v. United States District

Court, electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant is

not conducted where there is no foreign involvement.

All electronic surveillance related to national security

and foreign intelligence within the United States is conducted

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Bureau has estab-

lished strict internal review procedures with regard to all

electronic surveillance activities.

The extent of telephone and microphone surveillance

conducted within the United States in the interests of nation-

al security and foreign intelligence was last disclosed in 1973.

On a comparable basis, the extent of such surveillance between

1969 arid May 1975 is set forth in the attached memoranda.

The

total number of subjects of telephone surveillance during that

period is as follows: 1969, 113; 1970, 90; 1911, 81; 1912; 102;

1973, 116; 1974, 148. These figures do not, ot

the number of persons whose conversations were intercepted, but

rather only the number of subjects

•to whom the surveillance

directed.

The total number of subjects of microphone surveillance

• during that period was as follows:

1969, 14; 1970, 19: 1971, 16;

1912, 31: 1913, 38: 1914, 32..

Again, these figures do not in-

dicate the number of persons whose conversations were inter-

cepted, but rather the number of subjects to whom the sur

veillance was directed.. Moreover, I

should further note that

the above figures are duplicative to an

extent since in several

cases the same subject was under both telephone and microphone

surveillance.

The total installations of telephone and microphone sur-

veillances during the above periods would, of course, exceed

HH 55322 DocId:32989714 Page 337

these figures by varying margins.

On occasion, the sub-

ject under surveillance moved to a new location, thus nec-

essitating a re-installation of the surveillance at the new

address.

On other occasions, the surveillance was discon-

tinued because the subject left the promises for an extended

period, but was later re-instituted when the subject returned.

In still other cases,

the surveillance was discontinued for a

period as part of the Department's continuing review and re-

evaluation of all electronic surveillance activities. The

subsequent re-institution of the surveillance pursuant to a

new approval by the Attorney General would be counted as an

additional installation.

For the above reasons, the number

of installations of telephone and microphone surveillances is

extent of electronic surveillance. Nevertheless, pursuant to

your inquiry, I

am including in the attached memoranda

the total

number of installations of electronic surveillance devices for

• both telephone and microphones.

1972.

The records of daily counts were initiated in November

Comparable information is not available for prior periods.

As these figures indicate, the maximum number of telephone sur-

veillances in operation at any time during 1973 was 93; the

minimum number in operation that year was 65. The maximum

number of microphone surveillances in operation during 1973

was 22; the minimum was 10.

In 1974, the maximum number of

telephone surveillances in operation was 106; the minimum num-

ber in operation was 75. Microphone

surveillances in operation

during that period ranged from a maximum of 21 to a minimum of

10. During the first four and a half months of 1975, the maxi-

mum number of telephone surveillances in operation at any time

was 91; the minimum was 67. The maximum numbex of microphone

surveillances in operation at any time during that period was

20; the minimum was 9. On April 1, 1975, there were 75 tele-

phone and 15 microphone surveillances in operation.

I trust that the information supplied to date is of

assistance to your subcommittee in its inquiry into the prac-
