1. Recently Elaine R. Lenay, of KUTUBE, advined ¿bat on

15 February 1962, during the course of your developing a potential

agent of interest to KUTUBE in New York City, N. Y., she

advanced $50. 0D to you for this use. Because of operational

reasons at the time, it was not feasible to obtain a receipt for

this money.

2. Elaine R. Lenay advises that she recently submitted

a claim for the $50. 00 in conjunction with her travel voucher

for the trip during which this contact was made. The above was

disallowed by the Finance Division on the grounds that neither a

receipt nor an accounting was avallable.

3. Until such time as a receipt can be obtained from you.

the claim for $50. 00 le being disallowed. Therefore, it would

be appreciated if you would forward such a receipt at your earliest

convenience.
