CONSPIRATORIAL

ASPECTS

KC T-9 advised on January 29, 1964,

that it is

T-9's impression that SAM PALMA is a member of the La Cosa

Nostra and has been on "hits". T-9 based this on informa-

tion received in which PALMA has indicated that he has

often sat in a car for hours on end without eating and this

was PALMA's method of stating that he had traveled on "a

hit".

PALMA was reported to have stated that he knows a

lot of people in different cities throughout the country

and has done a lot of traveling:

T-9 also advised that SAM PALMA had mentioned to

an acquaintance that he wished this individual to contact

"CHECKERS" in Denver when this individual was visiting

them.

"CHECKERS" may refer to CLYDE SMALDONE, a well-known

Denver criminal figure.

T-9 advised on April 16, 1964, that SAM PALMA,

through arrangements made with ROY WILLIAMS, President oi

Joint Teamsters Council #56, Kansas City, Missouri, will

be going to Sacramento, California, "because

Sacramento needs some muscle". PALMA is to be pairin

$1,000 a week and had planned

would

be met by a man whom WILLIAMS had previously

contacted. T-9 stated this trip was delayed due to

illness of the individual PALMA was to meet in California,

however, he intends to take this trip in the future.

T-9 stated that T-9 was unable to determine

whether PALMA's services involved threat-type situations

or a killing but from the expressions used by PALMA, T-9

assumed it would be threat-type situations rather than a

killing.

PALMA has FBI #327 429 A, date of birth March 3,

1925, and has been previously described by informants as a

member of the criminal organization in Kansas City.

KC T-& advised during September, 1963, that

ANTHONY CIVELLA, nephew of NICK CIVELLA, 'had told associates

that SAM GIANCANA of Chicago, Illinois,

was the "boss of

Chicago, Kansas City, and St. "Louis".
