This agent reported that

ANDRES PELEGRINO, was working at Talisman as a tractor foreman

However, this unknown agent's reports were never very complete

and were sporadic. It was extremely difficult to communicate

with him, and his reports contained less

information after

the arrival of G-ll and were delayed for long periods of time.

When Cuban Agent G-1] was sent to the United States, it was

the hope of the DGI that he would soon be able to handle most

After he began to report on a

regular basis, the unknown agent was discontinued. Additionally,

some type of problem with the unknown agent developed.

it was of such importance that the DGI discontinued his operation.
