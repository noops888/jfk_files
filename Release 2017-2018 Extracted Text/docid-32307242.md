Fit will be recalled that for the past several years ROTHAN,

This office,

has been the front man at the Sans Souci night club

â€¢ In Havanad uring at least a part of this time RoTHAN was reliably

reported to be bankrolled by the SaMey

XLANNARINO interests of New Kensington,

HEREIN

Pae It in thought possible that Mr. PENNINTONe interest may hid

some Pennsylvanda political problet Involving AWARIN. (

MrazsCotT advised that he told PENNINGTON nothing on the telephon

about ROTHAN but suggested that PENNINGTON write him a letter suggesting

what he desired to know.

SCOTT has subsequently advised that he never

receiped the letter.

On October 20, 1954 SCOTT advised that ROTHAN had inquired 6e

him concerning a good bank to deposit $25,000.

ROTHAN intimated to SCOrT

that he wanted this to be more or less a hideout bank account and scort

recoumended him to the Bank of Nova Scotia and believes that ROTHAN made

the, depostt there.

Ithis rather doubted that this twenty-five thousand doller leppelt l

aay spectal significance as it has come to the attention of th's one:

that RoTHANy since closing the sans soucian April 19549

has been ena-

siderally in debt and owes money all over Havana, and it is thought that

he was looking for a new bank in which to make a deposit in order that his

creditore would not be aware of the fact that hedgow has money.

ROTFIAN on

October 25, 1954 advised Agents of this office that he hopes to be able to

open the sans Souci in late December 1954 andvindicated that he would

to be permitted to operate.
