According

to CarlostZarraga/Martinez,

a Cuban refugee

who actively participates in anti-Castro matters in the Miami,

Florida, area, plans were being made prior to May, 1964, for an

elite group inside Cuban military at Havana to make an

on lives of Fidel Castro,

Raul Castro or Ernesto "Che" Guevara

sometime during the general celebration of Fidel Castro's Sixth

anniversary as head of the Cuban Government which began on.

January 1, 1959.

Zarraga indicates that anti-Castro group in

Miami maintained

contact clandestinely with the elite group in

Havana until sometime prior to May, 1964,

but that this

communication link was broken and that he has

no current data

concerning the possible assassination attempt.

Miami Office furnished State Department's Cuban Affairs

Office there a copy of a memorandum concerning this possible

attempt and, in accordance with the request of State Department's

Miami representative, we have delivered a copy of it to State

Department's Cuban Coordinator in Washington, D. C.

In view

of Che Guevara's arrival in New York City to address the UN,s.

we have'also instructed the New York Office to alert the

Police Department and local representatives of

the various U.S. Government agencies who are interested in

Guevara's movements in New York City.

They are belng told the

a Cuban refugee in the U.S. whose identity is unknown to our

source possibly will leave the U. S. for some purpose connected

with the assassination attempt.

Miami Office has also furnished copies of its

locally and headquarters
