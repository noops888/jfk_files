selection of mate.

NORMAN ROTHMAN

NORMAN ROTHMAN has represented the MANNARINOs in their Cuban

and some Florida interests for many years. ROTHMAN, like all

other MANNARINO employees, steals from them, and when the

MANNARINOs have lost money in an investment, such as the Sans

Souc1 Gambling Casino, Havana, Cuba, which ROTHMAN fronted for

them, ROTHMAN always emerges

JOHN CHRISTOPHER FONTANA

JOHN FONTANA was once KELLY MANNARINO's bodyguard and most

trusted lieutenant. KELLY MANNARINO regarded FONTANA as his

protege and made him a "don."

After FONTANA's marriage about

a year and a half ago, he and MANNARINO had a falling out.

FONTANA thought that he was not getting enough money and

complained to MANNARINO, who told him that he was getting all

he was going to get.

FONTANA then made the serious mistake

of going over KELLY MANNARINO's head and appealing to JOHN

LA ROCCA, who subsequently reported this to KELLY MANNARINO.

Since then FONTANA has been relegated to an unimportant job

fronting the Marbet Heating Company store in New Kensington,

and he receives little or no income from the MANNARINO ganding

activities.

Gun-running

Although the Federal Government was not able to prove it,

there is no question that SAMUEL MANNARINO was part of the

conspiracy in 1958 to run guns from New Kensington, Pa., to

Cuba.

Originally the plans to take guns to Cuba were

which means that gamblers in Squirrel Hill are

transported from that section to New Kensington for the pur-

pose of gambling.

Routine employees at the gambling casino

receive $150 per week flat, and those in charge receive the

$150 weekly salary plus a small percentage of the net take.

It has been curious in the past to note that whenever they so

desire, KELLY MANNARINO Or SAM MANNARINO would walk into the

gambling casino and demand that the cashier give them a sum

of money.

For Instance; SAM MANNARINO might tell the cashier

to give him $1,000 and not to tell KELLY MANNARINO at the

risk of being killed. Employees at the casino do not carry

weapons generally, buton occasions, when there is a rumor that

the casino may be

robbed, everybody, including the MANNARINOs,

goes about town fully armed.

Prostitution and Narcotics

Neither KELLY nor SAM MANNARINO has ever been known to traffic

'in narcotics or to operate prostitution.

Church, New Kensington, Pa.
