HKHO RANDUM FOR THE ERCORD

IRPORT OF INTERROGATION

DATE: 29 July 1965

Komsomol

•Following higblights:

8) ANXETA (DPHQ) :

Subject displayed a superf1cinl

knowledge of this basic questionnaire.

He knows generally

the appenrance, the nature of the questions, and the parpose

of the document.

He continued to maintain,

Incorrectly, that

1t was required in two copies, that he filled it out at bone,

that it consisted of 4-6 pages.

He anended his story to say

that he does not romember for sure whether : he turned 1t ln

to BOZENKO 'a people on one of his first visits, or gave 1t

to

SAXHAROV when he first reported for work.

COMENT: An ordinary member of the KGB might concefvably

have forgotten the details of this document which vas

I11led out only at the beginning of his career.

As a

supervisor, however, Subject claim to have reviered

mnny permonnel f1len (as be bould have): a such, be

could not possibly make the mistakes that he ham about

this document, or be unable to give a better description

01t.

Becrecy Agreement:

Subject himself stated that

ho had simed such a form for SAKHAROY Ten ho first reported

for work.

He was unable to renember the proper designation

The description of

to 1947; 100, 1t is similar to the secrecy agreement that

'sht bo signed by an agent.

c) Lichuly Listok po Ucbetu Kadror: This In not a

very important document, but it is illled out by every

officer, and in found in every personnel &ile. Subject wan

not only unable to recall it, he nintained he had never

beard of it even afterit was described to him..

COMMENT:

Agnin, although Subject night base forgotten

1$ 11 he bad been just a plain case officer in the IGB,

he should know of 1t as & supervisor, or even as

Secretary of the Konsonol Organization (1t i8 a CC/CPBU

queationnaire).

d) SPRAYKA No. l: Thia document is reguired for

every personel action.

Subject did not react at all to

1ta mme and said he didn't knon of 1t.

When it's purpose

was described to him, Subject managed to give a superficial

descriptios of the document.

CODENT: An ordinary case ofiicer would know of the

existence of this form, but would not necessarily have

over scen 1t.

As deputy chief of a department, however,

Subject would handle this document 30-40 times a year.

and would be thoroughly faniliar with it.

Thus, bia

limited knowleage of it could only bavo come fron a brief.

e)

Posluzhney Spook (Enployment and Service Record):

Asked about Ebis document,

Subject gave a good description of

1ts nature and purpose.

Ala anewor that he himself did not

I1ll it out but that it vas filled out by personnel on tbe

basis of the data in bis Anketa is perfectly plausible.

It

1e odd, however, that Subject inslated that be did not sign

this document when be first entered the KGB (as 1a nomally

done), but only "in 1958 or 1957."

Subject uns asked how he anwered some of the questions

In tho Anketa, particularly the questions on bia former wife,

her relatives, and on bis mother's ancestry.

I then asked

Bubject how it was, taking into account bis mother's aristocratie

ancestry, the fact

that be father died in Jail, the Trotskyite

allegations agninet Subject's father, the fact that Subject's

former fatber-in-law was stild In jald, and the fact that Subject

was present when TELEGIN's apartment was searched - that he

had been accepted into the KCB, particularly in 1953. Subject

adnitted that the question was

logical, and said that he could

only assume that the Illiluence of KOBULOV and the Important

and influential position of his own father outweighed there

nogative factors.

Ho lao cited bia GRU experience in tbia

connection.

I then anted Subfoet pou be tad mported big recond

mriage to the IGB.

He replied that before the marriage bo

had mentloned it briefly to GORBATINKO, and that be had

run a nine check on his prospective bride, (whict

out

mnother anteta for personnel in which he incluged all the

roquired data on his wife and her relatives.

After considerable

prompting, Subject said that he had indicated that sbe and ber

parents had been in France, but that be had concealed the lact

that her grandmother had been in German occupied territoty

during the war (ho admitted that the KGB would have learned

this in a routine check, howover.)

I then retiewed for Subject

the negativo security factors mentioned above, adding the

arrest of KobuLov,

the fact that his new wife and her parents

had been abroad, the fact that her grandmother was in German-

occupied territory, the fact that subject was now everage for....

the Konsomol but not yet & party neuber or candidate, and the

Inct that Subject received « 15 day sentence for misuse of

cover documents and incurring _

1I be didn't think that

'bis personnel file had been reviewed

in 1934, and 1d so. what grounds there could have been for

retaining his in the KGB.

Subject said that he thought that

his file probably was reviewed but that ugain the influence

of bis fatber had saved bim.

Subject added that another

important factor was probably his languago qualification and

particularly his bigher education.

I told Subject that we

would examine the question of his education in greater detail

He made no comment. I also pointed out to Subject

that if his secoad wife and her parents bad been abroad 1t

was Inpossible that ber name check could have been negative.

He sinitted it was Illogeal, but Insisted that this was so.

CONCLUSIONS: Evidence contines to pile up to show

that Subject was never in a supervisory position in the KGB,

and that be could not have and did not enter the KGB in 1953.

Ile weak knowledge of the documents discussed indicates that

11 be was ever in the IGB at all it as liter, and for a

relatively short time.

5. Despite the fact that I continued to challenge Subject

frequently, the tono

of the interrogation was perticularly

friendly today. The following excharge was of somo interest:

Fubject: You probably worked for twenty yeare in personnel!

Ted: Not exactly. You should know better.

Subject:

No, I don't know.

If you told me your name?

Ted:

We'll talk about that later, and maybe even drin

to each other's boalth.
