Hollywood, Florida

JOHN EK stated that sKierty runs with a hippie group

and is associated with ROBERT SCHWARTZ, editor of the

"Libertarian Watchdogan underground hipple-type newspaper

that stands for legalized marijuana, youth power' and the

crushing of police brutality.

According to EK, the "Libertarian Watchdog" runs &

rogues gallery of uncover agents and police officers who operate

covertly in investigating narcotics and other violations.

SKLAREY has assisted SCHWARTZ and has attempted

to obtain photo-

graphs of these individuals.

It is to be noted that PATCH

was formerly associated with SCHWARTZ on the "Libertarian

Watchdog".

EK stated that SKLAREY had never approached him for

firearms,

although it would be the logical thing perhaps for

him to do if he was interested in obtaining them.

EK stated

that SKIAREY recently attended & Commissioners meeting where

firearm control laws were discussed and expressed to EK his

great disappointment that controls were not enacted.

SKLAREY,

according to EK, has no formal employment but had recently

stated he may take over the "Libertarian Watchdog."

EK

stated that PHIL OAKs was unknown to him and he

had never heard SKLAREY mention such an individual.

The above is furnished the Chicago office for its

information.

No further investigation is being conducted by Miami

in view of the lack of & substantial allegation and the fact

the original source has been described as

unreliable.
