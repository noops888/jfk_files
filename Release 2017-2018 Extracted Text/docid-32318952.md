Enclosed is a copy of G. Norman Christensen to

Mr. Greenleaf memorandum dated 5/22/92 captioned as above.

The Director has decided and advised Congress that all

material concerning the assassination of President John F.

Kennedy (JFK) not previously requested under the Freedom

of

Information Act and placed in the FBIHQ Reading Room would be

reviewed.

Due to our present budgetary constraints,

Mr. Greenleaf wanted to have a Task Force handle this project

with the least amount of funds being used.

To accomplish this, it was decided that former Freedom

of Information-Privacy Acts Analysts would comprise the JFK Task

Force and conduct this review.

These people will be needed in

the next couple of weeks.

Pages 6 and 7 of the enclosed

memorandum, you will find a listing of employees in your

respective Divisions and Office that will be used on the Task

Force.

L

Please have your respective personnel contact Section

Chief Kevin O'Brien's office, extension 3625, to determine the

exact time period they will need to report to work on this Task

Force.

"ASSASSINATION MATERIALS DISCLOSURE ACT OF 1992"

ADDENDUM: Information Management Division (IMD). 6/8/92, JKO: Kaw

Technical Services Division

Richard A. Ploshay

Office of Public Affairs

Margaret M. Tremblay

The Section proposes that 20 of these employees be

temporarily assigned to this project for an 8 week period

beginning in July:

Thereafter,

an assessment will be made as to

how personnel will be obtained

for the second eight week period,

tentatively scheduled to begin in September, which is mentioned

in recommendation number 2.

It is possible that some field

analysts may be required

to fill personnel needs,

but the

progress of the work and budgetary constraints will be important

factors

in any recommendation.

To capture costs of this project, a separate cost code,

1581, has been obtained.

salaries will be paid out of the

existing general FBI budget, since employees woula be on boaro

although in other assignments, if this

project did not exist.

However, other costs, such as

overtime, supplies, and equipment

will need designated funding.

We are unable to assess overtime needs now, but will do

so as the project progresses.

In order to make maximum use of summer employees now,

we believe that ten or more, with college experience, can be used

on the project, if available.

etc., have

been obtained

needed.

The initial cost is $1,492.54.

Computer equipment ( 6 desktop computers and 2 laser

jet printers) has been requested. Its cost would be

approximately $33,000.
