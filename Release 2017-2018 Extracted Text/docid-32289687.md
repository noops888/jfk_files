Re:

Vincent Alo

NOTE: The los Angeles Office has

under investigation a case

involving Vincent Alo, Anthony Salerno, Elliot Paul Price,

Jerome Zarowitz, and Ruby Lazarus.

This group met during

October, 1965, at the time of the 1965 world series.

The

group met at a Palm Springs,

approximately $200,000. 00 worth of rambling

residence to discuss

shortages caused by

Ruby Lazarus.

Numerous telephone calls were made from the

quarters being occupied by the above group to gamblers all over

the country.

A previous investigation had determined that Alo

and Salerno belong to La Cosa Nostra "Family" headed by Jerry

Catena of Newark, New Jersey.

Elliot Paul Price is a nationally

prominent "lay-off" bookmaker.

This case is presently under

investigation by Federal grand jury, Los Angeles, California.

Ruby Lazarus declined to answer questions after being granted

immunity and is incarcerated in contempt of court.
