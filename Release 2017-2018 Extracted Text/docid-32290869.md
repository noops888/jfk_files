MM 92-88

MM 829-PC advised on 1/24/63 that he has known

subject for a number of years and has had him as a client

on several occasions. He mentioned that the subject had

been in his office just a few weeks prior to the interview,

but declined to discuss any specific matters relative to

the subject inasmuch as he was a client.

He made the

comment that the subject has a very unusual personality,

who appears to have considerable influence, but is the

type of person that "one can never feel close to."

MM 829-PC may be characterized as a person

who is in daily contact with the criminal element in the

Miami area.
