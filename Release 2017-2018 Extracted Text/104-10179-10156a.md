RAY prior to his departure failed.

As RAY was expected to return on 8 July to San

At 2200 hours on 8 July, RODRIGUEZ

personally called [SKSWER-1 in Ponce, Puerto Rico,

to deterine if RAY had returned. °YS71 had not

yet heard from his contact, one (fnu) MELENDEZ,

if RAY had in fact returned.

On 9 July [s}1 stated that RAY had not returned.

On this same date RODRIGUEZ called Chief of

Station, JMWAVE, who informed. him that RAY was

still in Miami and would probably remain there

two or three more days.

This time RODRIGUEZ

decided to proceed immediately to Miant, It was

learned that RAY had in fact returned to San

Juan in the evening of 8 July.

H. After talking with Mr. ZOGBY on 9 July; RODRIGUEZ

Intended to returm to San Juan in order to make

contact; however,

due to the strike of Eastern

Airlines and the heavy loads being carried by

PAA, there was no space available for the week-

end and possibly not until after 16 July. A inch

to meet with him in the USA. Finally arrange-

3. From information available in San Juan and partic-

available to WAVE, li can be said with some certaint;

that RAY 18 surely the personal instrument of Governor MUND2

Rolling a My in to docal end e peasa chat ene

RAY will create an unnamed organization of key

Cuban exiles which once Inforned, will with the initial

backing of Governor MUNOZ seek support of President Romulo

• BETANCOURT and Ex-President Jose FIGURES.

With this back-

ing, it will then be possible to bring considerable pressure

on the U. S. Government to buy this package. RAY has indi-

cated to WAVE sources that whereas he is not persona grata

with the Agency, he has important political connections in

Washington and is thus kept informed of much of the Agency's

activities.

RAY's new organization is not to be military

or engage in military thrusts against Cuba because military

activity is presently controlled by the Agency and cannot

be wrested from it at this time. RAY's new organization

will cooperate with the Consejo and attempt to move in on

It with the ultimate aim of taking over and dominating it.
