their marriage.

He advised he

had hired attorneys to represent him, but continued court

appearances became excessive for him as his job was in

jeopardy because of his absences from work to attend

court hearings.

Therefore, according to Mr. Hingston,

he did not contest the divorce.

Mr. Kingston stated that on

the day of the divorce, he was

dismissed from the courtroom

on the advice of his own attorney. He stated he was later

informed that Miss Collins made allegations that he had

beaten her in the past.

He stated that this

was not true

and had he known that

these allegations were to be the

grounds for divorce, he would have contested the divorce.

Mr. Hingston stated that Miss Collins is a bright

and industrious individual who is a loyal American citizen

and he knows of nothing further of a derogatory nature

concerning her.

He recommended her for a position of trust

and responsibility with the United States Government.

Mr. McGraw

stated that Miss Collins appeared to be a

going through a divorce.

Mr. McGraw advised that he thought

this divorce, in his opinion, affected the personality of

Miss Collins as there were times when she was quite abrasive

and "rubbed people the wrong way." He stated that at that

He said that when the

university started a black studies program, Mr. Gay was

selected by the black students to be Director, and

Mr. Gay's selection was subsequently approved

by the

Mr. Gay had the necessary background, experience, or

education for this position; however, the committee

overruled him.

decision to pay Mr. Gay a high salary and provide him with

a good expense account.

Father Barrett said MT. Gay set up a black

rector, however, he said Mr. Cay abused his expense
