Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Hote) .

CG 92-350

BLASI:

If he got a bartender here, he'd tell "em

what the (obs) you gonna do, nothing.

SIMONELLI:

BLASI:

Yeah.

I mean, I don't give a (obs).

(both leave room and can be heard in outer

bar in conversation with two or more other

persons.)

The above conversation took place between DOMINIC

"Butch" BLASI, bodyguard and chauffeur for GIANCANA, anc

TARQUIN "Queenie" SIMONELLI, who is the brother-in-law of

TONY ACCARDO, prominent Chicago hoodlum.

Exact significance of conversation in which reference

is made to "boot" is not clear; however, in view of sounds

indicating some type manual labor in progress and subsequent

reference to delivery of "leads" to JOHN KRINGAS, conversation

might possibly refer to some type telephone apparatus.

Noted

BLASI also advised SIMONELLI that he suggested to SAM GIANCANA

that telephone be used for making meeting dates only. JOHN

KRINGAS is the owner of Gus' Steak House, a notorious Cicero,

Illinois, gambling establishment.

Identity of LOU SHOES, who apparently died 4/10/62

and was known to both BLASI and SIMONELLI, not known to

Chicago Office at this time.

Telephone conversation held between BLASI and

unidentified person apparently relates to business being

conducted at the Eden land and Building Company, Schiller

Park, Illinois, of which BLASI is allegedly Executive Vice

President.

Noted during interview of BLASI by SA JOHN R.

BASSETT of Chicago Office earlier this month BLASI made

available a business card for this company claiming it was

a successful new venture.

CG 6533-C advised 4/12/62 that the Armory Lounge

is officially closed until 4/24/62 and that CARMEN FANELLI,

proprietor, has entered hopital for an operation. Conversation

relating to ice machine apparently refers to instructions

left by FANELLI with BLASI regarding operation of the machine

while the Armory Lounge is closed indicating that although

the Lounge is closed to the public, hoodlums will continue

to conduct meetings there.
