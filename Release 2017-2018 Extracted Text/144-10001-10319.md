CHINESE DELEGATE DISRUPTS WORLD PEACE COUNCIL

28 Nov 63

--

I learned that in Today's inaugural meeting of the World

Peace Council, on which I am reporting in a dispatch of the

same date, Professor LANGE, Polish Deputy Chairman of the

Council of State, opened the work by expressing his profound

sorrow over the death of President KENNEDY and affirming that

his passing must be considered a serious loss for humanity.

The fetch dele ane was ey son in the sentiments, pro-

other delegations were agreeing on this proposal, a Chinese

delegate seized the microphone and, despite the Chairmah's

attempts to prevent his speaking, since the intervention of the

Peking delegation had not been requested according to procedure,

stated, shouting, that KENNEDY's death should not be mourned

since he was the principal exponent of aggressive Capitalism

and that if there should be grief; it should be expressed for

all those who had died through the crime of aggression of the

capitalist system, personified éspecially by the United States.

A profound silence in the Assembly followed the untimely re-

marks of the Chinese delegate, after which work was resumed.
