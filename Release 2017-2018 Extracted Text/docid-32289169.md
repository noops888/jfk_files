It should be noted that although this source

recognizes that his father has not told him everything

he does feel that with his association since childhood

with the criminal element in Chicago, having served

time in the Illinois State Penitentiary and his continued

close association with the Chicago criminal element, he

would probably have heard of any such rituals

membership.

attendant to

Chicago desires only to point out that the

operational procedures of this group could very well be

different from those which are known in other cities.

It

is not Chicago's intention to take issue with the information

that has been forthcoming from highly reliable sources in

New York and Philadelphia simply to point out that this

difference may exist.

INFORMANTS

Information from highly confidential sources has

been paraphrased in order to afford protection to these

valuable sources.
