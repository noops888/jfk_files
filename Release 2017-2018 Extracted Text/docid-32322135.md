Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

A number of the original documents contained in Detroit

files 92-447 (subject: Lawrence Thomas Phillip McHugh) and 92-438

Sub 2 (subject: Vito Giacalone) have information that has been

blacked out.

The JFKTF is charged with determining the content

Headquarters file numbers for field files without going through

the field office itself

Therefore, the JFKTF requests Detroit

determine the corresponding

Headquarters file numbers.
