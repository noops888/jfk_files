At that time LANGLEY told informant that he has not been

connected with gambline enterprises for more than a year

and that he intends to retire from gambling.

According to informant, LANGLEY purchased a house

at 6351 NÂº E. 19th Terrace, Et. Lauderdale, Florida, where

he resides with his wife.

LANGLEY reportedly owns a

substantial interest in a pizza-pie business.

WFO will follow the activities of NESLINE and

subject closely and will advise the Bureau and Miami of

significant developments.

Miami will interview GEORGE LANGLEY regarding his

association with the subject and NESLINE.

In this regard

although LANGLEY claims that he has not been involved in

gambling enterprises for more than a year, it is likely

that he will be contacted by the subject, NastINE, and other

prominent gamblers and hoodlums when they visit Florida.

LANGLEY is knowledgeable regarding top-level gambling

activity in Washington, D. C., and Florida for a substantial

number of years.

WFO feels that LANGLEY would be an excellent target

for development under the Top Echelon Criminal Informant

Program.

Miami, in contacting LANGLEY, should insure WF 1108-C

is fully protected.
