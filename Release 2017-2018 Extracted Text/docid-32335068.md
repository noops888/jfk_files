LEE HARVEY OSWALD

IS-R-CUBA

NY 3948-C on 3/26/64, reported that he had a

conversation with H. THEODORE LEE on 3/20/64, in which

LEE mentioned to the informant that he had turned over all

correspondence regarding the desire of LEE HARVEY OSWALD

to establish a chapter of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee

(FPCC) in Dallas to the FBI.

GEN

The informant indicated that LEE also related

that statements concerning the assassination of President

KENNEDY by individuals previously active in FPCC declare

that the President was actually assassinated by Dallas

Police Officer TIPPIT.

Also that one week before the

assassination, Patrolman TIPPIT, the Head of the John

Birch Society in Dallas and an unnamed third party suggested

by these FPCC individuals as possibly being OSWALD, were

together in JACK RUBY's night club.

LEE also stated that while OSWALD was an FPCC

advocate, he had also joined a number of anti-CASTRO

movements and was, therefore, in position to know everything

that was going on on both sides of the issues involved.
