Informant advised that he was in company with JOE

VALENTI the previous weekend.

He said that VALENTI was real

upset and was

telling him that somebody "high up" in the

syndicate was "doing a lot of talking" to the FBI. Informant

said that VALENTI told him of his interview the previous

Friday, 3/1/63, by the FBI. He said that VALENTI told him

that the FBI had his car "bugged"' apparently because "they knew

all about him."

Informant stated that VALENTI told him that the

FBI knew about his going to the Palm Furniture Co. and of his

contacts with SAMMY GIORDANO.

Informant said that actually

VALENTI was never "tight" with SAMMY G. and, in fact, VALENTI

hates GIORDANO. He added that VALENTI

been close

for years; however, he cansot be sure it VAlENtI knowS JOrNY

AYOTTE or not.

Informant advised that VALENTI told him that therBI

showed him a $50.00 check from Palm Furniture Co. which was

endorsed by "JOE VARGA" but which had VALENTI's true address

and telephone number of 12779 Evanston, LA 7-6173 and also

VALENTI's previous Michigan auto license number GG 4261.

Informant stated that VALENTI admitted to him that he had

actually endorsed this check as "JOE VARGA" and that "JOE VARGA"

was the allas given to him by SAMMY G. during the two week.

period during June, 1960, in which he (VALENTI) had worked

as

a salesman at Palm

Furniture. Informant said that VALENTI told

him that the check wasn't phony but that he had certainly made

a mistake in putting down his own address, phone number and

car license number.

Informant added that

VALENTI also told him

SAMMY G. had used htmas a "front" for two weeks and had paid

him a salary of $100.00 a week.

He stated that VALENTI seemed

very relieved that he only worked at Palm Furniture two weeks

and VALENTI commented that he was thankful that the one order

he signed for at Palm Furniture under the name "JOE VARGA" was

actually one of the orders which was paid for.

Informant advised that VALENTI commented that the

Palm Furniture check he signed, using the mame "JOE VARGA", was

a check proffered to him by SAMMY GIORDANd one day while work-

ing in the store.

VALENTI told him that it wasn't a salary

check and he cashed it only because GIORDANO needed some

cash. Informant said that VALENTI told him that he knew the

check was good so he gave GIORDANO the $50.00 cash. He advised

that VALENTI complained to him that when he went to cash the

Palm Furniture check at the Clark Gas Station the guy asked him

for all kinds of identification and he confusedly gave the name

"JOE VARGA" even though the check was made out to "cash" plus

all his own identifying data. Informant said that VALENTI told

him that he only went to work at Palm as he thought he could

make some money but, as it turned out, he "didn't eat or

drink", ie, make any money from the deal.

Informant advised that VALENTI told him that following

his interview the previous Friday by the FBI he had contacted

JOE "WHIP" TRIGLIA and gave "JOE WHIP" all the details of the

interview.

VALENTI tOld Informant that he asked TRIGLIA to get

in touch with RUBINO right away and find out what RUBINo wants

him (VALENTI) to do or say in the whole matter.

On 3/11/63, Informant advised that VALENTI told him

that TRIGLIA had contacted him and gave him a message from MIKE

RUBINO to the effect "Don't bother me. I've got troubles of my

own".

Informant commented that VALENTI is now real hot at

RUBINO.

He said

that really RUBINO made a big mistake in

answering VALENTI'S request like this as VALENTI's testimony

could help "bury

RUBINO".

Informant commented that he does

not believe that VALENTI actually knows RUBINO.

He said that

certainly VALENTI has seen RUBINO & few times around town but

that VALENTI, when he was associated with "the people" was

employed in

the numbers in the old Murphy House, which is now

run by "FAT DOMINIC" CORRADO and TONY GIACALONE, and VALENTI

wouldn't have come in contact with RUBINO, who represented another

faction in the syndicate.

He said that he knows that VALENTI

knows SAMMY G. but that VALENTI displays nothing but contempt

now for GIORDANO.

Informant advised that VALENTI has

been ranting and

raving about "the people" having no sense of loyalty or morals.

Informant added that not only does VALENTI realize this now

but he is still afraid of them. He offered that VALENTI is not

afraid of.

say, MIKE RUBINO Or TONY GIACALONE, as a person but

because they represent a strong organization - the syndicate.

Informant remarked that VALENTI had been employed as a

"pick-up man" and an office worker in the numbers for TONY

GIACALONE but that VALENTI and GIACALONE got in "a big beef"

one day and GIACALONE fired VALENTI.

Informant said that

VALENTI missed a "pick-up" one day at a particularly large

"drop" and it caused a lot of confusion and the loss of a

day's business"

Informant stated that VALENTI complained that

he "made a tail" and thus wasn't able to make the "stop".

added that the two of them apparently got in a big hassle over

it and the upshot was that VALENTI lost his job.

Informant ad

vised that VALENTI is still "pretty hot" at GIACALONE over this

whole incident.

recipient of a bomb.

He stated that he thought that DITTA was

only "flying off the handle" in these threats but that it is

an indication to him of how DITTA "reverts to type."
