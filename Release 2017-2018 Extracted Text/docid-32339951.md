SAMMY has been able to report relatively little

concerning

Service Number 1, saying only that "recently"

the former

Information Department of the KGB First Chief

Directorate was upgraded to the level of a "service" and

was renamed Service Number 1.

According to SAMMY, a

"service" is on

the same administrative level as

Directorate, which means that Service Number 1 is higher

in

status than a department and that the Chief of the

Service Number 1 receives a higher salary than a depart-

ment chief.

This change was made,

according to SAMMY,

because it was necessary to expand the Information Depart-

ment to include more people. He could not recall the name

to expo d

of the chief of

Service Number 1 or of any of the officers

came fr

assigned to it.
