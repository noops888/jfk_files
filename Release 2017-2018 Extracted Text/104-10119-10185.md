Remarks:

Perhaps the reasons for not publishing

the manuscript go beyond "checking on the

facts", etc. It could be that publishers

see this as an Agency effort to covertly tell

"the true story" and for that reason don't

wish to play a part in any publication endeavor.

MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Security Research Staff

FROM

SUBJECT

: Chief, Liaison and External Operations Branch

: Manuscript: Give Us This Day

Author: Edward J. Hamilton

inc.

...-

A letter from Tom Wallace of Holt, Rhinehart and Winston,

Inc. book publishers dated July 9, 1968 and addressed to Bill

Buckley of the National Review discusses subject publication and

indicates that Holt, Rhinehart declined publication because the man-

uscript by Hamilton was considered "far too controversial"'. A note

from Saroyan accompanying the manuscript indicated that Buckley

had sent this manuscript to Arlington House. A Henry Durkin now

publicity manager for Walker and Company handled this manuscript

while he, Durkin, was working for Arlington House some time ago.

Walker and Company have just recently declined to publish the man-

uscript apparently for the same reason as Holt, Rhinehart and

Arlington House.

It was noted that Arlington House rejected the

manuscript as

controversial because they had no way of checking

out the facts.

A review of the first few pages of the manuscript rather

clearly show this to be the work of E. Howard Hunt (OS file #23500),

presently a staff employee assigned to the European Division of DDP.

The following items culled from the manuscript were compared with

factual data in Mr. Hunt's security file:

a) Manuscript, page 6-- "The air was cool on this second

day of December 1956.... twenty of us were seated around

the spacious office of the Hon. Arthur Gardner, American

Ambassador to Cuba' ( then in Havana)

Hunt's file-- travel order dated 19 November 1956 authorized

Hunt to travel to and from Havana on TDY during the period

7-15 December 1956.

b) Manuscript, page 8, 9--"In 1926, at the height of the

Florida boom, my father was practicing law in Miami Beach";

the manuscript goes on to indicate that Subject's father had a

serious problem with his business partner which related to

missing funds and the partnership was dissolved.

Hunt's file-- Subject's personal history statement reveals that

Subject's father was an attorney. A Dun and Bradstreet report

dated 16 January 1945 indicated that when Subject's father was

with L. R. Steel Company as an attorney in the 20's that the

company failed with disastrous results, however, Subject's

father was exonerated after an investigation.

c) Manuscript, page 10-- "In March of 1960 I was having coffee

with the newly-elected president of the country (Uruguay) to

which I was assigned when a station officer was admitted. "

The manuscript goes on to indicate that Hunt had to report to

Washington.

people. Our cover staff provided me with documentation

that would support the operational alias I was to live with

for the duration of the Project: Edward J. Hamilton. I

drew a travel advance and flew to Tampa where I boarded a

National Airlines flight to Havana. "

Hunt's file-- On 27 September 1960 action was taken to pro-

vide alias

i documentation to Howard Hunt in the name of

Edward J. Hamilton. This documentation included a bonafide

District of Columbia driver's permit in alias including a

backstopped residence address. Later, in June of 1963 a

post office box in Washington, D.C. was established for Hunt

under the name, Edward J. Hamilton.

A rather casual review of the rest of the manuscript indicates

general similarity of the descriptive data of the author's ( Edward J.

Hamilton's ) activities with regard to the Cuban situation and the actual

facts regarding E. Howard Hunt and his Agency role.

It is quite clear that at least a number of minor compromises

of security are involved here. Additionally, personal opinion regarding

a number of prominent and in some cases former Agency employees

could be considered controversial if not actually damaging. Beginning

on page 214, the manuscript describes General Cabell's role in the

Cuban episode and it can be assumed that this presentation would do

little to add to General Cabell's reputation. Other references through-

out the manuscript may also produce provocative if not alarming con-

sequences when reviewed by those concerned or described.
