Mitchell Livingston WERBELL III, the principal

owner of the arms manufacturing firm befense Systens

International and an international arms dealer, has been

encouraging a group of Bahanian citizens on the island

of Abaco who seel: to secede from the Bahamian Commonwealth.

In this affair WERDELL has been collaborating with a

group based in Miami called the "Friends of Abaco."

Active. in the Friends of Abaco is Michael OLIVER, a wealthy

land developer residing at 2089 El Rancho Drive,

Carson City,

Nevada.

OLIVER, a naturalized U. S. Citizen, was born

Moses OLITSKI on 1l December 1928 in Lithuania.

HERBELL, on the

other hand, has privately expressed a desire to establish

a tourist mecca on Abaco to include hotels, recreation

facilities and gambling casinos.

Friends of Abaco, on 10 June 1974 sponsored a resolution

in behalf of the Abaco Independence Movement on the floor

of the British House of Lords, following conversations

with WERBELL in Washington in

late Hay.

5. Despite the seening innocence of

the enterprise,

however, lie have observed that WERBELl, in particular,'

has made a concerted effort to involve

persons formerly

affiliated with this Agency in the activities of the

Friends of Abaco in support of Abaco's independence.

above, WERBELL has introduced

them as presumably active

Agency officials in such a fashion as to imply,

according

to the persons involved, that either this Agency or the

United States Government supports the ains of the

Friends of Abaco.

6. Most recently, WERBELL has proposed to both

retired officers in separate conversations that they

conduct a study, involving a visit to Abaco, to determine

the feasibility of Abaco's independence in political and

economic terms.

The study would include interviews with

citizens on Abaco prior to an alleged "plebiscite" on

independence to take place in Abaco on 28 June 1974.

To be included

in the investigation is research on the

probable reaction in the Unitca vations Organization ic

a petition tron political groups in Abaco for support on

independence, notably any parallels to be found in

precedents such as the Biafra secession from Nigeria.

1. Andrew ST. GEORGE, a nationally known free-lance

writer, has becone active in WERBELL'S

organization and

claims to be preparing an article on HERBELL and the

Abaco movement for publication in true Magazine.

ST. GEORGE has participated in the several meetings that

HERBELL, OLIVER and their associates have had with

two Ictired Agency officers, Mr. John MULDOON
