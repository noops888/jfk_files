Re:

La Cosa NOSTRA

AR - Conspiracy

Reference is made to your memorandum of

24-Oct-66 concerning the apprehension of numerous individuals

while dining at the La Stella Restaurant, Queens, New York.

We are particularly interested in Joseph

N. GATIO. On 10-May-67 one Colagero Ging LoRE (B. 9-Sept-30

Palermo, Sicily, subject of our FPS 238652A) was arrested in

Toronto, Ontario, for possession of counterfeit Canadian currenc.

and possession of an unregistered firearm.

During his interro-

gation by Immigration Officials, LoRE indicated that he had

resided in the United States for several years, particularly

New York City.

He claimed to have an acquaintance with "CRAZY

JOE" believed to be Joseph GALIO, FBI # 120842A.

3.

in the charts and material prepared as a result of the McClellan

Committee Hearing, as being a member of the Giuseppe MAGLIOCCO

family of New York City. Joseph N. GALLO who is referred to

in your correspondence mentioned above bears FBI # 2444809,

however, a perusal of his arrest record fails to reveal that

he uses the alias "CRAZY JOE".

May we be advised if Joseph

GALLO FBI # 120842A and Joseph N. GALLO FBI # 2444809 are in

fact are the same person or are perhaps related. Should they

not be the same individual, may we be supplied with a copy of

the fingerprints,

photograph and criminal record of Joseph

GALIO

• alias "CRAZY JOE"

# 120842A.
