Ne apprecinte the detailed progreas report on KDAFGHAN

subaitted by reference.

The complete description of KDAFGILN

personnel,

working routine, facilities and equipment was very

helpful in understanding how this project functions.

2. Regarding your request for WOACRE advice and guidance

on hot-olking the lines, running into the gatehouse and consulate,

we have discussed this possible operation with WOACRE bere who

offer the following.comments.

First, to accomplish a hot-mike

installation, you must be able to get access to the telephone

If you can gain access to the phone lines, It would be

possible to hot-uike the telephone without getting to the instru

ment itself. ' However, a non-access system Ilke this will not

work if the target line goes through a switchboard or 11 there

are multiple telephone lines going into the same instrument.

and gain access to a single line that does not so through a switch-

Any such operation,

it one is proposed,

unilateral because the non-access systen is not for exposure to

It 18 possible that your interests in this operation

could be served egually well by an audio penetratioa of the

gatehouse.

Such a penetration could be made by a carryin

"quick plant" type

Perhaps one of your agents who

regularly viste

the gatehouse could be employed to carry in s

or you could exploit KDTUCK-A's close friendship with

KDACOUSTIC-11 to get a transmitter into the target.

Roferences:

C. DIRECTOR-280180

Operattonal Activities:

This Project continued as before

portion of this period with KDAFGHAN providing photo

coverage for oight lou's per day, five days per wook, of the ANFINk

installation.

In April the prineipal agent, KDAFGHAX-1, was provided

with new photographic equipment to improve the quality of the take.

This later proved unuseable

as sunlight playing on the mirror of

the lens was plainly

visible from the target area in the afternoons.

The Aront returned to the use of his old equipmont. It being the

current Case Offleer's practice to hold nearly all meetings with

this Agent in the Case Officer's auto about once every two wecks we

decided to terminate the KDAFGHAN satchouse as unnecessary.

KDAFGHAN-1 was notifled of this In carly June and nearly collapsed.

The salchouse had been his refuge from the Op and his mothei,

KDAFGHAN-". We intonded to put him on vacation when It was decided

(References B and C) to torminate him and his Project.

portion of this porlod was then spent in closing down the operation,

removing equipment fron the OP, restoring the OP to its original

condition and then assisting the Agents in their preparations for

resettling to Madrid.

All of this was finally accomplished by

31 July and the Agents were formally teiminated on 1 August.

period.

Agent

They have adapted fairly well and now are looking forward to

thelr new lifo in Spain. They intend to depart Mexico for Madild

on 1 Soptember.

4.

Production:

Production for this period was normal until

20 June when It ceased permanently.

Administrative/Finance: There was a laige amount of

administrative detaff Favolving Headquarters and the Nadrid

Station in the resettlement of these two Agents.

This has been

discussed in separate cable traffic.

Costs exceeded the programmed

amount becauso of the large severance pay paid both agents who had

over ton years service

each.

KDAFGHAN-I was paid U.S. $8,170.00

and KDAFGHAN-2 was pald U.S. $2, 228.48.

6.

Plans: We have no plans to replace KDAFGHAN with another®

strictly photo-surveillance project.

The production does not

justify the cost.

Howover, we do have plans to obtain a multi-

purpose baschouse in the area that can serve as a site for taking

photos when necessary, serve as a LP for future audio operations

against AMFINK,

and

as a-base from which to dispatch a future

surveillance team.

The PBRUMEN section has. alrendy started the

search

for

agent assets who, in turn, can look for an appropriate

site.

The acquisition of the lilter will be the most difficult

as

rental property is at a premium in the AMFINK area.

Headquarters

will be kept informed of our progress.

The cerer yover:

a.. The ngout was originally a walk-in to the former

JKLAVCE Station In Marana.. He was later referred

to this Station.. This in

isself Is enough to make

him suspect

b.

He still has closo relatives in PBRUMEN and corre

sponds witli these relatives by lotter - and probably

by telephone.

Four of these relatives are the sisters

Of KDAFGUAN-2 and the threat of pressure on these

would probably be enough to make her subject to

- ANSTAFF control.

Assuming that AQUAKE controls nll

mail and telephone calls to PBRUMEN, they would soon

come across the fact that KDAFGHAN-l and 2 live

directly: across the street from ANFINK.

At the last

meeting with KDAFGHAN-1 he mentionod that

they were

corresponding with some twenty

relatives in

This increases the odds

long this correspondence has been going on but assume

that it has been long enough to have been uncovered.

d.

Since the incident mentioned in Reference C,

that ANQUAKE has made some,

determined, eftort to locate the KDAFGIlAN site. .

Is conflined by our decent discovery that AUFINK has

been paying the rent on a vacant apartment directly

ncioss fron their entrance for tho past two years..

This is a building formerly occupled by KDAFGIAN-1

Only within the last two weeks has an AMFINK

employee moved into this site.

It would also be

relatively casy for ANtINK to

check all possible OP

If they did, and encountered a PBRUMEN exile

with famtly still within PBRUNEY, we nie afraid that

the conclusion is solf-evident.

On this particular

point we are now particularly

struck by KDAFGHAN-1's

repeated and unsolicited assurances that AMFINK has

idea whore the KDAFGHAN site is located.

this claim with photos of various ANFINk

employees and

visitors shaking their fists at the

Hindsight now lends us also to conclude

that it would ben very easy matter to investigate

and determine who had moved out of the former site and

where they now were.,. If this has been done, KDAFGHAN-1

would stick out like the proverbial sore thumb.

conclude that Reference D was, infortunately,

only too coricet.

While it has always been the practice of the Station

to sterilize all

photographs: given LNERGO or shown.

to assets (including KDAFGHAS photos), there is

a possibility that misuse of KDAFGHAN

either JKLANCE ON LVERGO Over the years

been a contributing factor.

le note that trey were

shown to KDTUCK-I on various occasions in the past and

While reviewing this activity, we were seruck by

individual, has been villing to devote the last ten years

to this dull and very routine effort.

It is intricult co

The security aspects aside, the Station is

probably doing KDAFGiLAN-1 a favor,

in terms of his nental

health, by forcing him to look outside his small and

insular world and

seed a new fora

of employnent.

frequent references to KDAFGIlAN-l's pent up nervousness

contained in the Station's reporting indicates that...

While we are more than a little ambivalent concern-

the ovor-all value of this activity as presently consti

personnel stationed at the PBRUMEN Embassy and the relative

dearth of PBRUMEN target access agcnts, we believe that this

activity should be continued.

We share the Station's concorn

about our inability to identify the photographs of non;

PBRUMEN personnel who visit the Embassy or Consulate, but

appreciate the difficult technical problens involved.

These weekly moetings generally take from one to two hours.

EXPANDED COVERAGE

During Ostober, the C/TECH at the Station éntered the

KDAFGHAN Basehouse,

installed a Ti-monitor and Robot camoin.

Essentlally the new

set-up was to expand KDAFGHAN-1'& coverage

to include the Consulte.

inaddition to the Embayyy front gate.

The equipment was so placed that while watching the front gato,

KDAFGHA'-] could look through a monitor at tho front kate of the

Consulate and if he saw. someone of

possible interest he pushed

a button and a picture was snapped:

At the same time, he

monitored the front gate and took pictures and kept his log.

This: double coverage

was totained only for one month.

Station found that the take was marginal becauso there was no

accompanying log, and no way of identifying any of the persons

whose pictures were being taken.

The current arrangement is

that 18 the Station his an operational need for checking whether

a particular porson visits the Consulale, we notify KDAFGHAN-1

in advance, providing him a photograph and or physical description

then at the dosignated time he personally monttors the

Consulate gate, whitle KDAFGHAN-2 handles the camera on the main

gate and log.

This fately occurs.

We expect even moro traffic

through the Consulate now that within the past two weeks the

Cultural Attacho's office has agatn been moved to tho second

floor of the consulate:

Everyone soliciting propaganda, film,

and other types of information on PBRUNEY will be ontering

through the Consulate. • There has been no further notion taken

with regard to tying nudio coverage at the front gate into the

KDAFGHAY Baschouse so that KDAFGIAN-1 might be in a better

position to identity the persons going in and out of the Embassy.

This 1s still a primary objective aimed ar improving the

KDAFGHAN end product.

PRODUCTION

5. The KDAFGHAN production has remained virtually constant.

The main value of the production has been to

IMPNOTING COVERAGE

3.

The full potential of the LIOXIO%-1 operation 1s

hampered by the lack of an audio

installation

at the LIRING

fatehouse covered by the LIONIO% and 2 observation post.

An audio

installation would serve,

to Identify

the

individuals who

normally

identify themselves

to

the satchouse attendant.

Thọ

Station is.constahtly. examining the possibility of an audio

installation

at this point.

There are a number of Station assets

who have eccisional

access to the gatehouse,

and it is conceivable

that one-of them

could place a quick plant

device, provided

, security

conditions are favorable:

The Station assets who visit

the LIRING complex

approximately once a weck

ale:

LIRELIC-1;

LITAINT-2; LIHACK-4 and to a lesser

extent LIBANGLE-1.

of this

grOUp, LITAINT-2 appears to have gained the confidence among

LIRIG personnel, for

whom he has provided services

and purchased

with Station assistance, clothing and other items outside Mexico.

Prior, to making any

installation, Station will submit an opera-

tional plan for Icadquarters approval.

Station is also Installing

a TV camera monitor in the LIONION basehouse to cover the LIRING

consulate.

• The installation will be coordinated with a robot!

photo camera so that photos can be taken of persons whom LIONION-1

determines to be of Station interest.

PRODUCTION

The LIONION production has remained virtually constant

since the primaly objectives

ot the installation seldom change.

Except for specific individuals, is similar

as in the case of AVDIME-l,

the general production material

to the contents

of

paragraph

4 of Reference.

In view of this it would be redundant

to repeat the entire paragraph.

COVER AND SECURITY

5. There were

no security

problems in the LIONION operatión

the period of this report.

The Case Officer visited thei

basehouse once during the hours

of darkness.

As reported pre-

viously: meetings with LIONIOY-l are held in his safehouse,

which is in another section of Mexico City.

The question

ANCHAMPAGNE-l's debriefing and the "vieja"

FINANCES

There were no changes in the projected LIONION expendi

tures reported in the paragraphs, under FINAYCES, in Reference

PLANS

The objectives outlined in paragraph &,

continue in effect.

Station is going ahead in the installation

of the TV monitoring system

The Station is also examining the possibility of

acquiring i second baschouse directly across the street from

the LIRING gatehouse.

ile two five: story apartment buildings

which would provide a better view, of the LikING comples fron n

technical point of view,

particulmily if an apartmont above tle

third flooi can be rented.:

The techuical adrantages would pro-

vide the observer a much

closer view of the gatehouse, and would

provide a more comprehensive covernge of the LIRING internal

grounds:

The present LIOSION baschouse is a low three story

bullding, from which it is virtually impossible to see the

routes traveled by persons who are escorted

or directed from /one:

bullding to another.

If a suitable apntment can be obtained in

oue of the two buildings across from the gatehouse, it would be

occupied by a Station asset other than LIONIOJ-1

compartmented from the latter two.

In the event an apartment can

be located and rented across from

the gatehouso,

the occupant

would provide photographic and visual surveillance of the gatehouse

and internai grounds.

The LIOVIOls, if they stay where they are at, would then

concentrate on the consulate and the very limited coverage of

internal LIRING grounds.

if they can locate suitable

quarters on the rear street perpendicular to the one on which

the main gate is located, they idenlly could cover the consulate

as woll us a third, little known entrance into the LIRING compound

which LITAINT-2 has reported being used by student visitors late

at night. From the current LIONION basehouse,

Chief of Station, Mexico City/s:

• LIONION/LIONION-2

ACTION REQUIRIO - RETERINCES

Reference:

HMMW - 18065

Reference asked for the Station's comments on

AMCHAMPAGNE-1's

leference to

"unn vieja"

monitoring the

actlvities of LIRING.

The Station discussed with LIONION-2

herselt whether she

thought she night have been singled out

by LIRING or whether there were any other people near by who

might have. been identified by LIRING as snoopers.

While the Station does not rule out the fact LIONION-2

be suspect in the eyes of LIRING,

she does remember that

LIRING 2 would occasionally come out the main vate some months

oi year's ago, look across the street and point up to ino apat-

ment buildings there and shakr his fist. Ou examination, thoro

are two apartments direcily across fron the front gate, each

6 floors high and with private apartments on each floor.

LIONION-2 does not know if there ae my "little old ladies"

residing in any of them now (see pala i below) but none of these

apartments have been

vacated during the past soveral years.

Her, and the Station's suess is that LIkING probably suspects

an occupant of these apartments.as being the one monitoring

The Station utilized LIONION-1 protographic coverage and his

LIRING.

In the case of some assets LIOXIOV-1 was given a photo-

graph of the agent and told to be particularly alert at certain

times of certain days to confirm the agent's entry, exit, etc.

This proved particularly useful in checking AVDINE-l's story of

contact with LIRING and confirmed LIRELIC-l's visits to LIRING

HMMA - 38996

As reported in the last progress Report (NNMIA-384SS), the

Station paid LIOYIOY-1 $250.00 USD in January 1970

to cover the

unexpected medical expenses of LIOSION-?.

This sum had originally

been intended as the second of two installments to compensate

LIONIO%-1 for cutting his long overdue vacation trip to europe

from one month to two wecks in carly summer of 1969.

Reinstate-

ment of this. payment in the Fy-7l budget is requested (and is

actually in lieu of & salary incrense).

PLANS

8.

As discussed above, the Station plans to continue using

the LIONION Base as a collection point for background information

on LIRING and its employees, to assist the Section in target

analysis work,

The Station is trying to collect information on

six major target personnel (i.e. LIRING officers), and in order

to properly assess the personnel selected, and try to recruit and

run access agents against them, additional information is needed

on their pattern of activity;

friends, contacts, work habits, ete.

It is hoped that LIONION-1 will be able to make a worthwhile con-

tribution to this effort.

At the same

time, he will be asked to

remain alert for any visitors of possible

interest (Americans,

students, etc.). The next step in the Station's

be

to assess LIONION-I's ability to observe and draw appropriate

conclusions from his observations, and write these up for the

Station:

The Station will also try to find some formula for per-

nitting

LIONIO-1 and 2 to continue photographic coverage, but

perhaps

on a nore limited basis than in the past, and at the same

time continue their target analysis work.

not planned for the immediate future and dependent

-on the need for Consulate coverage,

the Station still may wish

to install a TV monitoring system

on the Consulate as well as

They agreed with the Station that photo-

installation of a closed circuit television system with a remote

controlled Robot camera coaxially mounted.

The TV monitor and l'emote

control trigger would be located in the same room from which LIONION-1

covers the LIRING main gate.

PRODUCTION

As reported above, the Station was serlously hindered

in identifying LIRING visitors during the roporting perlod due

to the absence of audio as a complement to the

LIONION photogra-

phic product. Thus there was little development of information

regarding new visitors to LiRIsG.

Utilization of the LIONION

product during the reporting perlod was primarily confined to

confliming whether or nöt LIRIiG officials were at LIRING when

their presence was reported elsewhere. LIONION-l verified that

LITAINT-2 did visit LIRING at the time when he reported having.

a conversation with LIRING-2 and LIONION-l verified that they

LIOXION-1 reported that he hid

not seen LIRING-25 for about six weeks.

Utilization of the

between LIONION-2 and the undersigned to pass any priority

requirements which night arise during LIONIOX-l's absence.

LIONION-2. remained at the Listening Post during the entire

period in order not to leave the basehouse equipment unguarded.

Except for the

lack of coverage during these two weeks, ithere

were

no significant changes in the photographic coverage of

LIRING during the reporting period.

4.

Andio - LISANPAN/ DOG.

As reported in paragraph D2

of reference, LIONIO%-I live-monitored the LISANPAN/DOG

traffie from 0800 to: 1730 lour's daily.

Europe on i Jay 1969:

the carrier current transmission of this

traffie from LISANPAN/LISASH to the LIONION-l. Unsehouse was

discontinued.

It was decided to let LISANPAN- record various

portions of this

traffic during the two-week absence of

LIONION-1 for

evaluation by Richard C. HABOUSI.

The purpose

was to determine

whether continued recording by either

LISANPAN-1 or LIONIOX-I would be merited by the Information

obtained.

As previously reported (MEXICO CITY-0191 and

HMA-37166), LISAMPAN DOG WaS lost on elther 6 or 7 May 1969. 1

4s a result, LIONIO%-I has received no audio since his return

from Europe

on 25 May 1969.

Arter the loss of LISANPAN/DOG,

the Station considered running a straight tap to the LIONION-1

baschouse, but decided that the security risk was too great,

particularly in view of the fact that the target LIRING line

is already monitored by LIENVOY.

Miscellaneous.

During the Station's casing of the

residence of Chief,. LIRING in May and June 1969 to determine

tlie feasibility of mounting an audio operation against that

target, LIONION-1 extended his coverage of the LIRING target

his usual closing hour of 1730 until 0130.

The purpose

of this extended coverage was to monitor the activities of

certain LIRING personnel and establish their routine pattern

of nctivity in preparation for a possible

entry into Chief,

LIRING's residence.

This casing was

discontinued on 4 June

when it was determined that the residence was under apparent

surveillance.

The duration

of the extended coverage

by LIONION-1 was not long enough to

establish the regular

routine of the target LIRING staiters.

i. In lino with the Station's desire to stress

LIONION-1 and Station personnel, the presence of the

it is largo and difficult to disassemble.

Subsequont to the loss of LISAMPAN audio operations,:

tie Sintion removed all audio equipment and associated (

WOACRE material from

him only with commercial plotographic equipment.

The one exception to this is the pulse camera.

Station would apprectate Headquarters'

comments on

the use and value of the take from the pulse camera.

SECURITY

The only incident during the recording period which

had a bearing on the security of the LIONION operation

the loss of LISAMPAN/DOG.

As far as the Station can determine,

the carrier current transmitter was not in operation atlthe

the countermeasure sweeps were being conducted in the

vicinity of DOG.

Since. this was the only connection between

LIONION and LISAMPAN,

Station does not feel that LIONION

could have been compromised.' The entire question of the damage

resulting from the loss of the LISAMPAN operations is under

study and will shortly be the subject of a separate dispatch.

FINANCES

8.

During the reporting period, routine LIONION expend-

ttures

amounted to $22,701.00 MN (US$1,816.08).

In addition,.

LIONION-I waS

given a gift

of US$250.00 prior

to his departure

for Europe on 4 May.

Since LIONION-l's request for five

weeks leave could not be approved for operational reasons,

he was given the gift to help finance the air fare for a

second trip to Europe in a year er so if he wants to complete

his original rlans.

BACKGROUND

The LIONION Project is a fixed photographic surveil-.

lance capability of LIRING, a base for the radio dispatch of

the LIEUBRACE Surveillance Team, and a listening post (LP) for

LISAMPAY/ BAKER and LISAMPAN, DOG.

The basehouse is manned by

LIONION-1 and LIONIOS-2, who are fully qualified to operate

all of the technical equipment installed in the basehouse.

This team has operated under this project for nearly six years.

OPERITICNAL DEVELOPHENTS

Onerational leetings.

The Case Officer and LIONION-1

meet regularir at the beginning of each week and subsequently

the circumstances demand.

LIONION-1 reports telephonically

frequently fulfilling "Watchlist" obligations.

During the

temporary absence of the Case Officer during September,

LIONION-I was handled by Walter C. CORNBURY (with whom

he is

familiar) and Gerald D. FAILANGER.

Though LiONiOr-l. was able to activate Baltk regularly every

The Station checked lo

Basehouse. On Il April 1968, CORNBUKY then installed i carrier

several months

of efforts to achieve this hook-up.

The objective of this

operation was to give LlOYIOX-l "ears"

photographs.

This facility has proven very worthwhile.

incidentally, the live monitoring of DOG by LIONION-I has

in the LISAMPAN

ANGIFT-1.

On 13 August 1968, AMGIFT-1, an AMEDIT-

trained transcriber from JNCOBRA, arrived at the Station.

His

task was to transcribe LISAMPAY/BAKER, the most important and

productive of

the

LISANPAN installations.

LIOXION-1 waS

introduced to AMGIFT-1, under alias,

and assisted in the

latter's handling since LIONION-I had been

serving as the LP

operator for BAKER.

ANGIFT-l's transcriptions were very good

the best effort to date - and coupled with LIONION-I's intimate

knowledge of LIRING, they made a very good team.

LIONION-II

and

AMGIFT-1 not several times each week to chable LIONION-1

to provide AMGIFT-J with important background information on

LIRING.

Unfortunately, AMGIFT-l's chronic obsession with what

turned out

notional surveillance led to his return to;

JNCOBRA prematurely without any jeopardy to either of the

operations.

Miscellaneous. During the period under review,

LIONION-1 provided

basic information on LIRING

which was incorporated into Station studies.

Kid round Progress Report, I January: through 31 March_1968

BACKGROUND

LIONION provides WOFIRM with a fixed photographic survoillance

capability of LIRING, a base for the radio dispatch of the LIENBRACE

Survoillance Team, and a Listening Post (LP) for LISAMPAN/DOG and

BAKER.

The basehouse is manned by LIONION-1 and LIONION-2, both

fully qualified to handle all of the equipment installed in the site.

This team has operated the same iasenouse for photographic sur-

veillance of LIRING for nearly six years.

The

bility to identity visitors to LIRING (through live monttoring) and

thus affix names

to photographs he takes.

Previously,

the identifi

cation of visitors to LIRING required considerahle time and effort

but in the short period of LIONION's audio capability this effort

has decreased

measurably.

3. AGENT PERFORMANCE AND MORALE

Not withstanding the boring and difficuit nature of cais

operational assignment, LIONION-1 continues to purform in an

SinjeC ls indeed & ligniy mutivated ageat

as indicated by lils willingness to perforn this rather menial

task day-after day, when, with his educational background he

undoutedly could obtain more interesting and more lucratine

paragraph

the Station assisted LIONION-1 in the

purchase of a new ongthe for his vehicle.

This unexpected gesture

was greatly: appreciated by LIONION] and an immediate change for

the better in Subject's frome of mind was noted.

1.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS

(a)

Throughout the period under review, ProJect LIONION

continued to provide the Station with the invaluable photographic

coverage. of the targets.

In addition, LIONION-1 continued to

provide interesting observations on the personalities and activ

Ites of the porsonnel working in the target.

After years of

observation, LIONION=l can virtually tell the frano of mind and

disposition of the regular inhabitants.

LIONION-1'g obserrationg

on the Subject of reference (B)

were most valuable to the Station

in the plaining of the recruitment of this individual.

In i

addition, LIONION l provided radio dispatching support during

this recruitment operation; without which, the attempt would

have been virtually impossible.

Statistically, LIONION-l provided approximately ivo

individual photographs

of persons entering and leaving tho

target Ambassy (which he printed and developed himself) and

approximately 2100 feet of film coverage of

the Consulate.

(c) There wore no intelligence disseminations from this

operation during the

reporting period, since

as previously

described Project LiONION primarily a support type operation.

(d) Details have previously been submitted to Headquarters

concerning LIONION l's support in the AMBRATLE operation.

5. PLANS

As noted in paragraph 14 of reference (A), Statiou plans to

utilize LIONION-I and LIONION-2 as L/P operators in support of

the LISANPAN operation. Other than this, there are no significant

operational or adainistrative changes planned for the ensuring

period.

1.. Two promising new operations in the PBRUMEN fleld are now In cho

developmental etage:

A.

Through(LITAMIL-3 the Station has recruited a barber

who used co viait the Embassy regularly to cut the

hair of PBRUMEN Ambasandors and staff employees. Thia

man has been a long-time frlend of 1-3.

Ile has been

reintroduced Into the Embassy and has vlotted there on

three occasions recently.

He does not know who he in

working for beyond L-3.

The Abassador has proven to

be somewhat of a skinflint, paying only 10 pesos for

a haircut whereas the golia price for a haircut at une's

home or office la 20 pesos.

To dace 1-3 has paid the

barber a total uí lOO pesos (supplled by the Station).

It 1a planned to put him on a retainer of about 250

pesos a month ($20 US cy) with bonusus as appropriate.

The Scocion thus has a straight razor at the Ambaosador's

chront and, while an accidental slip might acem worth-

while, it ly bolieved that this new asset will eventually

prove useful in placing cechnical devices Inalde.

On his

last visit he did his haircutting in on upsinira room only
