Memorandum for Mr. Belmont

RE: CLIP $70 (1)

does not expect that the announcement of the

FRD existence will be of any unusual nature.

CIA anticipates that

Castro will give it little attention and regard it only as

another organization of exiles.

However, it is expected that

FRD will grow rapidly in strength and prestige. (C(u)

The Liaison Agent was furnished a list of locations in

the Miami area now being utilied by CIA in this operation.

list is enclosed herewith.

mounting of a radio broadcasting operation.

CIA is spending considerable time and effort to bring

certain anti-Castro Cubans outside of Cuba so that they can be

utilized in this operation. This is being done on a selective

basis in an effort to obtain the services de certain key men@(su)

You previously have been informed that a Cuban who is

held in high regard by CIA and apparently was to be utilized in:

this operation was Colonel Ramon Barquin.

This individual is still

connected with the Castro Governent and is assigned to an Embassy

abroad.

According to

a clean

Barquin has not been able to make

break with Castro vecause of action which might be taken

against members of his family in Cuba. He now feels that he has

this matter under

control and CIA thinks that he will officially

severe his connections with Castro within the next few weeks. He

could become a key figure in FRD. TA)KS)

The headquarters

of FRD will be reported as being in

Cuba and will exist in that country in a clandestine status.

Branches

will be established

in various Latin American countries, and in the

United States.

Costa Rica undoubtedly will be a key location.

CIA does not plan to utilize a large number of Cubans for this

operation.

There pobably will not be more than 40 or 50 who will

have been briefed and trained by ClA. This group, however, will

be engaged in a program of training

other Cubans outside of the U.s.

There is a plan

to use a U.S. base in the Panama Canal zone for

some of this training."
