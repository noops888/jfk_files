BRAUER ds contained in the aforementioned Tampa report of

SA JOHN H. MILLER, May 22, 1964.

The LHM is classified Confidential because it

sets forth information received

from TP 139-S, the dis-

closure of whose identity could be detrimental to the

national defense.

Local dissemination by the Miami Office of the

LHM is being made to INS; CIA; G-2, Ft. McPherson, Georgia;

Coordinator of Cuban Affairs, U. S. Department of

State;

U. S. Coast Guard; U. S. Customs, Miami; U. S. Customs,

Region 2; U. S. Border Patrol; ONI; and,

OSI.

In view of Bureau instructions that interview

of REYNOLDS A. MOODY was not desired, and in view of the

lack of any

additional information

that MOODY is engaged

in Cuban revolutionary affairs, this case is being placed

in a closed status.
