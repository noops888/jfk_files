By memorandum dated August 22, 1966, the New

York Office furnished the following information:

1966 NY 1839-C-TE, an admitted member

•€ the LUCHESAugUamIly" of LON, advised SA ANTHONY R. VITiLANO

of the following information concerning subject:

Informant advised that he first met ROSSELLI many.

years ago and was aware that ROSSELLI was originally from

Chicago and had an uncle who was an old time Mafiosa.

According to informant, ROSSELLI started in "the rackets" at

the age of 15 and was at an early age associated with AL

CAPONE.

Informant said during the mid 1940's ROSSELLI received

a 10 year sentence for extortion in connection with the movie

industry and that also involved in this extortion was PAJL

• RICCA, TOE DIAMOND (deceased), CHARLIE JOY (deceased!, and

LOUIS COMPAGNA (deceased).

Informant said previously ROSSELLI was sent to

Los Angeles by RICCA, acted as a "sottocapo" and took over

Los Angeles and extended his influence to Las Vegas.

Informant said sometime prior to this incarceration

BENNY THE BUG STECAL (deceased), went to California and there

was "set up" by ROSELLI.

ROSSELLI at that time was in the

early stages of investing approximately 2 million dollars of

illegitimate money received from "the cutfit" in Chicago in

the Flamingo at Las Vegas.

Upon ROSSELII's conviction, this assignment with the

accompanying money was turned over to BENNY THE BUG, who had

apparently been playing the stock market and had lost heavily,

including the

above monies.

said this individual's name would no doubt be reflected in the

penitentiary records of ROSSELLI's visitors.
