D/SIR

TOP SECRET

MEMORANDUM FOR THE PRINCIPAL DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY

OF DEFENSE (INTELLIGENCE)

SUBJECT:

Senate Select Committee Queries to NSA Concerning

the Warren Commission

Reference your letter dated 14 January 1976 transmitting

a request from Mr. Alton Quanbeck of the Senate Select

Committee Staff.

response to Mr. Quanbeck's letter, keyed by paragraph to

his letter (inclosed - see underlined portions). Most of

the information was made available to the SSC Staff, Mr.

Jim Johnson, during

an interview with Dr. Louis Tordella

on 20 January 1976.

Para. 1. - NSA requested permission to

retain

photocopies of those reports on which we had worked merely

as record copies of our efforts on behalf of the Commission.

It was felt that if a question should arise at that time

concerning what analytic efforts had been involved and the

number of manhours expended, a record copy would prove useful.

No operational use was made of these documents except to

hold

them on file for a period of time which cannot now be

determined. To the best of our present knowledge, the photo-

copies

have now been destroyed.

relevant to the assassination were obtained through NSA's

analytic look at the exhibits. The Commission, in the person

of Mr. Allan Dulles, had asked Dr. Tordella, informally, to

review the exhibits

for any secret writing or codes which

might have been contained in the documents. Dr. Tordella,

after causing a careful review of the documents by NSA crypt-

analysts, reported verbally to Mr. Dulles and other Commission

members that nothing whatsoever had been achieved by the

analytic effort.. No written reply was submitted.

Para. 2. - NSA is uncertain as to what is precisely

assume

that the comments on

names refer to our biographic files which are maintained on

foreign personalities of potential intelligence significance.

As the Committee knows, these biographic files are maintained

(now at CIA incidentally) as analytic support.

It is also

possible that the Commission was referring to the fact that

names are frequently seen in traffic collected for foreign

intelligence purposes and therefore NSA might have access

to foreign names not otherwise available to the Intelligence

Community.

Para. 3. - It may well be that CIA did obtain such

transmissions and pass them to NSA for analysis, but no one

presently working that analytic area recalls such a request.

Discussions with Dr. Tordella also failed to shed

any light

on this subject. There are no files or records which we have

been

able to locate from that time frame which would sub-

stantiate such a claim. In fact, the only file the responsible

analytic group has been able to locate concerning

a request

from the Warren Commission deals with a file compiled from

open sources citing major dates in the last months of Oswald's

life.

Presumably the date file was to be compared with NSA

product on/about the key dates in the hope that something

could be deduced.

The file does not contain any "hits."

The analysts who

performed this effort have since retired.

Para. 4. - The informal request from Mr. Dulles is

the known

total extent of NSA's role in assisting in the

investigation. The file discussed in Paragraph 3 is the only

file thus far recovered.

There is no information which can

now be identified which was developed from Cuban or Soviet

transmissions

relating to the assassination.

Para. 5. - We have no information on this subject

at all.

However, pursuant to the subject raised during the

Tordella interview, we have searched our files manually,

and as Mr. Lowman agreed during the Tordella interview, we

have recovered three product reports (Inclosures 2 through

4) which show that Cuban military forces did go on alert

immediately after the assassination. There is no SIGINT

evidence, however, that the Cuban forces were alerted prior

to the assassination, thereby suggesting that they had prior

knowledge of the event.
