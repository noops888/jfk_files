of his appeal of an extradition case ruling and his wife,

JAMIELLE,

was working as a waitress in a cocktail lounge in

either Ft. Worth or Dallas.

On 1/20/64,

as her son, ROBERT PAUL

his eyes at the Tarrant County Jail, Ft. Worth, Texas. He

sight of one

eye and would loose probably the sight of the other eye.

would

be returned to Mercer County, N.J., to stay with his

mother at 140 Bull Run Rd., Ewing Township, N.J.

on 3/5/64, said he had arranged to have

WINTERS brought into Mercer County Court, Trenton, on that

date with his wife, so that he could be released from the

bonds he had put up on both of them. He said that because

WINTERS had blinded himself in one eye and the sight was

poor in the other, Mercer County Judge GEORGE H. BARLOW

had released WINTERSS and his wife in their own recognizance

on charges against them in Mercer County, N.J.

On 3/13/64 and 3/18/64, L

some employment.
