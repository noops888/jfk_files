Action : As indicated

1. The salary paid to CISCO-26 ir. Caracas would, at least as a

beginning salary, be somewhat too high for Mexico, although the Station is

prepared to raise his salary after six months or so, provided the quality and

quentity of the information provided by him is sufficient.

Assuming that no

part of his salary will have to be diverted io ICINMATE, it is suggested that

he start off in Mexico with a monthly salary of US$ 150.00. That, amount should

allow him to live reasonably comfortably and pay his normal school expenses.

2.

In accordance with Reference A, it is assuned that CISCO-26

expects to enter the spring semester here.

Please keep Mexico informed of

the progress he is making toward changing his residence from Venezuela to

Mexico. At the appropriate time, Mexico will provide contact and recognition

instructions.
