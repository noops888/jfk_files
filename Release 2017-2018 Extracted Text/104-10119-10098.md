6. In September 1961 FE/YA requested and obtained permission for

Subject to re-establish social contact with a member of the

Social contact with this individual,

) dated back to 1958

When both were stationed in

their wives were also social

contacts.

7. In November 1962 Subject's request for approval of his wife's

proposed part-time employment by the Spanish Embassy was denied by OS

as Incompatible with Subject's Agency employment. A memorandum for the

record, dated 19 November 1962, indicated possibility that Subject might

appeal this decision; however, Subject's file reflects no appeal to date.

would require further exploration. It is recommended, therefore, that

Subject be afforded a routine re-polygraph.
