The Cuban Nationalist Movement (CNI) is a militant

anti-Castro organization which during 1967 was engaged in

eltorts to bomb Cuban targets in Canada.

On March 13, 1968, a confidential source who has

furnished reliable information in the past advised that

Ignacio Novo, Secretary General of the CV, is Interested

in obtaining

street maps of Ottawa and St. Johns, Canada.

Novo said that plans were being fornulated to make an

attack on a Cuban ship in one of the Canadian harbors in

retaliation for the three Cubans whose lifeboat was ramned

on February 21, 1968, by the Cuban freighter "26th of July"

out the const ad Virginto (A) (u

the confidential source learned that the CHl was

able to obtain a street map of the city of Ottava, but was

unable to find any nap of the city of St. Johns. Efforts

to obtain the street map of St. Johns are continuing and

efforts are also being made to obtain a map of the elty of

Montreal.

tion against the Cuban Government was a Joint effort by the

CNN and the Moviniento Insurreccional de Recuperacion

Revolucionaria (MIRR), another militant anti-Castro organi-

zation.

Guillerno Novo, Ignacio's brother, said that the

MIRR would supply the manpower in carrying out this attack

and that soue men would go by automobile to Canada, but that

the individual who would set the explosive would be flown to

Canada from "down there" which the source interpreted to

mean fron the area of Miami, Florida. Guillerno Novo further

indicated that they would hold a meeting on March 17, 1968,

and formulate their plan for this attack

against a Cuban

boat in one of the Canadian harbors.Cx U
