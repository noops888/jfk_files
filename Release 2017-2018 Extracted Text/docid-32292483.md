that date. She made reservations for her mother to return

to. Munich

by the same airline from Zurich on 12/23/64. The

address given at the time the reservations were made was the

Koenigshof Hotel in Munich.

So far as the Munich police have been able to

determine FUEGER has made no contacts since arriving in

Munich other than with her mother.

It was determined that

their stop at the Bayerische Hypo-Bank on 11/23/64 was

for the purpose of changing $200. into local currency.

By communication dated 11/30/64, the BA furnished

the following additional information:

foreign currency window. They then went to #2 Habsburger Platz

in Munich where they probably visited with one ANNA BERGEN,

born 4/20/98 at Sackenhagen, (no country given), who is un-

married and who is registered as being an owner

of a business.

At 12:45PM FUEGER and her mother checked out of their hotel

and using the mother's Volkswagen automobile left Munich

toward the south along the Landsbergstrasse.

The Bavarian

State Police determined that

they travelled to House #4 in

Riederau which is the home of FUEGER's mother.

It was learned that on 11/23/64, FUEGER called the

following telephone numbers:

Zurich, Switzerland #241700

Diessen, Germany #7116

The BKA is attempting to check the Diessen number.

The two women made future reservations at the

Koenigshof Hotel for a

double room for the nights of 12/17 and 18,

1964.
