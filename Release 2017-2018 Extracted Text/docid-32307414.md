Will continue efforts to obtain information regarding

ITSMV and Neutrality Matters aspects of IACB-CASTRO Operation..

2. Wili await Departmental decision regarding

possible prosecution in

this matter.

ADMINISTRATIVE

Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicle. aspects of this case are being handled in the

Miami case titled "ROBERT PAUL CURTIS; ITSMV", Miami

file 26-34692, Bureau file 26-407068.

Referenced report dated January 6, 1969,

contained, beginning on page 58, an interview with CHERYL

SCHLECKER, in which that individual described how she and

subject MAX GONZALEZ traveled to Mexico in August, 1968,

with RAY and LYNN BANNISTER, in 1968 Chevrolets.

BANNISTER was later identified by MM 1312-C as RAY BRUCE.

Subsequently, Miami investigation disclosed that the true

name of RAY BRUCE is LOMEN RAY BRUCE, whose wife is CARRIE

LYNN BRUCE. CARRIE LYNN BRUCE, also known as LYNN BRUCE

and LYNN BANNISTER, was located and interviewed on March 18,

1969, results of which interview are set out in instant

report.

LOMEN RAY BRUCE was interviewed on March 24, 1969,

results of which are set out in details, and was ostensibly

cooperative. However, his version of the trip to Mexico

differed in several basic aspects from the story given by

his wife. It is believed that BRUCE has more information

regarding the cars driven into Mexico by himself and GONZALEZ,

and more knowledge regarding FIORINI's plans for subject

organization prior to onset of actual operation, than he

divulged during interview.

Re-interview of BRUCE will be

considered should Legat, Mexico City investigation produce

information warranting this.

The BRUCEs evidently returned

to

the U.S., singly or together, without participating in the

Mexico phase of the IACB operation, except that the car they

drove into Mexico was probably a rental car disposed of in the

same manner as other rental cars previously mentioned in this case
