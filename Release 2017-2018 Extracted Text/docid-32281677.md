1o Security Forces Charged with Protecting the President

A. Soo Paulo State Department Of Public Safety (DSP)

I, Division of Political and Social Police (DOPS)

Within the DSP (consisting of approximately

35,000 orticers and men and commonly referred to ai

the sao reule State Police!' is the DOPS, also called

the Fifth Police Division. _ Offieers and investige.

tors of DOPS will have the direct responsibility for

the security of the Presidential party. They are:

Dro Burleo Mirunds, Chief of DOPS

Dr • Nilo Mirendo de Guimaraes, Assistant Chief of DOPS

Dr • Paulo Pestona

Dr • Italo Ferrigno

Dr. Tasso de Oliveira

Dx. Jose Roberto Nexy Machado

Dr• Erloveldo Garcia

Dr. Floriano de Olivetra

Dr. Dengler de Guimarees

Most of these officers listed above participated in the

security arrangements during the visit of forner Presi

dent Eisenhower to See Peulo in February 1960 and,

hence, are arguainted with the requirements of the

U.S. Seeret Service. Our representative in Sao Paulo

also participated in the security arrangements during

the Elsenhower vialt and knowe all these officers

personally.

these two factors ahould be particularly

adventageous in working out the security procedures

for the forthcoming Kennedy visit.

Dro Burico Miranda sold that he plans to assign

about 100-150 plainclothes investigators to handle

security and these investigators will work under the

direction of the officers identified above.

The advance detail of the U.ß. Seoret Service, in

discussing and astablishing security arrangemente for

the visit, will deal with the following DOPS officers:

Dr • Burico Miranda

Dr. Nilo Mirande de Guimaraes

provide one or two interpreters for the Secret Bervice,

this should not be counted upon. During the last

along the route to be followed by the Exesidential party.

2. Route to be followed

The route of the Frestdential party is not yet nown but

may be the same as that followed by former President Elsenhower

1n 1960. It Is presumed that President Kennedy will arrive in

Seo Paulo it Congonhas Alsport (which cannot handle jet alr

craft larger than the Carsvalle.) Viracops Alrport (which

sen handle the Boeing 707 and D0-8 jets) is located about

60 niles north of the alty of Bao Parlo.

since the exact route to be follored by the President 18

not get knows, It is difficult to say tibore potential danger

spots w1ll be. During the Elsenhower vialt, one of the con-

cerns of the U.S. Secret Servics mas the 9 de Julho tunnel

and the muerous vladuets in donatora Bao Paulo. It was

foared at the time that objects could be thrown 12on the vla-

duets onto the presidential car or the tunnel could be blocked

by the arplosion of a bomb. DI. Eurleo Miranda Is Of the

opinton that potential danger spots are along the routo to

be followed, wharsas the fixed points where the President

WIll pey vialts will be safer sinco a greater number of inves-

tigators on be concentratad at these pointe. Di. Miranda

sald he expects a certain number of student devonstrations

against the vialt but belleves these will be anall. the

only inoident during the Elsenhover visit to seo Paulo was

& smo11 student denonstration which was quiakly broken up

by the police.

BRASUALA

Groups. Expected to Assume a Hostile Attitude Towerds the Vistt

Our Brasilie representative has reported that the following

are likely to take limited action in protest against the Prest-

dent's visit to Brasilia: Communist Party of Brastl (POB)

and its major splinter organizations, strongly anti-des.

nationalist political organizations including followers of

Rio Grande do Sul Covernor Leonel Erizola, and supporters

of Traneisco Julleo's Pessent Leagues. The capability of

these groups to carry out hostile action is limited, however,

because their moin forces are not located in Brasilia.

Bracilla is populated primarily by Brasilian governent en

ployees and their families who are unlikely to form the

basis of any group activities against the visit.

scele demonstrations would probably require the transporta-

tion of demonstretors into Brasilie from outlying areas.

This lo largely tre in every case except for students at the

National Univeretty of Brestlia and pesibly some small labor

organizations affiliated with the larger national labor organd-

zationg in other cities. In both cases, however, their strength

1e limited due to the comperetively small numbers of persone

who might be involved.

Since Brasilie la the meeting site for the Brazilian

Congress, the whole political spectrum is represented there.

Therefore, antl-U.S. specches end statemente can be expected

by members of the various ant1-U.S. political organizations.

these statements end speeches will probably tbe given national

coverage in the Brazilien press; nevertheless, it is probable

that the weight of coverage will be levorable to the vieit.

2.

Security Forces Charred with Peoteeting the President

In addition to the seeurity forces described in CSCI-3/T71,413,

Our Brasilie ropresentative reported that he is in close contact

with Dr. Gilberto Alves Siqueira, head of the Metropolitan

Police (criminal matters).

This officer is an experienced

police official who has also worked for many yeers in the

security section of the Brazilian police. Our representetive

will maintain regular contact with him before and during the

President'o visit. Contact with him will be used to supple

ment any official liaison with the Brosilia police.

3.

Miscallaneous Actione to be Undertaken by CIA Repreientatives

Our assets in Brasilie vill be used for the following

рихрорев :

a.)

provide intelligence coverage of any planned

hostile street demonstrations or formations of percons before

and during the visit; b.) provide corerage on the plene

of hostite elements in the National University of Brasilia

which could affect the security of the vistt.

a favorable atmosphere for the visit in Prasilia are linited.

Such sotions will be undertaken in other cities in Brozil

where assets are better equipped for this purpose.

Generel, Fatilmate of the situation

While the security forces in Brasilie are somewhat

tnexpertineed end untested with respect to providing protection

for visiting atonitarion, the Chter of the Federal Police in

Brasilio and his stoff are attempting to gain national recog

nition in Brazil se the prime hattonal police force in the

country. As President Konnedy'e Viett will be of national

triportance and elve nottonal prestige to theüchies of folice

and his orgenization, they con be expected to be completely

cooperative before and during the viett.

By end largo,

the Freaident will probably receive a

werm reception in brasilia.
