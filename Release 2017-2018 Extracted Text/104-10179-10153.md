MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with AMBANG/1

A.

Loss of Cacho - AMBANQ/1 voluntarily raised

the subjoct of the loss of the cache of material on the

Island of Caja de los Muertos.

The loss arose from a

failure to cache these materials on an island south of

Cuba in the area of Camaguey Province. - The JURE

controlled ship,

the M/V VENUS, sailed from Puerto Limon

during the month

of January with the intent of caching

these

materials,

including

some 200 lbs. of the C-4

which had been made available to A/l.

On resching tha

cache area the ship was surveilled by a small, commercial-

type aircraft,

resulting

in a decision on. the part of

the VENUS Captain to proceed to Puerto Rico rather than

risk the Joss

of the

matorials to the Cubans. A/1

stated that he interviewed each member of the crew

separately and each told essentially the same story.

Upon arriving in the area of Ponco, Puorto Rico, a cache

was made on the island previously mentioned with the

intent of rotrieving the materials in about three days

after tho ship was refueled and certain repair work

done.

The location of the cache on Caja de los Muertos,

which is normally inhabitod only by turtles, but

unfortunatoly

• Puerto Rican soarching for turtle eggs

spotted the disturbed sand covoring the cache, anc

eventually the cache, which he reported to Puorto Rican

authorities.

According to A/l the materials recovored

are belloved to be in san Juan, Puerto Rico, now in the

hande of the Puerto Rican police.

A/i has talked to

Governor Munox Marin's bright pours, Tight-hand man,

Polanco ABREU, Speaker of the

who will do what he

an to roturn tho matorials to A/1.

It 18 A/l's opinion

that ho stands a 50/50 chance of retrioving the materials.

It is A/l's opinion that the JURE had not been implicated

in the cache and that the crow of the VENUS have kept

appropriately silent.

JURE Purchase of One Ton of Pentolite - A/1

Informed me that the JURE had purchased a ton of Pentolito,

* high explosive, which is not as desirable for use as

or C4: but

nevertheless, & good material for them.

My first reaction was to ask where A/1 had this material.

I reconsidered this request, stating that I hoped it was

well hiddon.

A/l assured me that it was. I gathered

from my conversation with A/l that this material was

not in place in Costa Rica.

In view of WAVE's report via ANTAUP/2, specifically

"Alanis said large

sula money has been spent in purchase modern C-3

explosives and some C-4 which was in CISNEROS® home

there subsequent from Costa Rica," I discussed this

matter of explosives with cos, wAVE.

This discussion

was predicated actually on my

telephonic discussions

on this same subject with C/SAS.

On the basis of

this background.

on 5 February 1964, I called A/1 in

San Juan, Puerto Rico.

Based on a carefully prepared

Ilne which Shackley and I had agreed on, I told A/]

that he had better move all such material immediately

out of the United States, Including Puerto Rico.

In

spenking of Puerto

Rico,

I advised A/1 that despito..

his influential friends, he was bound to get into

trouble if he did not get out of that area and move

his operations to Costa Rica without further delay.

I also warned All that the setting up of communications,

that is, a radio station in Miami,

would alnost.

certainly get him into trouble with United States

authorities and result in the confiscation of big

equipment.

A/1 was obviously unsettlod by my

statements and asked me 11 I could not intervene

with appropriate authorities for timo to move the

materials.

I told him that I could not so intervene

as each arm of the Government had its role to play

and its duties to fulfill

and these could not. be.

Influenced. A/1 stated that he would move an fast

na humanly possible to take the materials out.

that the remaining d0 seceivers and

one additional

and eventually Havam Provinces.

According to Al, the

first tro teams infiltrated will not be met by JURE

on the inside of Cuba; but will proceed on

their own to establish their contacts once inside.

D. JURE Strength Inside Cuba - I asked A/1 1f 1t

the JURE were actually

Ho stated that of

four are inside

council of the JURE is. so divided and located.

#re concerned.

• • H. AKBANG/1's Considering Acrial Re-Supply - A/1

of eventually using an aircraft to re-supply his efforts

He wondered about radar offects and potential

on low 1lying aircraft.

I mentioned to him that there

In considering this capability; not only because of the

purpose it could serve in re supply, but also in the

yet reached the point in his negotiations which will

bring that group into tho JURE.

A/l Indicated his

opinion that within approximately six weks be will have

worked out a program porhaps bringing this groups into

the JURE.

2. Comments • Insofar as the activities of the JURE

in U.S. territory

are concernod, I belleve it is important

to point out certain facts.

A.

WhereRs vardous AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated

various activitios and statements on the part of the JuRe

representative in miami, nogello casinos, against this

Agency, there has not bon any overt proof of these

activities.

Nor has thero been any overt proof of a

propaganda drivo, black lotters of any sort, adverse

radio propaganda,

or evon a program

based on a person-

to-person

basis.

Wo should take note of the fact that

CISNEROS's talking har boen restricted so his own littlo

coterio of clandestino cronies.

I discussed the natter

of ANTAUP/2's roporting at great length

with Tony Sforza

and Warren Frank.

I indicated an interest in proof

that CISNEROS 1g'

behind a donigration progran against the

Agency tolling them that wo would not tolerate such a

program, 1f In

fact, wo could prove its existence. I

specifically pointed out tho caso recently reported of

the choice of ono Dioninto SUAREZ Esquirel, who reportodly

has been chosen to fo to Latin Amorica and carry out a

program of denigration of the Agency in universities, as

& case which we could and should follow in order to

satisfy ourselvos that the JURE is working against us.

B.

The AMOTS and tho JURE • I satisfied myself In

talking to Tony Sforze that the AlOTS in general are

politically opponod to the JURE and that the reporting

of this group, to which AMTAUP/2 belongs, must be

considered in llght of itu projudices and lack of

objectivity insofar

as tho JURE is concerned.

C. The Position

of Rogelio CISNEROS - Despite

what may te the naturo of AlTAPY2's reporting, and we

must admit that he appears to report pretty nuch what

he hoars, the activities of Rogello CISNEROS In Miamt will

sooner or later, unless my warning to AMBANG/1 has some

effect, involve the JURE with U.S. authorities. This

development is something that we should expect and the

time may be here when it becomes necessary to tell

AMBANG/1 that CISNSROS had better leave the U.S.A.

3.

Financial Matters - AMBANG/I received a total of

35 thousand dollars.

Ten thousand of this sum is understood

to be for the assistance of those elements not aligned with

JURE but with a capability to take action against CASTRO.
