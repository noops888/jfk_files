ADMINISTRATIVE DATA

It has previously been reported that PH 701-C* was

developed as a source of information conversant with the

dally activities of RUSSELL BUFALINO in June 1964.

ceased furnishing information in October 1964. To date an

additional source

has not been developed to replace this former

valuable source.

On 3/25/65 PH 752-0* was developed and it is ant1c1-

pated this source will eventually furnish valuable information

concerning the activities of ANGELO BRUNO. This source replaced

former Philadelphia source PH 623-C* whose reliabillty and

productivity were well known to the Bureau.

On 3/26/65 PH 753-0* was developed. This source

is in a position to furnish valuable information concerning the

activities of ICN members ERNEST PERRICONE and JAMES GATTO.

PH 591-C* continues to furnish daily information on

the activities of PETER MAGGIO, Soldato of the Philadelphia

Family of LCN, who is a close confidant of ANGELO BRUNO and 18

BRUNO's brother-in-law.

On occasion this source has, in the

past, provided information concerning ICN of great value.

PH 734_0* was developed in December 1964 as a replace-

ment for the former PH 571-C*.

This source furnishes information

on a daily basis concerning the activities of MAX WEISBERG who

is the recognized leader of Philadelphia!g

"Jewish Mob." This

source has furnished considerable valuable Information concerning

activities of ANGELO BRUNO and other IN members.

PH 672-C-TE and PH 599-C-IE, both of whom are members

of the Philadelphia Family of ICN, continue to furnish intorma-

tion concerning the activities and identities of ICN members.

PH 521-C who was originally developed in 1951, 1s

directly knowledgeable concerning the activities of ICN members

in the Pittston and Scranton, Pa., areas. In recent months this

PH 92-1027

Informant's potential has been fully realized and he is furnishing

Information enabling the Philadelphia Division to precisely

determine the membership of ICN members in the Pittston and:

Scranton areas.

This informant 1s

a son of PH 739-PC.

PH 521-0

has advised he is not a member of

or of ION;

however, his father was formerly active in

"The Organization:

An analysis of information furnished by PH 521-C leaves l1ttle

room to doubt that his father, PH 739-PC, 1s a member of ICN.

In view of this and in view of the fact that PH 739-PC has

confided in his son in the past concerning membership and

activities of "The Organization,

out in the body of this report insofar as Individual membership

is concerned.

While PH 521-C 1s neither a highly confidential

source nor an ICN member, It is believed his statements concerning

the identities of persons holding membership in

"The Organization

are sufficiently reliable to attribute ICN membership to the

persons identifled as members by him.

PH 702-C* is an investigative technique used in

connection with the assignments

given to PH 672-C-TE.

During the month of April 1965, Philadelphia sources

have advised that LoN capodecina PHILli

NESTA and ANGELO BRUNO'E

close confidant PETER J. MAGGIO have both purchased residences in

the Southern New Jersey

areas.

The locations of these residences

have been determined and the Newark Division has been requested

to make every effort to develop highly confidential sources

information conversant with the activities at these residences.
