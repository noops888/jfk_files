Metro Dupleix; 8 July 1445; Cafe Datavia, 1445-1730

NEXT MIETING : Cafe Batavía, 1730, 9 July

KEYPUNCHED

1.

Contact established, eventho PETUNIA was standing on the wrong side of the

netro station and got his pact of the recogicion phrases wrong.

Explained

that he

had been busy on the 3rd and thought it better to stay where he was than to leave

to meet CHALEMSKY.

Had prepared notes on his contacts (had had Initial difficulty

in finding anyone, finally called Susan George and get reintroduced into

the circle).

2. Lagry COX:

Cox runs a hang-out ir. Pantin for deserters, SDS activists,

resisters ald casuals passing through Paris, address is 3,

Gabrielle Jasserand

In Pantin (Paris suburb . this address figured in an UNDERBID report on the

arrest of some desarters for possession of drugs).

Did not know how long this

touse has been in operation; sent is 1200 frs/mo [$240.].

Cox spends a lot of

time making the contributions circuit to raise money to pay for the house - mentioned

Cox also gets support from Resist

reat as a form of support.

(No names mentioned in this context.) Also gets some

very nodest support from the Monthly Review, most of It In the form of books and

periodicals for their political use (and presumably, sales - 1f possible). Mike

Spiegel of National SDS was in town this lest year, Cox said (no date) and said he

would cry to get them support from the States.

Cox himself first came to Paris to take French lessons prior to

assignment somewhere in Africa with one of: the church-identified international

voluntary service organizations After 6 mos of language, he decided that he wanted

to remain in Paris and proposed to his sponsors that he be allowedto work here

anong deserters and draft resisters %the letter of proposal described this in social

work terms,. but Cox said he didn't hide what he planned to do and in fact let his

sponsors know; he didn't expect them to approva 1t). The group in effect turned

thair heads to the political implications of Cox' work, and agreed to let him stay

in Paris on salary ($240, month); they asked for monthly reports, which he has not

sent them.

Of his $240, he continbutes $40 to the food budget of the house.

There are 20 deserters/resisters who live in the house, and

PETUNIA described them as a bunch of apolitical bums.

Most of the good, politically

minded deserters work in France to save money to buy false documentation and passage

to Canada, then leave.

Those who remain behind aren't interested in politics and

aren't capable of nuch. 'From one girl who hangs out with this group he got various

anecdotes of life among the deserters:

one sends letters to Mao Tse-tung Informing

hin that 1000 men in Canada, 15,000 in Alaska and others In France who are preparing

to take over the US and are

In training at the moment (math class from 910 this

nocning") and asking Mao to send some divisions to help the invasion; another went

on s starvation diet and saved every penny he could find (to buy his way out of

France), then went off and bought a monkey ($40); another always pulls a knife on

to find someone to bankroll him, and went to Canada.

PETUNIA got the

impression that this was under false docurentation (which can be bought for $300.):

(No names or hints of where one cen get this documentation.)

Everyone desplays the usual paranoia on

the subject of CIA.

and others are positive that there is an agent in the house; they are very suspicious

of ezch other and play games trying to trip each other up.

They claim that within

24 hours after a deserter has arrived In France, the Embassy knows everything about

Cox has a Swiss fiancee who plans to join him soon in Paris; she

is studying educational psychology in Geneva with an u/1 professor there who Cox

said was about to set off. a revolution in this field.

They both want to go to the

States, and Cox talked about going there when she finishs in Geneva.

work in a factory and get involved in organizing within the movement.. Since he has

refused induction 3 times, he

expects legal action to be taken gainst him when he

returns (and vondered whether'they' would also get him for alding and abetting

desertion within the army), de described his major work here as dealing with

deserters and resisters, trying to educate them and get them involved in the movement,

and in working with GIs In Germany, encouraging them to desert. A few GI's on RaR

have stayed at the house in Pantin

Described life & tires in Paris as tough, but getting a little

batter now.

Most of the deserters want to leave and none of those here are here

for political reasons.

Cox made a trip to Sweden last winter (by microbus), and

met the ADC there.

Said nobody likes Sweden (lousy weather, no work, lousy

people eventho they get a warm reception).

2. Ed DUBINSKY:

Former math prof at Tulane (got fired for taking part in some

protest - on the racial issue?).

Was In Warsaw earlier this summer for an

FALL LON

In Warsaw, met a Polish woman (age 32, Andreajea B; married, three children;

forner funcationary of the PZPR but forced out because of Jewish origins), and

he is considering marrying her.

She has asked

him to come back to Warsaw and

He mentioned a strong possibility that he would be invited to teach or

do research at the Úniv of Warsaw (apparently something of a center for higher

nath), and said for personal and professional reasons he'd love to

go m this

would be sometime around 1970/71.

Thinks of living in the UK or Israel with

his new Polish wife after that; probably UK. Dubinsky was quasi-invited to

a meeting here with the Viets,.

which is why he was In Parls.

Before leaving

the States he got letters of introduction from Robert Greenblatt and Mel Rach

Rotheaberg to Mme Than Van Phaw.

contacted by Dubinsky

about a meeting of nathematicians with the Viets "to discuss the

state of

higher math in Vietnam and life In general" [this apparently said with a straight

fece!], which he billed to PETUNIA as an apolitical meeting "to prepare for

American-Viet relations after the war'.

Dubinsky was supposed to meet Greenblatt

in Paris, but he can't find himad can't find anyone who knows him...so he's

taken to sitting In cafes in hopes Greenblatt with walk past! If Greenblatt

and the meeting don't show up soon, he's going to leave for Cambridge.

rcluctant to contact the Viets directly despite the two letters of introduction

since he says he'd not give the time of day to anyone who just appeared at his

door - with of without letters.

(His position was reinforced by Susan George,

who agreed; George added that she didn't know Than Van Pham.]

3: Martha BULIMAN:

Met on 20 June (address: 4, ave. Hoche; tel CAR 42-84). Said

her father John Hess had just written a book on De Gaulle and his foreign policy;

was rather proud of his father.

Said "ny. father would be considered to be

extreme left in the US, but actually he 1s cautlous if even a conservative in

many ways." Said her parents were Izzizy very suspicious and had always told

had dinner one night (apparently recently) with

Mary McCarthy, and husband (Chez Hess) • Coxmented McCarthy Is very bourgeoise;

her husband is quiet and looks like Clay Shaw. McCarthy feels that the Niese

have handled their propaganda rather badly on the war, and Hess agreed (no

elaboration) •

Martha is sympathetic towards the deserters and resisters

In Paris, says there are 13 or 14 who are the real coumitted ones,

but about

60 who are In the Paris

McCarthy apparently has pretty

good contact with the covezant, and is at least in contact with some resisters;

said that she'd mentioned Cox's naze once.

Martha works for SDS in New Orleans, but is tired of their

Inetoric; she can't stand ELP people. Mentioned Sue Munaker (another PETUNIA

contact) had written a 40 page essay on the lieuen's Liberation Movement to

be published in some forthcoming book on the student left. Martha knows

Dubiasky.

Susan CEORGE:

Met Susan George on 24 June (address 42 I du Cherche-Hidi;

phone number III 48-01). Discussed banning of PACS last October:

she said the

leaces of the MPL (Claude Bourdet) suggested that PACS members joined the Mi;

thear had been no little hesitation after the French had tossed Croyell out but

people wera row gravitating toward the MPh which is composed of individuals

from almost every political grouping.

The MDPL's basic Issue is of course

Vietnam, though at base the movement

1a committed to an anti-imperialist, anti-

copitalist position. George described it as a very flexible organization with

no structured leaders or administrative comittees so ka it can avoid the

buresueratic Indecision of old PACS leadership groups., MDPI members are

developing "political consciousness" and have passed the point of regarding

the Vietnam war as just a "mistake'.

George, herself, was working at the American College st in

the Registrar's office; said there were about a half dozen radicals in the

College, she knows them and is sympathetic toward their efforts. Claims the

schools administrator is a "paranoic dictator".

She resigned after the

principal of the school accused her of "conspiratorial counseling"•

Нав

done translating work,

but pr prefers more

"active" and less "confining"

jobs. She has received an advance from Beacon. Press to wiite a book on

Americans deserters in France. When PETUNIA asked her where he jacome really

came frow, she replied that she lives off her husband!

The tone of the conversation with her, PETUNIA commented, was

very pro-INese; she said they have offered nagnanimous gestures to work with

the 'American people after the war is over". Feels that they are handling

the war and the negotiations brilliantly.

She frequently sees "her Vietnamese

friends", and they have told her they are very satisfied with the progress of

¡the struggle and its certain outcome.

Mentioned that she would see her friends

the next day to get their reactions/approval to a circular prepared for

distribution advertising the 4 July meeting. Also said she had just talked

with her friends last night about the meeting. and was sure that they would

approve the circular.

she nade a tape for Pacifica Corp on "the war and

resistance, you know...".

said that a Paris law student sir 1s giving legal

help and draft counselling to resisters in laris (!)g name not mentioned.

said that last year she was mostly tied up with PACS and didn't work with

"Marxist Studay Groups". Plans to go to the US in August to visit her mother.

JOhn KIY INU:

Deserter from Army whom PETUVIA met in the Luxembourg by

Chained he was In security In the Aruy and was one of two who had

Whice In France, he has been Living

6. Marie iOLAS:

Met on 2 July.: Jolas asked about the movement in the States

reference to the SDS/CLP split. Said she thought the PL position with respect to

the NNese and the war was ridiculous - made no other comments on the American

the war and that more work against the war was being done in Paris than In

Mentioned the Paris movement was pretty well coordinated and ready

to go with coordinated demonstrations to time with those held in the US, last

does need an organizational secretary behind him.

Nevertheless, she lamented the

fact that many people from the old PACS were frightened away after the French

banned it (afzaid of losing passports or being tossed out), and not everyone had

joined Bourdet's butfit.

% Anti-Vietnem Meetings:

Os 24 juae, a group collected at Claude Bourdet's home to use his

address file to send out invitations to the 4 July meeting-

Bourdet's address

file comprises approximately 1,500 names and addresses; Bourdet cormented that he

had a separate file for French communist party members.

Working at the meeting

were Susan George, Dean Savage, Relph Fischer and Elizabeth INU (Adler?]. Fischer

scrogo is a physics teacher at * Jr. College in Brooklyn, visiting Paris.

1s married to a Yugosav girl; he writes for the Guardian, about 25 years old,

clean shaves, bright but cold.

On others, see above..

On 3 July, another group collected to work up posters for the

a deserter, a resister and 2 girls. No names for the latter four.

picked up the info that the deserter was from Vietnam, he held a factory job,

his father is a good friend of Westmoreland's.

On 4 July, the meeting took place:

It alternated speakers and

one hour, someone read the names of American war dead; second hour,

soreone read from texts provided by the Vietnamese. On the latter polit, there

was a last minute change of tactics by the Viets.

The original idea had been

a political wake for the American dead and for those in Vietnamese villages

bombed by the Americans.

the names of the war dead and the names of

bombed villages would be read out.

At the last moment, the Viets told Susan

George that the names of bombed villages had non "political significance", and

Instead they'd rather the meeting reed aloud from material marked in red by

George want along with the idea, though Jolas among others didn't

like it since It altered the purpose and impact of the meeting.

Nonetheless,

the Viet alteration was accepted. Very few people attended the 4 July meeting;

PETUNIA wasn't impressed at all. Everyone signed two books open in the back

one called for an end to the war; a second was a peedge of support

to the Viets.

Everyone signed, and the Viets took this book back with them,

Three Viets appeared during the day, sat quietly in the back of the room and

said little to anyone other than themselves, and left not long after they'd

arrived. One of the three returned that evening to collect the signature book.

After the meeting was over at midnight, everyone went their separate ways.

8o Julle Herve Height

Anecdote from Dubinsky.

Dubinsky said he first metzletter in

Ghena (where Dublasky was for a while doing social work).

While there he also

met someone else he described as, at the time, his best friend. Later he heard

fron targettierve that his friend had been the one who killed Richard Wright.

Dubinsky did not mention the same, but said the episode is described in the

bdography on Wright.

He at first refused to belleve Julia Herva's

but later became convinced of it. His friend never denied the guilt, and

did admit to being a ca agent.

Wright was killed by the CIA because he had
