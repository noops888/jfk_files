David possesses the ability to express himsels clearly.

David has

ability of understanding

a sinimum of effort.

His approach to training was positive.

His

notivation and morale was cood; his interest and enthusiasm

outstanding.

David performed

very well in the nap and compass

phase

of training.

He can accurately ground navigate, read

coordinates,

measure distarces,

and locate unknown positions

using

intersection

and resection.

His report

: the one night

exercise he participated in, was too general, lacking inportant

details on the target observed.

With more practice, David's

reporting capability should show marked improvement.

In the

night movement phase, David had no difficulty with terrain move

having a good sense of direction.

He was able to use all

During the

The five missions met with varying degrees of

success but in each AJICE-14 showed an uncommon anount of personal

bravery terpered with a realistic application of the principles of

clandestine operations.

His performance in these operatiors has also

been marked

this agent possesses.

his best to phrase his sentences gra-atically but he, at least in

recent years, is hampered by a lack

of formal education in English.

While he coabined both P/A and Teas Leader functions for the

AUTRUNK tean, his case officer did not press hin to provide written

His reports were given verbally to his case officer who

would then prepare them in Englisa.

He has since beer given the

& sypewriter-he had taken a course in typewriting-and his

first report (in Spanish) appears Io be

thorough and comprehensive.

There is no reason why he cannot be developed into a good reporter

because he is very observant and

is a keen student of human nature.

He will probably

have to be prodded to continue to write but he

has not jai objected to it.

ANICE-14 would be ideal for anti-Concunist

student activities in Latin Incrica-if he wants to sive it a try.

this is still only a goal for the immediate future--he cannot be

a student all his life.

The biggest challenge is to lind a way to

continue to utilize his talents.

It all depends on the Cuban

situation.

If fidel is. ousted,

there is an excellert possibility

day AMICE-14 may well be

avery influential person in a

free Cubar government.

If the situasion in Cuba remains status quo

and if a way can

be found to "interna-ionalize" his thinking

against Comounisa as a world nonace rather tian as the nore localized

personal carcer that Cuban Coumunis- represents to his at present,

he could continue to be of immense value

tO KUBARK in other Spanish-

speaking areas

for many years.
