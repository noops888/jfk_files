denied access to these files.

However, by letter dated

1/5/781

the HSCA Chairman requested the Attorney General

resolve the matter and it is expected the files will

eventually be made accessible to the HSCA. Therefore, files

were brought to FBI Headquarters to begin processing, since

Xeroxing capabilities of the Memphis Office prevented

reproduction there.

known, and he inquired about & small item in the store

that had been priced at about $50, but purchased for $15

in the St. Charles area.

He offered to pay $15 for the

item, exhibiting considerable interest in and knowledge

of antiques.

he lett the store without buying anytaing,

but within a day or ino returned to the store, also meeting

informant, and still having interest in the piece he had

previously looked at.

This nas the first meeting with in

formant. This individual brought with him a small pottery

tea set, described as golden brown, with a set of cups and

saucers, pitcher, sugar, and creamer, having a gold brown

shiny glaze.

The set was believed to be worth about $100,

but he offered to sell it for $300. He then identified him

self as RUSSELL BEYERS. He is belived to be a very intelli

gent, perceptive person.

No business was transacted. On

that occasion, however, BEYERS "opened up" with informant,

advising that

he is personally represented by Attorney MURRAY

that he and RANDALl are very close personal friends.

& RAYAt, are very close

He said

he had inquired of an individual at OK Novelty Co.,

St. Louis,

also inquiring of informant as to "what kind ef guy" was

inforrant. He said he had learned that he could talk to

informant, advising further that it was his understanding

that informant was not a "snitch"

He also advised that he

had personally sent the aforementioned black couple into

informant's shop to "have him knocked off", but that after

learning that he could be trusted, he had

advised the black

• couple against taking anything from him.

He asserted that

if there was anything in St. Louis that intormant vanted to

buy, he would have it stolen and seil it to hin at the right

price. He came into in omant's shop at least once or twice

for the next several wekks, and shortly after the aforemen-

tioned second meeting in the shop, BEYERS told informant that

he had a painting recently stolen, referring to it as the

"Norman Rockwell". He said he intended "to have it on ice"

but would sell it to informant for $5,000.

Infornant advised

he personally contacted his lawyer, inquiring as to whether

it would be

reasible to buy the painting and seit 1t to an

insurane company.

Reportedly, this lawyers not identified

by informant, made some inquiries and found that the involved

insurance company was not interested in paying that amount

for sane. A few days later, BEYERS again came to the shop

offering to sell the

painting for 53,000, and then made

a final offer to sell it for $2,000.

BEYERS then said that

the painting was "going into cold storage", BEYERS has

never again mentioned this painting.

During the fall of 1973, live or six months ago,

date not recalled, BEYERS came to the shop inquiring as to

whether they could get together to talk, and they later did

so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, MO., in

the area of a Brod-

Dugan

Paint Store, where informant

had traveled on business.

BEYERS talked freely about himself and his business, and

they later went to informant's house where BEYERs told a story

about visiting a lawyer in st. Louis county, now deceased,

not turther Identilled, who had offered to give him a contract

to kill MARTIN LUTHER KING.

He said that also present was a

short, stocky man, who walked with a linp. Later, wicha

gard to the latter individual,

BEYERS comnented that this

man was actually the individual who made the payoff of JAMES

EARL RAY after the killing.) BEYERS said be had declined

accept this contract.

to

He did remark thatthis laryer

ha.d

Confederate flags and other items about the house that might

indicate that he was "a real

rebel".

BEYERS also conmented

that he had

been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill

KING.

Sometime later, informant talked to JOSEPH "J00"

OLIVESTRO, a known fence, with whom he is acquainted.

This

individual advised informant that BEYERS truly is a "vary

treacherous guy", cautioning him to stay away fron him if

he wanted to stay out of trouble.

About two or three months ago, BEYERS telephoned

hin at 7:00 on night, probably a Monday

night, date not.re

called, advising that he was

going to kill a

man, indicating that the man had "snitched at orts st. Louis

BEERS could have said that the man had "snitched of drugs".

At 10:00 P.M.

the same night, BEVERS again called him, ad

vising that

"the job is done".

The next day, nformant read

about a man being killed at his home or in front of his house

in North St. Louis, further details not recalled.

SL 137-16185

At about that same time, informant recalled that

BEYERS inquired as. to whether. he knew anyone by the name

Of EUGENE ZIGLER who lives somewhere in west St. Louis

County.

BEYERS referred to him as an old man, believed

by him to have stolen some paintings in Florida.

BEYERS

said he intended to find out whether the man had the paint-

ings and if so, he intended to have them stolen from him.

About one month prior to the date of the reported

burglary of the Jelferson Memorial, St. Louis, in which sev-

eral items of Lindbergh trophies were taken, exact date not

recalled, BLYERS came to his shop asking him if he was in

terested in buying any articles from the Jefferson Memorial,

commenting specifically that he had in mind some

"commemox&

tive pieces" that were included in the Lindbergh trophies.

informant said he told him this would be "too hot to bandle"

whereupon BEYERS said they could be used to "set up enemies"

by "stashing them in the trunk of somebody's car".

Informant

said he told BEYERS he was not interested in that kind of.

job since he had been in trouble once (robbery of lour Seasons

Antique shop›

and did not care to get in that kind of trouble

again. Within several days, informant heard the news of the

breakin of the Jefferson Memorial and the theft of several

items there.

A day or two after that publicity, BEYERS came

to informant's shop,

advising that "now I've got my hands

full - I've got a lot of problems". Informant recalled that

it appeared BEYERS had not shaven for several days. Ordi

narily, BEYIRS is a very conservadie, well-dressed

person.

BEYERS never again mentioned the Jefferson Memorial

Items, and he never mentioned same to BEYERS, despite the

recent publicity.

He firmly believes that BEYERS at one time had

both these items and the Norman Rockwell painting and may

still have

same.

He does not believe that BEYERS would ever

confess to anything, BEYERS having told him on one occasion

that the police would never get anywhere with him since he

absolutely would never talk, even if confronted with informa

tion from other sources attributed to him.

BEYERS is further described as follows:

By teletype dated 3/23/78, St. Louis Office

Byers was opened 10/3/75 and closed 11/22/76, having furnished

information on several "87" and "92" matters.

of previously mentioned contact memorandum had been placed

in his St. Louis informant file; however, there was no

indication that he was ever questioned concerning this

information.

800-13503

The HSCA requested, by letter of 6/5/78, all

files on Russell George Beyers.

A search at FBI Headquarters

(FBIHQ) revealed only one Interstate Transportation of Stolen

Property (IISP) reierence, of which the Committee was advised

oy letter of 6/9/78. It has been determined that the

St. Louis Office furnished incorrect spelling of "Beyers"

instead of "Byers"

and, subsequently, Bureau file 137-42744,

as well as several additional Interstate Transportation of

Stolen Motor Vehicles (ITSMV) references, was located. No

information regarding Byers' possible connection with the King

assassination case (MURKIN) was found in the Bureau's informant

file on Byers.

the Bureau hotter dated 104175, e sCA requeted that

furnished information regarding Byers to determine if

(1) he would agree to submit to interview by the iSCA,

and (2) whether he would execute a waiver allowing for release

of his informant files to the Committee.

St. Louis Office

advised this informant was closed and he had moved to

Chicago.

Chicago Office has been advised of the above

and an attempt is being made to locate former St. Louis infor-

mant. This matter is being handled by separate communication.

SAC, St. Louis, has advised that both the Agent

and supervisor who handled SI 3167-lEftired in February, 1977.

By teletype dated 7/26/78, St. Louis advised review

of St. Louis file 137-16185 on Richard Francis O'Hara (SL 3167-C)

and all files logically related thereto, including MURKIN main

file, all fail to reveal any indication

as to why information

provided by O'Hara concerning MURKIN was not disseminated or

otherwise acted upon.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

DETAILS: The 7/26/78 edition of "The New York Times"

contains an article by Nicholas M. Horrock, entitled

"Report by a

Missouri Man Suggests Plotters Sought Murder

of Dr. King."

This article sets forth information regarding

an HSCA investigation into an allegation by Russell G. Byers

that he was offered $50,000 to kill DI. Martin Luther King, JI.,

in 1966 or 1967 bý two men from Imperial, Missouri. The

article states that the FBI had discovered the information

regarding Byers during a file review in the St. Louis Office,

and this information was subsequently transmitted to the

HSCA in March of this year.

The article states that this

information provided the basis for the HSCA inquiry.

The information alluded to in "The New York Times"

article was discovered during a file review conducted in

the St. Louis Office for background information on Russell

George Byers, who was a suspect in a recent St. Louis museum

burglary.

Byers was referred to in a contact memorandum

dated 3/19/74, located in St. Louis file 137-16185.

This

memorandum, in addition to having information regarding

sèveral criminal matters, contained a paragraph in which

it is reflected that Beyers advised SL 3167-C, in the Fall

of 1973, that he had met with an attorney from St. Louis

County and

an unidentified individual who offered him

$10,000 or $20,000 to kill Dr. King. Byers told the

informant that he rejected the offer. By teletype dated

3/13/78, the St. Louis Office advised FBIHQ that this

information had been located and that there was no indication

that it was ever disseminated.

By airtel dated 3/13/78, the St. Louis Office

transmitted an LHM to FBIHQ which set forth verbatim the

above-mentioned paragraph.

By letter from the Director,

FBI, to Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division,

Attention:

Mr. Robert. L. Keuch, dated 3/24/78, the information

contained in the contact memorandum was furnished by LHM

dated 3/13/78

for dissemination to the HSCA. In addition,

an IHM dated 3/20/78 was attached which reflected background

information regarding Russell George Beyers, which was

telephonically furnished to FBIHQ by the St. Louis Office

at the request of the Congressional Inquiry

Unit, Records

Management Division. This data was provided to facilitate

the HSCA's evaluation of the information regarding Byers

furnished by SL 3167-C. St. Louis, in communications with

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

FBInd, advised that last name was "Beyers"; however, it has

been determined that the correct spelling is "Byers.

No active FBI investigation into the information located

by the St. Louis Office regarding Byers and his possible

connection with the MURKIN case has been undertaken pursuant

one cat it ond contined ty letter

from Robert L. Keuch, Special Counsel to the Attorney General,

to Director, FBI, dated 8/3/77. As set forth therein,

à 8/3777

without a specific request from the Department, the FBI is

not to further investigate any allegations regarding the

King or John F. Kennedy assassinations. No request has

been received from the Department regarding this matter.

The St. Louis Office, by teletype dated 3/23/78,

furnished details of Byers' informant status.

He was

having furnished

information on several "87"

opened 10/3/75 and closed " 2d "92' matters. The Department

had been previously advised that he had furnished information

of value to this Bureau in our letter of 3/24/78. A copy

oI the previously mentioned contact memorandum had been

placed in Bvers'

St. Louis informant file; however, there

was no indication that he was ever questioned concerning

this information.

The HSCA requested, by letter dated 6/5/78, all

files pertaining to Russell George Beyers.

A search

conducted at FBIHQ located only one ITSP reference, of

which the Committee was advised by memorandum of 6/9/18.

Subsequently, a search conducted using the last name of

"Byers" resulted in the location of Bureau file 137-42744;

however, the four serials contained therein did not pertain

to the MURKIN

case.

This search also resulted in two ITSMV

file references pertaining to Byers.

By letter dated 7/4/78, the HSCA requested that

the Bureau contact the St. Louis informant (SL 3167-C)

who initially furnished the information regarding Byers

to determine if (1) he would agree to submit to interview

by the isCA, and (2) whether he would execute a waiver

allowing for release of his informant file to the Committee.

The St. Louis Office telephonically advised that this

informant was closed in May, 1975, and he has since moved to

Chicago, Illinois.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett •

RE: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Chicago was requested to immediately attempt to locate

this informant, identified as Richard Francis O'Hara,

and question him regarding

the HSCA's request. This

matter is being handled separately.

on 1/26/18, SAC Roy B. Klager, Jr., St. Louis,

advised that SA Howard C. Kennedy was the Agent who handled

St. Louis intormant SL 3167-C. Kennedy retired 2/28/11.

SA Robert I. Bender was the St. Louis Field Supervisor

whose initials appear on the contact memorandum of 3/19/74.

Bendér retired 2/25/77.

By teletype dated 7/26/78, St. Louis advised review

of St. Louis file 137-16185 on Richard Francis O'Hara (SL 3167-C)

and all files logically related thereto, including MURKIN main

file, all fail to reveal any indication

as to why information

provided by O'Hara concerning MURKIN was not disseminated or

otherwise acted upon.

RECOMMENDATION: In view of the retirement of SAs Kennedy

and Bender, no administrative action is recommended concerning

the failure to disseminate the information received from

Byers and our St. Louis informant.

between the Department of Justice and the Bureau concerning

allegations in the King matter, no investigation be undertaken

in this matter concerning the statements made by Russell

the Attornag General

However, while the FBI continues to cooperate fully •

with the HSCh, both of these matters, as set out in the referenced

letters, remain unresolved, continue

to Impinge upon our Inves-

tigative responsibilities, and in essence: raise the question of

this Bureau's continuing criminal jurisdiction in these

investizations.

As you are avare, in hovember, 1903, the fBi initiatea

an immediate Investigation

Into the assassination of President

John P. Kennedy based upon a request from President Lyndon B.

Johnson to former Director John Eagar Hoover.

Prior to the

assassination, no Federal statute existed concerning the killing

of, or assault on the President.

Mr. Hoover, In testimony before

the President's Commission on the Assassination of President

Kennedy (Warren Commission) stated that President Johnson

communicated with him within 24 hours of the assassination and

requested the FBI to Investigate.

(Hearings before the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, Volume 5,

Page 98.)

Although the Bureau's Investigative responsibilities

concerning the assassination of President Kennedy would have

logically ended with the termination of the Warren Commission,

Director Hoover, In his testimony before the Commission, agreed

with a statement by a Commission Member, Representative Gerala R..

Ford, that the responsibility to conduct the Investigation is not

an authority with

a terminal point, but an authority that goes

on Indefinitely. (Hearings before

•the President's Commission on

the Assassination of President Kennedy, Volume 5, Page 100.)

FBI has continued to Investigate and report to the Department

any new allegations or Information received concerning the

assassination.

In reference to this Bureau's criminal jurisdiction in

the investigation of the assassination of Martin Luther King, by

nemoraniu.: dated April 4, 1255, Assistant Attorney General

stepnen o. ?0112l, Civil Finits

Division, requested that this

The Attorney General

On April 16, 1968, the Attorney General authorized the

f111ng of a complaint

charrine Galt with violation of Title 18.

Section 241, U.S. Code,

for conspiring to Interfere with the

constitutional rights of king.

On April 17, 1968, Federal process was obtained and Galt

was charged with conspiracy

(Section 241) In that he and an

individual whom he alleged to be his brother, entered into e

conspiracy in Birmingham on March 29, 1968, by reason of their

purchase of the rifle later used in the shooting of King.

On March 10, 1969, In State Court, Memphis, Tennessee,

James Earl Ray entered a plea of guilty to charges of murder

and received a 99-year sentence.

Federal process against Galt was dismissed on December 2,

1971, by U.S. Commissioner Hacy Taylor, Northern District of

Alabana, based upon a motion filed by Ray's Attorney,

Bernard

Fenstervald, Jr.

In Dècember of 1975, the C1V1l Rights Division began

a revier of the FRI's Investigation of the King assassination and

thls revier was recently completed by the office of Professional

Responsibility (OPR), U. S. Department of Justice. The OPR

Issued a report of its review and reported, among other things,

that "... the sum of all the evidence of Ray's guilt points to

•him so exclusively that it most effectively makes the point no

Task Force to Review the FBI Martin Luther King, Jr., Security

• and Assassination Investigations, Page 109.)

Since the time of the Kennedy and King assassinations,

the FBI has continued to investigate various allegations concerning

these assassinations and has furnished the results to the

Department.

No viable information has been developed to negate

the

original findings of the FBI or the, subsequent conclusions of

the warren Commiscion or the OPR.

During the HSCA review and Investigation Into these

assassinations, additional allegations regarding these assas-

sinations have

been receiver.

The FBI has continued to attempt to

investigate all of inose additional

allegations; horever, the FBI

has found in Several Instances that the lSCA conducted independent

and parallel investigations, the results of which are not available

to the FBI:

Attention:

Mi. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear MI. Attorney General:

Pursuant to the mandate under which the House

Select Committee on Assassinations operates, it is

incumbent upon us to ascertain not only the individual

culpability of those individuals possibly involved in

the assassination of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., but

also the direct or indirect responsibility of any organi-

zations so involved.

Inasmuch as this portion of our

mandate does not differentiate between governmental and

non-governmental entities, the FBI

is one of those

organizations whose possible complicity in the assassi-

nation of DI. King must be examined. Such an examination

must proceed on some fundamental assumptions:

if James

Earl Ray killed Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., and the FBI

were involved then such involvement could have been effec-

tuated only by direct FBI agent contact with James Earl

Ray or through indirect contact by means of an FBI operative,

through indirec

informant or individual with whom the FBI had some type

of source relationship.

In order to analyze the question of possible direct

contact it will be necessary to interview certain FBI

agents who either were stationed at the office serving

Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri

during 1960-1967 or were involved in the unlawful flight

investigation of James Earl Ray prior to the death of

DI. King.

A prior request by this Committee has sought the

identity of some of these agents.

While a list of such

agents is not yet complete, it would be helpful if the

Mr. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the

information and he is sure that no other information concerning

KING was furnished to him by O'HARA. He can make no comment

with

regard to the credibility of the information at this late

date. He does not believe, however, that credibility of either

O'HARA Or BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision

with regard to dissemination of the information concerning

I KING.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service

in the FBI at St. Louis that RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known

fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the

failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph

2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN

LUTHER KING.

He noted that there is nothing written on the

memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action

taken otherwise.

Mr. KENNEDY'S attention was further directed to a hand-

written notation on the first page of the memorandum which

states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies

this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,

ROBERT I. BENDER.

Upon reading the memorandum in detail, it

was KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation did

not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead,

applied

to an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities

appearing on page 2 of the memorandum.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. KENNEDY stated that

in retrospect, the information concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING

in the memorandum of 3/19/74 should have been acted upon.

Mr. Robert I, Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

As stated in our letter to Congressman Stokes

dated June 13, 1978, if it becomes general knowledge that FBI

being openca to outside parties, informant

privilege is threatened and our informant development progran

can be severely hampered.. Despite the ESCA's statement in

the letter Exom Congressnan Stokes that it is not seeking

informants' identities at this time, this is not the

The central issue is the principle

of opening a field office informant file to outside parties.

2.

The HSCA was provided access to IBIIIQ files

concerning informants who reported on the Invaders.

Although the HSCA feels these were administrative in

nature, the policy of the Bureau at that time required that

all incornation of a substantive nature be furnished to FBIHQ.

Data such as informant's travel, amount of payments and a

summary of background material

• are examples of such infor-

nation provided to BIll.

Therefore, FBIIIQ feels that its

files contain significant information concerning the operation

of any informant.

3. All information of substance concerning the

Invaders organization furnished by these informants would

be

reported in the Invaders file at FBIIQ.

the HSCA has had

access to this file since December, 1977.

The HISCA has

shown no interest in reviewing the Memphis Field Office

file concerning the Invaders, a file which would contain

all reports from informants covering the Invaders.

would appear logical to examine this file in detail prior

to pressing for files of informants, none of whom were

even menbers of the Invaders at the

time of or prior to

King's assassination.

4. Review of FBIIQ informant files was restricted

to ME. G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ISCA,

and not to his staff because, since the staff had access

to the Invaders file at FBIHQ, their knowledge of the

organization could possibly result in identification of

informants through a cross checking of the files. Subsequent

to Mr. Blakey's review of the informant files, the FBIRQ

Invaders file was delivered to the HSCA on July 6, 1978. Now

tic, Blakey himself has access to the substantive Invaders

file, and, similarly, his possible new knowledge could result

in source identification if allowed access to field office

Illes.

on July 17 and 18, 1978, all five informants

vere contacted to determine if they would permit disclosure

of their identification to the ISCA. All declined.

Following his review of FBINQ files on

May 19, 1978, Mr. Blakey told agents present that he found

no evidence that any of our informants acted as "agent

provocatcurs. "

Ho furnished notes taken during his review

tO FLINQ

and

requested the notes be maintained by the FBI

for possible future use in writing into his final report a

paragraph to the cileci he had found no evidence that any of

those informants had instigated violence.

Re made no request

at that time to review field office informant files. It is

possible that Mr. Blakey is satisfied with the review of

FDIIQ informant

files.

7. The FBI desires to maintain consistency

with rogard to our position in this matter. In our letter

to Congressnan Stokes dated June 13, 1979, access to these

files was denied.

This position was decided upon after

caccful deliberation between interested divisions in the

FBI and, in our view, the ISCA has provided no basis to cause

a change of this position.

8. Providing the HSCA access to field office

infomant liles, although excised, could serve as an

undesirable precedent for other outside groups to review

9. Because of the large number of excisions

in these files to protect the identities of informants,

it is unlikely the ISCA will be satisfied with its review,

if granted, It will probably ast: for fewer excisions and/

or the identities of the informants.

10, Finally, the letter Erom Congressman Stokes

dated July 5, 1973, has been analyzed at FBIHQ and, generally,

it is not believed it contains additional information giving

substance to the allegation that our informants acted as

Specifically, the folloving points are

noted:

The letter states (pages 1 and 4) that the

ISCA had access to relevant Dureau personnel and has conducted

extensive interview among those who may also be subjects of

this aspect of the Committee's investigation.

The Committee

claims need to review the files to determine if the written

Iccord supports or refutes the oral testimony on the relevant

questions.

Howevel, the letter offers no specific results

of interviews of personnel or others concerning the basic

allegation.

It has not identified any specific individual

who has furnished infornation bearing on this allegation.

The letter states (page 4) that based on

field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

This is not new information.

The I'BINQ file concerning the

Invaders and media reports issued then and more recently verify

the Invaders culpability regarding violence during the march,

letter also states (page 4) that "it is universally

bolieved that the Invader followers who caused the violence

were paid FBI operatives." The FBI considers this statement

a sweeping generalization and again the Committee offers

no specific identities of individuals who believed those

causing violence were I'BI infornanis.

Other than articles

appearing in "Newsday" magazine in 1976 and, more recently,

Statements by Mark Lane and possibly former members of the

Invadors, who olse shares this belief?

The letter from

Congressman Stokes identifies no one.

This letter states (page 4) that the "Memphis

Field Office had prior knowledge of impending violence (a

fact memorialized in FBI documonts)."

this staterent

implies the FBI new of violence because its informants

in our files, FBI knowledge of impending violence was based

on intormation tron various informants and officials,

resulting fIon a tense situation brought about by the

Sanitation Workers Strike, all of which made knowleüge of

impending violence rather obvious.

The letter states (pages 4 and 5) that "nembers

of the Invaders were observed by agents of the FBI exhorting

the crowd and readying weapons from signposts (a fact later

testified to under oath by these agents)."

A review of the

Invaders and informant files at FBIHQ disclosed that none

of the informants were members of the Invaders at the time

violence occurred. Only one of these five informants was

over a member and

that was subsequent to the assassination

The letter states

(page 5) that "Professor

Blakey's review of the files revealed that at least one

informant subsequently joined a more violence-prone

organization.

It is assuned this statement is to demonstrate

the informant's propensity for violence.

However, the FBI

believes that king's death and

the rioting that followed

intensified racial feeling and tended to make some organiza-

more violent.

therefore, it is logical that whatever

organization our informant was

redirected into, it would be

more violence prone.

NOTE: This matter concerns HSCA request to review Memphis

Field Office files of five informants who reported on

activities of the Invaders,

a Memphis youth gang. The HSCA

is trying to resolve an allegation that our informants

instigated violence which caused King to return to Memphis

where he was killed. We granted access to Headquarters

tIles of the intormants to Mr. Blakey only, but denied his

subsequent request for similar access to field office files.

In letter to the Attorney General dated 7/5/78, Congressman

Stokes requested a conference to

resolve the issue.

Mr. Keuch's

letter of 7/24/78 stated his position, which is to provide

Blakey access to the files, excising all identifying data.

While we agree that Mr. Keuch's position is sound, our

arguments against release are being provided him formally,

per his request.

Full background and details regarding this matter

were set forth in D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum dated

7/28/78, which recommended a letter to Mr. Keuch be sent

listing our arguments against release of the files. This

memorandum has been approved by the Director.

TO

The Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

DATE:

FROM

SUBJECT:

Robert L. Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

House Select Committee on Assassinations

Request for Memphis Field Office Files

RLK: mal

By letter dated July 5, 1978, directed to the Attorney

General, the Select Committee has

repeated its request for

access to the Memphis, Tennessee, field office informant files

concerning informants in the Invaders, a black militant group

judgment, as Special Counsel for the

Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to

excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief

1, of the requested

Counsel, Professor G.

Robert blakey. let

request

that this task be completed as soon as possible and that

ProfeSSor Blakey be provided access to the processed

files.

As you are aware, we had, by letter of June 13, 1978,

previously refused the request of the Committee. I

concurred

in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact

that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee

for access to the field office files rested on naked allega-

tions which had been denied in the past.

In the Committee's

Latest demand, presented by the July 5 letter, the Committee,

on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail

the justification for its request.

While it may be our juag~

ment that the information set forth by the Committee is not

sufficient to substantiate the allegations

made about the

activities of the informants at issue, it is equally clear

that we can no longer take the position that the Committee's

legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula-

tion and/or naked allegations.

That being the case, the

limited access outlined above should be granted in response

to the Committee's request.

I am, of course, aware of the deep concern held by the

Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing to

disclose informants or release information which will lead

to their disclosure. I share that concern and my decision

in this matter has been reached only with the greatest

possible consideration of that concern.

In addition to the further justification submitted by

the Committee for their request, I believe there are other

factors

which support my conclusion that we should provide

the limited access discussed. An important factor is that,

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue subpoenas for the informant

files.

The only way we could respond to such subpoenas other

than by providing the requested information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a federal court. While this type

of confrontation may ultimately be necessary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer

the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant

files by the entire staff thereby increasing the possibility

that the informants could be compromised through the knowledge

of the members of the staff who have studied the other files

in the matter in greater detail and, in any case, would broaden.

the number of individuals who could

learn the identity of the

informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevail in the litigation, a

possibility which, in my judgment, is remote given the subject

matter of the Committee's inquiry and the allegations and

information that formed the basis of their request, we can

only win if we show a reasonable posture to the court. An

absolute refusal to comply would not do that.

An attempt

to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests

by providing limited access to excised files would do that.

Further support for the procedure of providing limited

access stems from the very nature of the Committee's investi-

gation. Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or

lawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets

*Dureau nate bac

or subjects of the investigation.

Under such circumstances

our obligation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible

with the

Congress

is obvious.

The public conception of our

cooperation is going to be a very important factor in the

acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts

and determinations in these investigations.

To put ourselves

in a posture of confrontation with the Committee

over this

particular issue without first attempting some

accommodation

of competing interests would only serve

to revive all the

allegations

and criticisms of us and our actions concerning

the assassinations.

HH 55004 Do0Id:32989737 Page 74

## Page 75

-3 -

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of

this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more

subject to public comment and criticism. The present interest

in, and repeated stories related to, the allegations in the

case of Mr. Rowe makes this one of the worst times to come

to a-point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-

tions advanced by the Committee. If and when we reach the

ultimate confrontation over the possible disclosure of

informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by

any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect

our informants to provide the Committee with necessary

evidence and information.

That balance, at least at this

stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally

to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the

Committee is preparing for public hearings in the near future,

and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on

my representations that we were making immediate efforts to

• .

respond, we should not delay our response to the Committee.

Therefore, I am sending a

I copy of this request to the Attorney

General.

If the Bureau

disagrees

with my determination and

decides not to comply with my decision, your response should

be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved

quickly.

disseninated to hin because at the time he vas the coordina-

tor for the Intelligence Division's "lass liedia Program."

The staff menbers exhibited great interest in this program

and its purpose and administration was described to them in

some detail.

The stact menbors persistently questioned kyan

regarding his opinion, "Icelings," or viows as rolates to the

FBI's past investigation of Martin Luther King, JI.

advised he did not believe his opinions were significant or

important to tho Conmittoo's inquiries or mandatc, but the

staff ncbers responded that they vere trying to devalop the

atmospherc in which the investigation was conductod. Ryan

advised in his mind there was 20 question that King warranted

investigation because of his close association with a signifi-

cant communist and because, as the bureau subscquently acci-

dently determined, ot his hypocritical and

• apparent opportunist

character.

The staff members acknowledged that they had read

considerable infornation regarding both King's association

with a key communist

and his private life.

They vere advised

by Ryan that he would not pursue the formor becausu of the

sensitivities involvod, nor the latter

becauce he felt enough

had been said alrcady rolating to King's moral activitios and

philosophy.

The staff members asled a number of questions seek-

ing Ryan's knowledge or opinion relating to the continued

investigation of King. Ryan statod that he had no opinion

regarding the duration of the investigation except to point

was, during the 1900s, carciully

following all areas of possible violence, including demonstra-

tions, and thus they would be interested

in any area where

King was engaging in activitios which would involve large

denonstrations.

SA Ryan is of the bolick, based on the questions

asked and the conments solicited, that the three staff menbers

of the HSCA were endeavoring to substantinte their already-

dovoloped conclusions relating to FBI activities in comec-

tion with the investigation of Hartin Luther King, JI.

Qbert L. Keuch

Special Counsel to the Attorney General

(ouse Select Committee on Assassinations

Request for Memphis Field Office Files

RLK: mal

By letter dated July 5, 1978, directed to the Attorney

General, the Select Committee has repeated its request for

Tennessee; field office informant files

concerning informants.in the Invaders, a black militant group

in that city. It is my judgment, as Special Counsel for the

Attorney General, that it is necessary to provide access to :

excised versions of the requested files to Committee Chief

Counsel, Professor G. Robert Blakey. I have made an oral

request

to have the files processed and this is to request

that this task be completed as soon as possible and that

Professor Blakey be provided access to the processed 5i1ea1

As you are aware, we had, by letter of June 13, 1978,

previously refused the request of the Committee. I concurred

in that action and believe it was correct based on the fact

that, in our view, the only need demonstrated by the Committee

for access to the

field office files rested on naked allega-/

tions which had been denied in the past.

In the Committee's:

latest demand, presented by the July 5 letter, the Committee,

on pages 3, 4, and 5 of the letter, outlines in greater detail

the justification for its request.

While it may be our judg-

ment that the information set forth by the Committee is not

legislative and investigative needs are based on pure specula-

tion and/or naked allegations.

That being the case, the

limited access outlined above

to the Committee's requests 18)

REC-66.

I am, of course, aware of the deep concern

Bureau concerning any indication that we are willing touchpo 1978

disclose informants or release information which will lead

to their disclosure.

I share that concern and my decision

in this matter has been reached only with the greatest

possible consideration of that concern.

- 2 -

In addition to the further justification submitted by

the Committee for their request,

I believe there are other

factors which support my conclusion that we should provide

the limited access discussed.

An important factor

is that,

if the response to the Committee's latest request is a complete

refusal, the Committee will issue subpoenas for the informant

files.

The only way we could respond to such subpoenas other

than by providing the requested information would be to seek

to have them enjoined by a federal court.

While

this type

of confrontation may ultimately be necessary during the course

of the Committee's proceedings, it does not appear wise to

take this step without first offering limited access. This

is so for two reasons.

First, in contrast to the limited access we will offer

the Committee, a subpoena would request access to the informant

files by the entire staff thereby increasing the possibility

that the informants could be compromised through the knowledge

of the members of the staff who have studied the other files

in the matter in greater detail and, in any case, would broaden

the number of individuals who could learn the identity of the

informants.

Secondly, if we are to prevail in the litigation, a

possibility which;

in my judgment, is remote given the subject

matter of the Committee's inquiry and the allegations and

information that formed the basis of their request, we can

only win if we show a reasonable posture to the court.. An

absolute refusal to comply would not do that. An attempt

to meet the Committee's needs while protecting our interests

by providing limited access to excised files would do that.

Further support for the procedure of providing limited

access stems from the very nature of the Committee's investi-

gation. Unlike the normal Congressional investigation and/or

lawsuit, the Bureau and the Department of Justice are targets

or subjects of the investigation.

our obligation to be as cooperative as reasonably possible

with the Congress is obvious.

cooperation is going to be a very important factor in the

acceptance or lack of acceptance of the Committee's efforts

and determinations in these investigations.

To put ourselves

in a posture of confrontation with the Committee over this

particular issue without first attempting some

accommodation

of competing interests would only serve to revive all the

allegations and criticisms of us and our actions concerning

the assassinations.

55004 DooId:32989737

Page 108

## Page 109

-3-

It is regrettable but inescapable that the timing of

this demand by the Committee makes our decisions much more

subject to public comment and criticism.

The present interest

in, and

repeated stories related to, the allegations in the

case of Mr. Rowe makes this one of the worst times to come

to a point of absolute refusal in the face of the justifica-

tions advanced by the Committee. If and when we reach the

ultimate confrontation over the

informants, our position will be extremely strengthened by

any steps we can take consistent with our needs to protect

our informants to provide the Committee with necessary

evidence and intormation. That balance, at least at this

stage, is best struck by offering the limited access under

discussion.

Since the Committee's last request was directed personally

to the Attorney General by the Chairman of the Committee, the

Committee is preparing for public hearings in the near future,

and has delayed issuing subpoenas for these materials based on

ny representations that we were making immediate efforts to

respond, we should not delay our response to the Committee.

I am sending a copy of this request to the Attorney

If the Bureau

disagrees with my determination and

decides not to comply with my decision,

your response should

be directed to the Attorney General so this matter can be resolved

quickly.
