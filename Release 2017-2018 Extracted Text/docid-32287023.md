yourself to them things.

he through with the hives?

Who SAM?

How is SAMBO?

CELANO:

BRODKIN:

RIPÂ®

CELANO:

BRODKIN:

Yeah, he's better.

There's a classy little guy.

How is PAUL?

I ain't seen PAUL in a long

time. How is he?

CELANO:

Where's he gonna go if Italy don't want him?

BRODKIN:

That's good. If Italy don't want him, that's

good, then he stays right here. You know that

don't ya?

CELANO:

If Italy don't want him?

BRODKIN:

That's right.. They can't send him to another

country besides his place of origin.

CELANO:

He has renounced his citizenship in Italy and

they don't want him.

The reference to "HANDSOME" is a reference to

GUS ALEX, it being noted that BRODKIN frequently refers to

his close friend, ALEX, as "HANDSOME."

The reference

"that doll" is obviously a reference to MARIANNE RYAN ALEX,

who divorced ALEX in February, 1961. It has been learned

that ALEX continues to have a

great deal of affection for

his former wife.

Interview with louds silver, who owns the

Ambassador Hotels in Chicago where the exclusive Fump Roon

is located, determined that MARIANNE RYAN, as was previously

known, models on Thursdays at noon in the

Pump Room. SILVER

advised that frequently ALEX comes to the Pump Room on

Thursday afternoon and sits in a corner drinking a cup of

coffee while watching his former wife model. SILVER advised

that it is obvious that ALEX carries a "hard, hot torch"

for MARIANNE. MARIANNE, who is identical with CG 6445-PC,

advises that she occasionally speaks with ALEX but that she

has had no close connection with him since their divorce.
