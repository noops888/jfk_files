HARRINGTON; who was away from Paris for several

months, had allowed GIBSON, who was then single and living,

in a hotel, the use of his apartment.

Violent arguments

took place

between the two men in connection with the apartment,

and GIBSON resolved to seek revenge by trying to bring about

the expulsion of HARRINGTON from France.

For this purpose he

sent to a weekly American publication and to the British daily

"The Observer"

, over the signature O. HARRINGION, violently

anti-French articles which were printed in these publications

and were of such nature that they could have brought about the

expulsion of their author from Franco. (C)

Upon being informed of the publication of these

articles of which he was not the author, HARRINGTON located

proof of the very probable guilt of GIBSON and filed a complaint

Judiciaire (Criminal Police)

of the Sûreté Nationale, quickly

that GIBSON ceased working for that agency. (e)

The investigation in connection with the above matter,

in addition to reflecting GIBSON's lack of principles, also

developed the

It was learned from a source in the Agence France

Presse that GIBSON was the animator of a group for aid to

This report confirms another, received from an American

source, to the effect that GIBSON was chairman of the New York

section of a crypto-Communist organization called "Fair Play

for Cuba Committee" which had as its purpose agitation in lavor

of the CASTRO regime in Cuba. (C)
