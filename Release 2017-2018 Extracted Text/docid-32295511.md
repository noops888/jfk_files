the attached chart from which he will present testimony before

LA DUCA, ANTONIO MAGADDINO, JOHN C. MONTANA, and SALVATORE

PIERI represent individuals who act as counselors to STEFANO

MAGADDINO, although they may possess authority, such as

authority exercised by LA DUCA and PIERI which may or may not

PASCAL FRANK POLITANO, a former PCI of this

office,

was a subject in a bank

burglary investigation

in 1958 (Bufile 91-10250) in which prosecution was

declined. He is a former tavern operator who has most

recently received publicity aiter being arrested on an

arson charge and being shot several times. His

assailant was identified and is serving a sentence.

Indices of this office have numerous references

to PAUL A. BRIANDI,

aka Bobby Ross,

Paul Ross, FBI No.

375990. He has not been the subject of a substantive

or

intelligence type investigation since his activities

did not apparently warrant the latter.

For information of the Bureau, positions of

importance assigned various individuals on attached chart

are not substantiated through investigations by

SAM LAGATTUTA, etc.

(HCS) of this office have repeatedly emphasized the position of

FRED G. RANDACCIO.

this chart also fails to show the

position and influence of such individuals as VINCENT A. SCRO

and SAM RANGATORE as developed through HOS.
