LA COSA NOSTRA;

- Cha.

Re Bureau letter dated 2/17/65, requesting

Philadelphia to forward specific examples

of information furnished by PH 705-C* to

provide basis for justification of con-

tinuance of this source for

a 60 day period.

It should be noted that PH 705-C* furnishes

FEB-

information in regard to PH 672-C-IE, a known member of - d

La Cosa Nostra.

PH 705-C* during the pertinent period

has failed to furnish any specific information of value.

It is not felt, however, that this source should be

discontinued.,

The source during the pertinent period was

visited by La Cosa Nostra member FRANK MONTE on two

occasions.

MONTE was out of

range of. PH 705-0* when

con-

versing with the occupant of this location; however, the

source served as a means to verify that PH 672-C-TE did not

shield the fact that MONTE visited him and propositioned

source to accompany him ón a proposed holdup.

This holdup

was not undertaken. The proposition was made by MONtE.

PH 672-C-TE improves his financial status

monthly, and it is felt that he will, therefore, be con-

tacted

socially more frequently, and since he is a member

of La Cosa

Nostra and has potential to furnish valuable

information, Philadelphia will continue PH 705-0*, UACB,

for an additional 60 days.
