A. BACKGROUND

1. Origin and Development

The Pennsylvania State Police furnished the Pittsburgh FBI

Office a copy of a report dated October 14, 1942, which was

written by Detective JOHN CHRIN, Pennsylvania State Police (PSP),

entitled "Mafia Society's Activities in Labor," in which

Detective. CHRIN referred to several prominent Western

Pennsylvania racketeers

as members of the Black Hand or of

the Mafia. No evidence is contained in CHRIN's report to

the effect that these racketeers are actually Mafia members,

but merely refers to them as such.

CHRIN, in his report, also mentioned the society known as the

Rosa, beneficial association organized by JACK CANCELLIERE,

a North Side, Pittsburgh, racketeer, and composed of a group. of

Unverified allegations have come to the attention

of this office from other sources to the effect that the

Rosa Society might be a Black Hand group.

In Detective CHRIN's report, he indicates that in 1942, there

were at least two hundred members of the Black Hand in

Pittsburgh and vicinity.

PG T-1, who has furnished reliable information in the past,

Masta was never used when he was a partner of JOHN TA ROCC-fie

AMATO in a business relationship.

"said that his partners were referred to by everyone, including

himself, as "Black Handers" and that they employed a group of

Italian toughs who carried out collection duties. He said

that most of these toughs carried no guns or knives, but were

armed constantly with a twelve inch to fifteen inch

cue stick

which they sawed off and weighted with lead.

He said that a

hole bored in the end of the sawed off cue stick was filled

the lead and was then corked. He advised that he carried one

himself for many years and would still have it if he had not

left it in the glove compartment of an automobile he sold. He

He said that during this period the local hoodlums and toughs

had great respect for the power and temper of LA ROCCA. who was
