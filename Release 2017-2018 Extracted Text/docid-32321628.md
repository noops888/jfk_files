Title: JFK RECORDS COLLECTION ACT OF 1992 (The Act)

Synopsis:

Miami is requested to conduct necessary research

pursuant to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) letter

requiring the FBI's response by 10/21/96. Miami is also

requested to send pertinent files to Headquarters/JFK Task Force

as soon as possible.

Details:

The ARRB by letter dated 9/10/96 (copy available

upon request) has requested that the FBI identify all information

in FBI assassination records that the FBI believes is under court

seal.

The ARRB's

interest in this matter, is to have the Department of

Justice assist in petitioning the courts to unseal the records so

the documents may be opened to the public as established by the

JFK Assassination Records Collection Act (JFKARCA) .

In accordance with the ARRB letter, the FBI must

identify which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under

court seal. In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB

also seeks the location and the duration of the surveillance.

Because the background information concerning these electronic

surveillances are maintained in the Field Office, we are

requesting that the field do the research necessary to respond to

the ARRB's request. The ARRB seeks the following information:

1)

the name and jurisdiction of the judge approving

the electronic surveillance.

2) any docket number or case name associated with the

., information.

3) the location and duration of the electronic

surveillance.

4) the subject of the electronic surveillance.

Please furnish this information for each file/informant number

indicated at the end of this communication.

This information may

be faxed into HQ/JFK Task Force by secure fax (202) 324-9471.

This information should be furnished to HQ by C.o.B. 10/11/96.

Pursuant to the JFKARCA any materials considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form.

The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened

in

full.

Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field Office.

Since 'the

originals will be sent to NARA, copies of the files

should be made for record purposes prior to their shipment to

Headquarters.

All files should be received at Headquarters no

later than C.O.B. 10/11/96:

Below are the assassination records maintained in your

Field Office.

Because the copies of the documents we are working

with were put together in 1978 in no real assemblage and many

with no identifying file numbers,

we are furnishing you with the

best available information possible.

If you have any questions,

you may contact Brian Fields (202) 324-9535 or LuAnn Wilkins

(202) 324-9466.

Please ship the following files to FBIHQ, JFK Task

Force, Attention:

Brian Fields, Room 6362.
