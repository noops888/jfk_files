d. Wick significant because of

its apparent urgency.

It appears also

that the subject cannot

get her passport in

time to be in

England this Saturday,

so her husband is

going in her place.

It would appear, therefore, that he has an appointment to meet

someone in England.

The Bureau is requested, through liaison

to contact

them attempt to discreetly

determine RICHARD FRANK's contacts and activities in England

and elsewhere.

Discretion should be used so as RICHARD FRANK

does not become aware of investigative interest in him.

A copy of this airtel is being designated for WFO

because

of their previous investigation in this matter.
