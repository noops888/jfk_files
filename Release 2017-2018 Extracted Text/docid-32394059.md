INTERNAL SECURITY - CUBA

This is to advise of pertinent developments in

a double agent operation, assigned the code name "Ocelot,"

which involves a meeting between our asset and Cuban

Intelligence Officers

(CIO's) in Mexico on May 19, 1977.

We learned, after debriefing the asset upon his return

from Mexico, that the format of the meeting had unex-

pectedly involved a videotaped interview of our asset

by Cuban technicians concerning his knowledge and partici-

pation in anti-Castro Cuban exile activities. : (S)

The asset developed in this operation first

became of investigative interest to the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) in November, 1976, when allegations

were received that he was in contact with known CIO's in

Jamaica during October and November, 1976. Subsequent

investigation, coordinated closely with the Central

Intelligence Agency

• (CIA), confirmed an active relation-

ship with Cuban officials in Jamaica, Panama and Mexico.

A successful interview of asset was effected on April 8,

1977, which resulted in establishing a double agent

operation.: At that point, the asset furnished details

of seven previous meetings with CIO's in Jamaica, Panama

and Mexico.

In addition, asset furnished a typewritten

note containing instructions for his next meeting in

Mexico City, on May 19, 1977, which involved a coded

telephone call to the Cuban

Embassy, Mexico City, to

activate the scheduled meet at a pre-determined time

and place. The purpose of this meeting, according to

the asset, was for the passage of additional information

concerning the activities of Cuban exile groups in the

United States and Latin America, as had been done at

previous meetings. : (S)

pied by two Cuban technicians.

The asset was then asked

questions by CIO's and his responses were recorded on

with questions regarding his family life in Cuba before

the Castro revolution, after which he was asked to comment

member.

He told the interviewer that in 1964 he had worked

with Alona 66, a militant anti-Castro organization head-

quartered in Miami, Florida, in helping approximately

twenty-eight Cuban
