tedly, he has performed a satisfactory service for the

the event he decides to sever connections with us because of his

failure to achieve more praminent status, would be a permanent blow

to our effectiveness there. With respect to his knowledge of

Hunarold Project

DATE:

28 September 1952

In connection with a re-examination of the security

factors of this Project, a pre-arranged visit to the home of

Humanoid was nade by the writer.

As previously reported,

subject

has constructed a secret dark room under the floor of his house.

and processes the production from the Humankind Project it this

work room. It is therefore necessary that certain comprovising

naterial is retained overnight by Humanoid, anu,

at present, this

naterial is kept in a wooden desk with a cheap lock.

Although

Humanoid's personal security appeare good at this tire note possi

billty of an unexpected house search or a pure case of

breaking, with theft as a motive cannot be overlooked, with resultant

serlous security considerations

2. It is therefore requested that heedcuarters

consider furnishing a snall wall safe with a combination lock for

installation in the above-mentioned dark rosa.

It would be possible

to sink the safe into the concrete wall, and even if complete con-

cealment were not possible, the safety of the material would be

greatly enhanced.

Suitable safes are not available locally, but

It isnown that Remington Rand markets a

snadd strong box with a

combination lock (price about $20.00) which would be ideal.

3. I rould appreciate receiving your opinion in this

matter Inasnuch as other measures must be taken in the event a safe

cannot be made available.

Inasmuch as Humanoid is aware of the proposed salary

raise recommended by the former Chief of Station in the Cuarterly

Report dated Aupust 17, 1951, Inforration as to the status of this

recommendation is requested.

the photography incident to the HUMANKIND project, which work be

From the above circumstances, it appears possible that HUMANOID's
