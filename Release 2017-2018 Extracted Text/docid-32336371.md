LEFF informed

involving everyone except JACK BARENFELD, who was

also guilty. LEFF also said that someone

beat FRIEDMAN

for some money playing cards and FRIEDMAN went to the

District Attorney claiming he was cheated.

Source also learned that an Italian who has

a bookmaking operation at the Harbor Island Spa, Miami

Beach, as well as being a bookmaker in New Jersey,

name unknown, reportedly sent someone to Los Angeles to

see TEITELBAUM.

Reportedly, TELIELBAUM was advised to

cease taking money out of Florida.

It 1s noted that source

has advised in the past that TEITELBAUM visits the Harbor

Island Spa every winter and wins: very large sums of

money in crooked card games.

On 0/1/66, source advised that the recent

publicity in the Chicago newspaper reporting a raid

gambling equipment in Tulsa, Oklahoma mentioned crooked

dice and the Riviera Hotel as well as KORSHAK by name.

on

KORSHAK was very mad

because his name was mentioned in this

article.

Source said there has never been any doubt

In his mind that the Desert Inn, the Stardust, and the

Dunes Casinos use crooked dice and have done so for a long

time. There may be others also guilty but these are

the

ones source has reason to believe are guilty.

On 8/3/66, source advised the following:

About two years, MAURICE FRIEDMAN, JOHN ROSELLI,

and DAN TEITELBAUM arranged to cheat HARRY KARL and TED

BRISKIN at gin rummy at the Friars Club.

They brought

in a man known as the spotter, who is the same man that

TEITELBAUM uses in Miami Beach, who drilled peep holes

in the ceiling and was able to signal with a transmitter

to FRIEDMAN so that he would know what cards to play.

FRIEDMAN used AL, MATHES as a partner playing against KARL

and BRISKIN. Source was told this by MATHES who was

ED That KARL

not

in on the deal but found out about it later. After

,several months play, KARL and BRISKIN reportedly lost

several thousand dollars and never knew they had been

cheated.

The

source again mentioned crooked dice

being used in Las Vegas

and said possibly the only

honest casino in his opinion was the Golden Nugget, where

he would play If he were going to gamble, next would be

-4

LA 137-2528

possibly the Sahara and then maybe the Tropicana.

In his opinion, in all probability all the other casinos

would use crooked dice on occasions when they considered

it necessary.

KORSHAK has returned to town and has left

again. He usually goes to Las Vegas the first of every

month.

Source speculated that

this is probably to

pick up money.

Source recalled that on 7/22/66, he observed

JOHN ROSELLI and ALLEN SMILEY meeting two

young girls

for dinner at the Bistro Restaurant, Beverly Hills.

Source

also mentioned that the Detroit

Italian hoodlums had attempted to get into the Silver

Slipper but as far as he knew, they were unsuccessful.

The lessees now operating the

casino are JACK SHAPIRO,

SHELLBY WILLIAMS, T. W. RICHARDSON and Dr. FRIEDMAN, nO

known relation to MORRIE FRIEDMAN.

on 8/4/66, source advised he saw HARRY KARL the

previous night.

KARL recently lost $25,000 at the dice

table at the Riviera Hotel. When KARL returned from

Las Vegas and read the newspaper accounts of the

crooked dice game, he asked KORSHAK if he should pay

his loss at the Riviera since they were reportedly

using crooked dice. Although the remark was in jest,

KORSHAK got mad.

On 8/17/66, source advised that he accidentally

met JOHN ROSELLI on the night of 8/15/66 at a restaurant.

ROSELLI requested source to contact him to telephone

him the following day..

Source did phone ROSELLI at

his residence

on 8/16/66 and ROSELLI said he was concerned

over the investigation currently being conducted by the

Negada

Gaming Control Board and the FBI in Las Vegas.

He indicated that he was aware that source in the past

has been extremely close to Gaming Control official BUTCH

LEYPOLDT. ROSELLI said he suspected that LEYPOLDT and

the head of the FBI, Las Vegas were working in concert in

-5-

## Page 7

LA 137-2528

an attempt to embarrass and harass casino operators and

their associates.

ROSELLI specifically requested source

to contact LEYPOLDT to see if he could persuade him

to reduce the heat on Las Vegas.

Source told ROSELLI

that if he should run into LEYPOLDT, he would

mention it.

Source said that while he was operating in

Las Vegas as a hotel owner he was in frequent contact

he described as being very honest

but he has not seen LEYPOLDt for the past six years and

has no intention of bringing this to lEYPOLDT's attention

even if he should run into him by accident.

On 8/26/66, source advised that on the previous

day KORSHAK told him that Sands Hotel executive JACK

ENTRATTER is currently in the process of arranging

to buy out all Italian hoodlum interests in the Sands

Hotel based on the Italian's desire to be disassociated

with Las Vegas as a result of current disclosures and

heat applied from skimming information.

KORSHAK mentioned

his information is that all Italians having hidden

ownership in Las Vegas casinos are interested in divorcing

themselves from their ownership and getting out of

Las Vegas completely.

KORSHAK further advised source that MOE DALITZ,

president of Desert Inn Hotel, has been in contact with

ALBERT PARVIN about buying and

taking over the Desert Inn.

On 9/12/66, source advised that KORSHAK was

in Cedars of Lebanon

Hospital for three or four days last

week.

He was suffering from a stomach disorder.

He

was

scheduled to go to La Costa Country Club over the

past weekend to attend a labor meeting concerning a

race track presumably Del Mar, but he was to ill and someone

from Chicago went in his place.

on 9/14/66, source advised that AL MATHES told him

that day that

LOUIS TOM DRAGNA had been shaking him

down for money. MATHES used to be a bookmaker but

is now a restaurant owner in partner with STEVE CRANE

and

AL PARVIN is also partner in their newest restaurant,

the

Scam, on Sunset Boulevard.

'On 9/19/66, source advised the following:

About four weeks ago, he was contacted by

ALBERT PARVIN who desired to buy land owned by source

in Las Vegas and offered three million.

Source requested

three and a half million and no agreement was reached

at that time.

on 9/7/66, source met with SIDNEY

KORSHAK and attorney HARVEY SILBERT. KORSHAK and SILBERT

told source independently that when PARVIN bought

the Fremont Hotel he made a secret agreement to pay

off the hidden Italian interests for two and a half

million within a year and a half from skimmed funds.

Now based on skimmed revealations, the Italians want

their money. PARVIN desires to purchase source's

property as a device to obtain a kickback of one million

dollars under the table in order to make this money

available to the unknown Italians. Source agreed

ne boat a tronace this none y

to sell his land for four million dollars and go ahead

with their proposal to attempt to compromise PARVIN,

KORSHAK and SILBERT in this matter. SILBERT said

the price was too high but invited

source to travel

with he and KORSHAK to Las Vegas on 9/20/66 to further

discuss the deal. Source stated that the Italians:

names were never mentioned but speculated they would

probably include JERRY CATENA of New Jersey because

he was previously assocated with prior owners of the

Fremont Hotel.

On 9/22/66,

source advised that he did travel

to Las Vegas on 9/20/66 with KORSHAK and SILBERT and

they stayed at the Riviera Hotel. Source again presented

his offer to SILbeRt, who was non-commital. During

this discussion AL PARVIN left for Europe so was not

in on this past negotiations.

On 9/26/66, source advised that KORSHAR left

on the morning: of 9/25/00, probably for Chicago.

PAUL RAFFLES told

source that KORSHAK is using RALPH

STOLKIN, wealthy principal stockholder of Brunswick

Manufacturing Company and National Video in an attempt

to take over the ownership of Columbia Studios.
