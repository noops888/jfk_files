OCCURRENCE: In discussing the possible methods of accomplishing the mission, Sam

Gold suggested that they not resort to firearms, but 'that"if he could be furnished with

some type of potent pill that could be placed in Castro's food or drink.

Sam indicated

that he had a prospective nominee in the person of Juan Orta, a Cuban official, who hac

been receiving back payments from the gambling interests who still had access to Castro,

and was in a financial bind.

cornelius roosevelt, Chief, ISD was consulted and assigned

lethal content, and little or no traceability. Six of these items were produced-and—

after being checked out for their effectiveness by Dr. Edward M. Gunn, three pills were

ultimately turned over to Sam for the mission. Neither TSD nor Dr. Gunn was briefed on

the ultimate use of the pills.
