REPORT ON PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S SPEECH BEFORE THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

17 Dec •63

Msg NI:

In a brief address to the United Nations General Assembly

the new President of the United States attempted to make clear

what his future foreign policy will be like. He pointed out

that 30 years ago he was a collaborate of ROOSEVELT in; a peaceful

revolution in the United States, and said that he now seeks

something similar for the entire;world. His remark that no one

particular political system will dominate the future of mankind

may be taken as an expression of his willingness to accept

peaceful coexistence.

Every leader who strives for peace, he

said, will find himself side by side with' the United States.

Mr. JOHNSON's speech, which took only 15, minutes, did nọt

go into details, but in its main outlines, left nothing to be

desired so far as clarity is concerned.

The New York police took extensive precautions to insure

the President's safety. The hall was carefully checked, and

even the grounds outside the building were inspected closely.

The President, who was accompanied by his wife and 'll members

of the Congress, was welcomed by Secretary General U. THANT.

It was the last day the General Assembly, and most of the:

delegates were about to return home, but the large half was

filled to capacity. All seats in the public gallery were

occupied by special invitation.

_ T12-63

Mr. JOHNSON said that the late President had inspired humanity

with fresh hope, which he shared with a new generation of world

leaders. KENNEDY had addressed himself to the future, and

wanted to forget the disunity of the past. The world should

follow his example.

It is true that the world knows more about how to destroy

itself than how to live together in understanding, but the

United Nations has been too successful for one to despair of the

future. President JOHNSON pointed to successes in the Congo

and Middle East, to the slowing of the arms race, to the progress

of decolonization, to the furthering of human rights.: The

United Nations should provide opportunities for constructive

action and not become a platform for name-calling.

The President does not desire only bilateral assistance to

underdeveloped countries, but lays great stress on collective

international action. Just as he wishes to create the impression

among Americans that he is liberal and progressive, so did he

take this opportunity to convince the Assembly that he is deeply

interested in the fight against illiteracy, poverty, and disease.

Just as 30 years ago under ROOSEVELT he helped eliminate poverty

in America, so does he now wish to contribute to the elimination

of misery throughout the world.

Above all else, however, he sees his task as the maintenance

of peace.

Thanks to KENNEDY, the world has become a little

safer and the road to the future a little easier. The greatest

tribute one can pay to President KENNEDY is to continue his work

for a peaceful future. On this note the new President ended his

brief, reassuring speech.
