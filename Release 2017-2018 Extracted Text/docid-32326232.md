MISCELLANEOUS - INFORMATION CONCERNING

(ACCOUNTING AND FRAUD SECTION)

Reurairtel 9/19/61.

with

The Bureau appreciates that during your early contacts

it was necessary to exercise care with respect to

the questions asked so you would not disclose to him more informa-

tion than you obtained from him. Reairtel indicates that in view

of later developments this problem is not as great as it was

previously.

The Bureau desires to point out that even though the

informant may now appear more at ease with the Agents and more

trustful of them, you should still continue to exercise entreme

caution in your conversations with him so you will not disclose in

formation in Bureau files during the course of these conversations.

With respect to the suggestion contained in the penultimate

paragraph of roairtel you are advised that it is not felt that dis

senination of information received from the informant can be held

in abeyance until the conditions of this suggestion are completely

fulfilled in all instances. As you undoubtedly have observed

from various communications received from the Bureau regarding the

information received from this informant, dissemination is being

made to the Department of Justice promptly of those matters con

cerning which it is believed prompt dissemination is required.

It

is being delayed in other instances until nore specific facts can

be obtained by your office from the informant. It is expected

that this practice will continue to be followed in the future.

If you have not already done so, quairtel immediately

furnishing

information requested in Buairtel of 9/15/64.
