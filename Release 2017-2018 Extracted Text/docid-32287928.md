The New Garden Club continues to operate gambling

games at Gretna, La., and NO 1205-C reported that 21 tables

have operated in many of the clubs throughout Jefferson

Parish.

NO 1205-C advised that an individual recently

attempted to operate a roulette game at the Cotton Club on

Jefferson Highway, and after one day's operation it was

closed by Major EARL ROLLING of the Jefferson Parish SO.

The next day Capt. SAM LE BLANC, Jefferson Parish so,

rechecked to be sure that the club had closed down.

NO 1205-C advised the only explanation he can offer is that

the son of the owner of the Cotton Club was actively backing

another candidate in the first Democratic primary, and the

club was closed by Sheriff FITZGERALD because of

this reason.

Sheriff JOHN JACK FITZGERALD was defeated in his

effort to be re-elected as sheriff in the first Democratic

primary, however, he will hold office until the first week

1964. Capt. CY DI LIBERTO on 1/8/64 advised that

it is a well-regarded fact that either of the two candidates

in the second primary will probably dismiss most of the

current employees of the Jefferson Parish so, and he antici-

sates that most of the current deputies of the Jeffersor

Parish staff will be hunting jobs between now and the first

week in May. DI LIBERTO indicated that Sheriff JOHN JACK

FITZGERALD has disregarded the operation of the Jefferson

Parish

SO and for the time being the office is "running

itself"'.

LEAD

NEW ORLEANS

AT NEW ORLEANS, LA. â€¢

Will be alert for possible violation of Federal

laws through the change of political administration in

Jefferson Parish.
