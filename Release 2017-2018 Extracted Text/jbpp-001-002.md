Dear John:

This clipping from this morning's Star-Telegram

will indicate the strong interest in Americanism

which the Fort Worth Elk's Lodge has; and it will

further substantiate our sincere desire to receive

an American flag from the President during his

visit to Fort Worth. If it is impossible for him

to present it at the Elks* Lodge, would it be

possible for him to make a private presentation

at the Hotel Texas?

Two half-page ads have been purchased in both

daily newspapers, urging all individuals to take an

active part in "Know your America" Week.

P. S.

You might pass

this clipping and note on

to Vice President Lyndon Johnson.

December 8, 1963

Dear Harry:

Dy a series of odd coincidences, I have been moving

fringes of events connected to the tragedy of

Dallas.

Inst week the Comiasion ampointed by President

Knoxady Johnson to investigate the death of President

Kennedy hold its first two meetings in the National

Archiven and I served as the Commission's Press Officor

on these two occasions.

We had boen asired to provide

a meeting place for the organizational neetings of the

Commission and offered Chief Justice Warren a quiet conference

room in tho National Archives.

Apparently the Chief Justice

vanta to keep unrelated the functiona of the Supreme Court

and the Commission; this dosire, again apparently,

press aide camo

By agreement

of the Chiof Justice and the Archivist of the United States,

therefore, I was designated to attempt to bring a little

order from the press chaos that ocours in Washington at the

scene of any significant news event.

My function has been to act as a sort of "press policenan"

rather than

spokesnen.

The Chief Justice himself has sorved

as the Commission spokesman.

Last Thursda y the firat meeting was hold and there was a

horde of reporters and photographers on hand to provide a

crowd scene in the "quiet" Archives.

Working with the

Archiviet and other officials, we arranged reasonable security

with uniformed and plain clothes security mon.

Taking a

lead from Dellas, we required all prosa people to present

The section of the Archives where the conference

room is situated was placed off limita to other porsons.

The Chief Justice eusgested that I bring in the photographers

at the start of the session so they could get their pictures

and then get the hell out; he said to tell the reporters that

there would be no statement because the Commission work waa

just barely getting under wey.

Ho allowed me to divide the

photographers into two groups - stilla and TV - becaus e

there was so many of

An emusing thing happened:

took in the "stills" to

shoot tro minutes, then asled them

to g't out and let the TV men come in with their handheld

"stilla" sneaked back in with the

but ho was immediately informed upon by his colleagues

who bangod

the door and pushod their way part way in,

calling to me

"He's cheating!

He's a hog!"

So he got the

bums rush.

Although the Chief Justice said there woula be

no statement,

some 40 reporters and seven IV crews remaine

in tho hall — tho IV men with their big sound-on-fi2m

cemoras sot up.

At the end of the three-hour session,

however, the Chief Justice did have a few minor comments

and lot mo bring in the reporters

to hear them,

but without camoras and mikes. He cooperates with the

press, but doesn't get puahed around.

John Mcdloy, one

of the Commision mombors, just sat

thore and clowored.

The second dey wen a re-run of the firat.

Hopefully,

the Commission will got a staff this coming week and

the mechanics of the sessions will operate more moothly.

The Chief Justioo doesn't care for security measures at

011 - in fact,

I gathor that ho distains them.

no formal protection for him in his pooition.

Knowing the

fury that his name evokes in nome quartera, I find the

leck of sacurity a worriesome thing.

His car didn't come

for him for some reason at the ond of the second meeting and

ha stood at the curb with Senator John Sherman Cooper for

about 10 minutes.

The Archivist and I drove out of the bacoment

at that time,

found then standing there and gave them a 11ft

up to the Hill.

Ir. Warren has been vory gracious to us,

most appreciative for the few

things that we have been able

to do for him andthe Commission.

This slight involvement with the start of the Comminion's

meetings, coupled to the mission to Fort Worth, has me feeling

that I have been looking in on history. They are experiencos

which I would have gladly foregone.

All of us are well here. Give our love to Iarchmont and

New Rochelle.

Best regards,

Job

Dear Dave:

Please accept my warmest thanks for your thoughtfulness in

providing me with those unexpbeted photographs taken in front of

the Hotel Texas in Fort Worth.

It was a pleasuze working with you, Marjorio, Raymond Buck and

others on the arrangements for the Fort Worth breakfast. It was a

day that onded tragically but at least we have the satisfaction of know-

ing that President Kennedy obviously appeared very pleased by the

Fort Worth program.

I regret that it was not posaible to see Marjorie when she visited

Washington.

However, we did have a chance to talk on the telephone

when she visited Jim Wright's office.

The next time I am in Fort Worth I intend to drop in and see you

because my memory of your hospitality and cooperation is as pleasant

as can be.

Thank you again for the pictures and give my best regards to Majorie

and your children.

Washington 25, D. C.

Dear John:

Enclosed are five pictures which I thought you might

like to have.

Four of these pictures are in sequence and I have

numbered them on the back in the order in which they were taken.

You will note picture No. I shows you standing back by

the side of the building, I am at the door, Senator Ralph Yarborough

is in front and Nellie and John Connally are getting ready to get

in che car. Picture No.

2 shows you standing on the edge of the

curb, Marjorie, my wife, has moved over by the door and I have got

the dark glasses on and Jackie is walking to the car.

Picture No. 3 shows you greeting President Johnson on

the curb.

John Kennedy is in the car and Ralph Yarborough is to

the rear of the second car and Cliff Carter is opening the door

of the white car in the center of the street.

That is Lady Bird

Johnson with the white coat on and to the left of che man who is

holding the coat is Mr. Johnson.

Picture No. 4 shows Mr. Johnson

with his coat on talking to you, but you are blocked out of the

picture.

The above four pictures were taken when the Kennedys and

the rest of the group were going to the airport to catch the plane

to go to Dallas.

The fifth picture was taken when Mr. Kennedy was

going out to address the group on the parking lot before the break-

fast.

As you can see, this picture shows Senator Yarborough, Jim

Wright, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, Governor Connally, Marjorie,

Raymond Buck and State Senator Don Kennard.

Marge and our oldest daughter and two other teenagers

are in New York this week but expect to come to Washington Sunday,

January 20. She is going to try to locate you, but I wish you

would call Jim Wright, our Congressman whom you met and know,

let him know how he can get hold of you, and maybe you and Marge

and Duncan and Jim can get together.

I thought these pictures of you making your move to

meet Mr. Johnson were pretty strong and thought you might like

them. I am sending the fifth picture because you met all these

people and I thought you might like to have it.

Here is tenetive program:

9:45 A.M. - President Leaves breakfast for room, after the

usual shaking

of hands etc.

Rest of schedule as previously outlined.

N°

However, there is a strong

feeling here that there

should be a public exposure of the president in addition to

the Chamber of Commerce luncheon.

Al though Mr. Buck has

promised liberality in dispensing tickets,

labor and

working Democratic politicians feel that not enough attention

is: being paid to the pe ople who worked

the

Ve attended a meeting last nicht ar anged by the

Governor's men: attorney David 0. Belew, Jr.

In addition

to Mrs. Belew, county Democratic BRitiShonaage people

were in attendance:

Bill Potts, Tennant Democratic County Chairman;

state comnitteeman and campaign

Garrett Morris cov. Connally in last campaign;

Garland Ham,

United Auto Workers Union representative:

John Heath,

representative of International Association

lachinists ( at Gen'1 Dynamics)

Bill Haworth,

public relations representative from

Bell Helicopter

This group pleaded for public exposure of the President.

The plea was that the President take the

time for

a short

address to the FT. Worth general citizenry either:

1.

At the parking lot across the street from the Texas

Hotel where the breakfast is being held;

At Burnett Park, four blocks

away, where the President

as a candidate spoke in 1960;

Or at Carswell Air Force Base where he will emplane

for Dallas late in the morning of Now. 22.

A fourth suszestion was that there be an -extensive

cavalcade up and down FT. Worth main streets.

I have checked out these possibilities with Mr. Buck and

hó has no objection as long

as anything dobe does not

interfere with the "non-partisanship" of the C of C breakfast.

Integration: the breakfast will be integrated, bir. Buck

tells me,

because perhaps 30 persons from labor will

be nogro.

(Incidentally,

SAPURDAY, UBCEMBER 21, 1903

It was under John F. Kennedy in his 1900 campaign for

the Presidency that great care was given to making aetailed

preparations fur campaign appearances.

Ven designated ne

"advance men"

were

sent days in advance of the date or the

appesrance to the specific locality to make certain that it

would yield the greatest return to the candidatex. This

technique vas again employed at the end or 1963 as a prelude

to what was to be his campaign for reelection.

I was one of the Presidential advance men in Texas on

November 22, 1963 - the day President Kennedy was assasinated.

A week before Veterans Day, November 11, I vas told that I was

to be the advance man for the President's visit to Fort Worth

on November 22. The Preaident's Toxas trip was to include

speaking engage melte in Sen Antonio and Houston Novenber 21,

an overnigne suay

in Fore Worun November &h an an adarese

there at a Chamber o1 Conuerce breakiast vau nexi morning.

## Page 51

political dinner in Austin. As it turned out, the last speech

which he delivered

- 2 -

was in Ft. Worth. He was assassinated on the motor

cavalcade route from Love Field in Dallas to the place

where he was to speak.

Jerry Bruno in the Democratic National Committee had

requested Bernard L. Boutin, Administrator of General

Services, for assistance in helping make the final arrangements

on the

Texas trip and the assignment was given to me.

In talking over the trip with Bruno, he decided to let me

handle Pt. Worth. Several other agencies, similarly, •

provided advance

men for the other cities on the tour.

We left Andrews Air Force Base the morning of November

12 1n a twin-engined aircraft which also was carrying the

Secret Service Teams and communications specialista who

had been assigned to the various points. It was a tedious

flight in, by modern standards, a slow aircraft. I remember

being amused by the sight of one Secret Service agent

across the aisle i

burted/in an Ian Flemming Janes Bond thriller.

Ft. Worth was the next to last stop Bo we did not reach there

until after 6 P.M. Texas time.

We (those asnigned to Ft.

Worth) were driven to

the Hotel Texas in an Air Force car

after landing at Carswell Alr Force Base. B111 Duncan

was the Secret Sorvice agent in charge assleted by a Hall

and by the Secret Service man-on-the-acene, Mike Howard.

Major Jack Rubley of the Signal Corps attached to the

White House was with un in charge of communications and

assisted by a young lieutenant, B1ll something ot

Dartell,

---

## Page 52

- 3 -

who was being trained for such work. Our first chore that

night was to have excellent

steaks in the Cattleman's

restaurant.

The effort to shape up the President's visit to Ft.

Worth began the next day. It had been determined previously

that the Ft. Worth

stop would be a non-partisan engagement,

breakfast sponsored by the Ft. Worth Chamber of Commerce

which, I believe, is rather heavily on the Republican side.

However, the President of the Chamber, Raymond Buck, a

vealthy lawyer and head of insurance companies, is a Democrat

and close friend of the then-Vice President Johnson and

Governor Connally. The Secret Service team and I vielted

with him on the morning of Nov. 13. He

18 obviously a man

affluence and, in fact, wanted it to be

a free breakfast with him and several other Democrats picking

up the entire tab. Mr. Buck described himself to me as the

last of the long-haired Texas politicians after the death

of Tom Connally. His white hair, in truth, curled around

the back of his neck. In the succeeding days I enaextox

gained

a great deal of respect for him as a man of integrity

and as a doer of things without exciting antagonisms, or

rather, I should day, with keepfng antagonisms to a minimum.

For when I arrived I found that the basic format of the

Ft. Worth visit was causing trouble. The Democratic party

workers resented the fact that the sponsoring organization

of the President's visit was the Republican oriented Chamber

of Commerce. Labor also was unhappy with this arrangement

---

## Page 53

1 +-

- - 4 -

and, as it later turned out, so were the Negro and

Spanish-American communities.

To complicate matters further politically, the liberal

Senator Ralph Yarhorough of Texas was engaged in a feud

with Governor John Connally. Furthermore, there was a

marked coolness between Yarborough and Vice President Johnson.

I was told that Yarborough had refused to allow faxa Connally

and Johnson to be invited to a testimonial dinner in his

behalf. Connally, I soon became aware from his people,

had refused to invite Yarborough to his reception for the

President in Austin. As soon as I waB in residence in the

Hotel Texas, I began to receive telephone calls from

Connally people passing

along the word that the Governor

did not want Yarborough seated

at the head table

at the

Ft. Worth breakfast and did not want Yarborough seated in

one of the front cars in the motorcade.

I was, however,

under instrue song from Bruno to make sure that Yarborough

was not slighted. He had been one of the most reliable

supporters of the President's program in the Senate.

The days that followed were filled with discussions

Individually or severally, with Mr. Buck, Executive Vice

President of the Chamber of Commerce Milton Atkinson who

obvioualy vas a conservative Republican, Tarrant County

Democratic Chairman B111 Potte, State Committeevoman

(Democratic) Marjorie Belew and her husband Dave, State

Com Itteeman Garrett Norris who had been Connally's campaign

chairman,

0.0. Yancey Jr. who headed the AFL-CIO Central

---

## Page 54

- 5 -

Labor Council and his associates, Negro leader Dr. "arion J.

Brooks and, the day before the breakfast, Rate Jake Cardenae

of the Spanish-American group known as SANO. And many others.

With the cooperation.of Mr. Buck, 550 of the 2000 available

tickets for the breakfast were made avallable free to

Democrats, the Labor Unions, Negroes and Spanich-Americans.

I required each group do compile lists and channel them through

me. Mr. Buck and his friends, who he did not identify, were

to piaixap pay for these tickets. The rest of the tickets

were sold to members of

the Chamber of Commerce at $3 each.

Congressman Jim Wright of Fort Worth checked into the

notel for two days a couple of roome down the hall from mine.

Itold him bluntly that the intra-party squabbling between

Yarborough and Connally was nonsense. He agreed and, I

belleve, did his best to madkatexthex contain the dispute

Insofar as it affected Ft. Worth. B11l Moyers, young

Deputy Director of the Peace Corps and close friend of

Vice President Johnson, had arrived in Austin in the

meantime to coordinate the entire Texas visit and we were

in touch two or three times a day by telephone. There were

three telephones in my hotel room toward the end

and one, at

least, was usually ringing. One of the phones was tied in

to a switchboard connecting directly with the White House.

The press got on to me finally, thanke to someone in the

labor union leadership, and reporters began ringing me.

Rather than deal in equivocations, I told them factually that

I was deputy assistant administrator of the General Services

---

## Page 55

- 6 -

Administration and had bien detailed by the White House

to coordinate the ft. Worth visit. Moyers saw one of the

stories in one of the Ft. Worth dallies and called me to say

he was going to recommend when we returned to Washington

that other advance men during the campaign be as frank if

tracked down by the press rather than try and maintain the

fiction that they were where they were on agency business.

Meantime, Duncan and his associates

were busy

from

morning until night holding meetinge with enforcement agencies

to insure the security of the President.

I attended *xerex

their menting with Major General, or was it Brigadier, Noore

at Carawell Air Force Base and the officers he had assigned

to work on the visit. We succeeded in getting Moore to open

the base to the public both on the night of the President's

arrival and on the morning of his planned departure.

Carswell 1e a SAO base and security there usually precludes

opening the base to the public. Difrerent routes to end

from the hate base were decided upon and diagrammed in the

newspapers so that the public would know where to stand

to see the Presidential party. After much pushing-and

pulling, I set up the welcoming-farewell committee composed

of Chamber of Commerce officials, city and county public

officials, labor union leaders and Democratic local officials.

In the off-hours I consumed a substantial quantity of

Scotch. Ross Wilder, our GSA Director of Business Affairs

in Dallas, met me in Ft. Worth and introduced me to the oner

of the Empire Club just down the street from the hotel where

---

## Page 56

- 7 -

I was signed on as an honorary member and could buy mixed

drinks and steaks. In Texas you have to belong to a club

in other to buy hard liquor by the drink. I gave membership

cards to the Secret Service guys and used to meet them

in mid-evening

at the Club for discussions about the day's

business. They were abstemious -- a couple of drinks and

that was it. On several nights we dropped down to an

after-hours place two blocks from the hotel called "The

Cellarl -- a Joint protected by the local police where the

beatnike abounded

and horrid drinka such as coffee royals

or bourbon, or what passed as bourban, was served with 7-Up.

We never stayed more than half an hour because the din from

drums and guitars was more than the ordinary ear could bear.

The plane for the visit gradually fell together.

The

diverse groups were more or less satlefied with the numbere

of tickets assigned them. The Connally people gave in and

arrangements were made to give Senator Yarborough everything

to which he was entitled by protocol -- including a seat at

the head table and a seat in the car with the Vice President

1n the motorcade.

Wilder came

over to Dallas and checked into the hotel

on November 21 to assist me.

The Presidential party was

to arrive at Carswell around 11 P.M. and Wilder and I drove

out there and I lined up the welcoming committee in a

hangar.

Air Force Number l arrived and landed and the President and

---

## Page 57

- 8 -

his party disembarked to the cheers of thousands. Majorie

Belew hande: Mrs. Kennedy a rather heavily dewed armful son

red roses. The motorcade took off for town and, despite the

hour, the sidewalks were lined with cheering people.

Wilder and I went back to the hotel in his car and, after

the Presidential party was settled, I went up to the President's

floor and reported to Kenny O'Donnell on the advance

arrangements.

He was

standing in a room laughing at the

antics

attas of Dave Powers, the President's companion, who in

his shorts was tumbling around on a bed. O'Donnell was

pleasant enough but wanted to know why the Congressmen

accompanying

the President had to wait at the desk in the

lobby rather than being

escorted right to their rooms. This

was a detail that hadn't occurred to me.

I went up to Wilder's room and his Empire Club owner-

friend came over with his wife and we talked and had a few

drinks and then broke up for the night.

One of the big points of the Democratic party workers

was that the President would not get enough exposure at the

breakfast the next morning, so the White House was prevailed

upon to have him walk across the street to a parking lot

where a platform had been erected. He spoke briefly and

pleasantly to the crowd, mentoning that Mrs. Kennedy was

not"organized"yet.

"It takes longer of course," he said,

"but, of course, she locks better than we do when she does 1t."

He spoke of the defense strength of our country and of

Texas's contribution to 1t. It was drizzling. Policemen in

raincoats stood on the roofs of the buildings overlooking

the parking lot.

The President went back inside the hotel and went to the

Grand Ballroom where the guests had nearly finished their

breakfasts. His entrance, as arranged by the Secret

Service, was through the kitchen so he could go directly to

the head table. I stood with the Secret Service in the

kitchen doorway. Soon Mrs. Kennedy was

standing behind us

dressed in a dusky pink suit and looking charming. She had

to stay there for a while as Mr. Buck finished the

Introductions of head table guests. There were wild cheers aB

she walked down the aisle. Mr. Buck presented the President

with a pair of boots and a Stetson -- he had asked me

beforehand if this would be appropriate and I told him

"sure."

Mr. *ennedy didn't put on the hat. He started his remarke

with a witticism about the mmp getting up and getting down

that had been going on during introductions:

"I know now why everyone in Texas, Ft. Worth, 1e so thin,

having gotten up and down about nine times. This is what

you

do every morning..."

The President's remarks were directed to the country'e

defense posture, liberally sprinkled with references to

what Ft. Worth had contributed to it including helicopters,

the new TEX planes and the World War II bombers.

He

charmed the

audience.

The enthusiasm was almost tangible in

the room.

When he finished the ovation was loud and long. He came

down the aisle to the kitchen with his wife. ka His gax

face looked young and was wreathed with smiles. Hands

stretched over the ropes and he grasped many.

About that time Congressman Albert Thomas, GSA's

Appropriation chairman, spotted me and came over and shook my

hand and said "Congratulations on what you fellows did here."

He also handed me his hatcheck and a quarter for the

hatcheck room and asked me if I would get his hat since 1t

was across the ballroom. I got it and met him out in front

of the hotel where the cars were lined up for the motorcade.

Larry O'Brien was there and placed Senator Yarborough in a

car with Mrs. Johnson. Then O'Brien stepped back and suggested

that I usher Johnson into that car when he appeared. I did

after perhaps a querulous look from the Vice President.

President and Mrs. Kennedy came out to multitudinous cheers

and climbed into their car and the motorcade moved-off.

Wilder and I went out to the airoort in his car. The

departure committee did its duty and the Presidential

plane took off. Most of the people in the departure

committee, their faces aglow, came over and

shook my hand.

There were thousands of people standing cheering behind the

barricades as the big 707 jet -- blue and white -- roared

into action and took off. Headed for Dallas. It must have

been about 11 A.M.

We went back to the Hotel Texas and I made
