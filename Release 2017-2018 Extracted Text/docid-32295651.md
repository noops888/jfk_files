RE:

DIRECTOR, FBI (92-3267)

SAC, LOS ANGELES (92-113) (P)

JOHN ROSELLI, aka

00: LOS ANGELES

Re New York letter to Los Angeles dated 8/22/66,

setting forth information concerning JOHN ROSELLI by

NY 1839-C-TE.

For more than 40 years ROSELLI has claimed he is

from Chicago and in 1936 filed a falsified delayed birth

certificate claiming birth in Chicago. In fact, he was

born in Italy; his true name is FILIPPO SACCO and he spent

his childhood in Boston, Massachusetts.

The "uncle who was an old time Mafiosa" is no

in 1930.

D'ACUNTO was from New York and lived in Chicago in the early

1900's. He was a bootlegger in Los Angeles when he and

ROSELLI became acquainted.

ROSELLI Claimed D'ACUNTO as an

uncle, but there is no relationship between the two.

The movie starlet who source stated corresponded

with ROSELLI in Atlanta Penitentiary is no doubt BERNICE

ANN FRANK, who also visited ROSELLI in prison.
