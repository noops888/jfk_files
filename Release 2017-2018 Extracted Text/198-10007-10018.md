SUB-COMMITTEE ON CUBAN SUBVERSION

30 March 1963

MEMORANDUM FOR THE INTERDEPARIMENTAL COORDINATING

COMMITTEE ON CUBAN AFFAIRS

SUBJECT:

First Progress Report, Sub-Committee on Cuban

Subversion

ENCLOSURE: Progress Achieved in Impeding Travel to Cuba

HH 50955

1. On 8 March the President approved certain actions proposed to

combat Castro-Communist subversion in Latin America. Subsequently,

the related departments and agencies undertook to execute those

decisions. This is the first report of progress achieved.

2. The three-week period covered by the report has been sufficient

to set the program in motion and to bring about the following principal

developments, which come within the purview of the sub-committee:

a. In addition to the program on control of subversive travel,

approved by the President on 8 March, four companion action pro-

grams have also been completed and forwarded for approval,

covering the movements of arms, the movement of propaganda

materials, the exchange of intelligence, and surveillance of the

Caribbean.

b. Action programs on the control of the movement of funds

for subversive purposes and the training of Latin Americans in

the United States are in preparation.

c. Preparations have been made, including the development of

a set of action objectives, for use in the ministerial meeting on

security in Managua on 3 April.

SECRET

d. Tangible progress is evident in the effort to impede and

monitor the travel of subversives through Mexico. That country,

as a result of efforts by the Department of State and the Central

GROUP- 1

Intelligence Agency, is now taking informal, though useful, steps

to regulate travel to and from Cuba, and has agreed to prohibit

the introduction by Cubana Airlines of Russian-made aircraft on

the Mexico-Havana route.

3. Specific actions taken to date by each department and agency

concerned are summarized in the enclosure. Subsequent reports will

be submitted on the first day of each month. These reports will cover

further progress achieved in the now on-going program to control

subversive travel, and in implementing decisions, as they are taken,

on the additional anti-subversion programs which have been submitted

by the sub-committee for approval.

PROGRESS ACHIEVED IN IMPEDING TRAVEL TO CUBA

1.

The Department of State has:

a. Determined that a Committee of the Council of the

Organization of American States has prepared a program

of travel control measures which will be recommended for

implementation to member governments within the next

several weeks.

b. Consulted. our Ambassador in Mexico concerning the

possibility of institution by that country of adminis-

trative procedures to delay, or otherwise make difficult,

the carrying of passengers to Cuba.

The Ambassador has

reported

that essentially all feasible control measures,

short of discontinuing Cubana flights, are being taken

by the Mexican government.

c. Determined that Mexico is now requiring that visas

for Cuba be placed securely in passports of all travelers

departing for that country, and is stamping passports to

indicate that a person has

departed or arrived from Cuba.

d. Determined that Mexico is prepared to furnish

manifests of all carriers departing for or arriving

from Cuba to Latin American countries which request them.

e. Forwarded a memorandum to the President recom-

mending that we seek action in the Council of the

Organization of American States to prohibit Latin American

ships from serving Cuba and to prohibit member countries

from granting overflight or landing rights to Soviet

aircraft.

f. Persuaded Mexico, through the good offices of

Senator Mansfield, to refuse to permit Cubana Airlines

to employ Soviet-made Ilyushin 18 aircraft on the

Havana-Mexico route.

g. Pursued arrangements for a conference at Managua

on 3 April, to be attended by representatives of the

Isthmian states and the United States, for the purpose

of considering measures to control Castro-Communist

Isthmian countries at the San Jose Conference in regard

to increasing the Caribbean surveillance effort with U.S.

training and material support, and stated U.S. willing-

ness to provide similar assistance to the countries

addressed.

radio station in Costa Rica, (2) continuing work on a

similar facillty in Nicaragua, (3) continuing negotia-

tions for installation of military

• radio facilities in

Honduras, Colombia and Ecuador, (4) commencing installa-

tion of

a submarine cable between Fort Sherman, Canal

Zone, and

Jamaica, to be completed about 1 April, (5)

leasing six channels in this cable for communication

between the U.S, and the Canal Zone, and (6) making minor

improvements in

radio facilities previously installed

in Bolivia and Guatemala.

c. Initiated a study, to be completed during the first

establishing intelligence centers at Caribbean Command

and Caribbean Sea Frontier Headquarters for rapid pro-

cessing and dissemination to countries concerned, via

the American Ambassadors, of the intelligence on

movement of subversives.

d. Directed

establishment of a U.S, military alerting

system for the Caribbean area, by which intelligence on

subversive movement can be rapidly transmitted to United

States

Ambassadors in countries concerned.

CINCARIB

has sufficient communication facilities to initiate the

system, and improvement of these facilities is continu-
