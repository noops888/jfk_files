This/letter read as follows:

"Eü. Gen. P. A. del Valle

41 Cornhill Street

Annapolis, Maryland

11 september, 1901

"When a free and sovereign people find their elected

servants in government, and their appointed advisors, following a

course of action contrary to their cath of office, destructive

of the Constitution they have sworn to uphold, and leading

relentlessiy to the loss oi their freedon and

their sovereignty,

they must perforce take the nost eflective action to restore sane,

constitutional goverment, or perish as a irce and sovereign people.

"A government thai aids and abets the enemies of ireedom

at home and abroad; recklessly spends the substance of the nation

in the purcinse of

votes and in the pursuit of a pro-conmunisi

policy; punishes patriots who dare defy the cormunist enemy they

are trying to shield, while giving positions of power and pelf

to those traitors who give aid and contort to this eneny; employs

the power of the press and all other communications media

• tO

deceive the people as to their real aims and objectives; bohaves

as though this nation vere already but a province of the illegally

Joined United Nations; is willing or unable to net the constant

¡low of crises provided by an arrogant enomy, yielding piece by

piece the entire world into their ruthless hands; shows every sign

of having yielded their powers 10 an unseen, irresponsible and

thoroughly rapacious government within the government; then even

the bread and circuses no longer can hold the people in check.

They must take matters into their own hands and force the tratiors

out of pover and oblige their elected representatives to honor

their oath of office.

"In such case there are several courses of action opan

to the people.

Political organization to vote out the traitora

and vote in the patriots is one.

Pressure by personal appeals,

petitions, lecters and telegrans is another. dut the tine comes

when the eneny, feeling strong and secure enough, shanelessly

ignores these

efforts of the people, and maxes ready to roplice

constitutional goverrment with socialistic tyranny obenly and

quickly.

Then there is yet another course of action left:

ine

organization of a poveríul, armed resistance lorce to defeat the

ains of the usurpers and bring about a return or constitutional

government.

"The formation of such a nation-wide force, under the

second article of the bill of hights, and for the legitimate

purpose of preventing a connunistic takeover of their beloved

countiy, with the toal loss of their freedom, cannot tail to

bring into being again that sovereignty which, under our form of

government, is based upon the people.

Government rules by the

consent of

the governed, and, when the governed retuse zurther to

consent to being betrayed, then beware! Those in government who

have been loyal need have no fear.

But when the day comes that

the people, in the exercise of their constitutional rights and

sovereignty once more take up arms as they did in 1776, then must

the traitore take flight.

for the wrath of a free and

people, a God learing people, againat atheistic tyronis can be

terrible and swiit.

Ipray to cod that courses one and two will

guilloe, but id they do not, then I pray to God that this last

instrumentality be given His grace to discharge our obligation to

defend those sacred rights He, and He alone, gave unto us."

"I was born June 24, 1938, Bonham, Texas. I completed

eighth grade in school.

"On June 20, 1963, I was arrested by the Garland, Texas,

police for assaulting my wife, Pauline Robinson. I was arrested

at 9:35 AM, and released at 2:00 PM. I later learned from my

halt hrother Donald Kaiser that at about 1:30 Pil, two Garland

police officers and one Garland detective, names unknown, accompanied

my wife to our residence at 200 Second aves, Garland, Texas.

"The Garland Police then searched my office and removed

some of my literature I had concerning racial integration

and the

Jewish conspiracy.

They also took ny membership list for the

National States Rights Party. I am the organizer for the National

States Rights Party in the Dallas, Texas, area.

"My office is a separate building behind my house. The

National States Rights Party rents this office from me for one

dollar a month.

My wife had no right to let the police search

this office as it was not under her control. My nembership list

was returned, but they kept my literature.

They also took pictures

of my office and some of the signs i had.

"I feel that my civil rights have been violated because

the Garland Police searched the office of National States Rights

Party, of which I am the head in the Dallas area, without my consent.
