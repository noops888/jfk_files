associated with ALFX SHONDORXBIRNS In the numbers business.

He added that the numbers business in Cleveland is operated

almost exclusively by Negroes, except for the clearing-

house layoff which has been handled by BIRNS.

He stated

that in his op the outeroes would not stand still for

could not afford 1t.

He added that another reason, in his.

opinion, "the outfit" Is not in the numbers

business in

Cleveland is the fact that they do not need it and they do

not want the headaches it would cause since apparently

JOHN T. SCALISH, through his interest in the Desert Inn

In Las Vegas, gets enough to take care of himself and his

associates In Cleveland without resorting to the numbers

business.

With regard to TONY and JIMMY LA FATCH, who he

feels are definitely members of "the outfit" in Akron,

in the. City of Akron and today probably exert some control

over bookmaking in that city.
