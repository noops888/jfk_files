should be noted that

these were

distributed not only by Russian War Relief Association but by the Communist

Party as well. [copies of these were obtained by Canfidential National De-

fense Informant I.A. #150, a representative number being retained in this

file.

The identity of the aforementioned union leader has not been

ascertained; however, JIM BURFORD, a known Comnunist whose Communist Party

book number can be obtained from Confidential National Defense Informant

LoA. #3, represented the CIO has head of the Russian War Relief Committee

of the CIO at the rally on March 24, 1942.

Further, as will be shown sub-

sequently in this report, BURFORD was active, with DIMITRI TIOMKIN in the

Russian War Relief office in organizing this rally. Further investigation

is being made through Confidential National Defense Informant I.A. #2 in

an attempt to identify this union leader.

On March 10, 1942 DIMITRI TIOMKIN and BIBERMAN held a conference

and TIOMKIN advised BIBERMAN that JANE and he had just called New York to

determine through the Russian War Relief offices there if it would be pos-

sible to get Madame LITVINOV or DOROTHY THOMPSON for the rally. DIMITRI

stated that she had talked to MORRIS (general administrator of Russian War

Relief in New York) and MORRIS advised sending a telegram to Madame LITVINOV

with many prominent names on it and maybe she would come.

TIOMKIN stated

that he had also talked with EDWARD CARTER, whom, he stated, had pneumonia

and was dangerously illo

CARTER had told JANE, TIOMKIN stated, that TIOKIN

was the person who could induce Madame LITVINOV to come if anyone could.

DIMITRI then told BIBERMAN that he and JANE had tried to call someone, 'ap-

parently Madame LITVINOV, "But that she would not be in until tomorrow.

morning".

(e)u)

DIMITRI also stated that DAVID FARIES, president of the Russian

War Relief Association of Southern California, had promised to take the

responsibility. to get the big names and to send Madame LIVINOV a telegram.

BIBERMAN then asked DIMITRI what he was doing about the letters,

apparently referring to letters written to prominent people encouraging

them to donate to this campaign. DIMITRI told him that everything was go-

ing fine and that HARRY BENNETT, Russian War Relief publicity director, was

attempting to get in the studio and also planning a radio program. BIBER-

MAN told TIOMKIN that the fact that CARTER and MORRIS were so enthusiastic

should give DIMITRI a great deal of encouragement. DIMITRI further advised

HERBERT that JANE was attempting to plan a reception for a certain lady,

who apparently is rather well respected; and after some lengthy conversa-

tion with Mrs. RATHBORNE to have her as hostess or to act in some capacity

for this event; however, this informant was unable to obtain sufficient

information concerning

this proposed reception: (S(4)

On the same date DIMITRI was again in contact with BIBERMAN and

advised that BORIS INGSTER, JANE MADE, MR, ARNOLD and PARTES had held * (C(U

BIBERMAN, in further consultations with

HARRIS, stated that they" think

that PARLE'S book is the best. ' "They" undoubtedly refers to the Russian

Consulate at Los Angeles, with whom it is evident BIBERMAN discussed the

matter prior to referring HARRIS to the proper book.

Hence it would ap

pear that at least in this particular instance BIBERMAN was the go-between

in procuring fussian propaganda for a script, which will probably be pro-

duced as a movie. Should BIBERMAN be further affiliated in either procür-

ing other background for this proposed script or should he in any way be

During the period of this report GALE SONDERGAARD had been con-

tacted by members of two Communist front organizations and invited to lec-

ture to them. On March 1, 1942 FREDA FONTIVITZ. (phonetic), telephone

CHArleston 6-6594, contacted HERBERT BIBERMAN and advised him that she re-

presented the Hollywood Womens Council and wanted CALE to give a lecture

entitled women in Defense" in one of the series of chain luncheons which

was to be held the following Saturday at 2:00 P.M. At this meeting, FONTI-

VITZ stated, one hundred and fifty ladies would be present, including four

of the Russian medical aides.

GALE later recontacted FONTIVITZ and advised

she could not make a personal appearance at this meetings stating she had

a first aid class at the same hour on saturday (e)U)

Again on March 2,

~ 1942, HANNA SCHWARTZ contacted CALE and asked

her if she would speak at a women's mass meeting on Brooklyn Avenue on

March 8. HANNA advised CALE that there would be a number of IWO clubs

present and several other organizations., She asked GALE to speak on the

subject of "Women's place in the World".

GALE advised HANNA that she would

check her schedule to see if she could make this appearance and requested

HANNA to contact her later on the same day; however, when HANNA recontacted

GALE, GALE stated she had talked to her husband and "It seems we are occu-

pied that evening so I can't accept the invitation." U

The file entitled COMMUNIST PARTY, LOS ANGELES AREA", number

100-1763, reflects that one HANNA SCHWARTZ is

the wife of LOUIS SCHWARTZ,

president of the Newsboys Union - CIO, who is prominently connected with the

Communist Party in Los Angeles.

Confidential National Defense Informant

L.A. #150, whose identity has been made known to the Bureau, has advised

this office that HANNA SCHWARTZ is also an active member of the Los Angeles

Communist Party and a close friend of PETTIS FERRY, chairman of the Los

Angeles County Communist Party. She is also a member of the Executive

Committee of the Los Angeles Auxiliary Council of the CIO and is 'ä member

of the committee of the Consumers Union and also very active in the American

Peace Mobilization.

(E)(U)

Attention is

invited to the fact that this HANNA SCHWARTZ may be

the one who consulted with GALE SONDERGAARD and it is further noted that

BIBERMAN consulted with CALE before she gave a final decision in the mat

ter, lending credence to the belief that BIBERMAN wishes not only himself

but his wife to remain in the background of known Communist contacts and

organizations. GALE SONDERGAARD is still active in the Womens Ambulance

Defense Corps, and a full page of pictures of GALE, including one in

her WADO uniform, appeared in the lios Angeles Evening Herald and Express

March 5, 1942. Two of these full length pictures are being retained in

the file for identification purposes.

Also during the period of this report it has come to the

attention of the Los Angeles Office that GALE SONDERGAARD was one of

many people from the movie industry who sent telegrams to the president

of Mexico objecting to his proposed deportation of several Spanish chil-

dren between the ages of fifteen and twenty-one. The People's World

described these Spaniards as being anti-Fascist and conducted a cam-

paign urging American citizens to wire the president of Mexico in their

Further, Confidential National Defense Informant L.A: #1357

advised the writer that ED ROBBIN, known Communist member and sponsor

of the World Forum, on March 29, 1942, publicly urged the audience at

the World Forum to direct "such terms of intercession to the president

of Mexico on behalf of these anti-Fascist people", The fact that GALE

SONDERGAARD also sent one reflects that in this one instance, at least,

ahe has followed the so-called Gommunist Party Line (e)(Li)

It is further interesting to note in this connection that the

People's World of April 5, 1942 reflects that the president of Mexico

granted these Spanish deportees one year of grace for their final depor

tation.

During the past month JOHN HOWARD LAWSON has secured a posi-

tion as writer for CECIL B. DeMILLE at a Hollywood studio.

Temporary

Confidential National Defense Informant L.A. #3 stated that LAWSON leaves

his home every morning at approximately 9:30 A.M. and reappears at ap-

proximately 4:30 or 5:00 P.M. During this pertinent period, also, this

informant has procured a copy of the "Soviet Power" written by the Dean

of Conterbury and a pamphlet entitled "Information Bulletin", published

by the Embassy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics celebrating the

twenty-fourth anniversary of the "Great Qctober Socialist Revolution",

In this pamphlet are various messages sent to SIALIN by American people,

congratulating him on the twenty-fourth anniversary of the Revolution.

Included in this booklet are messages from THEODORE DREISER, WALTER

DURANTY, JOSEPH CURRAN, FRANZ BOAS, UPTON SINCLAIR, and also PETTIS

PERRY,

who is described therein as "Chairman Soviet Anniversary meeting in Los

Angeles", but who is known to the los Angeles Office and the Bureau as

chairman of the Los Angeles County Connunist Party.

Concerning the magazine "Soviet Power", attention is invited

to the fact that the Communist Party in Los Angeles distributed over

seventy thousand copies in this area alone and has stated at their meet-

ings that "Comrades should see to it that the public receives this publi-

cation. " Both

of these publications are being retained in the file of this

case.
