the

Naval RU on graduation in 1949; that it was four years'

and that Locause he failed a state examination he

was graduated later,

in 1950; that it was of five years'

his departure from the Institute.

rosarikn's Information

SHUBIN was a native of California of Russian

traction, a Russian speaker, and

a university professor

in New Yori City.

SHUBIN, who nad visited the soviet

Union twice before, visited thi Soviet Union in 1953

or 1959, while NOSENKO was serving his first tour of

duty in

the Seventh Department.

At that time, SHUBIN

was the. target of Seventh

Departnent case officcr

A.A. VETLIISKIY, NOSENKO heard later that SHUBI!! was'

placed under surveillance, and hen the KGB surveillance

observed SHUBiN as a passengor in a Ministry of Dofense

automobile,

the GRU was

asked about the Anerican.

"They

very

furtively said that they were interested in him,"

from which the iGb concludud that SHUBIN was a GRU agent.

In 1962 (sic) NOSEUKO was roviewing a list of foreign

visitors to the Sovict Union and he noted SHUBIN's name

and

rocalled his earlier identification as a GRU agent.

NOSENKO hirself telephoned

GRJ General

SOKOLOV's office

and informed SOKOLOV of SHUBIN's presence (or, according

to another version, SokOLOV's office was advised by

others).

SOKOLOV's office

eventually apologized for

having failed carlier to notify the KGB of the GRU's

interest in SHUBIN.

Comment:

a sensitive source

Earlier,

#identified an

agent apparently Identical with SHUBIN

and FBI sources reported SHUBIN's travel

to the USSR in

summer 1961 and in

September 1963.

SHUBIN had no valid U.S. passport

between 1940 and June 1961; if he visited

the Soviet Union during that period it was

not as an American tourist under his true

name.

Consequently, he could not then have

been the tourist target of the Seventh

Department case officer, as NOSENKO claimed.

If NOSENKO erred, and actually was referring

to SHUBIN's visit in 1961, there is a further

contradiction: NOSENKO could not have

noticed his name while reviewing tourist

lists in the Seventh Department, because

he claims he was in the American Department

at the time.

Evon if HOSENKO learned of the operations as

elements other than the Sevent:: Deprtment), they are atypical

with respect to HOSElKO's oun description of Seventh Depar=-

They do not accurately characterize, as

NOSENKO claims, KGB counterirtelligence operations against

tourists, and thus do not substantiate his Seventh Department

service.

NOSENKO's explanations for his assignment to

Geneva in 1964 äre no more plausible than

for his carlicr

assignment there in 1962.

MOSENKO has asserted that he was

not a lieutenant colonel
