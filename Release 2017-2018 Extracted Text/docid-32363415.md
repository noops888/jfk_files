TERMINATION SECRECY AGREEMENT

1. I acknowledge that by virtue of my duties I have been exposed to or the recipient

of classified information, which, in itself, or by the implications drawn from it, is highly sen-

sitive and its unauthorized disclosure or negligent handling could adversely affect the interests

of the United States. I am aware that the unauthorized disclosure of classified information

is prohibited by the Espionage Laws (18 U.S.C., Sections 793, 794 and 798) and that a vi-

olation of these laws may subject me to prosecution by the U. S. Government.

2. I hereby reaffirm my pledge that I will never publish or reveal by any means such

information. I agree further that I do not now, nor will I ever, possess any right, interest,

title or claim whatsoever to such information.

I recognize the full and vested property right

of the United States in such matters.

3. I certify that I have surrendered and no longer have in my possession or custody any

classified information or material acquired as a result of this association.

4. I further acknowledge and agree that I have a continuing individual responsibility

to the United States Government for the protection of such information and that the termina-

tion from this relationship with my employer and/or the United States Government does not

relieve me of my obligations under this oath or any other previously executed Secrecy Agree-

ments.

I understand that I will not be relieved of these obligations except when specifically

advised in writing by the sponsoring activity of the U. S. Government.

5. I understand that this oath may be retained by the U. S. Government for its future

use in any manner within the scope of this oath.

6. I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion

and in the absence of duress.
