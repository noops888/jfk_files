Dear Bert:

With reference to your letter of June 25 requesting our assistance in

the effort to provide for Church Committee access to documents in the

Presidential Library, I did, after speaking with you, speak also to Dr.

Reed. Dr. Reed confirms that he has been in touch with Mr. Wilderotter,

Associate Counsel to the President, and that appropriate arrangements

have been made. If we can be of assistance, we of course would be glad

to do so.

Yours very truly,

Gail

Richard H. Lansdale
