Re Milwaukee letter to Springfield 10/23/64; Springfield airtel

to Milwaukee 11/5/64; Springfield airtel to the Bureau and

MILwaukee 11/10/04.

On 11/10/64 MI 623-C-TE was re-interviewed by SA RICHARD Ca

Chatoon concerning the la Cosa Nostra family in Springfielo

and was ared to consider the possibility of going to Springfield

to renew contacts there. Informant said that he would make

plans sometime in the relatively near future to drive to

Springfield.

He sald that he had a suitable reason, Involving

relatives of his wife, and that while in Springfield it would

be incumbent upon him

to "check in" with the boss of La Cosa

Nostra in Springfield - whom he assumes to be FRANK ZITO.

least ZITO was last known to informant as the boss there.

Informant said that he would thus try to find out something

about the current situation in Springfield.

Springfield's attention is again directed to the caution set

out in Milwaukee letter to Springfield dated 10/23/64

should be used only on Administrative Pages for the sake or

Intormant's security.

This caution now seems doubly important

because,

it intormant goes to Springfield personally, and

thereafter there is any discussion of actual membership in Lo

Cosa Nostra outside the FBI,

informant may be subject to suspi-

cion by the Springfield family.

on 11/10/64 informant also stated that insofar as he could

recall he had furnished all the information he had about the

La Cosa Nostra set-up in Springfield.

He said that he had

not seen FRANK ZITO since the time of the Incident previously

described (about 12 years ago) when the Milwaukee ICN family

was to "hit" one of ZITO's enemies.

Informant said the name

JAMES DE ROSA, suggested by Springfield, meant nothing to him,

but it was probably not the name of the Intended victin.

Informant also said he hadn't seen TONY ZITO since prior to the

above incident nor had he seen NICK CAMPO in 20-25 years.

However, he saw (FNU) RUFFINO in Milwaukee about eight years

ago.

Informant said RUFFINO was a good friend of NICK FUCARINO

of Milwaukee (who is also an ICN member) •

9. Every

ke Buairtel to springtield, 10-28-64

The following is in response to re Buairtel which

requested the Springfield Office to advise the Bureau as to

Springfield's plans to maintain a thorough and continuing project

to fully develop investigation of the La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

in the Springfield Division.

The material previously furnished by the Milwaukee

Office emanating from MI 623-C-TE has been reviewed which

resulted in the following 1l point program which has been

instituted:

1. Inasmuch as MI 623-C-TE advised that TONY ZITO

is a member of the Springfield "family" of LCN, a new 92 case

has been opened on ANTHONY ZITO to determine his actual

association with the Springfield "family" and, if verified,

Steps will be taken to penetrate this "family" for appropriate

coverage.

2. As MI 623-C-TE advised that one NICK CAMPO was

the underboss of the Springfield "family" of LCN, immediate

investigation was condueted to identify NICK CAMPO and

consequently a new 92 case has been opened on one DOMINIC CAMPO

who operates a concession stand in the basement of the State

House, state ot illinois, for the purpose of determining his

association with the Springfield "family" of LCN.

3. In a recent contact with MI 623-C-TE, he advised

that one (ENU) RUFFINO was a member of the St. Louis "family"

of LCN, however, runs and operates a business in the Springfield

Division near Scott Air Force Base. As a result of this, a

new sa case has been opened on this individual to fully identity

him and to determine if he has any actual connection with LCN.

4.

With regard to the LCN, this office is conducting

immediate and intensive investigation regarding FRANK ZITO

and others and their place of business known as the Modern

Distributing Company, to determine whether or not technical

coverage of these individuals and place of business is deemed

feasible and, if so, will request the Bureau for proper

authority to institute this technical coverage.

5. This office is also instituting a program whereby

a target will be selected for the development of a TE informant

capable of penetrating and furnishing information regarding the

Springfield "family" of LCN.

6. Agents assigned to this office have been requested

to develop a sufficient number of informants who may be knowl-

edgable of LCN matters and association of ZITO and others with

regara to the LCN.

7. Additionally, this office has undertaken a

program whereby a new 92 file will be opened on any individual

identified as a close associate of FRANK ZITO, ANTHONY ZITO,

DOMINIC CAMPO or others identified in the future.

This office has already undertaken the coordination

of investigation being conducted by this division with the

Milwaukee Division so that MI 623-C-TE can be utilized to the

best advantage in furnishing recent and up-to-date information
