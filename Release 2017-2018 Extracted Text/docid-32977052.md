The primary puzpose of the meeting was to brief the President in depth about

some of the basic Cubar issues. Essentially, the discussion described where

we have been since Jaruary, 1963, where we are now, and where we can go.

(An outlinc, which was prepared for the discussion is attached.)

The group agreed that this is not an casy problem; Mr. Ball said that our

allies have always been reluctant to interfere with private traders and have

always had a diffcrent view of Free World/Bloc trade than we have had.

Nevertheless, it was also agreed that we should intensify our cfforts and that

there are still things we can do. First, Mr. Crimmins noted that we could

consider ways in which the new amendment to the Foreign Assistance Author-

ization Act (prevents assistance to any country whose planes or ships carry

commodities to Cuba) can be used to reinforce our economic denial program.

Second, Mr. Ball said that the question of Canadian trade in sensitive items

would be taken up with the Canadian Minister of Economics and Trade on

December 20; later, Mr. Ball will talk to other appropriate Free World gov-

ernments also. Third, the President directed that the agencies prepare a

detailed memorandum (including the names of companies and commodities in-

volved in Free World trade with Cuba) which, inter alia, will be useful for his

forthcoming talks with Prime Ministers Home and Pearson.

only somewhat better than 50-50. Second, if the raiders get caught, they will

of conclusions from the first acts of President Johnson. An attack on a big

Cuban target could give Castro important leverage in his negotiations for more

Sovict aid.

General Wheeler thought that, to improve the chance of success, we might want

to ty to hit the Matanzas power plant from the air; it should be noted that there

have already been some free-lance raids over Cuba. Alexis Johnson pointed out

that an ais strike might cause retaliation against one of our U-2 flights.

In response to a question, Secretary Nance ndicated that he was in favor of an

attack on Matanzas.

It was decided that there will be no air of ground attack on the Matanzas power

plant at this time, primarily because of its high probability of failure and be-

cause of the Soviet dimension. However, it was agreed, in principle, that low-

risk sabotage efforts could go forward along with the plaru.ing necessary to

develop an air strike capability.

(1) Mr. Fitzgeraid described CLA's program in aiding to autonomous

Cuban exile groups, which will be operating from outside the U.S. One group,

which is headed by Manuel Artime, will start operating out of Costa Rica and

Nicaragua in February; the other group is headed by Manolo Ray who is some-

what to the left of Artime, but probably has the best following within Cuba. Both

of these groups will conduct externally mounted raids on Cuba, and will send

teams inside Cuba to conduct internal sabotage and to establish contact with dis-

sidents Mr. Fitzgerald added that there are some disadvantages in these oper -

ation -- the groups aren't trained by CLA and they operate outside of CIA control.

But chere are advantages too -- they operate from outside United States territory

and we will have sclatively little trouble denying U,S. association with the

2.

Mr. Bundy gave a very quick briefing on some other aspects of the current

Cuban situation. (The group paused to read the attached CLA situation brief.)

(a) With respect to Soviet/Cuban military strength on the island, Mr.

Bundy noted that one of our primary objcctives is to ensure that there is no

reintroduction of offensive missiles. The camera is our best inspector and,

sg

far as we know, there are no offensive missiles now in Cuba. Mr. Bundy added

that we are concerned about the transfer of SAM control to the Cubans in about

mid-1964, and we will have to watch this development carefully. As for the

Soviet troops, the general consensus of the group was that the big withdrawals

are over and that, from here on, the withdrawals will proceed more slowly.

(b) Mr. Bundy noted, in passing, our anti-subversion efforts. The key to

the problem is to build up the will and capabilities of the Latin American

countries to counter the threat. Our efforts in the field of controlling travel

between Letin America and Cuba are also important.

(c) M=. Bundy described briefly the very tenuous, sensitive, and marginal

contacts we have established with Castro himself. The initiative is on Castro's

part and we aze essentially faced with a decision as to whether or not we are

prepared to listen to waat Castro has to say. Mr. Ball noted that such U.S. /

Cuban contacts could tave an unsettling effect on Soviet/ Cuban relations.

attacks, usleaching of exales (allowing thera to use

which have distinct avantages but which are similar in that they all tend to

raise the noise-level, Low level flights, for example, would provide us with

more intelligence and would irritate and harass Castro. At the same time, they

could precipitate the sbooting down of a te

(b) Mr. Bundy said that we can take further unilateral shipping measures

-- e-g. close ports and deny U.S. -financed commodities to lines engaged in

Frce World shipping to Cuba. He noted, however, that we have found through

pest experience that bilatoral measures are more effective in reducing Free

World shipping to Cuba. At the säme time, we should not deceive ourselves.

We should recognize that the Soviets arc capable of handling all Cuba's

shipping needs even if we are able to climinate Free World shipping to Cuba.

(c) Mr. Bundy said that the President could make a public statement in

the near future, taking a more vigorous line than we have in the past. He noted

that in his November 18 speech, President Kennedy made two points about Cuba

-- the first was designed to encourage anti-Castro elements within Cuba to

revolt, and the second was to indicate that we would not permit another Cuba in

the Hemisphere.

(d) Bilaterally there are possibilities of increasing our pressures against

Free World trade to Cuba. Spain should be a high priority target.

NOTE: At this point the President left the room and there was a brief discussion

about the exiles in Florida. Mi. Crinmins said that resettlement remains our

basic policy. It is true that the exiles feel that the pressure for their resettle-

meat is intense. In fact, it is no more intense now than it has been for some time.

5. On the President's return to the room, Mr. Bundy introduced the subject of

the discovery in Verezuela of the Cuban arms cache.

(a) Mr. Heims gave a graphic presentation of the link between the arms

cache and a plot to upset the elections in Caracas.

(b) Mr. Martin explained the status of the OAS investigation of the arms

cache.

The evidence is convincing in showing that the arms were from Cuba.

The OAS investigating team is still working on its report. Hopefully, it will be

able to tie the arms cache into a general plot to subvert Venezuela. The report

should be ready by about January 10.

(6) Mi. Bundy described the types of action we can hope to get in the OAS

as a result of the discovery of the arms cache. The most interesting is the

surveillance action where we have essentially two basic choices -- we may want

to push for a system which involves search and seizure of Cuban vessels on the

bigh seas; this implies the possible use of force.

Or we can push for a system

involving the search and seizure of Cuban véssels in territorial waters; this

evades the issue of force. Mr. Bundy added that it is still too early to know

how far the Latin Americans will go in support of force against Castro. We

have put out feclers.

6. Mr. Bundy brought up the problem of lifting travel restrictions on Americans

who wish to go to Cuba. Mi. Ball noted that a great number of students want to

go down to Cuba during the Christmas holidays and that Justice Department

recommends that we lift our travel restrictions. If we don't, we will probably

be obliged to put many of the students in jail when they return; this will be

embarrassing. M.. Ball addcd that the State Department is tentatively opposed

to lifting the travel restrictions bocause of the effect it will have on Latin

American countries. We have been trying to get the Latin Americans to impose

restrictions on travel to Cuba; if we lift our own restrictions, our position will

be considerably weakened. Mr. Ball said that he would be meeting with the

Attorney General later in the day to talk about the subject.

Tentatively, the President indicated that he favored maintaining the travel

restrictions and a policy of selective prosecution.
