that the voice on the both of these recordings sounded like

the anonymous caller who has previously contacted the

BENJOCHEA residence and he still believed that this is the

voice of JOSE RICARDO GARCIGA. BENJOGHEA, SR., who has never

talked to the extortionist by telephone, expressed the

opinion that the voice sounds like that of GARCIGA, whom he

has talked to in person.

On 1/22/65 the Miami Office eent to the FBI

Laboratory typewritten specimen obtaired on 1/15/65 by

MM 535-S, who went to the, Abbey Clinic to consult Dr. BOSCH

as a patient for a foot ailment.' He observod BOSChi type

this specimen on ans old Underwood typewritur. a non-

professional comparison of this specimen with the extortion

letter which was sent to the home of MINDOZA redlects great

similarity, and it is hoped that this typermiter may be

identified

as being the one used in the MaNDozA Letter !

CONTEMPLATED INVESTIGATION

Miami will conduct investigation to identify the..

anonymous caller and issattempting to bring this case to anoth

"payoff". Miami will also attempt to catch subjects in the

act of making a telephone call to one of the victims, if

possible.

Efforts will continue to obtain specimens from

typewriters in possession of subjects and suspects.

Voice

recordings obtained from IGLESIAS will be played back to

additional victims and witnesses for identisication purposes.
