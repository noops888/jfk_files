Investigation has developed that the COTRONI

Brothers have controlled or played a major role in direct-

ing all major criminal activities in the Montreal area.

Previous reports have identified the members of the

COTRONI organization.

In March of 1966, PETER A. MAGADDINO and DOMINIC

ROMEO were reportedly in touch with VINCENT COTRONI and

PAUL VIOLI in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.

On November 28, 1966, the Montreal Police Depart-

ment, Montreal, Quebec,

Canada, arrested WILLIAM BONANNO,

also

known as

Salvatore Vincent Bonanno, the son of JOE

BONANNO, PATRICK and VITO DE FILIPPO, LOUIS GRECO, PETEI

VOTARO, CARL SIMARI and PETER JOSEPH MAGADDINO, a

cousin

Of STEVE MAGADDINO who had been missing from his residence

on Grand Island, New York, for several years. These indi-

viduals refused

to furnish any information as to the purpose

of their being in Canada. They were all subsequently

deported from Canada.

On January 15, 1967, BU T-14 advised that VINCENT

COTRONI of Montreal, Quebec, had in recent days been en-

gaged in a number of meetings at Montreal. The informant

was of the opinion that this indicated some type of a meeting

in the United States in the near future, which meeting would

probably be attended by COTRONI, who had left Montreal for

an unknown destination.

According to informant, there is some indication

that COTRONI had been in difficulty with the "Magaddino

Family" in Buffalo, New York, and there have been efforts

on the part of COTRONI to negotiate some sort of settlement

It was suggested at one

time that corroNt, himself, might travel to the Unite

States but when he apparently refused to do so, PAUL VIOLI

vas suggested as a possible intermidiary. VIOLi, however.

according to BU T-14, refused to travel to the Unite

States when assurances as to his safety were apparently

not forthcoming.

According

the "Bonanno Group, "to BU I-14, COTRONI is a member of

and there is speculation that this

at ta can "buy the hatchet" by the

LA COSA NOSTRA

INTERNAL DISSENSION

In December of 1966, information was received

from BU T-15 to the effect that PETER JOSEPH MAGADDINO

etse t that

had visited with JOSEPH BONANNO apparently to act as an

intermidiary between BONANNO and STEVE MAGADDINO. It was

conjectured that BONANNO was attempting to regain control

of his former "Family" of ICN and have it sanctioned by

the Commission through STEVE MAGADDINO.

On October 20, 1966, BU T-16 advised that SAM

PIERI continues to gain papularity with "the organization."

Informant stated that PIERI is more congenial and better

able to solve the differences of the group then FRED

RANDACCIO." It was the informant's opinion that if any-

thing happened to STEVE MAGADDINO in the near future,

PIERI would stand a good chance of being elevated in

organization through some of the members.

On August 25, 1967, BU T-4 advised that leader-

• ship in the LCN is still vested in STEVE MAGADDINO and

a sad that®

that FRED RANDACCIO is next in line to assume command ir

the "Magaddino Family'

as soon as his current legal dif-

ficulties are resolved.

On May 8, 1967, Buffalo City Police conducted

a raid on a meeting being held at Panaro's Lounge, Buffalo,

Among those arrested was FRED G. RANDACCIO.
