No information has been received to date to the

or is endeavoring to obtain control or direction of it. LNO

knowledge of this urganization 15(4)

Since referenced New Orleans letter and letterhead

memorandum to the Bureau, dated 5/2/63, the New. Orleans

Council for Peaceful Alternatives (NOCPA) gathered at Audubon

Park, on 5/5/63, for the purpose of parading from Audubon

Park

to Jackson

Avenue along St. Charles Avenue.

When it

was pointed out to the Chairman

by the NOPD that their permit

to parade was for 5/3/63, when none of their members appeared,

the group disbanded.

Present at the time at Audubon Park

were a number of "right wing or conservative group" persons

who were going to parade in opposition

to the NOCPA. No

incidents happened at this time.

The NOCPA obtained a permit to parade on 5/19/63

from Pine Street to Jackson Avenue on St. Charles Avenue.

They so paraded. The group consisted of about 40 persons

counting children and drew little attention. A group of

opposition persons tried to parade, but were denied the

privilege since they had no permit.

This group then drove

a few blocks ahead of the parade, got out and stood on a

corner with their signs and an American Flag until the NOCPA

group passed. This procedure was repeated to the end of the

parade.
