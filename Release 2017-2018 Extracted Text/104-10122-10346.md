meet Sukarso, but due to unfortunate timing that had him leaving

his country on official business, she bad little time to cultivate him;

consequently, the purpose of the mission was not fulfilled. I should

be noted that Sukarno took sufficient notice of her that during 2a 23-

official visit to the United States in June 1959, he expressed a strong

desire to seo her and did.

17. The last lown contact illishad with the Agancy was in

the form of a telsphona call on 12 April 1961 whan she called on the

sterile line and talked to Hugh Tovar, who she knew as Georgs Fienry.

She advised that Sister asked her to give a party for Presi-

dent Sukarzo who would be in Los Angeles on 21 April 1961. She

wanted to know whether Henry's people were interested in sponsor-

ing this party. A negative response was given.

the present time, but presumably she is still in the Los Angal's
