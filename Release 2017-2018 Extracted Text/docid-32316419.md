MODESTO LOQUASTO: The informant did not know

with certainty

that LOQUASTO was

a member; however, he is

a bodyguard of RUSSELL BUFALINO, and he would assume he

was a member.

NICK ALAIMO:

Is a close associate of RUSSELL

BUFALINO in the dress factory business.

The informant

believed that he was a member butwas not positive.

Confidential Informant I-3 on January 4, 1954,

furnished substantially the same information as to the

leadership of the Mafia in the Pittston area.

On April 23, 1958, Confidential Informant I-3

advised SA NOAH R. BASS that DOMINIC ALAIMO and JAMES OSTICCO

are

controlled by RUSSELL BUFALINO and are the "strongarm

men" of the Mafia, although ALAIMO is not too active as a

strongarm man.

On June 19, 1958, Confidential Informant I-9 ad-

vised that he would

consider ALAIMO as the number one man

under RUSSELL BUFALINO in the organization, even though

ALAIMO does not associate socially with BUFALINO. He further

advised that he knew of no present illegal activities of the

subject.

On March 28, 1958, Confidential Informant T=11

advised SA FRANK W. MULDERIG ne is convincea the purpose

f the meeting at Apalachin, N. Y., on November 14,

1957,

at the home of JOSEPH BARBARA was to take control of the

women's garment industry. He said that LEONARD BLANDINA,

who is a partner of ANGELO SCIANDRA in S & B Sewing Machine

Company which is located in the plant owned by SCIANDRA on

South Main Street, Pittston, Pa., told him that was the

purpose of the meeting, and further, that on other occasions,

he heard NICK ALAIMO and SAMMY DI BELLA, associates of

RUSSELL BUFALINO, discussing the purpose of the meeting

and they, too, in their conversation said that was the pur-

pose of the meeting.

I-Il said the only one who told him directly

the purpose of the meeting was LEONARD BLANDINA, but on

three other occasions he overheard conversations indicat-

ing the above was the purpose of the meeting, and BLANDINA

did not institute or commence such conversations but they

were conversations by ALAIMO and DI BELLA.
