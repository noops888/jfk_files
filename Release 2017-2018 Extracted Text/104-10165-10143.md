This letter 1s prompted by letter of even date

2. You wili recall trat some montics ago I protested

the fact that you had transferred

a staggeringly large advance

to our books ageinst henry Hyce, a great fert of maich nad been

outstanding for nearly two years.

I sas reluctant at trat

snould be extremeiy scrupulous in seeping outstanaing acvances

to an absolute minimur aso nost certainty in liniting the

lengto of time over nico tney may be carried.

3o During the past two or three montos Caserta has

transferred

several otner accounts to my orfice sone oi which!

ware long standing on Casertals books and in every case these

transfers have been picked up with reluctance.

I shouia like

to point out that my cilice, nitn à tota, personnel of 14

people,

We are hard pressed to keep our normal

business functioning

control tae problems asica coniront us nita tre estabilsnent

Particularly curing

the past six

weeks we have been worsing under terrific pressure because of

the constant saliting of personnel from Paris to london to

Weshington, Biebrich, and other points.

in view of the fact

that te have made every efiore to close out ail outstending

accounts as quicily as possible in orcer that the reduetion

According to the instructions contained in your

6336.19.2. This Includes a L275.0.0 deposit with your ofíice

These transfers went through our books in july.

We will con-

tinue to deposit 661.19.ª to Miss Taylor's account on th: last

day of each month until further notice.

2. In your letter of 27 May, you notifled us of travel

advances amounting to 140.0.0 to embers oì the "Quail group.

Since you specifically listed the itens as advances, we

nave

deducted them fror Salary payments made here. • The members. of

the group insist that these payments were for expenses incurred,

and that no repayment was to be made.

We are Inclosing a

copy of a staterent by one of the members of the group. Can you

straighten this matter out for us?

Your menoranoun of June ll

gave us the intormasion that one of the nesters of the group

had been short changed in the amcunt of 1l.e.O, out we can do

nothing about crediting the account of the proper individual

until we know nis name.

If these items are to be considered

as expenses,

we see no reason why they should be transferred

to us,

since me do not have the receipts on any of these items,

nor were the expenses incurred in our theater.

SUBJECT: Transfer of SO Accounts

1. In reply to your letter of 26 June, we did, as you

office the sum of 1,400,000 French

rIencs on our Noverber 1944 redort for the SPOCUS Account

To imply frow that, however, that the operation was in any way

56333

our responsibility or that me had any mowledge of it is to

overlock entirely the circu-stances under which the transfer

•TaS

made.

This transfer originated with the 7th Army, which,

until that month, had been under your control. All funds

are tre territories the excee control.

and all expenses incurred on it

office accepted the transfer of Noverber, and we did not even

know, the nature o! the operation,

the project originated:

with Jow, was

on 'ith Army. books when trey came under our entrol,

and was returned to you without apparent objection.

3.

To have credited us with knowing, when we made the

¿transfer,

that "the coment Teams hit the ground they mere the

responsibility of the FTO for debriefing and bandling" is to

have grented us extraordinary prescience.

A much more practical

way of handling the transaction would have been for you to have

transferred the. advances made in Algiers to us as they were nade,

1f, es you say in Paragrayn o,

"these teams went through Algiers

and that we lost jurisdiction over thes the minute they hit the

soil of Prence."

In that way London could have had some know-

ledge of the responsibilities which you claim are. ours.

Apparently I must repeat that the Jedburgh financing

for your theater was not handled through my office and none of

the arrangements effecting sich operation were ever discussed

Therefore, despite what Colonel Glavin says with

respect to the responsibility of this theater'is and

the fact stil1

rerains that

the entire operation financially

always

has been vours.

Fith respect to the close. of your paragraph 6

asting that I inform you how I decide to handle this, because

you are closing your theater,

I.can only state that the decision

1s one which is autonatic, and the one originally taken. In

effect it is your problem and the final accounting and the closing

out of the secount is for you to handle:

That

you will not

statement invade de the ract that assase your resen foilsts

would seen a rather kroed

as Special Funds Officer for the theater imposes upon you the

obligation to close all of your accounts

regardless of any dead-

line which you may wish to impose.

with respect to your paragraph 5 in which you stete:

"As you have let Colonel Baker "sily" through your fingers"--I

apparently cust repeat what I said in my letter of June 21,

peregraph 3---Colonel Baker stopped in my office about ten

ago on his way to Fashington and agreed with me that it would

be absolutely impossible for the account to be cleared here, in

View of the fect thet I had none of the

background or records

which would be available to your office."

•6. I have no intention of treating a matter of this

Importance on the basis of pleayune accusations to stay on the

contained in your paragraphs 7. and 9, as I wish

overell subject.

As we now understand the transfer of lovember, 1t

can be broken down into two parts:

1,000,000 French francs advanced to Col. Baker, and

400,000 on SO Operations Barres, Bruyers,

Rostand.

• In regard to Barres, we credited you on our transfer of 29 Janu

ery with returns made to this office by Paul C. Sheelines Fis

eccount was cleared, with the exception of 15,000 francs he had

edvanced to a war correspondent,

responsibility, and a personal advance of 2,500 francs. " All

that remains is to itemize and enter the expenses listed on the

statement we sent your office, and to collect 17,500 franes

from Sheeline.

Paris picked up fron your transfer of 25 May 622,774 francs on

Col. Baker's Avignon

account.

Presumably you have an accounting

for the difference between

that figure and the 1,000,000 advanced.

Lt. Sichel

stated that he believed Col. Beker had made en account-

Ing in Paris.

Te are requestir. confirmation of that,

and 1f 50,

his account is presumably cleared.

If not, 1t will have

Now that the 7in Arny has more or less come under our

Jurisdiction I am wonderirz whether or not you have given

any

thought to hoi ne say clear cutstanding financial matters with re-

gard to personnel of OSS attached to the 7th Arny.

Naturally I hate no idea from this end as to how your

units are

set un with rescect to funds;

that is, how Jany peopie there

may be in the field: with evances outstanding and hor any contiruing

projects or operations cut authorized and budgeted may be at the

present time handled by 7ic Army groups:

Purely from cabie correspordence I gather that yourman

Sichel is assigned to the 7th irmy for the purpose of hardiing

Special Funds matters.

Forever, I am wondering if it would be gos;

sible for you to

submit tc zy London office with & cozy to

Springsteerg

Paris,

a lisine of all advances outstanding with the

Ith Army and any other pertinent data concerning operaticnal projects.

For the time belay re can continue to eperate as ve are how

doing by keening each otre= constantly advised and working closelzi

together in an effort to keep things on an even keel.

However, it!

might be tell to set a deadline, such as 1 November,

after which time

all personnel asigned by OSs to ühe 7th Army should be advised that

Speclal Funds matters xii: come directly under the control of the

Paris Office, and,

of course,

autonatically under joncen.

Sichel?

will of course continue te operate ith the 7th aruy, but I thirs is

of 1 Novenber he

should report to Puris rather than to Caserte ard

should come more directly under my office.

I am sure you Till realize that tds is a most difficult

letter to "rite and I do net nean to. sound presumptucus.cr

dictatorial; however, in view of the fact that the corers that be

nave brought the fth

Army inder ETO, I think you will understand

hat 1t 1s absolutely essential for us to regularize cur orn sho:

in order to conforn.

I am hopeful that me may be able to sit doin together and

work out the details in serson and with that thought in zind I az!:

2o With reference to paragrash 2, the advances made

to these Ben, which amounted to do pounds

were in the definite

form of travel advances and the sen shouid definitely account

to jou for tis money.

It 1s true that one of the members of

the group was short changed one pound by

Lto Brewster, who

handled the cash for them as I did not see the era in our

of1100.

As, however,

the ran never claiced the short-change

I can only suggest

that you invest it in champagne because I

certainly don't know abat so do with 1t sysell.

As Ito Breaster

has gone baok to washington now thare is no way that I know ofi:

that we oan verify the statement nade by Schonfeld as to

whethor this was the praotice or not but the mole satter vas

definitely reported to ua aa travel advasces for which they
