A review of Los Angeles indices reflects that

, Buffle

25-322346, Los Angeles file 25-521011 Investigation

in this case was initiated to determine if JUSTO RAMON

LEON was identical with registrant JUSTO RAMON LEON

SANTOS.

Investigation determined that he was and it

was subsequently determined that LEON was in the Army

and prosecution declined for this reason.

In connection

therewith, LEON

was contacted and at this time it was

determined that he was given a Medical Discharge for

hallucinations

and mental problems.

Concerning the above, it is noted that in all

three contacts and interviews by Agents with LEON, he

has in no way manifested any mental or emotional problems.

His position as owner of two of the most elaborate

restaurants in the Los Angeles area would tend to bear

credence to this

fact.

Los Angeles will continually

remain alert for any signs of emotional instability.

To date Investigation has in no way reflected that this

informant has furnished any false information.

information has

been

substantiated through other

Informant advised that ten months prior he

was approached by KATLEMAN and Beverly Hills attorney

GREYSON BAUTZER and the following business

deal proposed:

These two men wanted the informant to assume

the ownership and to front for KATLEMAN in the operation

of Romanoff's Restaurant, Los Angeles. They advised they

name as being the sole owner.

later and he refused their offer on the grounds that he

was running a French restaurant himself and that he

would be competing with his own restaurant. He stated

Informant stated he stimulated no interest

in this to SINICOLA but upon SINICOLA's insistence

he went to his office shortly thereafter and talked

long distance with FRANK SINATRA who at that time was

in Monte Carlo attending a celbration given by Prince

and Princess RAZIER.

During the conversation with

SINATRA he told SINATRA he would be interested in

the operation of such a

restaurant if the following

conditions would be met:

(1) That SINATRA close down his operation

of the VIlla Capri Restaurant, Los Angeles.

(2) That SINATRA's name in no way be

identified with the operation of this restaurant.

He stated that when these conditions were

presented to SINATRA he became extremely angry and

demanded to know why his name should not be used.

Informant told SINATRA that during the time he was working

for SINATRA at the Villa Capri Restaurant it was

obvious to him that the type of clientele drawn to that

restaurant was not desirable or good for business and

made specific mention of thewomen that frequented the

Villa Capri. Informant told SINATRA that he felt

if his name would be used in the new restaurant, that

this same type person would start coming to the

restaurant

and that the name and reputation of a first class

restaurant could not be maintained. He stated that

SINATRA did not agree to these terms and the deal was

closed. Shortly thereafter FRANK SINATRA opened

Puccinni's Restaurant and his manager, HANK SINICOLA,

set out in a planned effort to steal informant's help

from the La Scala Restaurant.

He stated they offered

them higher salaries in order to influence them.

Informant stated that one week prior to the opening

of the new restaurant, he fired all his help and told

them they could go 1f

they wanted to or stay with him

and he would rehire them..

He stated all his help

stayed with the exception of his maitre'a, MAT JORDAN,

who went to the new restaurant and operated the

restaurant for a short while for SINATRA.

He stated

that JORDAN did such a bad job on his own that two

to three months later he left and is now back at the

La Scala Restaurant.

Informant stated that he mentioned to NATE

STEIN that he was not going into the above-described

deal with SINATRA and when STEIN heard this he told

him he was crazy and was passing up the opportunity

of a life time.: Informant recalled that when this

deal was presented to him by SINICOLA and SINATRA

that he was told money was no object and that he

could have any location

in Beverly Hills that he

desired for the construction of the new restaurant.

Regarding SINATRA, informant stated that

he was a very arrogant and domineering man and that

he usually had his way with anyone he dealt with.

He stated however, that on one occasion he observed

FRANK SINATRA after an appearance in Las Vegas,

in to Los Angeles late at night and go directly from

the airport to the La Scala Restaurant. He said on

this one occasion NATE STEIN was in the restaurant

at the time of SINATRA's arrival and STEIN upon seeing

SINATRA informed SINATRA to come outside that he

wanted to talk to him and pulled him by the arm.

Informant couldoverhear STEIN dressing SINATRA down.

Informant wanted to mention this only to signify

the overall importance that STEIN has with these

people in Las Vegas because SINATRA would not take

this from many people.

MISCELLANEOUS

, Informant advised that numerous individuals

that he considers are connected with the criminal

world frequent the La Scala Restaurant.

knows no specific information regarding these people

but considers

them to be involved in hoodlum operations.

They are: JOHN ROSELLI, JOHN DREW, MOE DALITZ, RAY

RYAN, JOSEPH FISCHETTI, SIDNEY KORSHAK, LOU LEDERER,

and MEYER LANSKY.

advise the Los Angeles Office when any of the above-

mentioned individuals came into his restaurant so that

Los Angeles would be aware of there being in this area.

He stated he would remain alert for any information

concerning deals that the above individuals were involved

in.

Efforts to develop this informant will continue and
