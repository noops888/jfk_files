Remarks:

Per Ray Rocca's notes, we had expacted a

change in the reference to joint/

RY

I talked

to vir. Coons (Snyder's associate) who said

that according to their notes this was an item

which Hunt had agreed to consider; but the

publisher objected so strongly to each deletion

that Hunt acceded on this one not feeling in his

own mind that it was that serious or that he

had made a commitment to do other than con-

sider our wishes on it.
