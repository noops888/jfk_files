MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

21 November 1978

SUBJECT: House Assassination Committee Inquiry

1. On 17 November 1978, Mike Smith, GC, and I attended an

interview conducted by staff

members of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations in regard to the allegations of Mr. David F.

Christensen concerning the involvement of certain individuals

the assassination of President Kennedy.

The interview was conducted by Messrs Kenneth Klein and

Gary Cornwell and was held in secure spaces provided by Mr. George

Murphy, Director of the Senate National Security Office. Both

individuals are authorized SI access.

The interview was conducted under terms of a Memorandum

of Understanding executed between the Committee and OSD on 15 November,

1978 (copy attached) •

4. For purposes of the interview, DoD made available Sgt.

Nicholas B. Stevenson, USAF, who had been stationed with Mr.

Christensen at USA-55, Kirknewton, Scotland, in 1963. Sgt. Stevenson

accompanied by ITC Jiffrey Graham, USAF, Air Force Legislative

Liaison.

5-2107(5X912X0)

5. The Committee staffers were interested primarily insgt.

Stevenson's recollections in regard to events described-by Mr:

Christensen

in a letter to Stevenson written in May-1978.

6. Sgt. Stevenson briefly described. the USA-55 site

mission and confirmed that the I

_link mentioned in

Mr. Christensen's letter could have been intercepted by the site

but, to his knowledge, had not been an assigned target. Regarding

the specific allegations made by Mr. Christensen that he had

sonally intercepted communications relating to the President's

assassination, Sgt. Stevenson emphatically stated that he had no

knowledge of such an event, though, in all likelihood, if it had

occurred, it would have been widely known within the

station and

the probable subject of a CRITIC.

7. Mike's and my role in the interview was concentrated largely.

on interpreting SIGINT jargon and emphasing the fact that the sites'

mission was and

remains properly classified CONFIDENTIAL-HANDLE VIA

COMINT CHANNELS.

8. The staffers made no notes and agreed to let us review their

report, for purposes of classification, on or after 20 November 1978.

9. The staffers remain particularly interested in determining

the name of the individual who Mr. Christensen believes relates

the assassination.

They will explore means of determining this

information to include the possibility of having Sgt. Stevenson

call Christensen and ask him for the identity (Stevenson indicated

his extreme unwillingness to do this. LTC Graham stated that this

request would have to be examined at policy level within Dod).

10. If the Committee is able to determine a specific name,

the staffers indicated that they would probably initiate a specific
