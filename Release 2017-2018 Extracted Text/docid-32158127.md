"EMMA STERNE immediately took the floor and said

that none of us should everrefer to OSWALD as the

assassin.

She said that in refering to him we should

always

say the alledged or suspected or accused

assassin.

"SHe said, she felt that we may someday find out

that he was innocent, and that the guilty party is a

member of the right.

"She also said that half of the Dallas police are

members of the JOHN BIRCH Society, and that by announcing

just when OSWAlD would be moved they did their best

to see that he would be killed, and therefore silenced

forever.

"BARBARA LINDSAY stated that she believes OSWALD

was innocent, that his death was plotted by the F.B.I.

and the Dallas police and that she felt in four or

five years the true assassin of president KENNEDY may

be known, and that his name would probably be RUBY.

"The money raised through contributions and the

sale of liquor was turned over to FRANCIS FINK.

"This meeting was sponsored by the Committee

for Constitutional Liberties.

"Those present were:
