SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

On 6/26/61, PG 615-6 advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III

as follows:

The imminent incarceration of the convicted defendants

in the "GUN CASE (STUART SUVOR, ET AL; TGP; IISP;

FFA; NM; CONSPIRACY) has caused some consternation in

MANNARINO mob leadership.

On Saturday, 6/24/61,

SAM MANNARINO, while

at the Bonfire Restaurant near

Leechburg, Pa., said that It was a real blow to lose

Cuban contact-man; JOSEPH

GIORDANO of New Kensington,

Pa., who 1s a first-rate fence; and even DANIEL "SPEEDO!

HANNA of Arnold, Pa., who is very efficient as a gambling

dealer and "Strong-arm" enforcer collector.

MANNARINO

said the loss of these men would create some hard-to-fjll

openings.

For instance, to take HANNA's place, two men

were considered so far,

JOE HORGAN and AL SPISANO,

ooth or New Kensington, but while either man woul

a fair dealer, neither was physically or mentally

constituted for strong-arm work.
