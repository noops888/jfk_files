"As Kennedy told in Ulone tast conversation,

he himself had determined the people who were to

murder him.

He also told me that the people were

envious among themselves and that each fought to be

able to commit the murder.

"It was most likely for this reason that it later

came to the murder of the murderer, whose action was

begrudged him.

"I had originally predicted, and had also made

it a

condition in conversations

with the President,

that I would not make known the truth about the murder

to the public until half a year after the deed. I also

suggested the founding of a memorial library.

"However, Kennedy did not agree that the announcement

of the truth

about the murder should wait so long; rather,

he demanded that his family be told about it in time.

Therefore, some 14 days after the deed, I informed Robert

Kennedy, Who then informed the widow of the president.

Jacqueline Kennedy then sent me a telegram which stated

that she thanked me very much and was of the opinion that

what I had reported was the best solution of the case.

Unfortunately I no longer have the telegram."
