infiltrating

Cuba and beginning sabotage there, RaY would

be the one to do 1t. (8) 4)

on June 22, 1964, advised that as a result

of talking to various members of the JURE and in particular

in conversation with RAUL CHIBAS, he was able to put

together, the following concerning RAY's attempt to infiltrate

Cuba: def(u)

MANUEL RAY arrived in Miami, Florida, on May 17,

1964, and Informed ROGELIO CISNEROS that he was ready

to leave for Cuba. This announcement caught CISNEROS a

bit unaware since CISNEROS, although he had RAY's permission

to decide the route into cuba, did not want to assume

such a responsibility, and hence, was not prepared for RAY's

departure. lui

CISNEROS then chartered a boat in order not to

use one of the JURE's boats, because they wanted to

conceal RAY's movements.

The chartered boat was painted

white and 1t was necessary to change its color before

entering Cuban waters.

According to information from

MANUEL RAY, It was ascertained that after departure from

Miami, one of the motors broke down and the radio transmitter

which

was aboard the boat was not working.

These

failures indicated to many of the JURE that the plan

of RAY was already destined for failure although it

is assumed that RAY was serious in his statements relative

to getting into Cuba by May 20, "1964. (E)U)

According to information from RAUL CHIBAS,

NY I--2 said that the entrance into Cuba was not properly

prepared since the spot of entry on to cuban soil was

in an area where the inside contacts were not absolutely

reliable and this pointed out the lie that RAY boaste

that he had an efficient underground inside Cuba. (AU)
