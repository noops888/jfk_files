Re: " "Calabrese Organization"

On May 23, 1964, CV 278-C TE advised he received a

call from DOMINICK MALLAMO, aka.,

"BIG DOM," that day at which

time MALIAMO requested he stop down at the

Workingmen's Club

and see him.

(MALIAMO has been previously

reported as the

active head of the "Calabrese Organization" in the Youngstown

area.) Informant stated upon arrival he and MALLAMO talked

few minutes, and then MALLAMO reached in his pocket and

pulled out a wallet, and from the wallet took out two photographs

which he exhibited to the informant.

Informant looked at the

photographs and then MALLAMO asked the informant if he knew these

two men, and informant advised he told MALLAMO he did not, and

then asked MALLAMO "Are they State men?" and MALLAMO replied

they are not, and told the informant to look at them again,

which the Informant did.

Informant stated he had Immediately

recognized the photographs as being those of SAs FRANK G. DOUDS

and STANLEY E.

PETERSON. CV 278-C TE stated that MALLAMO then

told him, "These are FBIs. They are no good s.o.b.'s.

All the

FBIs are no good, none of them.

This one pointing to photograph

of SA PETERSON) is the Captain (in Italian), he's a no good

s.0.b., and this other one here, he's no good s.o.b.. too.

You

be careful of these guys, all of them.

Informant stated he

assured MALLAMO that he would.

Informant asked MALLAMO where

he obtained the photographs and he stated they had been copied

from a newspaper.

MALLAMO appeared to the informant as being very dis-

turbed, and in Italian asked the informant if the informant would

a big favor.

The informant Immediately told MALLAMO he

would be happy to do him a favor, and MALLAMO told the informant

then that he would like him to come to the c.M.A.s. club, 19-

5th Ave., that night, Sat., and act as a lookout

on the door

from 9:00 PM to 2:00 AM, and he, MALLAMO, would be there by

11:00 PM. Informant agreed to do this, but could not see why

MALIAMO needed him when his man, JOHN SALVATORE, would be working

MALLAMO then

told the informant he was very upset over the fact that SALVATORE

had been subpoenaed before the current Mahoning County Investigative

Grand Jury, and that it was possible that SALVATORE could be con-

victed of something, and SALVATORE would have to leave the club.

Informant then told

MALLAMO there was nothing for him to worry

about, even though he was convicted of something he always had

the right to appeal, to which MALIAMO replied,

that takes money."

MALIAMO, Could loan SALVATORE money for an appeal, and MALLAMO

The into art the old pay ana mAtiAno

"Appeal with what,

told informant he would not loan SALVATORE any more money, and

then took a pencil and on a piece of paper wrote the numerals

"18," and said "That's what he owes me now, with three zeros

behind It, and I'm not loaning him any more money. "

Informant stated on 5/24/64, that on the night of

5/23/64, he watched the door of the C.M.A.S. Club from 9:00 PM

until 2:00 AM for MALLAMO.

MALLAMO did not arrive until about

11:45 PM, when he appeared with ANTHONY AULISIO, owner of the

Aul1s1o Fish Market, E. Federal St., Youngstown, previously

reported as a member of the "Calabrese Organization."

MALLAMO

asked the informant how everything was, and informant told MALLAMO

there was no trouble, in that he turned no one away Irom the door,

and yet he only had about 25 customers in the club. Informant

then asked what MALLAMO was so worried about, and MALLAMO exhibited

to the informant a list of about twelve auto license numbers, and

told the informant these are for "FBI cars."

He then told the

Informant that he had one unmarked police cruiser with two Vice

Squad men in plain clothes parked on 5th Ave. outside the club,

and another unmarked police cruiser with two

Vice Squad men 1n

plain clothes parked in the parking lot opposite the C.M.A.S.

If any one of these men spotted an

"FBI car" in the

neighborhood, then the men in the car in the parking lot would

flash their spotlight up into the window of the C.M.A.S. Club,

and thereby alert the operators of the "FBI's" presence in the

neighborhood.

possibly think that the FBI might raid the C.M.A.S. Club, or have

any interest in the club, and he stated he does not know.

on 5/21/64, CV 544-C advised that even though JOHN

SALVATORE is working for MALLAMO, he does not trust him working

for him.

He stated MALLAMO has learned that SALVATORE has been

operating a shylocking business with C.M.A.S. Club lunas, which

money SALVATORE still owes the club, and to

date MALLAMO

not know exactly how much money SALVATORE has taken from the

club.

if knew another thing, and that is that in keeping the books

of the C.M.A.S. Club, SALVATORE lists $75 per month for the

auditor; one (FNU) FORTINE, while he actually pays FORTINE only

$25 per month for this.

Informant this could never be. brought

out,

in that he, himself, would be harmed if this were known as

there are only three

persons that know this, SALVATORE, FORTINE

and himself.

Prosecution in Local Mahoning County

Court of Common Pleas, Youngstown

â€¢ on 5/25/64, RONALD DAVID CARABBIA appeared with counsel

before Common Pleas Judge SIDNEY RIGELHAUPT seeking a motion for

a new trial, which Judge RIGELHAUPT denied.

Defense Counsel

EDWARD L.

WILLIAMS claimed that CARABBIA could not get a fair

trial since the CARABBIA name had been so prominent in the courts,

press and television several weeks ago when CARABBIA's older

brother, CHARLES, was found guilty of assault with a deadly

weapon.

Judge RIGELHAUPT ruled that in his opinion CARABBIA

had received a fair trial. He set a probation hearing for
