MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT:

BAGLEY, Tennent Harrington

#38638

I. On Wednesday, 7 October 1970, I briefed Colonel

L. K. White, Executive Director-Comptroller, on certain

reservations I have concerning the proposed promotion of

Subject to a supergrade position.

2.

I was very careful to explain to Colonel White at

the outset that my reservations had nothing, whatsoever, to do

with the Subject's security status. I explained that it was my

conviction that the Subject was almost exclusively responsible

for the manner in which the NOSENKO Case had been handled

by the SR Division. I'said I considered that the Subject lacked

objectivity and that he had displayed extremely poor judgment

over a two year period in his handling of this case. Specifically,

as one example of Subject's extreme prejudice, I pointed out that

the SR Division had neglected to follow up several leads provided

by NOSENKO which subsequently had been followed up by this

office (Bruce Solie), and this led us to individuals. who have

confessed their recruitment and use by the Soviets over extensive

periods of time.

3. I explained further that Subject displayed extremely

poor judgment in the actions he took during the time that

NOSENKO was incarcerated at ISOLATION. On many occasions,

as the individual responsible for NOSENKO's care, I refused to

condone Subject's instructions to my people who were guarding

him. In one instance Subject insisted that NOSENKO's food

ration be reduced to "black bread and water" three times daily.

After I had briefed Colonel White he indicated that he would

refresh the Director's memory on Subject's role in the

NOSENKO Case at the time he reviews supergrade promotions.
