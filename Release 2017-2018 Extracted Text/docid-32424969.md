d. Full air strike. Reaction Ilme - 12 hours.,

e. Implement CINCLANT OPLAN 316. Reaction Time -

DAY

Initial assault, Decision/t 7 days. All assault and es-

sential support forces ashore by Decision Day + 18 days,

perhaps somewhat earlier.

2. Invasion planning is being concentrated on OPLAN 316

and measures to make a coordinated assault on Strike Day +

7 with the remainder of landing and essential support

forces being put ashore in the shortest possible time...!

Because c; the vulnerability of airborne forces while in

flight to ground and aircraft fire, all or most of the 7

day interval between Strike Day and D-Day will be necessary

to neutralize or eliminate the hostile air and ground

capability.
