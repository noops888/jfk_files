OPERATION "LEONARDO"

- OBJECTIVES:

To establish contact with elements

within the Government, Rebel Army and Militia, in order to

panalize into action their present anti-cormunist feeling

and taduce those who maintain a passive attitude but who

are potentially susceptible to turn agalnet the Regime,

to not now.. The future plan of action and the size and de-

velopment of the present operation would be determined af-

ter firat contacts are made and Information thus gathered,

is evaluated.. However, "Leonardo" should be considered as

merely a first step towards coordination of anti-Castro

elements within the Cuban Government, for producing an in-

ternal upheaval.

It is the opinion of people with con-

tacts in Cuba, that the moment to act 1s now, because the

conditions for

action are ripening steadily. Rellable in-

formation from the Island points out to the gradual inter-

nal softening of the Castro Regime, to tensions existing

among its members, and to the effect President Kennedy's

worde had in the highest governmental Cuban clrcles who

are said to have acknowledged with sympatby his phrase

that "I am confident that all over the island of Cuba, in

the Government Itself, In the Arny, In the Militias, there

are many who....have viewed with dismay the destruction

of freedom faith and who are determined to restore that

LEONARDO II: Three disenbarcation poInts

are planned for this operation: a) the outer keys off Santa

Clara Say. (Matanzas province), b) keys of1 Calbarien, c)

keys off Corralillo area (Las Villas province). Santa Clara

Bay keys are thought most advisable as they are inhabited

by fishermen: and charcoal workers only and military patrols

Visit them very infroquently, because of extremely difficult

11v1ag condition, there. Two men employed in this mission:

Dr. Nestor Moreno 41, and Miguel Diaz y Solgue 23, would

use one of the fishermen (who are known to be willing to

work against Castro and had worked with them before), to go

to the mainland and proceed to Cardenas with the message to

arrange a meeting with Comandante Ramon Guin or a person he

designates. The round trip to Cardenas might take two or

three days. If conditions are favorable and a meeting can

be arranged at once, the two men would go inland. However,

if the rendezvous with Cuban contacts cannot take place

Immediately, they would have to return to Key Sal or any

other base and go back on the date or dates previously fixed

by the message. Through Comandante Guin, Whe norkE lA INRA

and travels around the country, and through anti-Castro army

and civilian elements already active in Cardenas and Marti,

the following army officers would be contacted initially:

Comandante Guerra, Comandante Parra, Comandante Jose Pinares,

Capitan Manuel Avila, Capitan Lawton. _Fron there on the

contacts would be enlarged.

The above mentioned officers were ar

proached before Pig's Bay and agreed to participate in he-

bel Army uprising in Las Villas province as a part of in-

ternal-external anti-Castro plan. After Play Giron, which

upset that plan, they remained in the Government and are

said

.to be disposed to do it again.

A 25 or 27

in shallow waters and can cruise at 40 knots. Identific.

tion documents, Cuban money and small amount of arms.

equipment for communications, once contacts are established.

4. - GENERAI, OBSERVATIONS:

It is considored that although the major-

1ty.of offictals whom the participants of the missions plan

to talk to have no politioal ambitions and will act against

• Castro for purely Ideological reasons, mininum of assurances

and promises have to be offered. It is also a concensus el

opinton, that once initial steps are successfully accomplished!

an additional number of persons should be uned for the devel-

opnent of "Leonardo", working always in operational coordin-

ation. Each of them are known to have friedds within the

Cuban Government and their personal and representative
