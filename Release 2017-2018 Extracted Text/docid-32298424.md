off and HAGEAL needed approximately 5450,000 to get

the firm out of trouble.

deep financial trouble.

PG T-8 stated that MANNARINO was dealing and

LAN 1, LEo controlled Way's Music Service In Vandere

s Music Service in Vandergrift,

LANZI was an old time associate of MANNARINO, and

MANNARINO used Kay's Music Service to obtain favors from

the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board for such things as liquor

The individual whom-LANZI controlled

or dealt with in the ICB and who in turn did favors for

MANNARINO was an Agent named NEIDRI, who was with the

Pennsylvania LCB in Punxsutawney, Pa.

PG T-8 stated that

LANZI resided in the wintertime at 3000 East Sunrise Boulevard,

LANZI at that apartment around Christmas Time of 1973, and

On January 16, 1974, PG T-4 advised the treasury

lottery tickets which formerly were sold in New Kensington,

Pa., have not been seen in the area for more than ten years.

If

they were in the community, pG T-4, as one of the leading

bookmakers, would know about it.

If JOHN "SHRIGGS" CIRIGLIANO is still handling

these tickets, you can be certain that he is doing so only

with the approval of KELLY MANNARINO.

On March 27, 1974, PG I-T advised as follows:

"RAGS" MAROTTA is working the door for the game

being run by JOE JINKS in Mckees Rocks, Pa,

NA GO AND A T

Recently,

"SONNY" CIANCUTTI said that JINKs, who was

supposed to be

paying a percentage of the house take to MIKE GENOVESE,

was holding out, and he, CIANCUTTI, had been instructed to

go to JINKS and straighten him out.

CIANCUTTI asked

PG T-7 what he would do if it was necessary to rough up JINKS

and MAROTTA, assuming that MAROTTA attempted to interfere.

PG T-T merely told CIANCUTTI that if he hurt MAROTTA, who

is

a close friend of PG T-T, then CIANCUTTI could stop considering

PG T-T as a friend.

Apparently CIANCUTTI relayed this to?

KELLY MANNARINO, because shortly thereafter, PG T-7 was

summoned to see MANNARINO.

He went to MANNARINO's "ranch"

and was told he should not "choose sides." He told MANNARINO

happen to MAROTTA, and he would see to it that JINKS was

approached away from the gambling joint.

On April 30, 1974, PG T-8 advised as follows:

PG T-8 stated that KELLY MANNARINO continues

to control all the gambling that occurs in his area, which

extends beyond New Kensington.

MANNARINO continues

to be

"the man" and the problems that he has frequently with

"SONNY" CIANCUTTI and others should not be interpreted to

mean that he is losing control.

MANNARINO is spending more

and more time in Florida. He delayed his trip to Florida

this year due to his subpoena to appear before a Federal Grand
