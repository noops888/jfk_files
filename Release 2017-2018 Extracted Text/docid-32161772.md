Hayrelson, in a telephone conversation with a con-

fidential source in New Orleans, Louisiana, obtained the following iniormation

with regard to Perry Russo.

This informant, who is well known to L.H.H. and who is a polygraph examiner

having been trained at/the Keeler Polygraph Institute, stated that Perry Russo was

examined by another polygraph examiner with the Sheriff's Office in New Orleans

and that he had heard that the Sheriff's Office examiner stated that Russo was lying

regarding the story of the plot to assassinate the late John E. Kennedy.

Jhis informant also advised L. HI.H. that Perry Russo had been subjected to

narco-interrogation, using sodium pentathol and that he had further been subjected

to hypno-interrogation. He stated that a local psychiatrist subsequently blasted

District Attorney Garrison for using these two techniques and suggested that Russo

should be examined on the polygraph which should be more reliable. This informant

stated that he received a call requesting him to examine Russo in regard to his

story. He stated that he was told that Russo wanted to meet him first to see what

kind of a person he was.

He stated that he made an appointment and met Russo for the first time Friday,

June 16, 1967. He stated that at this time he talked for a while and Russo requested

that he be given a trial run on the polygraph and that he wanted to be asked 10 or 20

questions and intended to lie to some of them to see if the examiner could detect

fit.

The source stated that he instead had Russo write down a number on a piece of

paper and place it in his pocket. He stated that he then made Russo a bet of $5.00

that he could pick out the number. He further stated that Russo called the bet, the

test was run and the examiner picked out the number.

He stated that Russo appeared in his office on June 19, 1967 to be examired in re-

gard to his story reporting the plot to assassinate the late John F. Kennedy.

stated that he attempted to exarnine Russo but that his neumo tracing (breathing)

was so erratic that he reported to D.A. Garrison that he felt Russo was an unfit

subject for polygraph testing at this time. He further stated that he did talk with

Russo about his tracing and explained to him that he obviously had something

bothering him. He stated Russo told him that he told the story in court because he

was getting so much pressure from D.A. Garrison and also NBC. He stated that

Russo further made the statement to him that he did not know if Clay shaw was.

present at the meeting or not. He stated that Russo added that if he had to say

"yes" or "no" that he would have to say "no." that Clay Shaw was not present.

This examiner stated that he asked Russo why he went into court and under oath

stated that Shaw was present at the alleged meeting. He stated that Russo replied

that he fully intended to go into court and testify that he did not know if Shaw was

present or not but became angered by Shaw's attorney's question, "Do you believe

in God" and afterwards did testify that Shaw was definitely present.

This informant stated that Russo admitted having undergone psychiatric treatment

for one and one-half years. He stated that Russo admitted to homosexual acts.

This informant stated that he fully believes that he would have been able to break

that Mr. Garrison told him in no uncertain terms to keep his mouth shut and not to

say anything about the test or what Russo said. This informant further stated that

kis official written report to Mr. Garrison is going to indicate that in his opinion

Russo was an unfit subject on Monday, June 19, 1967.

OTE:

The erratic breathing pattern that was described by this informant can indicate

claustrophobia, however, in all of the experience that I have had in conducting

polygraph examinations, an erratic breathing pattern as a general gule is an indica-

tion that the subject is being deceptive.
