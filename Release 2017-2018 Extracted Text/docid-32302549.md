SUBJECT:

GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka.

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.

AR

On 6/28/61, PG 612-0 advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III:

In the past ten days three men were beaten severely in

New Kensington, Pa.

Each of these men wage delinquent

in the payment of

gambling debts owed to the MANNARINO

organization, and as has been the traditional manner of

nanding such cases, each was attacked by at least two

of the

strong-arm"

collectors,

ANDY MANGINI®

The identities o probably SONNY CIANCuTTI and

the beaten men are not known,

but even if they were,

these men would not cooperate with

any law repforochebt agency due to the fear of further

beatings and because of

MAN and time ete es that the

the police.

One reason for the spate of beatings may be attributed to a

rumored shortage of

cash in the MANNARINO organization. It is

= said in gambling circles

that the gambling play nas been

so slow for the past two months that the

are getting

to the point of desperation.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
