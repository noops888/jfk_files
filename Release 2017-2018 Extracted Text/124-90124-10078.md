OFFICIAT DARLINLY

Clements said the Cubans wanted to have a meeting and he was willing

to escort them into the building (Pentagon). He said he had a Pentagon ID:

I told him that I had passed the information he had to the DIA but they had

not responded as yet about a meeting.

I told him I would call later in the morning. I then called DIA/NMIC

to pass the new information to them.

DIA called back shortly and said I

would he contacted by someone in the ClA.

A little later

called and asked that l go

dovn to DIA/NMIC so he could discuss the situation with me on a secure

telephone. I told him of my call from Clements and about the previous

incident.

He said he had only sketchy information on the first incident

but that he would look into it immediately.

I told him Clements was waiting

for a return call. He said he would take of that. I dropped the matter.

Approximately one hour later I received another call from Clements

because no one had

called him. told him I would call back shortly. I

called DIA NMIC and asked them to inform the ClA.

called me back and said the ClA was not Interested in talking to

the Cubans because of their known affiliation with an anti-Castro terrorist

group in the US.

He suggested I pass the information to the FBl, Mr. Willis

Walton, FBI/INTED, telephone 175-4656 (interagency call).

Mr. Walton knew

of the Cubans from other activities.

I told him what had transpired.

He

recommended that I inform Clements that no agency of the US Government is

willing to meet with the Cubans and suggest that he visit the nearest FBI

field office and pass what. information he has to them.

I called Clements

and informed him of the FBI's recommendation. I dropped the matter.

At approximately 1400 the same day, a man came into the office

(Africa

Region) and said he was Dick Clements:

l asked for identification and he

showed a Pentagon building pass.

I introduced him to Mr. Reed, Director,

Africa Region, OASD/ISA, and Mr. Hamilton, the analyst responsible for

Angolan attairs. Clements said he was in the building on other business Vla.

and just "dropped by"

He said he had met with the Cubans and informed

them that no agency would meet with them.

He said a third Cuban was with

Carballo, their contact with Cuba.

Clements said that during

their conversation he determined: (1) that the information about the

desire of a number of Cubans in Angola to defect came from Roberto Carballe

through other Cubans who had returned to Cuba from Angola, (2) that the

Cubans had been in contact with representatives of President Somoza of

Nicaragua, seeking his assistance, (3) that the basic concept was to set

up stations in a country bordering Angola and wage a campaign to inform

Cubans still in Angola of their existence, with the expectation (based

on the evidence they had) that large numbers of Cubans would take advantage

of the opportunity to defect.

Clements also said he overheard a conversation
