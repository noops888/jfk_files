my JOng DeBatOR WiiA MANOlO RAY, ROgOliO CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto

BETANCOURI. As will be noted in inas memorradum, lianolo promined lo

come us with a prospectus minin approximately ten days' simo, after con-

multiaz wich bin leaders la Cuba.

Lo On 1 June 1961 Mr. Darnes called me lo say that it. Goodwir bad

been visited by d's. Ernesto BETANCOURI M30 naked for Immediase ¡inancial

apport for certain assirit les of the MRF which would run around Slu, iju

dollare lír. Barnes alked me lo contact EETANCOURT lor the pus ose ol

ancersalning whas the lunde were to be uned for, exactly how much needed. etc.

I called BEIANCOURI and he told me that I abould get these denile from

CISNEROS (Engenio), who was staying as roora 589 al the vashlosion Hotel.

I called Eugenio and nade 1 daid for To ind Ray Dibois (Day Adars la lae

name he usen with Ray and Clineros) lo call upon him. He called on CISNEROS

al approximasely 1865 bours I June, and he informed us chas he had argent

need for pesos for use la support of hia saboiage and underground activittes

in Call. He sald his people were absoluely wilcout funda, seeded money for

Lug expenses, transportation purchase of rebotage equipment, air lares for

couriers, and for assistas people lo ges out of prison. He said that it was

now posuible for people to buy their way ous of prieon by bribing one of tbe

many 'consunim lawyers and judges. He thought that su, COU or dú, vic

would meet it nediase needs and that some sort of arrangemen should be made

to receive funds - 34, 600 moochly or theresbous • on a fixed and permanent

basie.

•3. He made so commitment lo Eugenlo other than lo say has me mould

money already ln Cuba - dollars would be delivered lo orners of le pesos who

• are la Miami). I told him 1 would call him in the morning to let hiza know bow

thing stood.

#. I diacuared our rasering with CISNEROS with Iracy Barnes on ibe

moralag of 2 June.

I was Iracy's opintos, In which I beartlly concur. that

we should pur out no money whatsoever until me have had a chance o examine

Nianolo'a plas and to sudy just what repercussione or ram'ifications tere

would be, policy-ime and othermise, lo a decision to asaiet the HIRP

elaterally; Inas is, ouside the Council and presumably withous M1R0'

Inomledge or. consent. Since RAY has withdrawn hin grous frora the Council

with a gren: deal of fanfare, l is mom: unlikely tat MIRO would look iindly

On ADY ASBiBENCE LO RAY, especially since he feels he has a rather Arm

promise from the President so deal only through MIRO.

5. RAY, upon Arrival in Washington, will presumably take his plan (along

wich BETANCOURT) direczly to Mir. Goodwin and I would also presume that

Goodwin will pass li donn to Iracy and Tracy to us. Ray DuBois, woo han

bees tenolo's case officer, le standing by ln the evens he sould be seeded.

6. I peranally feel very eroagly that we should do notbing to support the

plan, whatever la 1o, until we have received from the white liouse and che

Departmen clear-cul, unequivocal policy guidance on the overall piar 1 aloo

feel Chas now la the line: 11 we are soing lo support te MRP unilaterally, lo

Immert a son-official cut out tato the operation. I would recommend thus con-

aldermion le given to using MI. hursy Pleper (a NAVE corract employee)

on sio joo latty lo impermiéniaily icivá, ius a good business head, in

fluens la Spaninh (lived ¿8 years in Caba), is cleared, follows directions,

find a better person,

menta mità the RAY-BETANCOURI-CISNEROS trio. These fellows bave had

easy accees to the Whlie House and so the Depart-ens, are notorious ior their

"planned leaka: will probably presume all the Departmen officiala shey deal

wish are prity to the arrasgement, and before we know it the wbole exile

comminity will be well aware that we are providiag financial and materin!

SUPPOrE LO LA RAI GrOUP.

I am bos arguing againa: proriding such support,

but am merely polming out the real porenilal for emoarrassment to us il the

malter la nos handled with the greases of precautiona. I feel they hare become

too clonely identifled with U.S. -ollicialdom, lacluding uysall, nd that the

plausible denial aspecro, to dase at least, are almost sos-eslatene.
