Reference is made to this Division's memorandum dated

December 1, 1959 captioned "ANTI-FIDEI CASTRO ACTIVITIES, INTERNAL

SECURITY • CUBA."

By a letter dated April 1l, 1960 the Federal Aviation Agency

requested our opinion as to whether certain statements made by the

subject in his Applications for Registration of aircraft constituted

a violation of Title 18, U.S.C., Section 1001.

Following a review of the documentary material which was

forwarded to us and the information contained in the investigative

reports, it has been concluded that the facts of the case are not

such as to warrant undertaking prosecutive action.

The Federal Aviation Agency is being apprised of the

foregoing conclusion by an appropriate letter.
