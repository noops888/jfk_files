1. Action: This memorandum is for your information and

pursuant to your request.

2. Pursuant to your request relayed through Mr. Walter

Elder,

set out below are additional comments referring to the

chronology in referenced memorandum. These comments are keyed

to the paragraphs concerning which you raised specific questions?

My operational diary reflects that Lansdale

was advised of our plans for re-run of the Matahambre

operation on this date.

In addition, the memorandum

dated 19 September 1962 to the Acting Director of

Central Intelligence referred to in paragraph 10 of

referenced memorandum specifically states that the

You will note that this memorandum reflects that the

to re-run this operation at its meeting on 4 October

1962.

(1]) Attached is a copy of General Lansdale's

memorandum dated 20 September 1962 which was in re-

sponse to the memorandum referred to in the above

paragraph. My operational notes reflect that this

memorandum, after receipt, was discussed with Lansdale

and the major question was whether or not the team

could not have performed an alternate mission at the

time it was inside.

He was advised orally that in

view of operational conditions it could not have.

(13) Attached is a copy of the 11 October 1962

memorandum to Lansdale.

(16) My operational diary reflects that Lansdale

was

briefed on 17 October 1962 on our plans to re-run

the Matahambre Operation within the ensuing few days.

Mr. Helms,

who was present at this meeting, also

recalls this.

(17) The advice to the Attorney General on

18 October 1962 in the presence of Lansdale is re-

flected by my operational diary notes.

Mir. Helns

who was also present recalls this.

(19) My operational diary reflects a long dis-

cussion on 20 October 1962 with Lansdale, in which

was specifically told that we were re-running the

Matahambre Operation and that the Matahambre Operation

along with the Galefre Bridge Operation, which we

then were still considering, were the only two sabotage

operations which we felt we

could undertake at that

time in view of the changed conditions.

members of the Special Group. (Augmented).

(28) I have carefully questioned Mr. Halpern,

Executive Officer/TFW, on this briefing and he

distinctly recalls advising Lansdale orally on

the

morning of 26 October 1962 that the Matahambre

Operation had been re-run; that we had not heard

from the team; had not been able to recover the team,

and must presume the team to be either lost or in

hiding.

(29) The nention of the Matahambre Operation,

as best I can recall, at the meeting. of the Special

Group (Augmented) came up in an aside, I believe

from General Taylor, who asked in effect, "Whatever

happened to that sabotage operation"

, and was advised

orally that it had been re-run; that the caching part

of the operation had been successful, but that the

sabotage team had not been heard from the must be

presumed lost. Unfortunately, my operational diary

notes on this point reflect only that the Matahambre

Operation was mentioned casually at the Special Group

(Augnented) meeting.

3. All of the comments contained in the chronology in

reference memorandum are substantiated either by memoranda,

operational notes, or operational diary records.

4.

As you are aware, my meinorandum to you dated 14 Novem-

ber 1962 was prepared prior to the receipt of Lansdale's

memorandum and was not designed as an answer to it. Set out

below for your further information are pertinent comments

concerning the specific points made in Lansdale's memorandum.

a. With regard to paragraph 2 of Lansdale's

memorandum as reflected by reference chronology,

the statement that Operation Mongoose had had no

information on this operation since early October

was patently false.

Specific reference is made to

the penultimate paragraph in Lansdale's memorandum

concerning a report from CIA which he used as a

basis for a memorandum dated 31 October 1962 to

Mr.

Roswell Gilpatric.

This refers to the tele-

phonic conversation on the evening of 30 October

1962 between Lansdale and Mr. Bruce Cheever, Deputy

Chief/TFW, which is referred to specifically in

paragraph 2 on pages 7 and 8 of my reference memo-

randun.

I have discussed this matter in detail with

Hr. Cheever and he clearly recollects that his con-

versation with Lansdale on that date took place as

reflected in my reference memorandum.

During this

conversation there was no discussion of previous

operations except a brief discussion of the COBRA and

AMTORRID teams and Lansdale did not, according to

Mr. Cheeverts recollection, ask any specific questions

concerning assets inside or prior operations which

would logically have lead to any further discussions

at that time of the Matahambre Operation.
