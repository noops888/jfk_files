a termination of their work for us. As an additional

KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE operations are compartmented

and there has never been any indication that either

segment of KDFACTOR knows of the other's existence.

The only termination of a project asset in recent years was

KDFACTOR-1, who formerl! processed

the photo product from both

surveillance points.

NDFACTOR-I was terminated amicably in March

We still maintain periodic contact with him; and his brother,

KDADAGE-14, continues to be one of our more valued MIHARSH access

KDFACTOR-1 is a réputable physician with a wide circle of

friends, and

on a number-of recent occasions he has been very helpful

we have taxed his expertise in his field or requested background

information on people in the medical profession.

Although KDFACIOR-1

processed the photo product, he was not knowledgeable of the exact

surveillance point locations.

Delivery and pickup of the finished

product was always acco-plished by an outside case officer.

Contact is maintained with only two of the five assets.

KDFACTOR-2 and -5, both of whom

are responsible for the operation of

their respective basehouses.

Both KDFACTOR-2 and -5 are met weekly

to obtain the KDLITERAL and KDABSINTHE product for timely processing

and analysis by the Station.

Meetings with KDFACTOR-2 are car pick

ups at periodically changed locations in the suburbs.

Meetings with

KDFACTOR-5 consist of car meetings early in the morning along his

route of travel to his overt job.

These meetings last only long

enough to pick up the product, provide new supplies, and pay salaries,

rents, utility bills,.

ing photo coverage in the event the present KDABSINTHE location

becomes untenable.

We are also exploring alternate locations for

KDLITERAL to solve

the problem we face with this element of KDFACTOR

coverage (see below).

PROBLEMS

The only known problem connected with the project is a

product of mother nature which is threatening the effectiveness of

KDLITERAL coverage.

Approximately two years ago MHHARSH personnel

planted eight small trees along the edge of the terrace leading to

the garden.

These trees have flourished and now have grown to the

point where KDFACTOR-2, the KDLITERAL operator.

estimates he only

as a year more of effective operational capability

We are studying

ays of solving this problem and will forward a separate dispatc

to Headguarters on the topic in the near future.

OPERATIONS

1, The KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the past aix

to support two visual and photographic surveillance pointa

(KULITERAL and NDASSINTHE) directed against the MHHARSH installation.

ADMINISTRITION

2.

Howard T. BAGAUS handled the administration of the project

until early April 1971 when project responsibility reverted from the

Ops Support Section back to the REDTOP Section.

At that time Timothy

H. ARCHEOLD assumed the inside admidistrative chores, and agent

meotings were turned over to the outside case officer Bruce H.

_FERNALD who had previously handled the assets.

parted PCS on 7 June 1971, Oliver J. MANKUNAS

assumed his responsi

bilities.

MANKUNAS also took over agent meetings when FERNALD left

on home leave on 25 June and will continue to handle the project

assets in the future.

Processing

of the photo product is now accomplished inside

the Station by Phemia B. CHAUVEAU.

KDFACTOR-1, who formerly did all

the processing in an outside sarchouse/darkroom, was terminated

amicably in early March 1971,

and at that time

was turned over to CHAUVEAU.

The new arrangement has proven to be

more than satisfactory.

Agent meetings have now been cut to a

minimum, and

the processing of the product and delivery to the con

sumer has been speeded up considerably,

PRODUCTION

OLITERAL: During this reporting period, KOLITERAL

through KDFACTOR-2, continued to be tho source of within-the-compounc

photographic coverage of PCS and TDY MIHARSHers.

He produced 76

rolla of film and provided weekly written reports based on his daily

visual observation of the target aroa.

KDABS INTHS: Operated by KDFACTOR-5, NDABSINTHE produced

167 rolls of film and continued to be the principal source for infor-

mation on visitors to the MHHARSH installation, with special atton-

tion given to visits of "WOCORK-type" porsons and political exiles.

This segmont of KDFACTOR also continued to be the main source of

information on MHHARSH license plates and automobiles.

it would be difficult to identify personnel assigned to

REFERENCE: HMMA-39679, 28 October 1970 (Previous Operational Report)

GENERAL

1.

The- KDFACTOR Project continued throughout the period to

support two visual and photographic surveillance points (KDLITERAL

and KDABSINTH) directed against the MHHARSH installation and to

support the related photo processing of the product..

The Station is presently taking steps to terminate

KDFICTOR-1 the photo processor and move this phase of the operation

into the Station.

3.

Primary responsibility for the operational and administra-

tire handling of Project NDFACTOR pas transterred on 1 December 1970

to the Operational Support Section, and handling of the KDFACTOR

personnel was turned over to Howard I. BAGAUS on 2 December 1970.

MEETING ARRANGEMENTS

This agent is set by BAGALS at 0800 ench

Tuesday morning at

one of four different sites new the Anillo

Periferico in Polanco, some three miles from the Station.

The modus

operandi used with this agent is basically the same as previously

used by Bruce H. FERNALD.

All meetings are held in the case officer

car, and after the meetings, KDFACTOR-S resumes his trip to work.

KDFACTOR- 2:

He is mot at 1630 every Tuesday by BAGAUS. In

several new widoly spaced sites.

Modus operandt is basically the

same as that doscribed in the provicus operational report for

FERNALD, and after the

meeting, KDFACTOR-2 proceeds to his cover

KDFACTOR- 1:

After mooting with KDFACTOR-2. BAGAUS drives

round-a-bout route to & location several blocks

away from the

KDFACTOR-1 medical office, where he leaves his car and walks to the

counter-surveillanco precautions on tho way). BAGALS,

as FERNALD previously, uses the notional cover of olther a

pharmaceutical salesman for "Laboratorios del Norte" or that of a

patient while waiting in the outer office.

The waiting period

normally depends upon whether KDFACTOR-1 is in at the time, or

whether he is in the middle of an operation at the hospital..

(Walting periode vary from immediate admittance to the KDFACTOR-1

office to several hours).

average period is about twenty

minutes: A decision was reached in the Station to terminate this

asset and to transfer this phase of the operation to the Station

1tsell,

in the interest of speed,

security,

and cost.

•termination is planned for early March 1971, at which time, the

processing will be done in the stulion.

SECURITY

There have been no known security problems during this

reporting period.

PRODUCTION

KDLITERAL: During this reporting period, KDLITERAL

through KDFACTOR-% has again been the principal source of within-the-

compound photographic coverage of PCS and TDY HARSHERs producing

129 rolls of film.

During the period covered, a great changé

personnel at the MHARSH installation took place, and KDLITERAL

leading role in assisting the Station in identifying the

of the installation,

through not only photographic

but through detailed visual reporting also.

to reporting on

the activities sif the different individuals in the

target installation, KDLITERAL has also reported on significant

construction changes in the compound such a recent change in the

antenna configurations on the roof of the main building.

this period, KDLITERAL has boeu

sperifically targetted against

AEJEFE, on whom which a special report has been submitted.

KDABS INTH: Operating phrough KDFACTOR-5, KDABS INTH

produced 158 rolls of film.

It provided the Station with information

on visitors to the MIllARSH installation, giving special attention

of "WOCORK-type" persons.

KDABS INTH continues to fulfill

requirements from the various sections of the Station who have

requested fixed surveillance of political exiles, otc., to determine

if these individuals are in contact with the WHARSH

This segment of KDFACTOR continues to be the main source of

information on MAHARSH license plates and automobiles.

10. Both KDLITERAL and KDAPS INTH continued to provide detailed

"attendance sheets" on all NHHAPSH personnel.

In addition,

provided reports on the activities and associates of IDENTITY who

was on TDY l

from 15 October through 4 November 1970.

During this period both units were also involved

in surveilling

the movements of an AEKICK techdician, (201-83S166) who periodically

makes trips to oller Latin American

countries on short notice.

PLANS AND CHANGES

DO HELD CASEMATON

With the exception of the termination of KDFACTOR-1 (paras.

2 and 6) there are no further cages

With the termination of Raymond H. GulADE, effected on

26 June 1970 ard described in HYMA-ü9129,

29 June 1970, the

LIEPTY froject now consists of the operutions of the LICALll and

LILYRIC photo base houses and the photo processing of LISIPTY 4.

Outside case officer Bruce H. FARNALD handles all agents,

normally

on di once jur week basis,

passes the take to his Station

contact.

Operational funds are passed to FERNAL' by his Station

contact, and FEINAID pays all agest salaries,

expenses.

The elimination of die vor has resulted in sone 105s

of effictency, since base house personnel cannot regularly be met

as frequently

as in the past.

This can mean a delay of up lo two

werks

in receipt by the Station of rhotos.

Nowever, ilLYRIC and

LICALLA

personnel have standing requirenents

to report by telephone

visits of Amoricans, and they are

also nierted in advance whenever

possible

to

forthcoming TDYs

of MHHARSh visitors,

so that arrangements

can be made

for special meetings and speedy pircessing of photos.

Normally, all photos are developed and printed by LIMPTY.

Then speed is of the essenco, however, negatties are seit into

the Station

for processing by the WOACRE technician.

Thus, while

GERINDE'S loss is a serious one in cortain respects

talented,

PRIORITY

SUMMARY

The LIEMPTY Project has thus far survived the absence from

of its principal agent,

Raymond H.

GERINDE, as well as

the

threat to the security of the Project represented by GERUNDE'&

marital problons.

Bruce H. FERNALD has

been handling all Project

personnel since

early December 1969, when GERINDE was deactivated

and placed on half-pay.

No problems have resulted from this, other

than a delay in

the receipt of photos (FERNALD is unable to meet

LIEMPTY personnel as frequently as GERENDE waS) .

The security

threat will remain as long as GERINDE's estranged wife has it

within her power to expose GERENDE'S RVROCK connection and the type

of work he was engaged in.

She has continually promised not to do

this, and thus far she has kept her word,

2. The LIEMPTY product continues to be a valuable one for the

Station.

It continues to play an

important CI role (particularly

for LNEPGO and LNREAD) but its greatest value, as far as the Station

is concerned, is in the positive field.

underline this:

The early (and thus far only) debriefing of

of all MHHARSH Erbassy personnel and getting from her a character

that he must agree to an amicable settlement with

his wile in order to insure that she would not feel forced to take

steps which would jeopardizé the security of Station operations.

for this reason, the Station insisted from the beginning that any

financial settlement with his wife would have to take into account

the fact that he was recelving a certain salary from RVROCK, and

that he could not fairly keep this salary out of the settlement on

the grounds that his wife could make no legal claim to that

GERENDE's wife was made aware of our position on this, and

she was grateful, even though she realized that this arrangement

was strictly informal.

The Station felt that GERENDE could not be

allowed to use his RVROCK salary

AS a weapon in the dispute with his

wife, because if he did, she

could hardly be expected to refrain

exposing his connections.

Indeed, events have shown that

GERENDE'S Wife is a vindictive woman, and if it had

not been clear

to her that she,

as well as GERENDE,

would lose money if he loses

his job, she might have blown the whistle long ago.

GERENDE, fOr

his part, would have preferred to keep his RVROCK salary entirely

out of the picture.

Eventually, however, he agreed that the Station

position was fair, and he said he would

LIEMPTY-19 contacted RIZZUTO and asked poirt blank what

she could not mention the RVROCK portion under any circumstances,

and that if she told anyone-tbat GERENDS had any connection with

the connection would be denied and GERENDE would be

terminated.

She appeared to accept this gracefully, even though it

meant she would have to scale her support demands down to the

level of GERINDE'S overt income (GERENDS's monthly salary from

RVROCK was over 7,000 pesos; he earned an additional 4 to 5,000 pesos

teaching English, and he has since rented their house, for which

he is receiving slightly less than 7,000 pesos monthly).

Sibsequently, LIEHPTY-19 was told thet the Station would see to it

that as long

as GERINDE continued to receive an RVROCK salary, he

would give her the same proportion of this salary that the courts

determined should be paid fion his overt income. This, of course.

one which would stop the

Later, as LIENPTY-19's

position hardened and her vindictiveness began to rule her actions,

LIENPTY-19 was reminded by

the Station that the longer it took foi

to be reached,

the greater was

GERENDE' &

0800 to 1500 hours Saturdays.

(Extra-hour or reek-end coverage may

The family has continued to provide reports

The present situation of the marital conflict between GERENDE and

to Judge CRUZ Mellado who

agreed

not to issue an arrost warrant and who has,

finally,

called for a bearing on 16 March (subsequently postponed)

10:00.

MAGALLON has given GERINDE assurances that the charges

are likely to be dismissed.

Fraud - this charge was made by LIEMPTY-19 and her

lawyer on ll December 1969, the day after GERINDS left the

Villa Obregon jail after having spent a weok there for

disobeying a court order.

court order had consisted of

an unfounded request to have GERENDE expelled from his house

the temporary custodian of the

GERENDE refused them

aduisson under those terms,

hence disobeying the Villa Obregon

judge's order, so

the judge's secretary arbitrarily ordered,

on the spot,

LUCAS del ARENAL, was forced to lift the detention after

days and disniss binself from the case and divorce proceedings

The judge has had to face charges of

collusion from and with the lawyers of both parties, i.e.

Magallon and Jurado.

The charge of fraud rests at Mesa

of the Procuraduria del Distrito Federal.

Agent in charge of that table is Jorge GUTIERREZ Cruz.

LIEMPTY19 claims that the money lent to her and GERENDE for

building the house at Ladera #39 was actually loaned to buy

the house and that GRENDE, knowing they were married under

the separate property marriage clauselad wrongfully placed

the property in his name only, thereby committing fraud

Actually, the land was bought by GERINDE before Christmas 1965

in a complicated transaction Involving three other partners:

ODErT BANCrOIT HHITCHOUSE

Walter HURLEY, and each of

no partiers placed the property

in their respective names with the complete knowledge of their

spouses. Later the land was subdivided and after nineteen

months the deeds were issued. LIEHPTY 19 supervised and pronded

the notary who made the transaction and she was perfectly aware

In August 1967 when

was used which he had deposited

Since January 1969, according to the terms of the loan

agreement

GRENDE

has been paying it off and has receipts from

LIEMPTY-19 to show for it.

GRENDE has presented both the land deed ("escriturs")

house and the receipts

On 14 Novembor 1969, one day after LIFMPTY-19 disappeared

against her for minor lesions and showed medical proof thereof.

The hearing of 9 February after which GHENDE was detained, was

called by Villa Obregon judge Bonfilio SEGURA.

Neither the father nor the mother may take the children

Since GERINDE owes the parents of LIEMPTy.19 the sum of

at 39 Ladera, Lomas de Bezares in this city, procisely during the

SUMMARY

There have been no basic changes in the operation of the

project during the reporting period.

Raymond Hi. GrRINDE continues

as principal agent, handling the personnel of the two base houses,

LILYRIC and LICILll, and performing other additional tasks.

27 December 1968, consistent with our eldort to get as much of the

support activity as possibla handled by outsido officers, direct

agent handling responsibility for GRINDE and the LIMITY project

was turned over to Bruce ll. FERNALi.

Vincent P. RUKUTO remains

as alteinate and as FERNALD's inside contact,

GERINDE

Until the introduction of kERNALD,

there was no change in

meeting arrangements with GERENDE.

Meetings were held on an

average of three times per week until October, when LIENPTY-19

(GERENDE's wife) was relieved oi the responsibility ut transcribing

the Spanish-langunge portions oi LIENVOY coverage of the BEDOX

Therealter neetings averaged twice per week, the main

being the transfer of LILWITY base house material and

discussion of base house business.

Some attention should be devoted, if it has not already

been, to the dangers involved in this operation and particularly

to what counterneasures the target may institute, or may already

bave instituted.

2.

One current danger certainly eusts, to wit, the erist-

ence of project llcalla base, which is in the group of buildings

comprising the limesa compler. One of the agents at Licalla

base is known to one of the lipstick agents arrested in the

sunner of 1958, and It 19, hence, possible that both the host

government and the target knows of Licalla. It is suggested

that perhaps Idcalla abould be terminated.

The reason has been

advanced

that this should not be done since the agent would be

suspicious and In any event Licalla might serve as a red herriag

Linesa.

It is belleved that the licalla agent could be

gotten out

of this operation sithout arousing his suspicion.

The

Station could mount an obvious tail on him; when he reported 1t,

he could be told he had probably been made and that, hence, the

operation should no longer continue.

The agent has been & good

one and could be used elsewhere on some other vork. Licalla

house 1s going to be repaired soon.

This might be a good oppor

tunity to stop wor' there and let sone innocent party rent 1t.

That rould be a better red herring,

CUNTACT AND CONMUNICATIONS

3. During the period under rovlow, 30 meotings were held with GERaNDE by

the Project Case Officer.

Meoting, oites and times were varied to avoid

establishing a pattem and most moetings were scheduled at the previous meeting.

Severn'l unscheduled meetings wore hold during this period and were arranged by

the Case Officor telephoning CHiNiDE to establish the meeting tire and site.

Times and sites are cored when discussed by telephone and are arranged in such

a may as to appoar to be a normal conversation.

Telephone calls to GERENDE aro

made from pay booths located awny fron the INPURE Installation.

GERENDE hold twice weokly, clandestine meetings sith LIEVPTY-H, -6,

various uites and at various times of the day so that meetings correspond

with the regular habits and movements of the basehousekeepers and LINTRAP

operators.

5. All assets involved in the LIEMPTY project performed in a most

satisfactory manner during the perlod under review. LIFEUD, has been extremoly

efficient in developing and printing negatives provided by the other assets.

PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES

6. LICALLA.

During thio period LIEVITY -9, operator of the LICALLA

taschouse, provided 1,239 franea of operational photozraphs covering the patio

and garden of the FISTiAL installation, the aroa where many of the officers,

f'anily members and visitors conercyate.

This coverage 1o especially valuable

because the officers are usually nt their leisure and often father into

ructional groupings. LIMPTY-? 1s very observant and his comments and notes

are considered of great value to the station.

All photos providel by LIEMPTY-9

are accompanied by a fixed-survetllance report.

This basehouse is staffed by LlzJPry-13, -14, and -27 with

LIPTY-ll rid - 27 providinr most of the coverage because of the lull-time

do In Decenter 1966 Rayond H. GURENDE, Prinelpal Agent for the LIEMPTY

project, was asted to prepare 8 security resume, Including his opiniona, on

the security of the LILYRIC, LIMITED and LICAllA BAsehouses vis-a-vis soviet

knowledge of their existence.

The following paragraphs contain a alightly

oditod version of GRANDE's roport, which was received on 28 Docembur 1966.

Station cooments follow GERUNDE's and are ao noted.

LILYRIC

2. In its present new location LILYRIC is the newest of the photo bases

under my control.

According to LIEMPTY-13, there has been no indication of

Interest of any sort by the soviets in the fanily"s move to the new apartment

nor was there in the past any show of Intorest or pecullar behavior on their

(Soviet's) part with rogard to the old base and

tho possibility that they might

be under photo survelllance.

The cover for the work carrled on by thia base is good since the

wife, LIEMPtY-l, who does most of the work has no trouble in justifying

her presance at hone all of the time.

The son, LIEMPTY-27 18 a medieal

student and attends his classes regularty and can justily his hours as

(He continues to be an excellent student and was exempted from

exaninations at the end of this, his second year in mudical school. Actually,

he studles most of the night).

or sone other activity that does not require-full concentration la carried out.

The curtaino and blinds in this room are kept partially or fully open to allow

soud visibility and provide a normi appearance. Most of the dally movement of

the sovlet personnel is followed from this room and when it is necessary to

_take pietures of violtors, unknown persons or novly arrived Soviets, the

operators go to the other roon and use the pre-set aguipment.

It seems to me that any careful observation by

the Sovlets would have revonled the tell-tale position of the venetlan blinde

In both the old and the new bases. I have no doubt that the Soviets realize

they are under photo surveillance. The move by the family from the old to the

new building must surely have been noted by the soviets.

Possibly the Sovieta

think the family fe working with the local authorities due to LIEMPTY-13°g

former association with the Mexican Army.

6. Station Comments, The Station agrees with GERENDE that careful

observation by the Soviets would have revealed the missing slat in the venetian

blinds and also the fact that those blinin are soldon open.

The Station also

agrees that the Soviets realizo that they are under photo survelllance.

This was pointed out recontly when a Soviet shielded an LNSHOO walk-In when

they passed the front gate of the Embassy and made a sign to the wallin

indicating that they could be seen by someone watching with a telescope

tron the buildings across the street.

Also, as Hecdquarters 1a Aware, there

havo been numerous comments by residents of Mexico City to the effoct

anyone entering the Soviet imbnsay is photographed; however, seldom has 1t

been rumored that the "Americans" are doing it, which might indicate most people

bolieve the Mexican Government is doing, any such photographing and thereby

rentiirming GERENDE's statement that the Soviets possibly believe the Mexican

Goverrment runs the base.

Given the assumption that the LILYRIC base is blown, the Station at

does not plan to terminate or revanp the LILYRIC Installation,

Any operational change by the operators would be spotted by the Soviets and

if the Bnse were cloged the Sovlets would start looking for a new installatian.

The LILYRIC Base is performing a useful function and it is believed that 1t

will continue to do so.

The Soviets nave had opportunities to complain to

the Mexican Government about boing monitored photogmphically and have not

seen f'it to do so and it i0 believed that they probably will not do so unlesa

thero is a radical change in joviet and/or Mexican policy. The Station has

instructed GEHiNDE to tako every precaution during his meetings with LIFMPIX-13

to assure that LIEMPTY-13 does not lead the sovlets to him and therebs

Jeopardizing other operations, especially LICALLA.

when the soviets raised the helutt of the wall in their backyard

about two years ago, they could have blocked complotoly the view of this

base's working window by making the vall a few inches higher.

Since thoy did

not do this, it would seem to indicate that they nre not avcre that their

activities are beine, monitored from this point.

On the other hand, in recent

months LIMPTY, the operstor, has reported that activitios in the back

yard have been curtalled more and more.

For example, the women no longer

13. GERENDE Comment. I bolleve the Soviets are aware of the photo

Station Comment.

The Station does not believe that tils photo base

This bellef is based on the Inct that the LICALIA

coverage is excellent and there, has been no indication that the Sovlets act

for tho bonefit of oboervers while they are in the backyard.

to note that the sovlets made no effort to "protect" the LNERGO walk-in mentioned

The school children no longer pass through the

fallowing the daily comings and soings

of the LIMERICK personnel; providing leade to and confirming the identi-

fications: of new LIMERICK staffers and also visitors to the LIMBRICK installa

tion; providing leads to the relative rank and the specific intelligence

service affiliation of various LIMSRICK officars; keeping the Station abreast

of construction and physical changes in the LIMERICK physical plant; and

postal accommodation addresses used by Mexico City Station, Headquarters and

other field Stations.

of operational film as well as daily physical surveillance reports covering

the arrival and departure of all LINEFICK personnel and visitors at the

ront sate of that installation during the evening and weekend hours. I

e) Ramond H. CERns - Dung the reportine periol, GUINDE gerved

1s the cull-tIme LIEOT FA, operatias ns the cutoit te the LIMITED,

LILYRIC, and IICAll basehouses and bearing the agent hanlling responslbility

for the operatora of the LIEVRAP mobile unit as well as LIEMITY-l and

LIDPTY-19, & Station asset (tranglator) carried under FroJoct LIFEAT. This

vernil asstenment Involved at least twelve clandestine agent meetings per

week (in oddition the 34 meetings held with tre froject Case Officer)

GRaDe also made sumennis and essential contributions to the sensitive

AMRCD operation.

It should be noted that GERENDe's alertness in spotting

he PBRUMEN surveillance of one of the AMMOD accoroiation addresses,

indoubteddy saved this sensitive deception operation inm exposure by the

opposition®

A. SECURITY AID PROBLENS

Other then the attempted PERUMD! surveillance of the AMROD accommodation

address noted above (which was neutralized by GERENDS's alertness), there

have been no known Inoldents which adversely alfected the security of the

LIMITY project or the related asent personnel. While several minor ad-

ministrative problems arose, all such matters were resolved locally.

5. CHANGES AND PLANNING

One major operational change la planned for the ensuing perlod.

Upon completion of the new LINOUSINE structure (see HNH-25352, dated 10

labruary 1965), the Station will move the present. Linkic basenouse

personnel (LIENPTYs 13, 14, 26 and 27) into that edifice rather than the

LIMITED (LIDOTYs 6 and 7) personnel as originally plamed.

modifications are: l) To increase the hours of doth the photographic and

physical surveillance coverage provided by the LILYRIC operators (dawn to

dusk) during the week daj's and 2) have LIMITED provide photographic and

physical surveillance coverese on week-ends only, while remining on lally

stand-by for radio-dispatching assignments. Tuese changes were dictated by

the following conalderations:

1) The new LINOUSINE building will offer a much better vantage point

for both photographic and physical surveillance than does the present

complex which houses the LILYRIC and LIMITED bases.

Station feels that the personnel occupying this new base should be

those possessing the highest technical skills and also those able to

provide the most thorough and complete coveraj®.

Sines the LIMITED base

now has only one trained operator while the LILIRIC basehouss has three,

the LILYRIC group 1s Indicated.

2) Because 1t appears that the coverage of the LLERICK installation

w111 be a lons-range and continuins requirenent, the station desires

to staff the new hase with personnel of lor;-ranse potential.

LIFMPTY-Ó Is now almost 60 jears old, 1t is obvious that he does not

possess this potential; however, the TILYRIC agent complex happlly

combines experienced personnel with youthful agents.

3)

Finally, the social and financial status of the LILYRIC personnel 1s

much more compatible and consistent with the envirorment of the new

butlding than is that of the LINICD family.

While It 1s anticipated that these noiifications and changes will initially

cause varicus administrative and operational probleas, it is belleved that

all such adjustrents can be handled locally.

b) The requisite copies of the PR2. Part II pertinent to LIDIMTY-26

HMMW-8515, 25 February 1960

SARil 1900

"* ONE)

Extra taun

MA'S SO NO DISK ONI

Pettine

1, It would appear from paragraphs 2a and 2b of reference fat

KUDESK and KUTUBE Ops have no leen completely informed of the back-

ground of the LIEMPTY Project and is agent-requirements. At the time

HMMA- 14093 (Request for Renewal of Project LIEMPTY) was written, it

was assumed that the Mexico Desk and KUTUBE/D could answer any additional

questions, based on reports and disparches not normally available co the

senior staifs, which migh: be raised during the renewal process.

2. In answer to paragraph 2a, Oliver G. SCANTLING first contacied

Inez PARADA de Moreno in early: 1957 to fulfill a KUTUBE/D requirement.

He visited hei ag an archipect interested in viewing the LIMERICA installation

from the building where she lives.

He was socially acquainted with her brother,

a Catholic Priest, and knew the family co be unquestionably anti-Communist.

However, It would be imprudent on the Station's and SCANTLING's part to

assunie that PARADA does not at less: suspect that some anti-LIMERICK

intelligence service Is involved. PARADA suggesied during SCANTLING's

initial visit that he couid return at sny time for further observations. This

was reported by SCANTLING on 21 Narch 1957 and it does not seem appropriate

to query him again on the pretert for his recent visits.

3. While HMMA-14093 correctly referred to LIMITED, LILYRIC and

LICALLA as "photographic basehouses, " the Station would like to emphasize

that photographic coverage is billy oue of their functions (please see HIMMA-12095,

+ February 1959). LIMITED is used as a radio dispatch base for atomobile

surveillance teams in addition io physical surveillance of persons entering

the front gate.

Their photography is negligible compared to their other duties.

The LILYRIC base performs the best photography of persons visiting the front

gate, perhaps because the vantage point for taking the bictures is from the

second floor and above the strees tratric which partially blocks LIMITED

photographs. LILYRIC also does irdividual reports on LIMERICK personnel

entering and leaving the main gate... LICALLA is used almosi exclusively to

identify LIMERICK officials and to support KUTUBE/D requirements in

connection with the LIMESA/LIMUST Project. As an indication of the effect-

tveness of LICALLA photographic coverage, the Mexico Station has all the

LIMERICK officials identified. Before this base was activated more than two-

- thirds of the LIMERICK officials were unidentified. In order to support other

operations, it is considered essential that the Station identify all LIMERICK

officials.

In this respect, LICALLA nas provided most of the necessary infor-

The retention of this base is also considered vital to the security of

the LIMUST portion of the LIMESA Project.

4. The Station does not agree that the color photography and moving

picrures are a luxury. Color slides were made for identification purposes

and have proved useful, particularly in identifying facial festures and skin

The motion pictures were nade at Headquarters suggastion (Pleasc

see HMIMW-7687, 29 May 1959 and HAMIW-8438, 26 January 1960).

5. In conclusion, the Station would like to point out that the "photo-

graphic basehouses" represent an integral and significant part of the Station's

counteresplonage effort against the LIMERICK Installation.

These bases do

not produce Foreign Intelligence and should not be considered in such a light.

1. On 13 October 1959 it was learned from source that the local ODENVY

chief got a priority cable from his Headquarters asking why data concerning the

Mexican apprehension of the (KUBARK) truck and photographer had not been re

ported to the U. S. Ambassador locally, The atatement was made that "such

nattera as this should be immediately reported to the Ambassador."

2. This cable resulted from the report the ODENVY office sent in on

the incident from the knowledge they had - as repurted in reference.

3. The local ODENVY chief replied to his Headquarters that he did nos

agree that matters concerning KUBARk operations should be reported by ODENVY

to the Ambassador.

4. Source stated that die cable waa abriously a result of the KUBARK/

ODENVY headquarters "ill feeling" which presently axints and which source

believes is primarily (and principally) attributable to the article in TRUE magasino

of September 1959.

At 1110 hrs., 20 Septomber 1959, while on an operational assignment.

LIEMPTY- 10 and the LIZNIRAP vehicle were temporarily detainod by the Servicio

Secreto de Mexico (Mexican Secret Survice), LIEMPTY- 10 was huld under

unofficial custody for approximately zú hours before his releaso was obtained, Ther

• follows bolow an accountol the more important details portaining to this incident.

2. LIEMPTY-10 was instructed on 17 September to case the area aurrounding

the Theatro Iris, located at Donceles 36, preliminary to undertaking a photographic

surveillance of all persons entering and leaving the theatre botwoon the hours of

0930 and 1200 hrs., 20 September. In this instance, the Station's target was a pro

Cuban rally spongured by the Circulo de Estudios Mexicanos (CEM).

I'he Station

had received information that many of the leading Mexican and Central American

Communists would attend this rally and that this was an opportune time to establish

which ones did attend and to collect their photographs.

the Stition did not know that

the Mexican Sucret Survice would also be covering this metting for the purpose of

preventing a Communier-inspired demonatration.

The Station was advised at 1730 his., 20 Septemher. by Raymond H.

GERENDE (ps), the Principal Agent who handles LIEMPTY- 10, that L-10 was being

held by the Socrut Service. Immediately following thia notification, Allen W. WAkE

(ps) was requested to contact Philip K. TESSAROLO (pa) and request him to implemdit

procedures through a criminal lawyer to effect the release of L-10.

TESSAROLO

was contacted and briefed at 2200 hours and immediately began attempts to locate

a reliable craninal lawyer.

lowever, as somotimes happens in an chergency

situation, his two most appropriate conticts were out of tern.

It was not until the

jollowing morning at 0700 hrs. that TESSAROLO located another reliable lawyer

who agroud to handle the case.

4.

Since GERENDE was known to L-10 and since the Station could not be

sure how much: L-10 might be forced to tell the Secret Survice, GEPENDE was

given the following instructions:

A. To disconnect immediately the LIFEAT/LIVERY lince in the base

where ho and his wife vere living and to move all equipment to another safe

location. It was believed appropriate to take this precaution even though L-10

nd not know the location of the LIVERY base, the telephow: number of the

base, or even that GERENDS was living at a place other than hus mother'g

residence in another part of the city.

B. To collect and deposit with his Case Olficer any compromising papers

presently in his possession.

C. To make a accurity inspection of the outside photographic lab at hi

nother's house.

D. To phon: L-10's wile and inform her that procedures were underway

to ubtain 1-10's release and ior her not to necome upset and talative.

E. To suspend all operational contacts until L-10 waa ruleased and the

extent of compromise was determined.

Darin; the evening of 20 Sepeember the Station LIfEAT Care Officer

was adrise: that GERENDE had been directed to disconnect the LIVERY lines

and so transier all LIFEAT equipment to a safe location. To further insure the

BeCurity & LIVERY, all LIVERY lines vere pulled externally during the carly

morning di it September.

ó. A: approximately 1000 hr8., 21 September, LINEW informed the Chief

of Statio: that a contact vi has (LINEW'n) had just informed him that L- 10 (true

nanie) and tie LIENTRAP

„schicle were being leid by the Secret Service. LIMEW

stated that si L-10 was gie oi NUBARK's agents he would attempt to have his

contact in to Secret Service obtain lug immediate release. LIMEW was told

that L-10 was, in face, a KUbARk agent and that the Station would very much

appreciate his efforts to effect his relense.

A short sale later LIMEW ayain

contacted lie Chief of Station and informed ham that it would be nocossary for

documented ODACID official personally to contact i Commandante fnu LIMON

of the Secret Survice and that L-10 would then bo released.

According tO LIMeW,

L-10 had toid the Secret Service that he was carrying out his operational photo-

graphic assignment on a contract basis for ODACID; thorefore, an ODACID

official wordd have to establish L-10' bona fides.

7. As the Station learned later, the Sccret Service agontg were roughing up

somic of tic individuala attending the rally; consequently, they were endcavoring

to make sure that no photographs were taken which could be used againat them by

the Communists.

L-10 and L-ll, the LIEN'TRAP driver who loft the scene before le

was detained, were just proparing to leave the area affor taiing five rolle of film

when a Secret Service agent demanded i search of the vehicle on tho suspicion that

it contaires Communist propaganda. L-10, his camera with telephoto lens and

the film were then diacovered in the rear of LIENTRAP. It was at this time that

L-10 was accused orally by the police officers of being a Soviot agent and later of

being a local Communist agent.

After being taken to Secret Survice Headquarters,

L-10 told LIMON, ma private, about his association with ODACID and emphasized

that he cortainly was not a Communist agent. LIMEW's source (possibly Con-

mandante alMON), beloving that there may be some truth in bo-10'a slatement,

contacioi LIMEW. Based in purt on assuniption and in part on fact, this is the

Station's opinion as to how ODENVY becams involved in the case.

The Station, scalizing that LIEMPTY-10 had not committed an illegal

act by zzking photographs, decided that WARE should personally visit LIMON

and request L-10's release. WARE contacted LIMON and thu sub-jefe of the

Secret Service, Raul MENDIOLëA Cerecero, about 1230 hrg., 21 September,

identified himself as an ODACID official and told them that L-10 did from time

to time perform photographic assignments for ODACID, particularly in the

field of local Communist activities, WARE also told LIMON and MENDICLEA

that L-10 was never permitted to lu any task which was legal under Mexican

law and that if he had done so it was certainly not under the auspices of ODACID,

but on is or volition. They implied that L-10 had not done anything illoyal and

that all they wanted to be sure about was that L-10 was not a Communist agunt. L-

10 was inimediately released and the LIENTRAP vchicle returned to him with all

equipment intact, including tie five rolls of undereloped tilim.

?. "While WARE was on his way to sec LIMON at the Secrut Service licad-

quarters, thi Chief of Station was advised by the ODACID Sucurity Office that

Lo-10 was being dotined by the Sociel Survico, The Security Office was told that

WARE was prosently investigating the matter and should be at the Sucret Service

Headquarters at that time. By coincidence, WARE Was tling to MENDIOLEA

when t: ODACID Security Odice phoned to inform him that WARE Was taking care

of the matter. It was learned later that MENDIOLEA is a brother-in-law of the

local invest gator employed full time b; the ODACID Security Office.

ODACID iccame involved in the incident. To the bust of te Station's knowledge, the

ODACID Security Oificer has said nothing more about the incident and, at the time,

did not attach any particular significance to it or seem especially concerned about

L-10'0 statement that he dad some phou raphic work for ODACID. There was no

newspaper or other publicity pertaining to 1 10 or LIENTRAP.

During his vioil to Sucret Service Headquarters WARE discovered that

L-10 had not boon booked or formally charted with an allegal act and that neither

LIMON NOr MENDIOLEA cuuld recall L-10'8 namo. L-10 was not placed in jail

during; the 26 hours he was il Sucret Service Headguarters but, rather, was permitted

to remain in tho Secret Service Arents' duty room. No bribes were nocessary to

obtain his relcase; however, per LIMEW's requent, $500.00 pesos were given to

LIMEW to give to his source. LIMEW said that in addition to notifying him about

L-10'a detention, the source was also rooponsible for all equipment and fim being

rcturned intact to L-10.

11. TESSAROLO vas advised, as soon in LIMEW became involved in the casd

that the criminal lawyer should not pursue the matter any further. I'wo bottles of

scotch whinkey were given to the lawyer through T'ESSAROLO for the fow taska he

had alrcady performed.

12. After his release, L-10 reported that he was not interrogated and that he

did not reveal any data about other operations he has worked on nor did he give the

names of anybody connected with operational activitica. Based on the developricnta

in the case, the Station has no reason to doubt the veracity pi l-10'a statement. 1-

10 was reprimanded for his usc of statements to the Secret Survice about being

employed by ODACID.

iic wan told that the revelation of such employment wo to

be made ouly by the Station and that hencolorth he is never to use such a cover

story, I-10 was aloo esprimanded for hiu lack of judgment in remaining in an arca

where there was i strone concentration of police, it la believed safe to assumic that

L-10 will nover maise this same mistake again.

In retrospect, it in interestiny to note that I-10's use of the ODACID

employment story is possibly responsible for his not being interrogated and thus

compromising other operatione and individuals.

This case has pointed out to the

Station shu desireability of taving casual contacts in the Secret Service and other

local police-type organizatiors so that the Station, rather than ODACID and ODENVY,

in the firet to learn of incidents of this type. Considering the multifarious activities

handled by the Station, it inus: be assumed that the police will occasionally appre-

hend an agent and that the Station must be geared to handle such emergencies.

I4. The Station is allowing a one month's cooling off pariod for the LIEN-

T'RAP vohicie and LIEMPTY-10, the vehicle will then de painted another atandard

color and re-registered in the State of Musico. Alter those security precantiona

are observed, the Station aces no reason why carofully sclected photographic aur-

velilance operations should not continue wich L- 10 as & wiser and more prudent

LIENTRAP operator.

SYNOPS IS OF DEVELOPMENTS

Du ring the period cove red by this

topor tria now. Case Officer, Quinton

N. OUSLER, assumed oper atfoial direction of söreral LIPSIlCK rises (Oliver

G. SCANTLING, Raymond Il, GERENDE, LIMITED, LICAL, LIENTRAP and

several support agents), the LIJERSEY surveillance team and the LILYRIC Base.

The Station has continued to usc SCANTLING, primarily, to follow up LIMESA

leads obtained from LIFEAT and i he photographie bases; however, no positive

rclurns have been realized from his prodigious cítoris except the collection of a

considerable amount of opcrational information, GERENDE performed his princl

pal a gent responsibilities for the photographic bises, LIENTRAP, LUERSEY

and until 10 December 1958 handled the LIFENT/BGMORNING and LIFEAT/

Cuban Exile operations. The LIJERSEY surveillance team has been used sparingly

for pretext investigations and routine stat le surve illane es; however, a principal ageht,

Simon D. CLACKETT, is currently being t rained in flead quarters to assune the

full-time direcrion, control, training and development of the LUJERSEY team, The

now projeci, LIEMPTY, combining all the assets discussed in this report was

submitted to Headquartors on 8 October 1958 with requested projeci year approval

period from 1 December 1958 through 30 Nov ember 1959. An operational security

review of Raymond H. GERENDE's activities was forwarded to Headquarters as an

ill tachment to HMMA- 11308, 22 October 1958.

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS • OLIVER G. SCANTLING SEGMENT

2. Agent Information - Oliver G. SCANTLING has continued to periorm his

assigned tasks in an outstanding manner. SCANTLING's potse, common sense,

clucation, ideology and native ability for the pursuit of clandestine activities

make him one ot the most valuable support assets available to the Mexico City .

Station. The face that S CANTLING has full time overt occupation as Chief

Engineer and Production Manager for a local manufacturing company adds to

his long-range potential as a KUBARK agent. On two occasions during the past

six months SCANTLING has indicated to his Case Officer that he would like to

resign from his overt position and devote full time to his KUBARK upe rational

duties; however, the Case Officer has discouraged him from doing this on che

basis that he has more long range potential when his cover occupation is legitimate.

Of course, SCANTLING would be more valuable if he could work full time for the

Station, but not sufficiently so to warrant his resignation from his overt job (his

monthly salary in his overt job is in excess of $800.00 U. S.).

significant limitation that S CANTLING has evidenced to his present Case Officer

Is his occasional delay in preparing written reports of investigations and other

matters requiring reporis for the files.

However, this limitacion gradually is

being overconie and it is expected that SCANTLING's reports will continue to

be factual, comprehen sive and soon will be prompily submitted.

CS GOPY

3. Security Developments - SCANTLING is constantly under a consider able

of exposure and pressure when following up LIMESA leads obtained from

LIFEAT and the photogra phic bases.

Since time is always of the essence when

using such perishable leads, SCANTLING frequently is di recred to make approaches

to individuals parforming services for the LIME RICK target after routine, ind

sometimes only cursory, investigation. The refore, the possibility always exists

of his entanglemon in an undesirable security incident.

is a calculated risk which buth SGANTLING and the Statlon must take if penetrition

of the primary target is achloved, whether cechnically or by a recruitment in place.

It Is to SCANTLING's credit that he has not yer become involved in an incident which

he Stat ion feels has compromised hiter and/or alerted the target of KUBA RK's many

uperational efforts against then. The closest SCANTLING has come to being compro-

mised and to being identified as a EBPRIMe agent stems directly from the ListICk

survelll ance team flap of June 1958. The office used by the surveillance team was

rented by SCANtLiNG in his true name at the time that he was loader of the team.

Nor the siightest indication, however, has been uncovered which points to SCANTLIN&

as a target of investigation by a local police service. SCANFLING and the Star ion

nave been alert and will continue to watch closcly for any sign of local polico and other

opposition interest in his activities.

Op crational Succoss and Eftectiveness - Briefly discussed below are Some

of the many operational activit les Ur which SCANTLING partic ipared during the periou

covered by this reportal le

MK LIGHTING ope ration th rough CASTRO. As late as September 1958 possibilities

still existed, or appeared to exist, that CASI'RO would complete his work in the

primary LIMERICK office and that it might be possible to install MKLIGHTING.

While CASTRO, through SCANTLING, was the principal source of this informa-

tion, portions were also confirmed by LIFEAT. During July, August and September

1958, SCANTLING had approximately cignt metings with CASTRO, In late

September 195S LIFEAT indicated that the LIMERICK target was using personnel

under the supervision d one of their regular local employeese Autoniga 2 EPEDA

(201-239821), to complete some of the work CASTRO was supposca rö'tinish and

that other contractors were doing jobs around the target area which CASTRO

would normally inve been expected to do had he still been in the employ of the r

target, Also, LIMITED and LIF EN't confir med that the LIMERICK target had

lost interest in CASCRO • ho was not seen visitine the target in stallation nor did

the target people attempt to get in touch with him.

In view of this, SCANTLING&

was instructed to coast all contact with CASTRO as of l November 1958. t

Pablo MON Rosas 201-132 During the period covetéd by this report

SCANTLING had two intervicws with MON Rosas. SCANTLING's most recent

report was forwarded to Headquarters as an attachment to HMMA - 11143, 1

October 1958, Unquestionably the Station has identified Mon Rosas as the tech-

nician whe services LIMERICK safes and locks. SCANTLING will continue hits

accurate drawing of the type door installed at LIME RICK. This drawing was

forwarded to Headquarters via HMMA -11926, 21 January 1959.

Cas ing Report on West German Embassy - Du ring June, July an

lugust 1958, SCANTLING prepared a detailed casing report on the neu

West Ger man Embassy. SCANTLING's engineering abllity enables him to

prepare accurate drawings and sketches from a minimum of data. Also,

his personality and gregar lous manner permit him to visit the inside of such

establishments, with an appropriate cover story, and retain minute details

which lat er he commits to paper and emerges with a comprehen sive floor

plan and important construction data,

F. 'LIMERICK Construction - SCANTLING's long association with th is

target from the casing standpoint provides the Stat ion with an unparalleled

source of information about LIMERICK construction activities, modifications

and rcasons for same. All of the LIMERICK cas ing reports on füe in read

quarters are the product of S CANTLING's unusual a bility and knowledge.

Consultations with Station Officers about LIME RICK construction have been

of benefit to the Stationdring this reporting period and they wili continue to

be of worthwhile importance.

G. Routine Investigations and Surveillances - Although the Station has

several assets capable of periorming investigations and surveillances,

SCANTLING is still used in situations requiring the utmost in discretion and

clandestinity. His activities in this connection are too numerous to list

here; suffice it to state that he has contributed materially to the Station's

collection of operacional uniermation through his investigative efforts.

SCANTLING's interiew of Paul Fredcrick Kir schhoff (201-436-15) of LCMAY-

TOWL interest is an example of SCANTLING's use on investications (see

HMMA-11749, 17 December 1958).

H. ESGEM-15 - SCANTLING served as the cutout with ESGEM-15 during

the latter's Deceinber 1958 t rip to Mexico City. In this connection

SCANTLING is & suppori asset which is trustworthy and dependable.

SCANTLING never displays undu e curiosity in operations such as the ESGEM-15

one; he accepts the min imum amount of information given and performs his

duties in a professional and sincere manner.

I. LIEMPTY/3 - SCANTLING handles the administ rative mart ers connected

with L. /3. Doris N. KILLGO provides operational direction to L/ 3. During

this reporting period, the Stat ion had hopes of SCANTLING taking over the

operational supervision of of activities. However, after a four-monch

trial period with both SCANTLING and KILLCO mceting with L/3, it was

decided that it would be desirable for KIIIGO to continue handling L/3. L/ 3's

unu sual personality and intellect indicated that he could best be direcied by

a PBPRIME citizen.

Therefore, SCANTLING no longer attends KILLGO's

and L/3's operational meetings, although he does continue to handle L/3's

administrative problems.

HEFERENCRISI

"Mexico Ciry in December 1958 and January 1959, it was con sidered appropriate

for SCANTLING to handle LIMITED, LICALLA and LIENTRAP. Although this

procedure defeats some compartmentation principles, it was the only manner

in which the Station could maintain effici ency with the three operations listed

SCANTLING has known the agents involved with LIMITED, LICALLA

and LIENTRAP for several years. In faci, he was at one time the agent in

cha rge of these three opcrations.

5. Operational Methods Evolved During the Perlod - The VIDALES operation

(see parag rapn * (C) above) indicated to the Station the necessity for thorough

bricfings and discussions with the agent making an approach to a target. This can

hardly be described as a new operational method, but it does serve to illu strate

the min im um efforts that should be followed.

The forthcoming LINNIENT IV

operation whe rein SCANTLING must recruit the landlord of the target's building

is offering SCANTLING and the Stat ion the opportunity to prepare thoroughly for

SCANTLING's recruit ment pit cli.

The excellent documentation propired by

KURIOT and the story being created by SCANTLING and the Station should increase

the batt ing average on SCANTLING's cold approaches.

(See HMMA - 11365, 22

October 1958, and HIMMW-7038, 21 November 1958, for additional details on

this Subjeci).

In a gencral sense, one other conclusion can be made ahout any Statior's

support apparatus - where technical and photographic operations are poss ibi e,

the utulity of the information obtained is enhanc cd consider ably by accurate,

comprchen sive and timely casing reporis. SCANTLING, as previously mentioned,

is an excellent asset for this type of support.

Administration - SCANTLING's contract expires on 15 February 1959.

As of that date SCANTLING will have received an annual salary of $3, 600. 00 U.S.

for two years. The Station plans to raise his annual compensation to $4, 000. 00

U.S. No other significant administrative problems exist.

7. Outlook ior Future Development - Station plans call for the continued

ut llization of SCANTLING in the same manner as he is presently being used.

The Station will keep SCANTLING as un independent asset and, it is hoped, resist

the temptation to make him a principal agent in charge of numerous sub-agents. It

is believed that SCANTLING is the type of support asser that can be so rtliwh ile

to the Station for many years to come and that every effor. should be made to protect

his security and value to KUBA RK.

ACCOUNT OF DEVELOPMENTS - RAYMOND 11. GERENDE SEGMENT®

Agent Intormation - Aside from the agent information given in HINIMA - 11368,

perhaps similar to the Civil Sorvice Retirement progiam for KUBARK employees.

9.. Security Developments • Again, the Information on this subject was covered

adequately In FIMMA-11365.

GERENDE was relieved of his LIFEAT/BGMORNING

and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles duties on 10 December 1958.

This, of course, was

vin line with recommendations contained in HMMA-11368 and represents a definite

security improvement.

GERENDE was told that LIFLAT/BMORNING was being

terminated because it had not been productive of chough significant Information and

that LIFEAT/Cuban Exlles was being terminated because the occupants of the target

apartment had moved (Note: This was true where the Cubans are concerned.)

Additional security improvements will be made when Simon D. CLACKETT retuma

to Mexico and relieves GERENDE of responsibility for the LIJERSEY surveillance

10, Opcrational Success and Effectiveness - Bricfly revlewed below are the •

separate oper att onal nett vit les which GEKENDE managed during the period covered

by this report:

A. LIMITED This base functioned smoothly, securely and citic lently

during the period July through December 1958.

'The base operator, LIEMPTY/&

demon strated his usual competence and devotion to duty. In addition to the

primary objective of taking photographs of Individuals of interest, L/6 also

prepared detailed daily logs on the arrivals and departures of all target

personnel, weckly reports of workers activities at the LIME RICK installation,

performed three one -man surveillances of Mexicans working at LIMERICK in

an effort to identify them by name and home address, and provided SCANTLING

with information on LIMERICK construction. During this six-month period,

LIEMPTY/6 took approximately 800 photographs from the LIMITED base.

B. LILYRIC - This base is operated by LIEMPTYs/13 and 14, with LIBMPTY/

12 serving as a cutout berween the base and GEKENDE. LIEMPTY/14 does most

of the photography and reporting for the base since LIEMPTY/13 has a regular

job and is not on the premises during regular daytime working hours. L/14

devotes approximately six hours (0800-1 400) each day to photography and the

remaining time is

spent preparing reports. The Base personnel compile

individual logs on each target personality indicating their arrivals and departures

from the LIME RICK installation (Note: These reports are filed in the

appropriate Station 201 file and are available to Station officers in analyzing a

target personality's pattern of daily acrivity). LILYRIC also prepared a

weekly report on workers activities at the Club and reports the lic ense plate

numbers of all chicles discharging or picking up individuals at LIMERICK.

(Note: These license plate numbers are then checked our through LIV ES TOCK/2

for the owners names and addresses - in case of immediate or later operational

interest.) During GERENDE's recent absence from Mexico City, OUSLER net

directly with LIEMPTY/ 12.

Dur ing this period approximatel approximatel 000 photographs

were taken from the LILYRIC base.

6084

C. LICALLA - While LILYRI C and LIMITED are excellent bases for

photographing individuals entering and leaving the LIME RICK installation,

the LICALLA base is the Station's best source of photographs of tIMERICK

employees. LICALLA is so situated that photographs can be made of tanges

per sonnel in the garden ared of LIME RICK. LIEMPTY/9 is the base operator

for LICALLA and it the Station's opinion performs his job in an outstanding

manner. As reporied in IMMA -11368, LIEMPTY/& is the brother of former

LIPST ICK/47 (the first LIPSTICK surveillance team member arrested in

June 1958). No repercussions, or indications of any impending ones, have

resulted in this family relationship. This, certainly, is the major security

problem faced by L/9 during this reporting period. L/9 and his family soon

will have to vacate the LICALLA base for the period of time required to remodel

it. The Station is quite sure that L/9 does not know that his covert employer

owns the LICALLA base and the three adjoining houses and every effort is

being made to preserve this secret from L/9. (Sce HNNA-12032, 28 January

1959, for a more detailed explanation.) Of course, during the remodeling of

LICALLA there will not be any LICALLA ioporting or photographs. In audition

to taking approximat cly 2, 500 photographs during d: is six-month period, the

LICALLA base also prepared weckly reports on LIM ERICK garden acrivities.

These reports Indicate which LIMERICK employees are sech together each day:

which veltales different employces are accustomed to using, construction activitles

and other matters which appear of significance to 1/9.

D. LIENTRAP - LIENTRAP continues to be a worthwhtie Station asser.

Approximately 1, 400 clandestine photographs have been made of numerous

targets during this reporting period and LIENTRAP cype activities will undoubreily

remain one of the Starion's best investigative asses. As explained in the Field

Project Outline, forwardal to Headquarters on 8 Getober 1958, the Starion is

* A of the opinion chat the LIENTRAP vehicle should be replaced as soon as cossible.

Ncarly tour months have clapsed without recciving Elcadquarters authority to

replace the volicle. The security situation is even more acute now than ai the

time of the requesi. LIEMPTYs 10 and 11 do an ercellent job on LIENTRAP

ope rations.

E, LIJERSEY - This operation can be characterized as somewhat dormant

for the July - December 1958 period, Because of GERENDE's other important

activities, he did not have the time to train and work with the surveillance team,

Also, the Station considered that it would be stretching security just a bit too far

to have GERENDE engaged in surveillance at the same time that he was handling

the photogra phic base houses and performing monitoring chores for LIFEAT/

BMORNING and LIF EAT/ Cuban Exiles.

The expected arrival of Simon D.

CLACKETT in April and his relieving GERENDE of LIJERSEY will enable

the Station to train, within a year, an efficient mobile surveillance team.

At present, LIEMPT Ys/15, 16 and 17 compose the LEERSEY team.

F. LIFEAT - Until 10 December 1958 GERENDE served as monitor

in the basc house containing LIF EAT/ BG MORNING and LIFEAT/Cuban

In addition to living in the base house, GERENDE also transer ibed

the majority of theßGMORNING and Cuban Exile tapes. He performed

these jobs satisfactorily even though his efficioncy was handicapped by numerous

other duties.

Relieving GERENDE of his LIFEAT duties enables him to devote

more time to his other operations with a corresponding increase in che sacurin

of all his activities.

apparent to all concerned that his decision was based upon loyalty lo

tila Station and dedIcation to the fight against Cormunism.

It is hoped

that this unselfian and devoted act of LIPSTICK 21's will be mado a

matter of permanent record.

The reason for LIPSIICK-2 to move fron very comfortable quarters

at less rent into cramped quarters at a higher rental. needed some explana

cion for his frienda aud relatives.

There is a very fine privace s0h00l

approxinately one block from this house which LIPSTICK-21 had often men-

loned as the best in the city for his children, and consequently he tol

everyone that the reason for moving was to be as close as possible to thi

school so that his children could attend. It should be noted in this

respect that,

In reality, LIPSTICK-21 had been sending his chiliren to

one of the best public schools in Mexico tity at no cost. Unier the present

circumstances, he will have to pay tuition at the private school because

1t 19 the only decent school in the area and it provides excellent cover

for his residence in the area.

It is requested that Headquarters authorize

thia Station te assist YIPSTICK-21 in the payment of his chiliren's tuition

for the above stated reasons.

Approximate cost of the tuition would bo

$20.00 U,S, per child por month, or a total for LIPSTiCK-21 of $40.00 US

Authorization is requested to asslat uIrotICK-21 ky payment

of $30.00 U.S. per month.

The house ia ore of a garles of one-story houses that axtend tron

the LIlICK building in a four-story apartment building on the far

corner.

The fronts of the houses are all diractly on the sidewalk with

the doors opening onto a ono-step stoop.

Ine backs of the houses and the

walls of the back patios all abut the compound of the LIMbRICK installa

tion.

The rear windows of the house face a patio which ends in a brick

wall.

this brick wall is not as high as the roof of the house, ending

about. four feet below the level of the roof.

thare are stairs mich

ascend from

this patio to the roof where

the maid's quarters are situated.

About halfway up

these stairs one can

turn and obtain an unrestricted

view of the LIMEKICK compound.

However,

the maid's room offers soe best

operational possibilities since it provides concealment for the observer

and his equipment, plus a more auvantageous view. LIrStICK-21 told his

maid that she would have to sleep out at a local pension since ne needed

her room

for his radio exueriments.

This is a plausible story since

LIPSTICK-21 Is known to be an enthusiastic radio amateur.

The maid's room has a door that faces across the roofs in the direction

of the LIMKKICK installation and one window wich faces across the house

roof toward the street.

A view of the LIMERICK compound is obtained by

an observer who is back in the room looking through the partly coened door.

Some better method of observation will be worked out which will eliminate

the security hazard of a door partially opened at all times of operation.
