DL 105-2027

It is to be noted that referenced communications

contained

leads to interview RICHARD W. DAWSON and OTTO "DUKE"

KOLING at Fort Worth, Texas.

On 7/15/65, DL 269-PSI advised SA GARRY OWEN WATT

that he was quite certain any additional interviews with indivt

duals associated with instant

group, at the present time,

would

more than likely uncover him

as an informant.: Infor-

mant advised that the interview of GRADY R. TURPIN by an

Agent of the FBI had not only left TURPIN shaken by the

experience but also suspicious of informant's activities.

Informant stated that hefelt certain that TURPIN had

communicated his

suspicions to other members of the group,

and any additional interviews of members of the group would

seriously curtail his effectiveness.

Continued contacts will be maintained with DL 269

and all other pertinent investigation will be conducted

in regard to the group, but it is not felt that any additional

interviews at this time would be in the best interests of the

Bureau.

LEADS

AT FORT WORTH, TEXAS. Maintain contact with DL 269-PSI.
