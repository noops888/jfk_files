Special Agent WILLIAM M. MACKEY, Federal Bureau

mvestigation (FBI), Washington Metropolitan Field Officelon

1/16-17/92:

Source learned Tampa, Florida, attorney FRANK RAGANO

(phonetic) would be appearing on the ABC News show "PRIME TIME

LIVE" on 1/16/92 claiming to have information that former

TEAMSTERS President JIMMY HOFFA instructed La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

bosses to kill President JOHN F. KENNEDY in 1963. Based upon

source's past relationship with both HOFFA and RAGANO, source

categorized RAGANO's claims as "lies".

Source advised source's relationship with HOFFA began

in the' late 1950s while HOFFA

was a Vice President of the

TEAMSTERS. Source's relationship with HOFFA lasted until HOFFA'S

disappearance. Source described the relationship between

source

and HOFFA as "close" noting

that source was one of HOFFA's few

associates who could meet with or call HOFFA at any time without

an appointment.

Source stated HOFFA offered source a position as

one

of HOFFA'S trusted assistants which source respectfully

declinedS

In regard to RAGANO, [source recalled attending only

contact with RAGANO for many years, source recalled RAGANO (like

most people attempting to contact HOFFA) was reguired to make an

appointment to see HOFFA in the early 1960s. Source was not aware

if RAGANO'S status with HOFFA changed in later years

Source identified attorneys close to HOFFA

as EDDIE

SHAFITZ (phonetic), a partner of the late EDWARD BENNETT WILLIAMS

in Washington, D.C. and an attorney (name not recalled) who was a

close associate of the BUFFALINO LCN family.

consider RAGANO an attorney "close" to HOFFA

Colice did not

Source advised HOFFA was very close to LCN bOSS SANTOS

TRAFFICANTE and other LCN members. Source said HOFFA was capable

of ordering a contract "hit".

Source advised HOFFA was always

"doing favors" for high level LCN members and, if HOFFA requested

a contract "hit", the "hit" probably would have been done by the

LCN for free.

Source advised HOFFA was not stupid and would not have

made a request for a contract "hit" in the manner described by

RAGANO. Source advised HOFFA never trusted "shyster" attorneys

and certainly would not have trusted an attorney to pass on a

request to kill the President of the United states.

believed that if HOFFA wanted to order a contract "hit" on

anyone, HOFFA would have distanced himself from the "hit".

Source believed HOFFA would have made the request of a very close

trusted associate who then would pass the reguest on through many

other layers of trusted associates without mentioning the origin

of the request or HOFFA's name.

Source described HOFFA as being "very paranoid" about

being under constant FBI physical and technical surveillance..

II HOFFA attended a meeting where illegal activities were

discussed and notes were taken by HOFFA, he (HOFFA) would tear up

the notes and flush them down the toilet before leaving the

meeting. Source noted HOFFA took this action because he feared

being stopped and searched by the FBI as he departed meetings.

Source recalled HOFFA frequently had his telephones and

offices swept for wire taps by an LCN associate (name not.

recalled). This associate was later the victim of an ICN "hit" in

Chicago.

Source advised HOFFA was so paranoid that at one time

HOFFA feared the FBI had "bugged" his toilet.

Source never had any discussions with HOFFA about

killing either President JOHN F. KENNEDY or Attorney General

ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

Source did recall disparaging remarks made by

HOFFA about the KENNEDY family while both PRESIDENT KENNEDY and

ROBERT F. KENNEDY were alive. Source advised that while HOFFA

"disliked" JOHN F: KENNEDY, HOFFA did not "hate" him. Source said

HOFFA "hated" ROBERT F. KENNEDY. HOFFA's hatred for ROBERT F.

KENNEDY resulted from problems ROBERT F. KENNEDY caused HOFFA

while KENNEDY was assigned to the Senate Rackets Committee and

after KENNEDY became U.S. Attorney General.

On several

occasions, HOFFA made statements hoping that someone would either

"beat up" or "blow away" ROBERT F. KENNEDY.

After PRESIDENT

KENNEDY's assassination; HOFFA told source "JACK (KENNEDY) was

not a bad guy but he allowed BOBBY (KENNEDY) to run his life".

Source recalled that immediately following PRESIDENT

KENNEDY's assassination on November 22, 1963, the TEAMSTERS

offices in Washington, D.C., were closed and the American flag

was ordered to fly at half-staff by order of HAROLD GIBBONS,

HOFFA'S Executive Assistant in Washington. Because of this

action, HOFFA fired GIBBONS and replaced GIBBONS with ROY

FITZSIMMONS.

source identified JOSEPH CONNO (phonetic) as a current

source described CONNO as

one of HOFFA's close assistants in the 1960s who may have

knowledge of HOFFA's activities prior to the assassination of

PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

Based upon source's relationships with past ICN bosses,

source commented that if RAGANO's claims about an LCN contract

against PRESIDENT KENNEDY were true, RAGANO would have been

killed by the LCN years ago. Based on RAGANO's claims that HOFFA,

through RAGANO, requested TRAFFICANTE to arrange for the murder

Of PRESIDENT KENNEDY, RAGANO should have been killed shortly

after PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S assassination. This would have been

done to prevent RAGANO from identifying either HOFFA or

TRAFFICANTE as orchestrating the "hit".
