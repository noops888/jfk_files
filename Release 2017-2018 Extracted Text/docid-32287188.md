On 1/14/70, JESUS DOMINGUEZ BENITEZ was found to be

in violation of his release on bond since he had left the

country and his bond was rescinded and he started serving his

sentence. He has already completed the sentence and he has

been released.

It is noted that on 6/16/71 (after the Circuit

Court had affirmed the conviction of the defendants in this

matter) EMM 1337-s advised that BOSCH had allegedly sent a

communication to GONZALEZ in which he indicated that none of

the co-defendants who had not served their sentences should

go to prison

and that if necessary they should leave the

country.

One copy of this airtel is designated for Kansas City.

inasmuch as BOSCH is presently incarcerated at Springfield, Mo.

Miami will through investigation in the 105 files on

the 7 pertinent subjects, attempt to discreetly ascertain the

present whereabouts of the subjects.
