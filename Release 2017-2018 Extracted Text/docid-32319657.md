with Mr. Johnson; however, he is aware of the fact

that Mr. Johnson's testimony before the Federal Grand Jury

commenced an assignment as an Assistant United States

Attorney in the District of Columbia to investigate

gambling operations.

He said during this period a major

investigation was underway concerning gambling,

corruption,

and the possible bribery of local police officials.

The

Washington, D. C., Metropolitan Police Department assisted

in the investigation.

During the investigation, legal

authority was obtained in 1972 to monitor the telephone at

the residence of Charles L. McDaniel, a local gambler.

McDaniel was subsequently convicted

on gambling charges and

was later summoned to testify before a Federal Grand Jury.

He refused to do so and was given a six-month sentence for

contempt.

Mr. McMullin said the monitoring or "tap" on

McDaniel's telephone produced two conversations that were

matters of concern to the Office of the United States

Attorney. He said information concerning these conversa-

tions, as well as other matters, is contained in a memoran-

dum dated February 1, 1974, authored by him and directed

to the United States

Attorney. He said one of the central

points of concern emanating from these two intercepted

telephone conversations was the identity of "the judge"

and "another judge." He said one of the participants in

one

of the conversations was confronted with a transcript

of the call and identified "the judge" as Mr. Johnson.

He said there was some concern also as to whether the

comment about "another judge" was indicative of a possible

entree to a member of the judiciary in the District of

Columbia. Mr. McMullin said Mr. Johnson, who at the

time was

an attorney assigned to the Criminal Division

of the Department of Justice, had been known to him since

1970. He said because Mr. Johnson was identified as

"the judge," and since he was scheduled to be a witness in

"United States vs. Simpson" based on his prior testimony

various aspects of the matter, particularly since it appeared

Mr. Johnson would be a witness

in the Simpson case. He said they

discussed Mr. Johngon's association with Charles L.

McDaniel, which Mr. Johnson described as "social" and he

said the

association was in no way a compromise of his

employment with the Department of Justice.

Mr. McMullin

said they also discussed the facts concerning one of the

intercepted telephone calls and the fact that Mr. Johngon

had been identified as "the judge." He said Mr. Johnson

told him he had asked one "Skip" Adams to place the call

to McDaniel

Johnson told him that shortly after the call he

visited at McDaniel's residence to inform McDaniel he

and'his family would not be attending a Thanksgiving Day

affair being hosted by McDaniel.

and said when they arrived at MeDaniel's home, Mr. Johnsor

went upstairs with McDaniel and remained there some time

while other gueste were in the recreation room.

He said,

taking all things together, he found it difficult to

believe Mr. Johnson visited McDaniel only for the purpose

of declining an invitation.

He said he also questioned Mr. Johnson concerning

the fact that when one "Monk" Moore, a gambler and heroin

dealer, was arrested, Mr. Johnson's

telephone numbers were

found in Moore's address

book.

He said Mr. Johnson told

him he had only a casual social acquaintance with Moore.

He also told him of having met Moore's girlfriend or mistress,

who at one time had been employed in his, Mr. Mclullin's,

office. Mr.

Molullin said this fact "as not discovered until

He said Mr. Johnson replied that since

He did say he had reported the matter to Luke Moore,

Chief Judge, superior Court Division. Mr. AcMullin

had so advised him.

He said Judge Moore recalled that

after "Monk" Moore

was arrested and his girlfriend's

employment was ascertained, Mr. Johnson came to him and

insisted he had told Judge Moore about it earlier, but

Judge Moore did not recall Mr. Johnson's having done so.

Mr. McMullin said after the discussion with

Mr. Johnson on January 24, 1974, he had no further associa-

tion with him.

Mr. Johnson was

not called as a witness in

the Simpson case, which was later dismissed. He said shortly

after their discussion he received an inquiry from his

superiors asking why he was investigating Mr. Johnson.

He said he then prepared the memorandum of February 1, 1974,

which is on file either in the Department of Justice or in

the Office of the United States Attorney. Mr. McMullin

said even though Mr. Johnson was well acquainted with

many

people on all levels of the black community, he cannot

Johnson's association with gamblers.

He pointed

out that although the investigation failed to show Mr. Johnson

had knowledge of gambling operations or was otherwise

involved in any wrongful activity, he is convinced Mr. Johnson

was less than candid in discussing his associations with the

gambling element in the District of Columbia.

He also said

he cannot condone Mr. Johnson's relationship

with the young

lady who drove them

to McDaniel's home.

He noted the young

lady admitted she and Mr. Johnson

were engaged in an

adulterous relationship.

He said he would not recommend

Mr. Johnson for a position of trust and confidence.

WilliamS. Block, Assistant United States Attorney,

Fraud Division, Office of the United states Attorney for the

District of Columbia, Washington, D. C., advised he has

known Mr. Johnson since June, 1970,

and

was associated with

him until September, 1972.

He said Mr. Johnson is a gregarious

person with an outgoing personality who impressed him as

being alert and possessing an excellent memory. He said

he has seen Mr. Johnson on an infrequent basis since 1972,

but whenever they meet Mr. Johnson always remembers him and

Mr. Block said inasmuch as their contacts have

Mr. Johnson's qualifications and could furnish no further

comments concerning him.

George W. Calhoun, Chief, Special Litigation

Section, Criminal

Division, Department of Justice, Washington,

D. C., advised he has known Mr. Johnson since 1970 and was

professionally associated with him from 1970 to 1976.

He

said he supervised Mr. Johnson for approximately a one-

year, period.

He said Mr. Johnson is a pleasant, even-

tempered

and affable person who, as an attorney, was

competent, trustworthy, and helpful. He said Mr. Johnson's

morals, patriotism, and reputation are above reproach.

Mr. Calhoun said he recalls several years ago

Mr. Johnson was called to testify before a grand jury

concerning his apparent association with various known

gamblers at social functions.

He said it is his recollection

that one gambler, after being arrested, was found to have

a notebook in which Mr. Johnson's home and office telephone

numbers were listed.

He said he believes Mr. Johnson used

stating that he would gladly rehire Mr. Johnson.

Washington, D. C., advised he became acquainted with

Mr. Johnson in 1973.

He said at that time he also became

aware of Mr. Johnson's association with several gambling

figures in

Washington, D. C. He said Mr. Johnson subsequently

testified before a grand jury concerning police corruption

and gambling.

He said in this regard he is of the opinion

that Mr. Johnson's admissions concerning his close relation-

ships with various gamblers constituted

a display of a

"division of loyalty and conflict of interests" on

Mr. Johnson's behalf. He said because of this he would not

To The purpose of this memorandum is: to provide you with

details regarding a suggestion by the United States Attorney's

Office for the District of: Columbia that I assist them in

obtaining evidence in a criminal investigation involving

associates: of mine in the Black community.

Tras. 33

By way of background, I came to washington.D..C. in

1964. attended Howard University Law School and graduated

in 19670x. I have worked as a Deputy United States Marshal

(January 1968 - September 1969), a Staff Assistant in the

United States Attorney's Office (September 1969 - March 1971),

Tand have been an attorney with the Department of: Justice

since March 1971. I have many associates in Washington's..?

Black community, as well as the Prosecutor's Office and the

Police Department. From my experience in living in washington,

it has not been uncommon for known gamblers in the Black

community to socialize and associate with Black political

leaders, professionals, judges, lawyers, police officers and

government officials and employees at all levels. In that

connection I have, over the years, attended social functions

and frequented restaurants where known gamblers have been

present.

Because of my knowledge of the Black community,

and my associates, I have been called upon from time to time

to

assist the Office of the Attorney General and the United

States Attorney's Office in such matters as criminal prosecu-

tions and community relations.

On two occasions, April 27 and May 23, 1973, I appeared

before a grand jury for the United States District Court for

the District of Columbia and was interrogated regarding

• certain of my associates. Prior to each appearance, I

informed my immediate superior at the Department of Justice,

Mr. Edward Szukelewicz, then Chief of the Selective Service

Unit.

At my first appearance before the grand jury in April

1973, I was questioned about my activities during the early

morning hours of November 23, 1972. That evening I had

visited a lady friend who, later that night, drove me to

Billy Simpson's Restaurant in the 3700 block of Georgia

Avenue, N. W. I arrived at the restaurant at about 2:00 a.m.

and went to the second floor where I saw Skip Adams, an

acquaintance, who was talking on the phone, which I later

learned was tapped by the District of columbia Police, to

:Charles McDaniels, a known gambler. I told Adams to tell

McDaniels that I wanted to see him; it was important, and

not to mention my name.

Shortly thereafter, Adams, my lady friend and I went

to McDaniels' home on Iowa Avenue, N. W. Upon entering

the house I asked one of the young ladies present where McDaniels

was and she said, "upstairs".. As I got to the top of the

stairs, I saw McDaniels sitting on the bed talking with a

man whom I did not know.. I waited a moment, the man left,

McDaniels greeted me and said that we could talk while he

shaved. I told him that my family and I would not be

coming to his Thanksgiving party the afternoon of the 23rd,

because we were having a quiet family dinner at home.

McDaniels appeared upset because some of the other people

who had been invited

had also cancelled out and he said that

he had spent a lot of money for food and liquor. I apologized

to him and don't believe that we talked for more than 15 or

20 minutes.

During that first appearance before the grand jury. I

was asked by the prosecutor what it was that was so important

that I had to tell McDaniels and I testified that I had no

: recollection. On my second appearance before the same grand

jury, I was asked the same question and testified that I had

had an opportunity to think it

over since my first appearance

and stated that 'I discussed the Thanksgiving party with

McDaniels and the fact that my family and I regretted that

we would not be able to attend.

While I was with McDaniels on November 23, the young

lady, who drove me to his home, called me and said that she

was ready to leave. I left McDaniels, walked her to her

car and returned to the McDaniels' home where a small party

was in progress in the basement. Present were MaDaniels,

Adams, two young ladies and I. A short time later, Billy

Simpson, the restaurant owner, came in. We had a few drinks

and Simpson left and later on, Adams and I left together.

I am relating these facts because I was questioned before

the grand jury about these events and I have later learned

that Adams had made some phone calls from the McDaniels' phone,

-which had also been tapped by the D. C. Police Department and,

during that telephone call, Adams made reference to a "meeting".

In my second appearance before the same grand jury on

May 23, I was sworn in and advised of my rights and again

questioned by the Assistant United States Attorney about

my previous testimony regarding the events of the morning of

November 23, 1972. I testified as I had in the first session.

The Assistant then read to me a list of telephone numbers

which included my old home phone number, my new home phone

number, my number at work and the number of the United states

Attorney's witness room.

He asked that I identify the numbers,

which I did, except for the witness room number which I could

not immediately recall. Subsequently, after a suggestion by

the Assistant that it was the telephone number for the witness

room, I recalled that it, in fact, was.

The numbers were, I

believe, written in a notebook taken from Monk Moore at the

time of his arrest for gambling and narcotics violations.

I have known Monk Moore for about five years and have talked

with him various times. on the phone, and it is my best

recollection that I probably gave him my numbers so he.could

call me regarding such things as tickets for ball games and

fights.

I was then interrogated regarding any association with

Moore, and I testified that I knew him. I was asked if I

knew Moore was a gambler and I responded that I always thought

of him as a "flat-foot hustler", (pool shark, card player

and crapshooter), but not involved in illegal gambling.

During the time I have known Moore, I have never known him

to have been arrested or charged with any criminal activity.

I was also questioned about Moore's girl friend who worked

in the United States Attorney's Office and I testified that

I had known her and reported to then Chief Assistant United

States Attorney for

the Superior Court, Luke Moore, that she

was Monk Moore's girl friend.

At one of the grand jury sessions,. I was asked if I

had ever told Simpson or McDaniels that I was "putting

together some information". I testified truthfully that

I had never made that

statement nor had ever put together

information for Simpson of McDaniels or anyone else. I

later learned that in a tapped telephone conversation,

Simpson had made the statement that he had "a judge putting

together some information" for him. I am known in the Black

community as "The Judge" and Simpson has stated that he was

not referring to a judge, but to "The Judge, Gene Johnson"

Simpson has

since been charged with making inconsistent

statements before

the grand jury. The telephone conversation

in which a reference was made to "a judge" or "The Judge"

was made on November 1l in a telephone conversation between

McDaniels and Simpson. : Simpson has testified that I was in

his restaurant on November 11 and that I had some young ladies

Simpson wanted McDaniels, a bachelor, to meet. When I was

questioned about whether I was at Simpson's on November 11,

I testified that I had absolutely no recollection.

During my second appearance, I was also questioned

regarding any association with Bernice Thompson, a known

thief and drug user, who was arrested in 1972 for grand

larceny. After her arrest she had expressed concern to me

about the possibility of going to jail and I referred her to

•a Black attorney. I told her at one time, prior

to her

appearance in court, that since she had not been charged

with a crime of violence, had a liberal judge and a good

lawyer, that she probably would not go to jail. However,

she was sentenced from one to three years.

Apparently,

she had been overheard in a telephone conversation with

McDaniels that she was upset with me because I had said

she would probably not do any time and, in fact, was given

a prison sentence. I testified that I did absolutely

nothing to affect her sentence in any way. I believe she

said the same thing.

Before my second appearance before the grand jury and

because I was concerned about the fact that I had been called

again, I asked Assistant United States Attorney Martin Linsky

whether I was the subject of a criminal investigation and he

said,no. After the session was over, Linsky apologized for

"being rough on me" and I replied that he was only doing his

job.: I heard nothing from the United States Attorney's

Office for 8 months until January 21, 1974, when I received

a call from Assistant United States Attorney James McMullin,

Deputy Chief of the Major Crimes Section, who asked me to

come to his office to discuss "the Billy Simpson matter".

I met with Assistant United States Attorneys McMullin

and John Drury the morning of January 22 and they advised me

that our conversation would be "off the record". We talked

for approximately 2-1/2 hours and I underwent a vigorous

interrogation. They said my grand jury testimony was evasive

and while they stated that I was not involved in any criminal

activity, they suggested that I was involved in activities

which might be considered "grossly improper".

Toward the end of our conversation, they indicated that

they needed help in their investigation and that I might be

of some assistance.

They asked me for some suggestions on how

I might be able to help them. After I indicated that I had

no ideas, they asked me what my reaction would be if I were

to be wired for sound (a body recorder) or be used to make

consent phone calls (which would be taped) to certain of my

associates in the Black community, such as McDaniels and

Simpson, who are the targets of their investigations.

They

said that I should think about it because of the possibility

that the information which had been developed during the

investigation would be brought out at Simpson's trial and

they would have to provide all details to Assistant Attorney

General Petersen who they thought would probably have to

dismiss me from the Department of Justice. They stated

further that while in their opinion I was not guilty of any

criminal conduct, that I was involved in what they considered

to be "gross improprieties".

They cautioned me not to discuss this with anyone ex-

cept my attorney. However, because of my concern about this

matter, that evening I discussed it with my wife, my minister,

my attorney and the President of the Black Bar Association.

Each advised me not to do it and expressed shock that the

United States Attorney's Office would even make

such a

suggestion. On January 23, I advised my immediate superiors

and Mr. Maroney of these events and I would appreciate the

opportunity of discussing this matter with you.

Interview of Gene R. Johnson

we Come Ged Wide

This memorandum is submitted in response to your request for

a written summary of my interview of Gene R. Johngon.: As you

are

aware, Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin I. Maroney has

also expressed an interest in this matter. While I have endeavored,

of course, to make this memorandun complete and accurate, It is not

intended to be a verbatim recapitulation of Mr. Johnson's responses

to my inquiries.

mon coolines:

war.

On Tuesday, January 22, 1974, at approximately 10:00 a.m.,

Mr.

Johnson arrived at my office. I had requested that. he come

for two reasons: 1.) he will be called to testify in United States

da he voffice.

V. Simpson, Criminal No. 664-73, which has been assigned to me for

trial; 2.) in the course of a protracted federal grand jury investi-

gation into gambling and corruption in the District of Columbia, it

was developed that Mr. Johnson had a close association with Charles

I.. MeDaniel ("Black Danny"), a convicted gambler and notorious

underworld figure,

and with Adolphus Wiggans ('Face"), a business

associate of MeDaniel.

Inasmuch as I have known Mr. Johnson as a colleague since

July of 1970, we passed the first ten minutes exchanging pleasant-

Iles about family and career matters.: At approximately 10:10 a.m.,

ve were joined by Assistant United States Attorney John E. Drury,

III,

who is assisting me in the preparation of the Simpson trial.

I was the protagonist in the interview of Mr. Johnson, with Mr.

Drury occasionally contributing his own observations upon the mat-

ters being discussed. In interviewing Mr. Johnson, I was initially

disturbed by his seeming inability to perceive that his regular

association with a convicted underworld figure might not necessar-

ily be in harmony with his responsibilities as an attorney in the

Department of Justice. In an effort to remove this obstacle to

communication, we discussed the principle of agency law that an

agent owes undivided loyalty to his principal.

Mr.

Johnson main-

tained that he was loyal to the Department and that his social re-

lationship with McDaniel had in no way compromised him. To illus-

trate my point, I told Mr. Johnson that I was going to pose some

hypothetical situations to him. I prefaced my outlining of these

situations with an unambiguous statement that these situations

were for purposes of illustration and should not be construed as

requests for action on his part. Mr. Johnson acknowledged that

he understood what I was saying. The first of these situations

was then outlined to Mr. Johnson: what would his response be if

he were asked to make a telephone call to McDaniel, which call

would be recorded and used against McDaniel if the conversation

were incriminating? After some apparent consideration and much

head shaking, Mr. Johnson replied that he would not be able to

accede to such a request because he liked McDaniel and would be

required to move to another city if he made such a call. The

second hypothetical situation was then outlined: what would be

Mr. Johnson's response if he were asked to engage Billy Simpson,

whose pending case was adverted to above, in a conversation about

Simpson's alleged perjury before the grand jury, after being

equipped with a concealed transmitter?

Again, Mr. Johnson mani-

fested

grave distress and indicated that he could not undertake

such

a mission.' I was satisfied that Mr. Johnson now understood

my point about undivided loyalty and understood the context in

which the situations were presented to him.

I am certain

that I

repeated to him, with emphasis, that in fact no such requests

were being made

of him.

i...

It should be noted that I was not making any such request of

Mr. Johnson, in fact, under the guiseeof outlining hypothetical

situations. To begin with, I was not authorized by my superiors,

either within the office or the Department of Justice, to pursue

such a course.

Secondly, the prospect of converting a Department

lawyer into a

"special employee" is of dubious appeal, as a gen-

eral matter.

Moreover, even if such a project were to be under-

taken and were it to succeed, any "evidence" obtained is clearly

Inadmissible under Massiah.

Finally, and most pragmatically, my

judgment is that the risk of obtaining only the most pious self-.

serving declarations from such an enterprise is too great.

We then proceeded to discuss different topics which arose

during Mr. Johnson's two appearances before the grand jury. As

you will recall, when "Honk" Moore, a well-known gambler, was

arrested on gambling and narcotics charges, we were chagrined to

learn that his mistress of long standing had been employed in our

office in a position of trust and sensitivity. When Moore's ad-

dress book was examined after seizure, it was found to contain four

telephone numbers pertaining to Mr. Johnson. These numbers were

that on at the dearer and on to nex

son acknowledged having had a casual, social relationship with

Moore.

On occasion they had had drinks together and Mr. Johnson

recalled at least one visit to Moore's home, where he met Moore'3

mistress. I asked Mr. Johnson if, when this lady came to work in

our office,. he had brought to the

attention of any of the super-

visors the

relationship between her and Moore. He remarked that

her employment meant that she had passed her F.B.I. security check

and that it.was not his function to backstop the Bureau. Before

the grand jury, Ms.. Johnson observed that if every woman who had

ever been in bed with a gambler were to be disqualified from employ-

ment, the Government would find itself without secretaries. Notwith-

standing Mr. Johnson's disclaimer of responsibility, he recalled

that he had brought..the.matter.to the attention.of

the then Chief

of the Superior Court Division, Judge Luke Moore, but could not re-

member any details of the information that he had furnished. I have

• subsequently telephoned Judge Moore to attempt-to verify Mr. John-

son's account. Judge Moore does not remember that Mr. Johnson ever

made any mention of this potential problem; however, Judge Moore

does remember that, after "Monk. Moore was

arrested and his connec-

tion with a member of our staff was learned, Mr. Johnson came to

him and insisted that he had warned Judge Moore. Remaining questions

addressed to Mr. Johnson about his relationship with "Monk" Moore

elicited uninformative responses.

"Monk" Moore's cases, Criminal

Numbers 813-73 and 814-73, are expected to proceed to trial in the

near future.

Another topic covered with Mr. Johnson was his relationship

with Adolphus Wiggans ("Face"). Mr. Johnson identified "Face"

as

his closest and dearest friend. "Face" has been convicted of

for encoding data for the PROMIS program, necessitating her handling

on a dally basis any number of misdemeanor and felony case jackets.

Ms. Ross was extremely uncooperative with the grand jury investiga-

tion. While she claimed to have invested her own money in the res-

taurant, police intelligence indicates that she, like "Face," is a

nominee for MeDaniel. This judgment is supported by the benefits

derived from the enterprise by the three persons apparently in-

volved. Ms. Ross has not received so much as a nickel in return

on her investment of thousands of dollars, which she asserts she

assiduously saved from her Government salary.

that we are concerned about these matters and the possibility that

Mr. Johnson might have been involved in any of the arrangements.

.. ....

We are particularly troubled by two related

episodes in which

Mr. Johnson concedes his participation. The first of these involves

a monitored telephone conversation between "Skip" Adams and McDaniel.

Adams, telephoning from Billy Simpson's restaurant at about 2:00

a.m. on Thanksgiving Day, 1972, Informs McDaniel that there is some-

one who wishes to speak with McDaniel about a very important matter.

He assures MeDaniel that, notwithstanding the hour, MeDaniel would

be pleased to receive this person at his home.

When McDaniel

presses for the identity of the person, Adams explains that he is

not supposed to use the person's name but finally states that it

is the judge who is with

him." MeDaniel expresses immediate recog-

nition of who "the judge" is, chuckles at his reluctance to speak

on the telephone, and assures Adams that he will receive "the

judge." Although Adams Initially denied making such a call, he has

subsequently identified Mr. Johnson as

"the judge."

Mr. Johnson

explains that he has acquired the soubriquet of "the judge" perhaps

because of his judicial demeanor.

At first, Mr. Johnson could only

recall that he had, indeed, asked Adams to call McDaniel on his be-

half, not to use his name, and to advise McDaniel that he had some-

thing important to tell McDiniel at that time. Mr. Johnson could

not recall what that important message could have been.

Subsequent-

ly, Mr. Johnson remembered what it was that he had to tell MeDaniel

in person, at that hour - something that he did not want to say over

the telephone, something that had to be communicated Immediately:

that Mr. Johnson would not be coming to McDanial's home for Thanks-

giving dinner.

?:?

The second episode involves MI. Johnson's going to Medaniel's

home shortly after the Adams-McDaniel conversation related above.

Mir. Johnson was accompanied by a young woman, with whom he had

slept earlier that evening, and who is employed. by one of the most

active bail bondsmen in the city. Also at MeDaniel's home during

MI. Joinson's visit were Adams, Billy Simpson, and two women whose

names. Mr. Johnson cannot recall. When she arrived at MeDaniel's

home, she and Mr.. Johnson were admitted by McDaniel. : McDaniel sug-

gested that she have a drink with the others: in the basement recre

ation room.: He and Mr.. Johnson repaired to an upper floor and re--

mained there for approximately one-half hour. She inferred from

one of Mr. Jonnson's remarks to MeDaniel that there was some problem

that they needed to discuss. The remark was to the effect that Mr.

Johnson was disputing the truth of something that lcdaniel had ap

parently learned. Because of the late hour and the amount of liquor

she had consumed, Mr. Johnson's date was anxious to return houe..

After waiting in

the basement for some time, she called up to MI.

Jonson, requesting that he join her. Mr. Johnson assured her that

he would be with her promptly but remained upstalrs.:. Aiter a second

Mr. Johnson informs us that he had heard that Medaniel was

having a party in the early morning hours of Thanksgiving Day.: MI..

Johnson therefore decided to stop by and tell McDaniel that he would

not be coming for dinner. When I used the word "meeting" to des-:

cribe MI. Johnson's upstairs conversation with MeDaniel, Mr. Join-.

son balked very strongly. It was not until I had read him the first

five definitions of "meeting" from Webster's New Collegiate Diction-

ary that he accepted my choice of words. Mr. Johnson stressed that

the only matter that he had discussed with MeDaniel during their up-

stairs meeting was the matter of the dinner invitation. Mr. Johnson

expressed amazement that anyone could question his association with

Mclaniel. He explained that his work in the Internal Security

Division could not possibly be of any interest to lieDaniel.

He ac-

knowledged his awareness of MeDaniel's "reputation" as a gambler,

but adamantly denied that he personally possessed any support for

that reputation. He traced his acquaintance with McDaniel to their

mutual friend,

"Face."

During the period of time that Mr. Johnson

was at McDaniel's home, Adams made talaphone calls to his mistress

and his wife, in that order. He stressed to each that he was being

detained by very important matters Involving himself, Simpson,

McDanial, and Mr. Johnson. Adams told each that he would explain

in fuller detail when next he saw her.

At approximately the noon hour, Mr. Johnson advised us that he

had an appointment to be interviewed by "Monk" Moore's defense at-

torney. We agreed to terminate the interview at that time and to ..?

resume at the earliest convenient time.

Prior to leaving, Mr.

John-

son asked if he should make himself available to Billy Simpson's

attorney for a pra-trial interview. I reminded him that a witness

is the property of neither party to a lawsuit and that it would be

unethical for me to suggest that he not meet with the attorney for

Simpson.

Mr. Johnson asked if he should discontinue his association

with McDaniel and "Face."

I told him that he was free to do as he

thought best, but I personally doubted that such associations ad-

vanced his interests. I concluded the interview by asking Mr. John-

son to think carefully about whether he had any information about

gambling and corruption which he had not disclosed. I felt then,

and I feel now, that Mr. Johnson has not been candid with us.. It

is a distressing irony that one of the few persons who is intimately

acquainted with high-level gamblers, judges, and police officers, is

an attorney with the Department.

The irony

is compounded by his

sponses to our inquiries: Mr. Johnson professes to have not the

slightest knowledge of gambling or corruption. In the course of the

Simpson trial, Mr. Johnson's relationship with McDaniel will surely

come to public attention. Simpson falsely denied to the grand jury

that he had told McDaniel that there was some information being pre-

pared for MeDaniel's use by a judge. Simpson has since suggested

that he was confused in his initial appearance by the word

"judge"

and that it might well have been Mr. Johnson who had some informa-

tion for MeDaniel. It is imperative that we continue our interview

of Mr. Johnson.

MENT

Memorandum

TO

_PARTMENT OF JUSTICE

• : Henry E. Petersen

Assistant Attorney General

DATE: February 7, 1974

FROM

EgS

Earl J. Silbert

United States Attorney

SUBJECT: Department of Justice Employee Gene Johnson

Pursuant to our recent telephone conversation re-

lating to the questioning and grand jury appearance of

Gene Johnson, an attorney in the Internal Security

Section of the Criminal Division, I requested James

McMullin, the Deputy Chief of our Major Crimes Division

and the Assistant who interviewed Mr. Johnson, to

furnish me an account of what happened. He has done so.

A copy of his memorandum is enclosed.

As the memorandüm indicates, the interview and grand

jury appearance of Mr. Johnson arose out of the indict-

ment in United States v. Simpson, Criminal Case No. 664-

73...

That indictment, a copy of which is also enclosed,

arose out of the investigation conducted by Mr. Wieseman.

Trial is presently set for February 19, 1974.

The defendant Simpson is charged with perjury and

false declaration for denying before the grand jury

that he told Charles I. McDaniel, a gambler, "that there

was a judge and another judge in his [Simpson's] restau-

rant and that they were fixing up

some information where

Charles L. McDaniel could get it." After Simpson realized

that the conversation he first denied under oath took

place was on tape - from

a wiretap - he changed his story

to the effect that he was not referring to a real judge

in the conversation and therefore honestly answered No.

Instead he was referring to Gene Johnson who is often

referred to as the Judge. This latter apparently is

true - in certain circles Mr. Johnson often is referred

to as "the Judge."

Mr. Johnson, I am told, has denied that he was in

Simpson's restaurant on the

date in question. It thus

appears that he will be a witness in the Simpson trial

- called by either the Government of the defense or

both. This is why AUSA McMullin concluded his memo-

randum to me stating that Mr. Johnson must be inter-

viewed.' There is also a belief by the Assistants in

the Major Crimes Division that Mr. Johnson knows a

good deal more information concerning gambling and

possible corruption than he has acknowledged.

Above and beyond the at least awkward situation

with Mr. Johnson, this case, of which I was not even

aware until about a month ago, troubles me. : I do not

doubt that the defendant did commit perjury.... The evi-

dence, however, is not strong, and the case will be

very difficult to win.

Moreover, there is in the case

oblique reference to Judge William Thompson which may

well come out at trial and could be construed as an

indirect attack on him by this Office without any

supporting evidence at all. Judge Thompson, as I am

certain you know, is a personally popular individual.

So is the defendant Simpson. This, of course, does

not

preclude prosecution and letting the chips fall

where they may in the appropriate case. I have

reservations, however, whether this is the appropriate

case.

The information in this summary memorandum

supplements the information contained in a summary memo-

randum dated September 23, 1977.

Interviews

Harley O. Staggers, United States Representative

from West Virginia

and Chairman of the Committee on Interstate

and Foreign Commerce (CIFC), advised in Washington, D. C.,

that Mr. Kelly was employed

as an investigator with his

committee from the fall of 1967, to April, 1971.

Representative Staggers suggested that former and present

employees of CIFC may be able to furnish additional informa-

tion concerning Mr. Kelly's employment with CIFC.

William T. Durhan, Staff Director, Subcommittee on

Transportation and Commerce,

CIFC, advised he formerly served

as Special Consultant for CIFC.

He said at the direction of

the Chairman he conducted an investigation into certain

activities of Mr. Kelly while Mr. Kelly was employed by

CIFC.

Mr. Durhan said the information he furnishes is based

on facts that were ascertained during his investigation.

He said the investigation centered on travel vouchers

submitted by Mr. Kelly during the course of his official duties

as an investigator with CIFC.

He said the investigation

revealed Mr. Kelly had a grant from the Law Enforcement

Assistance Administration (LEAA) in connection with an educa-

tional television station in Boston, Massachusetts.

The grant

involved a series of about twenty educational television shows

about crime or criminal investigations.

He said the investi

the shows at the same time he was on the payroll of CIFC. He

said a review of Mr. Kelly's travel vouchers submitted in

connection with official duties of CIFC revealed Mr. Kelly

traveled on a regular basis from Washington, D. C., to Boston,

Massachusetts, for the purpose of producing

the shows. He

claimed per diem and travel expenses concerning such trips on

his official vouchers submitted to CIFC.

He said as a result

of the investigation Mr. Kelly resigned

CIFC.

his position with

Mr. Durhan also stated that in his opinion Mr. Kelly

was not effective as an investigator with CIFC and much of his

investigative product concerned information discoverable from

various public sources such as Dun and Bradstreet Reports

or city directories.

He said this reflects a basic dishonesty

on Mr. Kelly's part.

He said much of the information on

which his investigation of Mr. Kelly's activities was based

can be found in LEAA records and the files of the Finance

office,

United States House of Representatives.

He said

Mr. Kelly is a loyal citizen and a discreet person; however,

there are serious questions concerning Mr. Kelly's

honesty,

trustworthiness, and reliability. He said that concerning

recommendation he would not hire

• Mr. Kelly.

A fourth individual who has requested confidentiality

advised he was formerly associated with Mr. Kelly with CIFC.

He said he is familiar with the circumstances surrounding

Mr. Kelly's employment with CIFC from 1967 to 1971. He said

during Mr. Kelly's association with CIFC he made numerous trips

to Boston, Massachusetts, for the purpose of working on a

lengthy television series on law enforcement training. He

claimed per diem and travel expenses for such trips as being

incidental to official business of CIFC. He also received a

salary from CIFC as well as payments from WGBH TV, Boston,

Massachusetts, for his work on the television series. He said

Mr. Kelly was

confronted with the facts concerning such dual

employment and his use of official funds for travel to work

on the series. He said Mr. Kelly elected to resign his posi

tion with CIFC. He said he would not recommend Mr. Kelly for

a position with the United States Government.

Stanley M. Brand, General Counsel, Office of the

Clerk, United States House of Representatives, Washington,

D. C., advised the current rules of the House

tives require a court order be presented in order to obtain

information concerning vouchers

submitted by an employee of

the House of Representatives.

He noted that if such

information is desired by a member of Congress, a letter

directed to the Clerk of the House from the member would in

all probability produce the desired information.

formerly headed the Educational Division of WGBH TV, Boston,

Massachusetts, from 1961 to 1976. He said he recalls

1966 to 1967. He said Mr. Kelly was hired because he had

prior experience in producing programs. Mr. Conant said

while Mr. Kelly was employed by WGBH TV he began a series of

enforcement training programs and helped produce films

and video tapes for law enforcement instruction and training.

He said he could not recall specifically, but thought it

possible that Mr. Kelly may have returned to WGBH TV as a

consultant subsequent to leaving the station in 1967.

said he cannot recall any detailed information concerning

this aspect of Mr. Kelly's association with WGBH TV. He said

Mr. Kelly was a hard worker who was diligent and very capable.

He got along well with everyone and did a splendid job.

commented favorably concerning his character, associates,

reputation, and loyalty, and highly recommended Mr. Kelly for

a position of trust and confidence. Mr. Conant subsequently

James Patrick Kelly

working for the CIFC, United States House of Representatives.

He said

at that time

Mr. Kelly was Chief Investigator and

his immediate superior was Robert Lishman, now deceased, who

was Chief Counsel to the committee.

He said Mr. Lishman and

Mr. Kelly had previously worked together on the

Committee on Public Works and Mr. Lishman had hired Mr. Kelly

based on that past association.

This individual said he could

not recommend Mr. Kelly for a position of trust and confidence

because he considers Mr. Kelly to be a poor investigator and

generally an undependable person. He based his opinion on the

following information.

He said it was common knowledge among several

employees of CIFC that at the time Mr. Kelly was hired by

Mr. Lishman he had been working at WGBH TV, Boston,

Massachusetts, under a grant from the Law Enforcement

Assistance Administration (LEAA)

on a series of law enforce-

ment programs or documentaries.

He said by way of general

background that it is common practice among the many Congres-

sional committees and subcommittees to permit their investi

sators to have a relatively "free hand" concerning their

investigations and connected travel. He said investigators

are rarely questioned regarding travel expenses or even places

of travel.

He said as a rule investigators usually advise

their immediate superiors as to purpose and intended travel.

He said this was not the

case concerning Mr. Kelly and his

travels for CIFC. He said it was the office joke to ask

"where's Kelly?"

because no one could say with any certainty.

He stated that in late 1968, Mr. Lishman expressed

concern to him regarding the seemingly exorbitant expense

vouchers being submitted by Mr. Kelly. Mr. Lishman also indi-

cated he was curious as to the nature of Mr. Kelly's investi-

gation which was requiring considerable travel to and time in

Boston.

He said that

about this time Mr. Lishman became ill

with what became terminal cancer.

He said in his opinion

Mr. Lishman's curiosity concerning Mr. Kelly's travel and

expense vouchers was never brought to a conclusion prior to •

Mr. Lishman's death in late 1970.

James Patrick Kelly

He stated, however, that sometime during 1969 to

1970 the Committee on

House Administration began making

inquiries through the Office of Harley O. Staggers, United

States Representative from West Virginia

and Chairman, CIFC,

concerning the high-average travel vouchers being submitted

by Mr. Kelly. This

individual said based on personal

knowledge Mr. Kelly's travel and expense vouchers ran about

$900 per month.

This amount was about $700 to $800 per month

higher than vouchers submitted by other investigators.

Mr. Kelly was required to submit a memorandum of explanation

detailing his expenditures.

by Mr.

Kelly was "nebulous" in that Mr. Kelly attributed the

expenses to high payments to various sources for information

and the necessity for frequent travel to Boston in order to

contact his sources.

This individual said sometime after Mr. Lishman

passed away, Congressman Staggers became increasingly curious

concerning Mr. Kelly's expense vouchers and he caused certain

members of the CIFC staff to conduct a review of old travel

and expense vouchers submitted by Mr. Kelly as well as a

review of documents on file with the LEAA. He said he is

somewhat familiar with the results of these reviews which

revealed the following information.

Mr. Kelly received an

LEAA grant in May, 1967, under which he was

• to devote

twenty-five percent of his time to the work under the grant.

He was to receive $4,000 per year.

He received a continuation

of the grant in March, 1968.

Kelly wrote a final report

for LEAA which report left no doubt that Mr. Kelly had com-

pleted the terms of the initial grant and the continuation

grant.

The report concerned the nineteen programs Mr. Kelly

had completed at WGBH TV and noted he was desirous of some

kind of additional grant. This individual noted that the

date of Mr. Kelly's report to LEAA was in doubt.

He said the

review also encompassed a comparison of CIFC travel and expense

vouchers with the dates of the nineteen LEAs programs, and

In approximately fourteen instances Mr. Kelly's travel for

CIFC coincided with the dates of the LEAA programs.

He said Congressman Staggers then confronted

Mr. Kelly with this information and demanded an explanation.

Mr. Kelly admitted having worked on the LEAA grant while

working for CIFC. He told Congressman Staggers that Mr. Lishman

James Patrick Kelly

had been fully aware of this and had agreed to permit it.

This individual noted that in this regard he does not believe

Mr. Lishman knew of or approved Mr. Kelly's dual employment,

because had he known, he would not have been curious concerning

he Poure not have o

Mr. Kelly's vouchers. He also noted that had Mr. Kelly's

explanation been true, then he should have mentioned it in

his memorandum of explanation to the House Committee on

Administration, which he did not do. He said thereafter

Mr. Kelly was given the opportunity to resign and did so

in April, 1971.

This individual said all of Mr. Kelly's travel

and expense vouchers would be on file with the Finance

Office, United States House of Representatives and the

information concerning the LEAA grant should be on file with

that agency.

A second individual who requested confidentiality

advised he has known Mr. Kelly since 1967 and worked with

him from 1967 to 1971 on CIFC, United States House of Representa-

tives.

He said their association was strictly professional.

He said during Mr. Kelly's tenure with CIFC, travel and

expense vouchers

submitted by Mr. Kelly were

the subject of

considerable doubt as to whether they were accurate and

proper. He said in his opinion, based on a personal review

of many of the vouchers at the time, Mr. Kelly's vouchers

were often doubtful as to whether he actually traveled on

CIFC business or on personal business.

He said some of the

vouchers were rejected by the House Committee on Administra-

tion because of their questionable nature.

He said he recalls unsubstantiated information

to the effect that while employed by CIFC Mr. Kelly was also

vorking for radio or television in Massachusetts. He was

unable to recall the specifics, but noted that if true, such

have constituted a conflict of interest.

He said the general feeling was that Mr. Kelly was blending

his personal business with the official business of CIFC.

He

stated that Mr. Kelly had somewhat of a "free hand" as an

investigator with CIFC as well as with travel incidental to

his investigations.

James Patrick Kelly

He said he recalled there were never any formal

allegations of fraud made against Mr. Kelly in connection

with the vouchers; however, there were sufficient doubt and

controversy generated over the matter that Mr. Kelly finally

resigned his position in April, 1971. He said due to the

doubt and controversy, he feels Mr.

Kelly's integrity was

in question to a degree sufficient to cause a loss of confi-

dence in him.

He said Mr. Kelly's discretion and reliability

as an investigator were unquestioned, and he considers Mr. Kelly

to be a loyal citizen. He said he could not comment concerning

Mr. Kelly's associates. He said he would recommend Mr. Kelly

for a position of trust with the United States Government on

the condition that Mr. Kelly is under very close supervision.

A third individual who has requested confidentiality

advised she has known Mr. Kelly since 1969. She said Mr. Kelly

was employed as Chief Investigator with CIFC, United States

House of Representatives, when she met him.

She said as an

investigator he did excellent work and was known for his

discretion and reliability. He was also a very charming and

likeable person, whose loyalty was never in question.

said, however,

she has sincere doubts and reservations con-

cerning his honesty and integrity. She furnished the following

information as the basis for her opinion.

She said she worked with expense and travel

vouchers with CIFC at the time and recalled that on at least .

two occasions she believes Mr. Kelly claimed expenses that

he did not sustain and expenses for modes of travel he did

not use.

She said on one occasion he claimed travel from

Washington, D. C., or New York, New York, to California

claiming full per diem for five days, when he did not actually

spend that amount.

She said his claim may have been legally

and technically correct, but it was not morally correct.

She

said on several occasions he claimed taxi fares to and from

aIrports, when in fact, he had not traveled by air, but by

train.

She said she also recalls he claimed travel expenses

in connection with a trip from California to New York,

New York, for the purpose of interviewing a person residing

there, who in fact was never in New York. She said she

thinks Mr. Kelly's travel to New York was solely for the

purpose of taking a ride on the Boeing 747 jumbo jet which

had just come into service between California and New York.

She said because of the lapse of time she could not

recall additional instances of incorrect or improper voucher

claims.

She noted that the vouchers should still be on file

in the

• Office of Finance, United States House of Representa-

tives. In addition, she said there was a question concerning

whether or not Mr. Kelly was engaged in an outside employment

while working full time for CIFC.

She said based on the

controversy over this and his vouchers, Mr. Kelly was asked

to resign his position which he did in April, 1971. She said

because of the foregoing she could not recommend Mr. Kelly for

a position of trust and confidence.

Benjamin J.

Smethurst, Special Assistant, CFIC,

United States House of

Representatives, washington, D. C.,

advised he has known Mr. Kelly since 1969. He said they

were professionally associated with CIFC.

He described

Mr. Kelly as an extremely capable investigator who liked to

work alone.

He sald during the period of time they were

associated he never had reason to question Mr. Kelly's

honesty, rellability, discretion, or loyalty.. He said

Kelly was a well-read person,

who enjoyed an excellent

reputation.

He said he could not

comment concerning

Mr. Kelly's associates.

Mr. Smethurst said he recalls Mr. Kelly became

the subject of considerable controversy during his employment

with CIFC caused by some irregularities concerning expense

vouchers. He said Mr. Kelly may have resigned "under fire"

He said he cannot recall specifi-

cally what irregularities existed, but believes they may have

concerned the fact that Mr. Kelly had a residence in Boston,

He said he also

vaguely recalls some controversy over other documents con-

cerning travel expenses.

He said he would recommend Mr. Kelly

for a position of trust and confidence, but due to the

controversy and questions over the expense and travel vouchers,

he would condition the recommendation on Mr. Kelly's being

properly supervised.
