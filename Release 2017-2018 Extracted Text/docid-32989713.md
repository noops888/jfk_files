Dear Mr. Field:

Slope

This is in reference-to-your-to letters to me dateä August 215

which request FBI materials relative to Donald Uffinger and Richard

Bast, and interviews with five special agents of the FBI.

While your

letter did not mention the subject of the interviews with the FBI

agents, we assume that, the subject concerns Mr. Bast and Mr. Urfinger.

As you may know, this Department as involved in litigation

with Vr. Bast in the District Court of the District of Columbia

styled: Bast v. Kelley. Departmental policy precludes release of

information which may impair the Department's position in any

pending litigation. Your requests also touch upon matters which

are currently the subject of a criminal investigation by the Depart-

ment. Department of Justice policy precludes release of information

which may impede any ongoing Departmental investigation. Certain

exceptions to these policies have been made for the Senate Select

Cormittee when special arrangements have been agreed to which ensure

that neither the Department's litigative position nor its criminal

investigation will be jeopardized. We would be pleased to discuss

such special arrangements relative to the pending Litigation and

ongoing investigation with you fC-l6 Start at your conventence.

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20530

SEP 3 1975

Mr. Aaron Donner, Counsel

Select Conmittee on Intelligence

U. S. House of Representatives

Washington, D. C.

20515

Dear Mr. Donner:

This is in reference to jour letter to me dated August 27, 1975,

in which you indicated that the Department's position that all oral

requests for materials and information made during the testimony of

Messrs. Pommerening and Walsh before the Cormittee on August 7, should

be submitted in writing was intended to delay and impede the work of

the Committee.

Your letter makes two main points. The first is that you were

not informed of the Department's position concerning oral requests

until August 21, and the second is that other agencies do not require

similar requests for materials or information to be put in writing.

First, let me explain the reasons for the delay in communicating

the Department's position on oral requests. You will recall that on

August 7g. 1975, Special Counsel Michael E. Shaneen, Jr., wrote to

Mr. A. Searle Field, House Select Cormittee Staff Director and Chief

Counsel, requesting a meeting on August 8, to discuss the need for

agreeing to structured procedures for processing Cormittee requests.

It was anticipated that at this meeting agreement would be reached

concerning procedures which would apply to the oral requests for mate-

rials. No response to the request for a meeting was received until

August 18, and the meeting was held August 19. You will recall that

at the meeting, Mr. Field rejected any formal procedures for processing

requests. My letter to you was an attempt to resolve, on an ad hoc

basis, a matter left unresolved by the failure to agree to procedures.

My letter would have been sent earlier had we anticipated that the

meeting would not be arranged until August 19.

Secondly, let me explain why the Department of Justice would like

all Committee requests to be in writing and signed by either the Chair-

man, Vice-Chairman, Staff Director or Counsel. Essentially there are

four reasons. The first is to avoid receiving requests for materials

which duplicate or overlap one another. The second is to avoid having

ENGLOSURE!

NW 55321

'DocId: 32989713 Page 29 l

02-11064-14

---

## Page 30

to interpret oral requests which are usually less precise than written

requests. The third is to avoid placing the Department in the position

of having to choose whether to respond first to requests made by indi-

vidual Committee members or to requests made by Committee staff. The

fourth is that written requests afford this office with a formal vehicle

for transmitting Cormittee requests to the various divisions, agencies

and bureaus of the Department for appropriate response and indexing.

I regret that you interpreted my letter of August 21, as an

attempt to hinder or delay the Committee's investigation.

In any event,

I have asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prepare responses

to all oral requests; not already responded to, for materials made dur-

ing the testimony on August T, and which have not been covered by pre

vious wriüten requests. The FBI has ¿nigumed me that esponses o the

oral requests will probably be available by September 12.

To avoid any

additional problems, we request that all luture requests Ior materials

or information be submitted in writing over the signatures of the Cóm-

mittee Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Stáff Director or Counsel.

Sincerely,

Steven Blackhurst

This is to advise of briefing afforded Mr. Tim

Oliphant and Mr. Richard Vermeire, House Select Committee (HSC)

staff members, on 8/22/75 and to identify documents relating to our

Counterintelligence Programs (Cointelpros) being furnished the

Committee as a result of agreement at the briefing.

Participating in the briefing were Assistant Director W. R.

Wannall, Deputy Assistant Director H. E. Helgeson and Supervisors

Edward J. Pistey, Elmer W. Larson, and David Ryan, all of the

Intelligence Division (INTD), Supervisor Paul V. Daly of Legal Counsel

Division and Mr. Steven Blackhurst, Deputy to Special Counsel for

Intelligence Coordination, Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

General details relating to the origin, scope and objectives of our

discontinued Cointelpros were related to the HSC staff members.

Additionally, general background regarding the work of the INTD,

the organization of the Division and our foreign and domestic intelli-

gence responsibilities were outlined.

• The HSC members expressed

extreme appreciation for this briefing and it was suggested to them

that they and Mr. A. Searle Field, Staff Director, HSC, take advantage

of the formal filmed INTD briefing which has been prepared by the

Sarati

Research (IS-3) Section.

Mr. Oliphant and; Mr. Vermeire indicated they did not

anticipate the HSC would want to explore those areas of Cointelpros

which are being scrutinized by the Senate Select Committee. They

pointed out that Congressman Otis G. Pike, Chairman, HSC, was

extremely interested in developing costs relating to Cointelpro activities,

Re: Houstudy

informant coverage and other areas of intelligence responsibility.

It was pointed out to them it would be difficult to assign cost figures

to any area of our Cointelpros as efforts in this regard were only a

minor adjunct to our overall intelligence efforts. The HSC members

indicated they anticipated carefully reviewing our Black Extremist

Cointelpro and our White Hate Cointelpro as Congressmen Dellums

of California and Treem of Louisiana felt a responsibility to their

constituents to thoroughly review these programs. It was also indi-

cated the program which targeted militants seeking independence for

Puerto Rico would also be reviewed.

During this briefing it was agreed the FBI would imme-

diately make available to the HSC the following materials:

1. The Study Committee report on FBI Counterintelligence

Programs (Petersen report) and its exhibits A through P. It is noted

this report has already been made available to the Senate Select Committee.

Exhibits A through E are individual summaries of all proposals under the

five domestic programs. At this time they are being made available to

HSC, excised to protect sensitive informants, operations and for privacy

considerations.

2. Thirteen documents which have been released in response

to the Carl Stern and Fred Graham Freedom of Information Act requests

will be made available to HSC.

These documents relate to the initiation

of the Cointelpros and have been extensively excised to protect sources,

ongoing investigations and for privacy considerations.

ACTION:

• For information. The Legal Counsel Division should

arrange to obtain the above-described documents from Room 4063, JEH,

for delivery to HSC.

After determining that Oliphant and Vermiere had appropriate

clearances, I gave them a rundown on the structure of INTD, the substantive

matters handled by this Division, and the jurisdiction under which we operate

I also advised them that we will cooperate with the House Committee to the

best of our ability.

Mr. Oliphant advised that he was familiar with the Attorney General's

proposed guidelines under which the FBI will operate in the future and asked

what our position on these guidelines were. I told him that we were currently

studying the guidelines and at the completion of this study we would be glad

to discuss this matter with th/Committee.

By request, Inspector Bowers called on Congressman

Dale Milford of Texas, a Member of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities, shortly before 10 a.m. on 8-5-75. The

Congressman furnished the enclosed document which he said had been

furnished to him on 8-4-75. He said he had read it that evening and

was concerned some of the information contained therein might be classified

or based on classified information. He said the document, which he

described as a very detailed questionnaire regarding intelligence activities,

undoubtedly was prepared by someone with a good knowledge of intelligence

organizations in this country. He noted the document shows on its last

page that it apparently was prepared by the National Security Study Group,

Institute for Policy Studies, 1901 @ Street, Northwest; Washington, D. C

He stated he had never heard of this organization.

The Congressman

was fürnished a brief description of this organization based on public

source material. Congressman Milford said he had not supplied a copy

of this document to CIA and had no objections to our furnishing them a

copy.

A copy of the document has been forwarded to CIA through the

Senstudy Project Personnei of the Intelligence Division.

During the brief conversation with Congressman Milford--

he was rushing to attend a meeting of the House Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities--he expressed grave concern over damage being

done to the intelligence community by the demands growing out of some of.

determination on the part of some Members of the Committee to insist on.

With CIA. He said actions such as this undoubtedly will greatly weaken

our intelligence gathering capacity. He indicated the airline president

apparently had taken this action out of concern that the company might

run into difficulties with some foreign governments if it was in any

way connected with CIA activities.

The Congressman was thanked for having brought this

matter promptly to our attention and for his support of the intelligence

community. He offered to be of assistance to us whenever possible.

The document furnished by Congressman Milford contains

78 demands for information and/or documents. from CIA, compliance with

which would reveal the most highly secret operations of the organization.

Four separate categories are covered. These are (1) Table of Organization,

(2) Laws Governing the CIA, (3) The Budget, and (4) Policies and

Procedures Concerning Disclosures.

The FBI is mentioned only in passing in this document;

however, it can be assumed the National Security Study Group of the

Institute for Policy Studies is working on a similar questionnaire

regarding the FBI.

This afternoon (8/21/75) House Select Committee (HSC)

Staff Members James Oliphant and Richard Vermiere indicated to

Soprise to prompt see as the materia de at at the ela

would like to promptly see all the material relating to

COINTELPRO which has already been made available by access

or delivery to the Senate Select Committee (SSC). Because

of the considerable volume of this material and the fact

that Staff Members of the SSC are in the midst of reviewing

much of it, it was pointed out that the immediate production

of this material to the HSC would pose some logistical problems

and that, further, itwould probably be most difficult for

them to fully understand the material going into it "cold."

It was therefore suggested to Oliphant and Vermiere that

perhaps an oral briefing on COINTELPRO would be productive

to them.

They immediately accepted the idea and asked for

such a briefing as soon as possible.

We have made arrangements for a briefing as described

to take place commencing at 3:00 p.m. tomorrow

(8/22/75) in the

INTD Conference Room. It is planned that the following

individuals in addition to Oliphant and Vermiere will be

present.

Mr. Steven Blackhurst, who is Deputy to the Special

Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the Office of the

Deputy Attorney General has indicated a desire to be present

and plans to attend. It should be noted that we have already

cleared with Blackhurst our having the briefing and he indicated

it would not interfere with negotiations currently under way

between the Bureau, Department and the HSC regarding procedures.

INID Will be present yourself (Mr. Wannall),

Mr. H. E. Helgeson, Deputy Assistant Director, Mr. E. &. Pistey,

The Department by letter dated' 8/7/75 requested a DirectorS'y-

meeting with House Select Committee representatives to arrange

Ior procedures for the handling of requests. by that Committee.

The Department as of 8/18/15. had not received a response despite s

the fact we.had received requests from the Committee in writing

and also requests which were set forth in the printed trans-

cript for the. hearings with the Select Committee on Intelligence

dated August 7, 1975. We requested on 8/18/75. that the Depart-

ment expeditiously contact the Committee to determine when a

meeting could be held with Committee representatives to discuss

the aforementioned matters including the outstanding requests.

Steven Blackhurst; Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Co-

ordination, in turn advised a meeting was scheduled for 8/19/75

with A. Searle Field, Staff Director.

The meeting was held

as scheduled on 8/19/75 and in

attendance were Inspector John B. Hotis, SA Paul V. Daly and

SA Elmer Larson; Aaron Donner, Counsel, for the Committee; A.

Searle Field, Staff Director;

Richard Vermeire and Tim Oliphant;

Staff Investigators; Pete. Hughes; and Michael E. Shaheen, JI.,

Spectal Counsel for Intelligence Coordination; and his Deputy, u

Steven Blackhurst:

• Field stated at the outset of the meeting that he

did not accept nor would the Committee accept the procedures

concerning the production of documents. that. existed between

the Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Field and Donner both expressed the opinion that these prócedures

appeared to be much too restrictive. ' Field also stated that he

wanted it. understood that this was an investigation and that

there would be no courtesies extended. . He expressed his dis-

pleasure at the agreement existing between the Senate Select

Committee and the Department allowing for in certain

the review. by FBI personnel of notes taken by Staff Members

from Bureau documents and being told how in certain instances

to. handle information furnished. . He said there would be no

precensoring of any intormation by. the FBI before it

his Committee.

He felt that a prior review would be intimidating

and self-defeating and would not permit his Committee to acquire

the facts it needs to conduct a thorough and comprehensive in-

vestigation.

As an example of the type of information he in-

tends to obtain for the Committee, he cited the identities of

informants, payment schedules to informants and access for

interview purposes to intormants. His Committee is Interestec

in the auditing procedures which are employed and it may. be

necessary to recommend to the Congress that procedures be. es-

tablished which will enable the Congress to exercise oversight

in this area.

He said that the CIA is making their confidential

sources available to the Committee Staff Members for interview

in some cases in "safe houses."

• Field said that the Committee

matters and stands. coequal with them in the review of infor-

The purpose of the interview of informants. by. the

Committee, according to Field, would be to verify the payments.

made to any particular informant and to insure the taxes were

paid on that money.

A lengthy discussion concerning the existing pro-

cedures. by. the

Senate Select Committee and the FBI concerning

document responses was. had with Field by. both Bureau and De-

partmental representatives. explaining to him the necessity

for a structured guideline for responses. It was apparent •

that Field did not share the feeling that guidelines were

necessary in this area and remarked that he did not want to

. be constrained by any formed agreement in this area but 'rather

from the FBI and his feeling was to. date that we had not been

responsive on a timely. basis. Mr. Shaheen pointed out to.

Field that the 'Bureau had responded to certain other requests

and highlighted the Department's request of 8/7/75 for the

opportunity. to discuss procedures and guidelines for future

RE: HOUSTUDY

With respect to interviews of current and former

Bureau employees, Field was informed of the existing arrange:

ments with the Senate Select Committee allowing a Bureau

representative to be either present and/or available for. con-

sultation if requested by thé proposed interviewee.. He was

also informed of the regulations in the Department and Bureau

which require current and former employees

'to. be released, for

purposes of interview. by Committee representatives. He was

also advised that we have generally been informed in advance

of interviews. by Congressional Committees of the identities

of. current and former. employees who were to be interviewed and

of the topic of the interview so that appropriate arrangements

the Committee would want to. conduct interviews without prior

notification of the Bureau pointing out that current or, former

Bureau personnel might desire to be interviewed without Bureau

knowledge.

It was apparent that the Committee Staff Members of

. the

House 'Select Committee. do not have expertise on Bureau

operations that is enjoyed by the 'Senate Select Committee and

that it would be to our advantage to this point to educate the

Committee Member's with regard to FBI operations and in so doing

hopefully making their requests reasonable. Since the prime area

at this point. based on conversations with

'Committee Staff Members

appears to be informant operations including audit procedures.

concerning payments.

It would appear that a detailed briefing

in this area concerning our informant matters would be öf value

to the Staff Members.

At the meeting it was agreed that with regard to. the

House Select Conmittee request for all materials furnished to

they would subsequently request the material be delivered to the

Committee.

This is in accordance with the decision made by the

Deputy. Attorney General as relayed to the Bureau concerning the

furnishing of material given to the Senate Select Committee to.

the House Select Committee.

Subsequent to the meeting, Steven Blackhurst and

Michael E. Shaheen, Jr., advised that the Bureau should not pre-

pare responses concerning the requests made of Assistant Director

Walsh during the hearing on August 7, 1975. It was the 'Depart-

ment's intention at this point to request that the Committee

make

those requests. in writing.

Epocial Counsel for Intelligence Coordination, dated August 6, 1975,

requested our views concerning a request icom the House Solect

Committce for all materials and documents which we previously

provided to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. For the

reasons set forth below, we believe that the Department should not

comply with this request.

To begin with, this request will add to the already

substantial administrative ardens imposed upon this. Bureau by

various Congrescional committees. We con also expect similar

demands by the House Subcommittee ón Civil and Constitational

Rights, chaired by Representative Don Edwards, and Mrs. Abzug's

Sabcommittee on Government Information and Individial Lights.

addition, the House select Comminee hag asked for all documents

previonsly furnished the Ceneral Accoming Cifice at the request of

the Judicinry Committee.

Although we are not suggesting that information be.

withheld which Congress needs to make appropriate oversight and

legislative judgments, we feel that it should be sutticient that the

information sought is provided one Committee in Congress. Otherwise,

we will soon be at the point where the eifort needed to comply in a

tion in the Committee's letter. of 7/28/75: It was pointed

out to the staff members that some of the questions were so

non-specific and all-encompassing that they could not possibly

answered in a short period of time if at all. It was also

pointed out to them that some of the requests. were for informa-

tion that even if' eventually. compiled would be of minimal

or of no use"to them:

Some of the questions of this type were

the number of payments to the informants. and the number of

informants with a breakout of multiple payments'to a single

informant. They said that what they were really looking for

in a question of this type was that as of a given time we had

so many. Organized Crime

General Criminal, Internal Security

or Counterintelligence informants. and that they were paid a

certain amount of money. They indicated that if a question

•were

stated in such a way, that it were impossible or extremely

difficult to. answer we should set that forth pointing out

what would be involved in responding to the request so that :

they. could make a decision as to requesting the information in

a more 'limited form:.

They next inquired as to whether payments to general

criminal or internal

security informants. would be Larger.

responded that while all payments are different since they are on

• criminal informants. would probably be larger and pointed out

in a recovery amounting to several million dollars which would,

because of the 'time

and money saved in FBI efforts, entitle

him to. a rather substantial payment. They asked how much an

agent. can pay to an informant without getting approval. It was

explained to them none without any approval' and depending upon

the amount it would need SAC approval or approval'from FBIHQ:

A brief and general discussion took place of the

expenditure of Bureau funds in which it was 'explained to

them that approximately 79 percent of Bureau expenditures are

for salary and personnel benefits and that these plus rent;

communications and utilities bring the total to almost 90

percent: They were told that all other expenditures. must be

borne from within the remaining ten percent of this which

included such things as automobiles, equipment, supplies,

travel and any other necessary expenditures to support our

investigative personnel.

advised that funds were not. budgeted for, spent Ior or accountec

for. under any program known as COINTELPRO

Finally, they asked if we had not conducted

several project evaluations. They were told that the. 'Office

of Planning and Evaluation has. done a number of indepth 'studies'

of: Bureau operations which were apparently. the evaluations

to. which they referred.

The foregoing is submitted for information and

offered by the FBI in any Bureau case since 1937, and this

Bureau does not réquest furids for this purpose.

It should

be noted that tho Attorney General has the statutory authority

to pay retards up to $25,000 for Information or capture of

any person vanted for violation of criminal laws. In this

regard, on the specific instruction of Attorney General

Robert F. Kennedy, a reward poster was issued by the

Department of Justice August 4, 1961, in the amount of

$10,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction

of anyone violating Federal statute in connection with

highjacking of an nircraft. This vas a Departmental offer

and was not considered an FBI matter.

Item j requests access to all payments and breakdown

thereof made to persons outside the FBI with respect to

intelligence and counterintelligence activities.

This is to inform that above-requested information

is not readily available from payment records naintained by

this Bureau.

Payments of this type made by Bureau field

divisions would be inoluded in the monthly report submitted

by each field division, entitled "Confidential Funds and

Informant Report" under the category of Miscellaneous

Expenditures. Similar payments could also have been made

by FBI Headquarters. In order to accurately respond to this

request, all miscellancous expenditures made by field divisions,

as well

as by FBI Headquarters covering a designated period,

would have to be manually searched and compared with background

material relating to the authority for such päyments. To be

responsive to request contained in Item I would involve an

extensive commitment of Burcau manporer and resources adversely

affecting ongoing and current operations.

Their develoyment frequently

requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuading

them to cooperate in furnishing information.

Care must be exercised in

attempting to persuade individuals to act as

informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence. An individual

who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in retura.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to

informants who

supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

the assistance:

another important lactor in the initial problem of getting a potential

informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment

sometimes generated during the handling of a case.

Agents must be alert

to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects

and to capitalize on

Should a subject indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,

and should be be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his

background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re-

contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

BUREAU POLICY

All investigative activity must be made a maiter of record in the fiela

office files with all sources

of information being completely identified.

Sources include all confidential informants - criminal, extremist,

or security.

Agents must not have and use informants known onlj to the individual

Agents personally.

Criminal informants must be advised that they are not Burear employees:

It must be recognized that many

such intormants are also criminals and

considerable care must be exercised in dealing in them so they will

not become aware of and have the opportunity to obstract the Bureau's work.

Arrangements must be worked out so that at least two Agents are in a posi-

tion to contact

each criminal informant.

For a short time afier an inform-

first developed, it may sometimes be necessary to have one Agent make

all contacts.

a program must be established and actually started

within six months after

the informant is developed to establish a working

arrangement so that a second Agent can contact such an informant.

arises in which this cannot be done, the Bureau must be informed.

Consideration should be given to the assignment of specific projects to

good informants, particularly those who have had little current opportunity

to furnish information beczuse of a temporary lull in criminal activity

area in which the informant is utilized.

All informants and potential informants should be contacted as often

as necessary, but at least one

personal contact should be made every

thirty days,

unless there is

substantial reason for not doing so.

Information from informants of interest to another Government agency must

be furnished to that agency.

When information is passed on to local or

other investigative agencies, or acted upon by the Bureau, the identity

of the informant must be fully protected.

When it appears

that a criminal informant or potential criminal inform-

ant shows indications of emotional instability.

that routine, everyday contacts with criminal informants will result

in a relaxing of our rigilance to protect informants.

It must almays

be remembered that one slip or one misstatement may cause a criminal inform-

ant to be killed.

Where prosecution is contemplated in a matter in which information has

been received from an informant and the USA can give no assurance of his

ability to protect

the informant's identity, no further aotion is to be

taken until the Burezü can be advised and the case can be discussed mith

the Department.

Informants should furnish information to the Bureau exclusively.

representatives of some other agency or

investigative jurisdiction so. far as it is possible to do

•not become involved in procuring evidence regarding violations not within

Debriel all informants

and sources on at least a monthly basis regarding their knowledge of

narcotics activities.

Criminal informants should be cultivated on Government reservations when

the investigative problems warrant this action but do not develop inform-

ants among active duty military personnel.

The office supervising an informant must furnish to any other office

using him a summary of information as to the informant, such as de-

scriptive data, mode of travel, criminal background, an up-to-date

DEPARIMENT POLICY AND OPINION

The Department has issued instructions to tell all USAs that informants of

the Bureau shall not be interviered or subpoenaed without prior consent of the

Department.

Any deviation from this policy should be immediately brought to

the Bureau's attention.

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question whether

an informant could be prosecuted for technically riolating the law while

attempting to obtain evidence regarding a Federal riolation.

The Department

intent throughout was to assist the government agents in

the enforcement of the law, and not to riolate or to cover-up, for a vio

lation of the law, it is not believed a case for prosecution could be made

against such an informer...."

TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM

The top echelon criminal informant program is zimed specifically at developing

informants sho can provide a continuous flow of quality criminal intelli-

gence information regarding the leaders of organized criminal activity

throughout the nation.

It is directed at developing informants in the

following categories:

Informants who are

members of La Cosa Nostra (LCN)

Informants who can furnish significant information regarding other

organized criminal groups

Informants at the top level of organized gambling activity who can

provide information that will enable the Bureau to effectively

enforce the anti-gambling statutes

Infuinonus who can produce accurate and authentic data regarding the

extent of

graft and

corruption in each sector of the nation

Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Burezu

to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber

is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

This program calls for the selection of targets for develooment.

selection should be based upon a combination ol a particular hoodlum's

qualifications by virtue of his position in the organized hoodlum element

and upon circumstances indicating his possible susceptibility to development.

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

igents in Charge of approving confidenvial expendivures nich may aù some

time be subject to question.

The Bureau refers particularly to those ex-

pendituras made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants.

It has been necessary for the: Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expenditures made when it appeared tha, the ex-

penditures made were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

of the information ras concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a tendency

growing up in the field for special Agents in charge to approve confidential

expenditures for l0g and 15% and other very minor amounts which probably

should be subject to further scrutiny by the Spacial Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenaitures but must insist that each spacial Agent in Charge perscnally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction. It is understood that with the type of internal security.

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

.of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful hanaling of expenditures from the confidential

tund and the submission of morthly reporus in connection therewith.

You are avare, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential"fund in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the casn balance on hand, plus disbursements which

have been made auring the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such monthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to otherrise maintain an accurate

record upon the casis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at

the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts fron $10

to $20. At the time the monthly statement is submitted by the field

office involved, such

statements invariably fail to indicato that the

expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55321 DocId: 32989713 Page 150

---

## Page 151

-?=.

an accurate accounting on the part of the Bureau

n

respect thereto.

For your guidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in maich discursements, avances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed.

All subsequent monthly statements

prepared by

your office should be submittea

strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Spacial Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue

slips. For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt attached..

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

•of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the Sureau is necessarily avare of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types

cê investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential

expenditures wherever it is possiole and otherwise

practicable to do so.

Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and .

related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

iccordingly, it is

desired that you forvard to the Burcau in the near future a detaileà

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that

same may be properly inventoried

on the bureau's records. Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment.

With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate non-expendable receiving slips. Such slips should indi-

cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue

slips. The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted

and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances

where field offices fail to submit non-expendable receiving slips:

NW 55321 DocId: 32989713 Page 151

Accordingly,

desired that the non-expends

eceiving slips

•covering purch

so? furniture: bedding, and

ser equipment by

paynent.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

your innediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected

that

in the future there will be strict compliance with the fore-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies may be logically concluded wiin a mininum of delay.

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

confidential und.

then Bureau authority hes. been granted for an expenditure

of this nature, ine field office is required to give such authorization on the

confidential item submitted to recleim the expenditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expenditures. In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is noted that in many instances there

will be no recora of the expenditure having been authorized. .

In the future when authorization is frented for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division must be savised.

If the field office 1s

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be rade for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517. If authority is grante telephonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Aâministrative

Division by nemorandim, giving the name of the person to nom payment is authorized

and the field office involved..

The above instructions are to be placeà into effect immediately in order

to preclude the delay which is now being experienced in determining wether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices were properly authorized.

RE: ACTIVITIES OF TES

CONFIDENIIAL FUND

The Bureau is desirous at the present tire of bringing to your attention

tho absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures from the con-

Isntial Iund and the submission of moathly roports in conncotion thurewith,

You are aware that under existing Bureau regulations It is absolutely

essential that an appropriate staterent be sanitted at the end of each month

reflecting the condition of the Confidential Fund in each field office, Including

therein its stetus with respect to the cash balence on hand, pius discursements

which have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

monthly statonents promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly

difficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in correction therewith. As

set out in SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, all Confidential Furd reports

should be received at the Bureau no later seen the 20th of the following sonth.

•For your guidence in the preparation of future monthly reporis concern-

Ing Confidential Furd exyenditures: there is enclosed a sample form which outlines

briefly the proper rethod of preparing the report. In addition, there is enclosed

a sample form which outlines the retrod which should be used to summarize

• payments to infoments and confidential sources. In this regard your attention

1s directed to Saction (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, which is

retised in that the Atomic

Energy informants should be deleted from the report.

The surmary should now reflect rayments to Criminal and National Defense

Confidential Sources.

It has bee

noted that In a, great number

instances Special Agents

have not been sucmitting receipts to justify the expenditures for which re-

imbursements are being clained through blue slips.

The Bureau is aware of the

fact that receipts cannot be secwrod in each and every instance, que to

exigencies peculiar to certair types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been

noted that sore are beins prepared too such in deteil. In those instances where

the payment is made to an authorized regular paid informant, the following

infornation is

sufficient to support the clein:

1. Amount of payment

2.

Hare and symbol number of informant

3. Case

4.

Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of beyment

A sample form reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip

Is attached.

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming susperded blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that the item was

suspended from a previous voucher. It is pointed out that no reference shouid

be made to the previous roucher nor should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with the

roucher.

Your attention is directed io the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of funds availabio to operate the Confidential Funds of the

field divisions, therefore, you should make every effort to operate on your

present fund.

It is pointed out that à more frequent submission of Contidential

Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund.

• In the future when an office desires to esteblish a Confidential

Fund, it will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full and complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

Immediate personal attention and

supervision.

Tery truly yours,

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES -

FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently

being followed by the various field divisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling

the operations of the Confidential Funds maintained by the various

field divisions should be

established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund

authorized for the field division. Transactions that

suild affect this rund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fünd.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received fron the Informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amouni to

be accounted for by the field aivision.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount

-to

be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page. shall be

lutilized to reflect all

cash transactions which affect the total

fund.

This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two, which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained indef1-

nitely and should be used

as the basis for the preparation of the

captioned "Miscellaneous."

The

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e, in either the

Bureau column. Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts

column, there should be a

corresponding entry in' one of the credit

Receipts .from Bureau column.

- It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "sum-

mary of Payments to Informants" In connection with the monthly

report.

The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the crealt side of Column one from. the

total of the debit side of this column.

•3. An individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the leager should be aivided Into three parts; namely, Criminal,

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization l's made by

Bureau letter and the date of

incoming letter when authorization

Is made by stamping "approved"

on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the rield division requesting authority.

Before making

any aisbursements from the Confidential

Fund to an informant,

the auchorization should be shecked

sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and

that the

period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization. These authorizations should be posted In the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau.

In connection

with sac authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

f1le (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

After a careful review of the many suggestions received

In response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-

Ing funds from the Confidential fund has been designed, a copy of

which is attached. You may print a supply of this form for use in

your office.

•FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have

been approved for your office.

A CODY Of FD-235 Is to be placed in

the FBI Form Book.

This form should be prepared in duplicate by

the Agent requesting

the funds, and after approval by the Agent

supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the sAC for his approval

before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the SAC and

after the employee handling

the disbursements from the fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accorcance with existing authority,

one copy of the

•form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be

divided into two sections: namely, an unvouchered file ars a

vouchered Ille. These icrms can de used ber the employee responsible

for disburserents from the fund

as the basis for preparing blue

sllps for submission io the Bureau. Of course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the

informant Is obtained from

the Agent making the payment, and in

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the

Agent making the payment.

At the time the voucher 1s prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim-

bursement is made

by the Bureau.

At the time reimbursement is

received,

the voucher should be

removed together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an item has

been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,

it would be necessary

to remove the Request for Funds form from

she voucher on which the blue slip was requested and returned to

the unvouchered file until such time as 1t is resubmitted or It 19

• determined 1t will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared

and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month following

the period during which the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested and âlter a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five).

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under the direct supervision or the special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly

designated Fleld Supervisor.

The fund should be audited

once. each

six months, on June 30 and December 31.

This audit shall be

personally performed by a Scecial Agent Accountant. The report of

this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of

July and the trentieth day of January. In those instances where

the confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and

Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

• regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the Field Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures

section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired

to illustrate the

following

points:

2.

All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All Items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

c .

The explanation should reflect the

name and symbol number of the informant as

well

as the period covered by the payment and

in case of miscellaneous expenditures,

a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted. for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

. dum. An examole

such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau, Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connection with the surmary of payments te informants:

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion.

This breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources

for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them

expenditures.

should be included under miscellaneous

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to: the

informant should be shown on the blue slip.

This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the Item have been

received from the Agent making the payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient Information to allow the Bureau to make

proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under bureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhitit Number Eight). These

samples

are general but should be used

as a guide for preparing all blue

slips.

In addition to the attached samples, 1t is desired

the following be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each

payment. It is not desired to have numerous

payments listed

on a single blue slip in view

of the possioility of error which would result

in the necessity of suspending the entire blue

slip; whereas lf only one payment were listed

on

the blue slip, 1t would be possible to re-

turn only the one Item and the

remaining items

could be processed for payment...

b. The authority must be clearly reflected

on the blue slip.

When authority is based

the letter Irom the Bureau, actual date ci che

Bureau letter shall be used as the date or the

authorization. Then the field office, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

authorization has been granted in the form of a

copy of the field office letter returned by the

Bureau with the Bureau approval stamped thereon,

the date of the authorization in this instance

shall be .the actual date

of the field office let-

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

c.

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body of the blue slip. For example, see

"period"

_reflected in body of

Exhibit Number

SiX.

It is

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, both by time

and amount.

Receipts should be obtained whenever

possible.

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the refusal of the informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

on

the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting recelpt of money from the SAC 1s

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

In all instances where the receipt signed

by the informant reflects payment was made to him

by the Special Agent in Charge, reimbursement must

be claimed on a voucher of the Special Agent in

Charge. If the receipt reflects payment was madé

Informant by the Assistant Special Agent in

Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a

voucher of the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment

was made to the informant by someone other than the

Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent

In Charge of where there is no payor designated, the

blue slip may be submitted for payment on the

voucher of either the Special Agent In Charge

or the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

the receipt reflects that payment was made by a

person other than the one claiming reimbursements.

Form ID-221 must be executed and attached to the

•blue slip. It is advisable to nave the inform-

ant's: receipts'executed in the name of the

employee actually making payment or in blank in

order that the Special Agent in Charge or the .

Assistant Speclal Agent in Charge may claim

reimbursement.

The Blue slip should not reflect the

number

of the check issued and no reference

should be made on the blue slip to the Inform-

ant's field file number:

&. All blue slips submitted on the monthly

expense vouchers of special Agents must bear the

approval or the special Agent in Charge; however,

the Speclal Agent in Charge may delegate authority

to the Assistant Special Agent In Charge or an

approved field office supervisor to sign his name

as approving official fcllowed by the initials of

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or the

supervisor.

h. Receipts obtained by personnel which

reflect payments to informants and sources

should

reflect the ACTUAL DATE payment is made to the

informant or source.

The receipt should in no

Instance reflect any other date. The Receipt

should also show the EXACT AMOUNT paid to the

Informant or source, 'and every Special Agent sub-

mitting receipts should thoroughly understand

this procedure.

manner to the Bureau.

7.

Miscellaneous.

It is desired to bring the following

miscellanecus items to your

attention:

When submitting blue slips covering

payments to informants from another field

aivision, the informant should be identified

on the blue slip by indicating his name, symbol

number and fiela division.

b.. The words Confidential Fund should never .

be mentioned on a blue slip. When claiming for

bank charges, the blue slip should reflect pay-

ment to an official of the bank by name for serv-

ices rendered.

c .

SAc are linited to ộ200.00 to criminal Informanis

and sources; and to $100.00 to security Informants

ant has been paid under Bureau authority, pay-

ments cannot be made under the authority of the

SAC even in instances where the informant has been

_discontinued as a regularly paid informant.

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenalture authorized by the Bureau complies wich existing ranua

provisions and

that the Bureau receives appropriate value lor

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge

to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat

of Government employees

to be judicious in authorizing expenditures

to he more end

to practice propsi economy.

For your information, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenalture and w1ll

trace

through the files information received and results obtained,

following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

In the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

very truly yours,

FASHLINGTON 25, D.G.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it

Is felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to inicrinants on sAc authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants.

It was suggested that the In-

formants' files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,

2954, be entered on the informants' individual ledger pages.

This

would apply only to payments made under SAC authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable

time and work in the field, and you are accordingly instructed

to put it in effect with the establishnent of the new accounting

procedure.

very truly. yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director.

.2. Fallure to properly explain laci. of receipts has been

4. The receipt signed by the informant should reflect the

name of the person actually making payment.

Any departure from tinis

should be fully explained on the blue slip.

5.. In the future where a symbol number has been assigned

ta the Informant, only the symbol number should be reflected on the

FD-221 und FD-22la forms; however, the name of the informant shall te

BLUE SLIPS

.

In the preparation of future blue slips, the

following Instructions should be adhered to:

The blue

s11ps should show the correct name of

the individual being paid. Any difference between this and

the name used by the Informant in signing a receipt for

psyment must be explained on the blue slip.

When a name

other than the individual's full correct name is used in

Initial development as an informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue silp as soon as lt 1s known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure

Is necessary to enable the

Burean to properly control payments and to make sure that

all payments to one individual are consolidated. It has

been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the Individual's middle name as a last

name. This 1s especially true in connection with Spanish

names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying

a separate account of payments under each name.

Fake sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the need for consistency.

18 paid by your division, the blue silo claiming reimburse-

to nave been vis sor the chao

In addition, where an informant or individual

ment should

refer to the fact that he is formerly from the

other division.

This 1s necessary to insure that the

Bureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for

payments irade.

The Bureau has noted that in many instances the

field 1s not following instructions concerning the forrard-

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-22la be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

'the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant receipts.

The matter concerning security for

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security:
