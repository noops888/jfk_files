ANTRUNK-11

10 NOVEMBER 1964

MSG NO 12 ( SHOULD BE 116). TODAY I WAS IN CARDENAS.

As: Ti. 1x-15)

AGREED TO GET EVERYTHING OUT (FROY THE CACHE) INCLUDING THAT

FROM THE SALI BEDS. UNTIL NEW ADVISE, DO NOT ENTER ANY OF THE CANALS

IN CARDENAS (MUNICIPAL TERM?) INCLUDING THE SALT BEDS. IN THIS LAST

PLACE (SALT BEDS) THEY HAVE INSTALLED TWO 30 CALIBER (LIGHT MACHINE

GUNS), THOSE WHO ENTERED (THE ARZA) LEFT A PACKAGE WITH THE LETTERS

¡MUSA" AND AS IT SEEMS LOGICAL THIS HAS AROUSED SUSPICIONS. FELIX INTRUNKIO

SAID THAT HE HAS NOT WRITTEN FOR LACK OF USEFUL INFORMATION, FELIX

ALSO TOLD ME CONFIDENTIALLY THAT HE WISHES TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.

HORACIO DID NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.. THE ONE WHO WAS ARRESTED WAS ONE OF

HIS RELATIVES WHO WORKS WITH HIM. I HAVE NOT HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH

HE CAME WITH HIS FAMILY, THE MEDICINES THAT I NEED ARE SOME TABLETS

FROM THE LILLY LABORATORIES FOR DIABETES, INSULIN "NOVA LENIA", U-80.
