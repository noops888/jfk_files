TEK TASk FORCe

It is noted that ROY EMORY HARGRAVES, an American

adventurer and mercenary, in July, 1970 advised he was

involved in a plan along with Miami Cuban exile IVAN VIDAL

SANTIAGO to effect warfare between the United States and

Cuba. The plan consisted of attempting to have defecting

Cuban military personnel fire missiles against the U. S.

Navy Base, Guantanamo, Cuba, thus projecting the United

States into a military takeover of Cuba.

HARGRAVES said

he was closely associated in this plan with GERALD PATRICK

HEMMING, another American adventurer and mercenary, and a

long time friend and associate of IVAN VIDAL SANTIAGO.

On December 23, 1970, Detective VINCENT OLLER,

Dade County, Florida Department of Public Safety, Miami,

Florida, advised that he had been notified by the U. S.

Coast Guard and U. S. Customs Agency Service, Miami.

Florida, that VIDAL, HEMMING, and HARGRAVES were involved

in a plan for military operations against Cuba..

OLIER said that these three individuals are

well known in the Miami area, their credibility is seriously

doubted, and because of this, the above Federal law

enforcement agencies have discounted their claims and

turned the matter over to local authorities.

CONETOENTIAL

RE: IVAN VIDAL SANTIAGO

OLLER said he interviewed HEMMING and HARGRAVES

and found their claims highly unlikely in that they do not

possess the knowledge, money, equipment, or personnel

necessary. For such an ambitious project.

OLLER stated

that they devised an unworkable scheme and then unsuccess-

fully contacted different U. S. Government agencies to

obtain backing and support.

OLLER stated their scheme had been discontinued,

never had any potential for success,

and it would be a

matter of time until they came up with some other equally

proposed unrealistic venture.

MM T-1, who is a

close friend and associate

Of VIDAL, HARGRAVES, and HEMMING, in February, 1971, advised

that they have completely discontinued their plans and

at the present time are inactive in Cuban revolutionary

matters. HARGRAVES continues to claim he has a back

ailment and cannot work as a construction laborer.

HEMMING is now associated with Captain (First Name

Unknown) MILTON of Miami in a business of delivering

commercial type fishing boats from Norfoll, Virginia

to Miami, Florida. They also plan to deliver some

of these

• boats to Nicaragua.

MM

T-1 stated that VIDAL continues to live in

the Cuban exile colony in Miami, is considered inactive,

and is not significant in Cuban exile political matters.
