WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 730-C advised that a new modern car wash

business, known as Sav-On, opened about I½ months ago at

10550 Biscayne Blvd., Miami, Fla. He also advised that

while getting his car washed at this establishment, he

observed JOSEPH FISCHETTI (Miami File 92-99) in the office

with the manager and they were going over some figures and

the books, which gave him the impression that JOE FISCHETTI

has a piece of the operation. In conversation with the

manager, MM 730-C related that the manager said he had a

sister,

ELEANOR ROTH, who is secretary to JACK ENTROTTER,

owner of the Sands Hotel and Casino at Las Vegas, Nevada,

and who was in Miami for a visit last year. He stated she

stayed at the Fontainebleau Hotel, Miami Beach, Fla. This

source further stated the manager told him that JOE

FISCHETTI, being close to BEN NOVACK, operator of the

Fontainebleau Hotel, secured everything for her at this

hotel and that it did not cost her a cent.

MM 606-C advised that HYMAN MARTIN (Miami File

92-218) is one of the biggest bolita operators and book-

makers in the Miami area.

He stated at the end of January,

1963, the "pay off" to the Constables and Dade County

Sheriff's Office amounts to about $7,000 a week in Miami
