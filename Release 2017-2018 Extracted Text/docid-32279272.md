Reference is made to pages 40 - 48, report of SA

MANNING C• CLEMENTS, 2/18/64, relative

to allegations RUBY

was in Cuba in late 1962 and

early 1963, and specifically

to the allegation he traveled to cuba by air from Mexico City.

Legat, Mexico City, by communication 3/65, furnished

Information received from CIA in a memorandum dated 2/27/64,

as follows:

"Information available to this office fails to

confirm that subject left Mexico for Habana, or arrived in

Mexico City from Habana by air anytime during 1962."

Reference pages 23 - 29, report of SA MANNING C.

CLEMENTS, concerning efforts to identify one "DAVIS,'

" with

whom RUBY had allegedly been in contact regarding shipment

of merchandise to Cuba.

The Miami Office has

advised as follows:

on 3/5/64, MM 639-S, true name HOWARD K. DAVIS,

advised he had seen newspaper photographs of JACK LEON RUBY

but had never seen him before, never had any dealings with

anyone with that name and had never met him in Houston, Texas.

It is noted

MM 639-S 1s from Chicago, Illinois;

Palm Beach and Miami, Florida, and does not have any criminal

record

Miami sources and informants were contacted with

negative results concerning the identity of DAVIS.

Local federal agencies advised they do not know

anyone possibly identical with DAVIS.

Reference is made to page 772, report of SA MANNING

C. CLEMENTS, 11/30/64, Dallas, and Dallas airtel 1/29/64,

soncerning a notation found in effects of RUBY, as follows:

"CARLOS CAMORGO (probably CAMARGO) , telephone

14-9628, Mexico Öity."
