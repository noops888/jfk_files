On January 7, 1958, NO T-3 advised that JOSEPH

is manager

of the Nola Printing Company. T-3 believed that PORETTO

actually has some financial interest in Nola, but it is

general knowledge in gambling circles that the company itself

is owned by CARLOS MARCELLO. At the time of the interview

with T-3, the informant said that the wire service provided

by Nola costs $60.00 a week for individual books and $108.00

a week for bookmakers who operated business places.

The informant stated that in the middle 30's,

PORETTO lived in Houston, Texas where he operated as a

gambler. He got in trouble with the Texas Rangers and was

ordered out of the state.

PORETTO returned to New Orleans

and began associating with JOHN. J. FOGERTY, who then operated a

horse race wire service in New Orleans. Informant said

MARCELLO moved in on FOGERTY and took over the wire service,

whereupon PORETTO associated himself with MARCELLO.

On December 17, 1957, NO T-4 advised that it is the

general opinion among bookmakers in Jefferson Parish that

Nola is controlled by CARLOS MARCELLO and that the operations

are managed by JOSEPH ALBERT PORETTO and MARCELLO's youngest

brother, JOSEPH MARCELLO, JR.

On January 3. 1958. NO T-5 advised that

was the local representative of the Trans-American Publishing

News Service Company,

the Southern News and Publishing Company as JOSEPH ALBERT

PORETTO and one SYLVESTRO CAROLLO;

- whom he described as a

local Italian alien and an ex-convict who had been the subject

of a deportation case since 1937. FOGERTY was of the

opinion that PORETTO and CAROLLO were receiving the financial

backing of CARLOS. MARCELLO.

With regard to the Mississippi Gulf Coast,: NO T-6

while acknowledging that gambling and the sale of illegal

liquor flourished, advised on September 20, 1961 that

this activity is carried on by local individuals of Anglo-

Saxon descent with no organization and no leadership.

NO T-7 on September 19, 1961, confirmed the opinion expressed

by NO T-6 as did NO T-8, who
