Enclosed for the Bureau, Detroit and Memphis are 4,

of a tape made by an Edwards pocket recorder worn by L

on 1/10/64.

The recorder apparently did not operate properly

as it varied in speed and also much of the conversation was

inaudible.

Detroit and Memphis should disseminate a copy of

the enclosed LHM to WILLIAM FRENCH and WALTER J. SHERIDAN

respectively.

For the information of Detroit and Memphis, Chicago

has obtained another Edwards pocket recorder from the Cleveland

Office which will be used in the event of future meetings

and VERHELLE.

The original and 2 dub tapes are being forwarded by

separate cover to the Bureau with the request that the Bureau

attempt to bring out the inaudible portions of the tape on

Bureau equipment.

(M) . . . Do they have that kind of money . .

(V) . . They don't have that kind of money .

Inaudible

(M) As a director you're liable

Inaudible

(M) In other words by giving them this letter

(M) You're putting them on notice.

(V) We're putting them on notice:. •

Inaudible

(M) I

just wondered. . you know if

(V) ..

• Sully Sherone our attorney,

he

told me that he had

seen Jimmy of course they were

on this negotiation and he is the one who told me

about

• that they're moving down to Chattanooga and

•'

from

the work we've done

in that state, knowing that state

just

• I don't see how he's gonna get a fix in there. I

don't know. This is the toughest one he's ever had.

Inaudible

(V)

•

• Jimmy's head attorney

(V) . . That's the fellow from town here.

(M) Oh, he's from Detroit .

Inaudible

(V)

.. and he had just come back .

• this was before they got

the move. they're all scared to death

(M) Well, I'm not sure that that isn't actually gonna be the route

the other hand I've never

clannishness up in New Hampshire or the clannishness out on

say North Shore in Chicago.

Those people are all related to

each other and unless you're in, you're out.

Now that would

be true.. they wouldn't like Jimmy but they're not gonna like

Bobby either.

(M) One thing that concerns me though is when we talked in Washington

and talked about the

possibility of Chicago and so on...

(M) I can't see how it's gonna do one darn bit of good to have the

fix in Chicago.

If he gets convicted in Tennessee, because

from Tennessee it comes to Chicago and with a recent felon,

because under those circumstances

Inaudible

(M)

•At least we can keep track of it in Chicago because

weili be in a position to help... apparently they're just

not sure that the one down South is right on the line . .

Inaudible

(V) I don't think it's helped him a lot to get it moved.

(M) Well; I think as a matter of fact it's probably hurt because • •

little town . . .

(M) Sort of a home town thing where everybody knows everybody and

there is certainly no industry there compared to Nashville . .

law of averages get friendlier.

Inaudible

(M)... and anybody that's on the bench down there is gonna listen

which is from that point of view a practical thing but it bothers

me cause he's gotta come out of Tennessee without a conviction

otherwise when he comes to Chicago.

Inaudible.

(M) I think that it could be done, I really do . , ah . . and it

can be done fast but . ah :

• if they're gonna move, they

gotta move and move fast.

• . true ...

(V) It can't be done by Jimmy, it's got to be done by somebody ...

(M) else that's in an entirely different industry, you as a banker

or somebody like myself as an engineer • . •

(M) I agree absolutely •

• it better be somebody . . that can

.. other reason to be talking to these people

• • have

nothing to do with the situation down in Chattanooga at all but

•. ah . . I think it can be done but it costs money.

(V) Like, any idea?

(M) Well, I would just guess, I would think that

•• ah.. to

delude the top guy would

cost a quarter of a million bucks.

Maybe, even half a million.

Campaign contributions I don't

think they're interested in. I think they'd be interested in

real money.

Maybe

• . • on

a COD basis, that way you know

somebody doesn't get paid before they get ... ah

• cause

they work on the honor system down there anyway, they always

have. but that the only way . ... the reason I know is that

even though we have this bankruptcy in . . . all kinds of

qualified

or out of it, they don't care but that's it.

No hitches, no

problems.

Inaudible

(M) You think you can get them to come up with that money .

(M) Did you ever talk to Jimmy about this
