ANGELO BRUNO, aka.

(00: PHILADELPHIA)

ANGELO BRUNO's prolonged absence from Philadelphia,

presently visiting

Palermo, Italy, confirms for sources

PH 591-C* and PH 614-C-TE that PETER MAGGIO handling BRUNO's

legal business interests while PHILIP TESTA is handling BRUNO's

illegal interests.

MAGGIO, during the current week at BRUNO's

request pressured RAYMOND

MARTORANO and today collected $8,000

from MARIORANO for payment due BRUNO from sale Penn Jersey

venaing, Inc., service contract.

LEstA apparently acting as

number two man in Philadelphia settling "Family"

disputes in

behalf of BRUNO. However, interest to note that ANTONIO POLLINA,

BRUNO'S

predecessor,

Family "La Causa

"Representando Officiale"

, Philadelphia

Nostra,

has conferred during past week and

did confer 4/15/63 with

MARIO MAGGIO and PETER MAGGIO first

in effort to raise funds to buy out a partner in Medallion

Provisions Company;

failing to do so, obtained their counsel

for POLLINA to sell his interests. POLLINA is the only person

known to sources who seeks assistance outside of BRUNO's or

TESTA's sphere of influence.
