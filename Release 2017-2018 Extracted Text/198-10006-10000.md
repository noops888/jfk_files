Considerations for Ul folloy Toward

Cube and Latin America

I. US POLICY OBJECTIVES

1. Us policy toward Latin Amerion la to Increase the

stability of the area, to strengthen friendly democrutic

goverments, and to prevent the establishment of Castroite

and anti US

regines.

None of these seen attainable so long

as Castro, with Boviet support, rules in Cuba. Accordingly,

the most immediato US objective in Cuba la the replacement

of the Castro-Communist regime by one compatible with the

goals of the United States. Current US policy in pursuance

of this objective is to leolate Cuba from the Western Homi

sphere and the rent of the Free World and to exert maximum

possible pressures, short of open and direct US military

intervention, to prevent the consolidation and stabilization

of the Castro-Communist rogine.

the CIA covert action pro-

gram is designed to support other governmental measures to

proliferate and intensily the pressures on Castro; 1ts

ultinate purpose

1a to encourage diantdent elements, particu

larly in the military, to carry out a coup and eliminate

Castro and the Soviet presence in Cuba.

II. PROSPECTS FOR ACHIEVING THESE OBJECTIVEB

2.

The situation in Cuba Is characterised by econonic

stagnation, deprensed living condition, the loss of

revolutionary impetus, and the dinillusionment of an 1i

creasingly large mjority of the population.

To mome extent

thie 19 a result of tonate economto deflolenotes in Cuba,

and more recently, hurricane Flore; but to a conniderable

extent, the probio contronting the castro regina have been

magnified by Chatro's own Ineptitude and by the Ua policy of

econome and politloal isolation, and other barassment and

sabotago measures. Castro's position apponre to be eroding

gradually and recently he has been forced to sdopt Increasingly

harsh mensures to mintain his control. We bollove that a

continuation of prement US polley over the nort 18 to 84

months w1ll produce a mbatantial further deterioration In

serious inplientions for Castro's poultion.

But Us prestre

met be intenalfied 11 the deteriorating altuation vithin

Cuba 1s to result in the overthrow of the Castro regime In

the foreseeable future.

$.

Despite whatever probles he has been having In

Cuba (or perhaps because of them), Chatro has recently inten

f10d setions alned at fomenting violence, subversion and

revolution throughout latin Ameriod.

Given stable political

conditions in this region, Cantro'n limited mubvermive capa

bilitles would pose no immediate threat to Us interests.

But mince polltical conditions are highly fragile in many

Latin Amertean countries, the threat fron Cantro ta real and

his recent caution as evidenced by the Cuban arms cache dig

covered in Venezuela, his call for violent revolutionary

action to take place in Peru, Brazil, and Panana, In December,

and his threat to cut off support from his follower. in other

countries unles they initiate early action.

While we belleve

that these actiona are evidence of some demperation and that

they may even baokfire, they neverthelon demonetrate Castro's

determination to pursue an all out campaign of revolution.

The key quentions then, are how much time does Castro have

he set dangerous revolutionary fires

throughout the benisphere. A corollary quention is whether

present US requirements. Our vlew is that the pace is slow.

and 1e allowing Castro a dangerous latitude in bin Latin

American program of subversion and revolution.

We believe

that Cantro's recent activities in latin America now provide

us with our opportunity to pursue a more openly aggressive

retaliation approach against the Cantro rogine, both unflaterally

as vell an in collaboration with the countries of the OAS for

Joint action designed to remove Castro.

III. COURSES OF ACTION

A. Invasion

4. A muccessful Invasion of Cuba would provide the most

direct, simplest, and expeditious way of removing cetro.

This course has been shunned up to now largely becaune of

concern for world reaction and the ponsibility of encalation

into global war with the fovlet Union, which to at least

mormlly committed to defend the Chutro regime. However,

several new feetors have become apparent aince the gaine und

costs of an invasion courne were last thoroughly aramined over

But

unduly basardous operational condition around these

Inutallations for maritime raide and concern over the

much raide.

Moreover,

the effectivo dange that can be
