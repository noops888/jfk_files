J.C. King on 22: November 1963 (see Item 8 in the bäckup

documentation), allegedly played a direct role in the

decision to put the photographs into the hands of the FBI

As far as I know,

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a cropped

as well as photographic, of both the soviet and Cuban Embassies was

conducted by the Station on 22 and 23 November 1963 after the

that there was no ClA photo coverage of OSWALD at any time during his

Lee Harvey OSWALD - CIA Coverage of His Mexico Cise Stay

15. The totality of Mexico Station coverage on, or reasonably

inferable to be OSWALD, consisted of five (5) voice intercepts as follows:

Washington but having this visa, she could conmunicate to any place

OSWALD is known to have arrived at the Flecha Roja bus terminal on bus

It was, therefore, possible for

him to have made this call.

But granting this, it is unreasonable to

believe the calls were OSWALD's for the

following reasons:

a.

The caller wanted visas, and specifically

for Odessa.

OSWALD wis seeking a visa and never in any

context did he specify

D.

The call was directed to the correct Sovlet consular

number:

15-60-55.

On 1 October, OSWALD first called the wrong

number, 15-69-87 (the MA's number), and had to redirect his call to

the correct number, 15-60-55.

It seems unlikely he would have made

what would have been his initial call, on Friday the ?7th, to the

correct number, and called the incorrect number on l October.

There is every reason to believe from the context of the

The

The relevance of this intercept to OSWALD is excludable on three

grounds:

The use of broken Spanish.

OSWALD throughout used broken

Russian or English.

-He had no competance in Spanish to handle a

conversation of this kind.

b.. The substance of the request indicates a visa request in

the first stages of initiation.

OSWALD had developed his matter

well beyond the stage indicated by the substance of this call.

was no photographic coverage of OSWALD on l'October: if the follow-

Ing reasoning is correct, that was as it should be. From the context

of the two calls, there would have been no reason

for him to go to

the Embassy. 'His case had clearly been placed at the sufferance of

the USSR Embassy in Washington: His two calls on 1 October were

concerned with whether any reply had been received from Washington.

identification data derived from the voice intercept and the descriptive

data derived fron the photograph, the Station reported the two elerents

as separate facts in its. cable to Headquarters on 8 October.

19. The Station's action was not unusual and really amounted to an

analytic "quantum leap," justified by the primitive and inflatory status

of the OSWALD identification. Many examoles of a similar kind of thing

can be found in she day-to-day record of Station-leadquarters correspon-

collateral details drawn fran a preliminary file review:

It is believed that OSkiLd may be identical,

to lee Henry (sic) USbALD, born on 18 October 1939

in New Orleans, Louisiana, a former U.S. Marine

who defected to the Soviet Union in Octöber 1959

and later made arrangements through the United

States Embassy in Moscow to return to the United

to the departments which, on the

record, were concerned with the OSWALD

case:

3. OSWALD's middle name mas misgiven:

"terry" for Harvey.

The reason for this mistake is simplicity itself. The sheet openiny

the file on OSKALD

on 9 Decerber 1960 had been erroneous ly inscribed

"CSWALD, Lée Henry." That sheet-unchanged except for the notation of

the error--is still the first sheet in the OSWALD file.

D. Mis wife's maiden name was misspelled: "PUSAKOVA" for PUSAKOVA.

Neither of these errors are significant (though they persist in the

Headquarters communications throughcut. the mönth). More important was:

c. Paragraph (2) of the Mexico Station's report, which dealt with

a concurrent, but separate, phenomenon, the description of an individual

observed going into and out of the Soviet Embassy, had been locked on to

Lee OSWALD as an alleged descriptive

fact. The Station's qualification,

"appeared to be an American," was transformed in the flat designation of

the unidentified individual as "The American."

There can be no question that this misreading of the Mexico Station report

was an

analyst's error

which escaped detection in the coordination before

release: the descriptive details attributed to OSWALD were so far off the

mark as

to be inmediately recognizable as such by the recipients in Head-

quarters, among whom both the Navy and FBI had photos of OSWALD. (In partial

explanation, if

not exculpation, be it recalled that as of that moment ClA

had no photograph of OSWALD in Headquarters or in Mexico City to refer to.)

23. Confirmation of this judgment is provided by the contents of

the cable composed

by the same analyst and sent as of 2209Z time (two

hours later) to Mexico Station, referencing its 8 October cable:

keep these two matters apart as Investigative faces.

But things did not

work out that way.

25. Mexico Station on 15 October 1963-asked Headquarters to

to the Department of the Navy the following message on 24 October 1963:

"priority pouch a photo of OSWALD so that Station

can check all recent coverage for OSWALD. Forward-

•Ing soonest coples of only visitor to Soviet Embassy

on 1 October who could be identical with OSWALD."

28: It is clear that Mexico Station had forgotten that according

to its own communication the unidentified male in the photo was of

"apparent age 35 and that the accurate description of OSWALD forwarded

by Headquarters on 10 October precluded the Identity with OSWALD of the

person whom they regarded as the "only visitor to the Soviet Embassy on

)'October who could be identical. " .

29. The Station meanwhtle had begun an exhaustive and accelerated

review of all its technical and photographic intelligence. A dispatch.

was prepared in accordance with the indication given

in the cable of

22 November, cited in paragraph 25 above.

The dispatch noted that

photo coverage of the unidentified individual had turned up on 4 and

15 October at the Sortet and Cuban Embassies, respectively. The text

of the 22 November 1963 pouched dispatch read:

"J. Attached are coples of the only photographs

Attached were eight photographs: four (of which two were marked

1 October on reverse) showing the Individual in a white shirt, and four

(unmarked on reverse) showing the individual in a black shirt. It

would

seem to be logical

that the word "sets" was probably omitted from

paragraph two of the dispatch between the words "two" and "photographs."

That the Station was working" under forced draft is clearly

apparent fron the text of the dispatch, which tacked on a material fact

.32. Concurrently with or before the foregoing cables to Headquarters.

the Chief of Station, Mexico City, had spoken directly by double-talk

telephone with the Western Hemisphere Chief of Division, Mr. J. C. KING,

and secured permission to give copies of the photographs of the uniden-

tified individual to the Legal Attaché and to make then known to the

Ambassador.

33. What happened next Is best reflected in a personal note by the

Chief.of. Station to the WH Division Chief, malled to the latter from

Dallas, together with copies of the photographs, by the Legal Attachés

representative who delivered then to the FBI in that city.

34. The decision to remit the photographs to the FEl in Dallas

had been made by the Anbassador, according to the Chief of Station, who

simultancously:with the FBi agent's departure reported to headquarters

by cable (0244Z time, 23 November):

"FBI agent left here 2000 local time with two copies

each of six photos of a person suspected to be

35. Headquarters responded two hours later, 0422Z time,

"I. No need send staffer with photos. We have

asked Navy for photos again, but Mexico can see

OSWALD's picture soonest on the press wire.

36. On the 23rd at 1729Z time, Headquarters advised Mexico City:

"The FBI says that the photos of the man

entering the Soviet Embassy which Mexico

Station,sent to Dallas were not of Lee OSWALD.

Presúme Mexico Station has double-checked

dates.of these photos and is also checking all

pertinent photos for possible shots of OSWALD."

37. And at this point, 2048Z time, 23 November, Mexico Station

finally agreed:

"Saw photos of Lee OSWALD on television night of

22 November and it obvious photos

sent to Dallas

were not identical with Lee OSWALD held in DaTas

Dates are as given on photos.

"Mexico Station is reviewing all available photos

of persons entering Soviet and Cuban Embassies."

38. Two hours later (2254Z time, 23 November 1963) the Station had

reported the results of its effort to review all available coverage:

Note, only visit we know he made to Cuban Embassy

28 September, Saturday, on which Embassy closed

and we had not had coverage

39. With this conmunication the matter of the "unidentified

individual" reaches the end of Phase I, the key element of which is the

conviction, at first latent, then expressed, that the photographed"

individual might be identical with OSWALD. This applies especially to

the Station, though at a certain point even Headquarters moved no

rebuttal despite the hard fact that the description of CSWALD. and the

unidentified individual were quite disparate.

40. - This reviem has attempted to deal even-handedly with all items

in the case record that have a bearing on what happened. The operational

zeal, innovativeness, and the high committment of all involved,

espectally in Mexico City, speaks for itself. Equally apparent-

because of the 20/20 advantage of hindsight--is the evidence of

non-performance. It was a critical failure, for example, that no photo

of OSWALD was made available--though it was expressly requested both at

Headquarters and by the field--or that it was not more aggressively

ubriated--in a aux the more possession of a correct physical description

evidently could not--the whole successive deterioration of what began in

Mexico City as an impressionistic selection of the photograph on

1 October 1965 into a cause celebre today.

40. It should de clear from this factual survey that never had.

there been a cause celebre with less intrinsic merit. It is equally

clear fron the facts themselves that there was nothing contrived or

conspired in what happened, unless we have now descended to that point

in human values achiered under STALIN in the USSR and under HITLER In

Germany, where just a plain'mistake is per se evidence of conspiracy.

The Genes is and Bevelgment of Odum Exhibit No. i and

41. Special Agent of the FBI, Bardwell D. OOUM, on 23 November

1963 showed one of the six photos flown up from Mexico City the previous

day to OSWALD's rother, Marguerite OSWALD. ODUM himself had trimmed off

the background sy straight cuts. Mrs. OSWALD had no recognition of the

image in the photograph. ODUM's own detailed account may be found in

Hearings, op cit. Vor. XX. p. 268.

42. The photograph shows the unidentified individual in a black

in Mexico City on & citater 1262. two days after eSwilD had

43: At this poine, for the record, the total available photo

coverage of the unidentified individual numbers twelve (12) photográphs:

a. Five (5) taken on l October 1963, entering and exiting the

Soviet Embassy. " He is garbe

in a white shirt and

light-colored

c. Two (2) taken on 15 October 1963 in front of the Cuban

Embassy. He is wearing a dark, collarless T-shirt or light sweater.

The negatives.of all of these are extent and are now held in Headquarters

as integral parts of. the OSWALD and related file holdings.

44. The result of ODUM's display of the photograph--to repeat, a

cropped version of one of those noted under paragraph 43b, above--was

Mrs. Marguerite OSWALD's allegation that she had been shown a picture of

her son's killer, Jack RUBY, a day before he perpetuated the deed! Again

the Warren. Conmission Report (pp. 364-365, 367) exhaustively disposes

of this erroneous charge and requires no repetition here. A complica-

ting fact developed along the way was Mrs. OSWALD's (correct) observation,

## Page 36

14-00000

when she firally admitted befere the cormission that the ODUM photograph

was not RUBY, was that the photo had been cropued differently from the

one she had been stiown in Dallas, Inspector MALLEY's cropped version of

the ODUM photograph became Conmission Exhibft 237 (see Hearings,

V01. XVI. D. 638)

45. The net effect of the develements in the hearings of the

Commission was to require the admissior. of the cropped photograph into

evidence in a chain of depositions beginning with ODUM, Including the

FBI Inspector, James R. MALLEY (who had trimmed the photograph used by

the Conmission in Washington), and Richard HELMS, who deposed for the.

originator. These documents speak for themselves and will be found in

the Hearings, Vol. XI, pp. 468-470.

46. Mexico Station and other senior Agency officers strongly

advised against the publication of the photograph in any form on the

grounds that the Soviets would be inmediately alerted to the existence

of a useful and continuing U.S. intelligence operation, and the opera-

tion would go down the drain. There were repeated cables exchanged on

this point between Headquarters and Mexico Station during

the summer

of. 1964, in particular fran 23 September to 15 October 1964 when the

Station had plans underway to abandon the operation.

47. In acceding to the Conmission's request for a deposition,

Mr. HELMS, then the Deputy Director for Plans, replied affirmatively to

Mr. RANKIN by memorandum of 23 June 1964 which included

additlonal observation:

the follaring

"The Central Intelligence Agency reconmends that

this photograph not be reproduced in the Commis-

-sion's report because it would jeopardize a most

confidential and pratuctive operation. In

addition, it could be embarrassing to the indivi

dual Involved who as far as the Agency is aware

had no connection with Lee Harvey OSWALD or the

assassination of President KENNEDY:"

48. In this instance the needs of the Commission prevailed over

the DCI's statutory obligation to protect sources and methods. The

"Unidentifled Individual" remains to this day unidentified and there is

no credible evidence up to this time to rebut the assertion made by

Mr. HELMS in the concluding sentence-of-his- memorandum. to Mr... RANKIN on

23 June 1964. And

the operation did, as predicted, go down the drain.

Within a week of the public appearance of the Odum Exhibit No. I and

Commission Exhibit 237, members of the Soviet Embassy began systematic

efforts to survey the surrcunding buildings, ostensibly for rental

space, but clearly their inquiries were directed to spotting possible

camera sites. The operation was continued in any case. Within a year

it had become almost totally unproductive in coverage on Americans in

contact with the Embassy--a clear sign that this category of visitor

was being warned away by the Soviets themselves.

49. Is could be foreseen, there has been persistent pressure by

critios of the Warren Carmission Report to exploit Odum Exhibit No. 1

and Camission Exhibit. No. 237 for partisan interpretive púrposes.

considerable correspondence has accumulated since the end of 1964 1n

attempted to be

from the inception of the matter: to protect the method of acquisition

of the photograph and the

acquisition possible.

50. Following are highlights from the correspondence during the

current phase.

On 16 May 1967, over the signature of the General Counsel

:of the Agency, Lawrence R. HOUSTON, CIA voluntarily submitted a

statement about the photograph to Judge BAGERT of the Criminal

District Court for the Parish of Orleans, State of Louistana.

The response dealt affirmatively with the contents of the subpoena

that had been delivered to the United States Marshall In the District

of Columbia, despite the fact that the subpoena could not be

executed because of the lack of jurisdiction.

Mr. HOUSTON proferred on Agency behalf categoric assur-

on this occasion Mr. FENSTERWALD, who was accompanled by his

partner, Mr. Willian OHLHAUSEN, told Mr. HOUSTON and another

representative of the Agency in attendance that he knew who the.

unidentified man was. The following is extracted from MF. HOUSTON'S

and the assassination of President KENNEDY.

Mr. FENSTERWALD did not give us the man's name at

this time, as he said enough people had suffered

unnecessarily from allegations that they were

associated with the assassination, but he did

say he was

sure we

had

a file on the man.

He

astied if he could have the photographs, and l

asked how he could use them. He said he did

not know and finally agreed that for the time

being he would not press his request. :..

The whole meeting was extremely friendly and

they thanked us for our response."

The following is extracted from the Memorandum of Record

by the other ClA man present, Mr. Arthur E. DOOLEY.

"Mr. FENSTERWALD said he knew who the person

was

and had

spoken to him; that the man was tco

nervous

to come forth on his own. FENSTERWALD

would

not give

the man's name but said he is an

American, serving a prison term in this country

on a criminal charge, and that he had met OSWALD

in Mexico.

!asked whether the prisoner had any

conspiratorial relationship with OSWALD.

FENSTERWALD replied he did not know the answer

as he had not interviewed the man as yet.

We

reiterated that we did not know who the man

was, and said that we would like to knew his

Identity: FENSTERWALD replied that ClA has

MP. FENSTERWALD made no reference

in his subsequent

conversations and correspondence to this allegation about the identity

of the "Unidentified indiuldual," though the claim, if true, would

be of direct evidential Interest and possibly permit us to assert

with finality what we belleve has been the fact from the beginning:

the "Unidentified Man" has nothing

to do with the OSWALD case at all.

Ni. F. lensy Knoche

Assistant to tho Director

Hashington, D.C:

Deir Mr. Knoche:

As you know, Ice Harvey Owwald was in Mexico City in

Into Septonbar and early October, 1963.

shortly after

he left Mexico City a photograph was taken of in American

male and a question was raised whether or not this

male vag

Ice Harvey Oswald. The CIA and the warren Cormission both

dotermined that the picturo was not of lee. Harvey Oswald

aud that the picture wis takon after Oswald leit Mexico

city.

Although portions of this rocord have boen rolessed to the

public,

other portions have romalned classificd because

of concorns by the CiA at tho time that a rolease of the

full picture might disclose sources and methods which the

CIA felt were not in thu national intercst to disclose at

that tine.

In light of the false allegations about the

assassination of President konnody and the false allogations

of CIA involvement,

I [cel that it would be appropriate to

reconsider whether or not the entire matter con be fully

disclosed at this tino.

I would like to receive by April 22 a full roport from

the CIA on this entiro matter.

sincorely yours,

David W.

Belin
