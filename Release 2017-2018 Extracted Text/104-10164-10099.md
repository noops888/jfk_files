assassination attempts directed against refugee leaders who

were viewed as opponents of the terrorists' tactics. Three

men were shot to death. One was killed by a bonb. Three.

other attempted killings failed, but a prominent radio broad-

caster lost both legs below the knees when a bomb ripped his:

• On Dec. 34, 1975, bombs blasted the Miami office of the

Federal Burcau of Investigation, a Social Socurily office, a

State unemployment office, two post offices, a bunk, i State

#torney's office and the Miami police-department headquar-

ters. A man accused of those bombings, and also the bombing

of the Minmi International Airport two months carlier, was

acquitted recently in a federal court. He is to be tried again

in a State court.

CUBAN EXTREMISTS

(continued from preceding pago)

includes representatives from Dade County and Miami po-

lice, the U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Bureau of

Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Although the Federal Hu-:

reau of Investigation is not formally a part of this task force,

its agents work closely with it.

With co operation from Cuban refugees who are sich of

the terrorist violence, law officers have arrested a number of

suspects. Police also have learned enough about other sus-

pects so that their freedom to engage in new acts of violence

can be limited even though there is not enough evidence lo

prosecute them.

A federal grand jury is interrogating witnesses who might

have some knowledge of terror opcrations.

Efforts of law-enforce.nent officials to deal with the terror-

Ist groups face formidable handicaps, however: The terrorists.

seem to know what police are doing.

Licutenant Lyons

relates that one suspect "identified one of my officers who

hnd never met him before, called him by name und told him

what section he worked in and what his duties were."

Terrorists are protected by a web of old loyalties: Most of

them worked at one time.or another for. the U.S. Govern-

ment. Many have had several roles: members of. the U.S...

Army, CIA opcratives and FEl informants. One refuger

leader suggests that law enforcement officials have not found

the killers of Cubans "because they don't want to.".

A further complication is the heavy Infliration of the

terrorist movement by: members of Castro's Intelligenco

corps. They not only gather intelligence but sometimes act as

aronts provocateurs, instiguting terrorist acts designed 8o

escredit the refugees and influence American polley.

The Cuban Prans Minister has "surfere" chough of such

agents to reveal their pattern of opcration, larly, this your;

for example, Manuel do Armas, a Cuban refugco who uns

mamed in Senate committee testimony as having bren in..

volved in torrortst neilvities in Miami, showed up in llavund.

In an April 22 broadcast by Malia la anu, Do Arman moll

hat he had supplied the explosives used in the killing of a

man named Rolando Masferrer and that a CIA ugent had

provided him with the explosives.

n'a speech on October 15, Castro bounted of a doubl

rent who Castro cinimod had pansed on codlod Insiruetion:

was recruited by the ClAnd over a period of 10 years. the

suppened agent has kegs the Calan Government fully in-

formed of all his contacts with (the CIA| and of the equip-

ment and instructions he has received."

Castro blamed the CIA for the airliner bombing and other

uces of vinlence. "H'ho else but the ClA... can curry out

these acts?"" Castro asked.:

Sccretary of State Henry Kissinger has flatly denied U.S.

involvement in the airliner bombing. Ile said: "I can state

categorically that no official of the United States Govern-

ment, nobody paid by the American Government, nobody in

contact with the Arnerican Covernment has had anything to

do with this crash of the airliner. We consider actions like this

totally reprehensible.

Tho ClA declines to discuss. Cuban refuge terrorism.

Officials of other Government agencies say they seriously

doubt thut the ClA, after all the criticisen lt has received for

some of its curlier activities, is still involsed in operations

against the Castro regime. However, the agency is described
