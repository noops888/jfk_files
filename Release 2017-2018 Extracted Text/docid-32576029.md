NOTE: This misur is located in the Philadelphia apartment of

PH 672-C-TE. This Top Echelon informant isan admitted member of

La Cosa Nostra who has provided detailed information relating to

La Cosa Nostra in Philadelphia. Source was installed on 8/7/64,

at which time Philadelphia Office reported they had a unique

opportunity to make such installation since the itformant's family

was out of the city. The informant has ho knowledge of this

installation.

One

of the primary reasons for making the installation

was information developed that meetings might take place at the

informant's residence, possibly at times when he would not be present.

This source also serves to corroborate information furnished by the

informant.

Philadelphia Office reports that during the briefcus

period of time it has been activated there have not been any meetings

at the apartment.

This is partially due to the informant's work

schedule.

The informant is endeavoring to arrange an appointment

with Angelo Bruno, head of La Cosa Nostra in Philadelphia, to request

permission to use

the apartment in connection with Bruno's numbers

operation.

The cost to operate this misur is minimal.

It is felt

that it has an excellent potential and it is recommended that

Philadelphia Office

be authorized to continue it for

90-day period.

As previously explained, the purpose of this installation

was to have the installation

so that technical coverage could

be afforded meetings between SCAFIDI, a known member of La Cosa

Nostra,

and his associates.

It is also a means to check the

reliability of SCAFIDI, who is PH 672-C-TE.

To date the source

has furnished information regarding SCAFIDI's personal activi-

ties. Due to his work schedule, he has been unable to bring

about many meetings.

He is at the present time endeavoring to

arrange an appointment with Commission member ANGELO BRUNO to

obtain permission from BRUNO to allow his apartment to be used

two or more days weekly in BRUNO's illegal numbers operation.

This will furnish information heretofore unavailable to this

division, if the source is successful in accomplishing this

arrangement.
