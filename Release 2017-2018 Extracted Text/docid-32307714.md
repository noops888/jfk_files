The trial in the subject case has been set for October 26,

1959.

Attached is a list of names of FBI agents who conducted

interviews of defendants and co-conspirators, nost of whom will

be called to give testimony at the trial.

Usually two agents

participated in an interview and under normal circumstances only

one of these would be needed for trial testimony. In this case,

however, the attorney in charge of the case. has indicated that

he would prefer to see both agents in advance of the time of

testllying Ior purposes of preparation and, if possible, would

prefer to have both present while the principal withesses testily

in the event the other is needed.

In order to cause as little interference as possible with

the other duties of the agents involved, it is requested that you

authorize the individual agents to contact Mr. Milton R. Wessel,

Special Assistant to the Attorney General, United States Court

House, Foley Square, New York City, Courtland 7-7100, in order

to arrange a time and date of interview which is mutually con-

venient.

With the commencement of the trial itself Mr. Wessel will

a schedule of the estimated dates when the various agents.

In the event that for some reason any of the listed agents

will not be available for interview prior to October 19, or for

the purpose of giving testimony at the trial, it is requested

that we be so advised as soon as possible.
