For the Foreign Minister.

Real shock exists over. the assassination of President

KENNEDY.

Television, via Telstar, is showing touching

demonstrations in Europe.

The Chiefs of State from many.countries will attend the;

funeral services.

It is my personal opinion that your attendance would be:

advisable in view of the fact that the new martyr to human

rights was a great friend of

and was convinced of the

grandeur and hopes of the national

revolution
