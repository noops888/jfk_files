15. Remarks:

Bureau authority for the installation at TRAFFICANTE's

residence was obtained telephonically on August 9, 1962,

from the Bureau.

The installation was made on the same

date and placed in operation at 4:50 p.m., August 9, 1962.

The installation consists of a MATE which is installed

in the master bedroom of the TRAFFICANTE residence.

It

is noted that TRAFFICANTE formerly had a telephone in

this bedroom whichhas since been disconnected. TRAFFICANTE

and his wife apparently spend a great deal of time in the

bedroom, as they have a television set in this room.

It

should be noted that installation of a MATE in another

portion of the subject's residence was precluded at the

time of installation for reasons of

security.
