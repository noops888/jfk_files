_ AND ZUBON WILL ARRIVE SIMULTANEOUSLY. AS SOON AS BOXES

ARE LOADED ABOARD PLANE DOOR WILL BE CLOSED AND PLANE WILL TAXI TO AIR STRIP

AND TAKE OFF.

2. CHANCES OF STOPPING AND INTERROGATION SLIGHT. WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN

WOULD BE THAT AMCLATTER-1 WOULD BE RECOGNIZED BY AN OFFICIAL WHO ALSO IS AWARE

THAT HE IS BEING SOUGHT. THIS COULD ONLY TAKE PLACE DURING THE APPROXIMATELY

15 MINUTE PERIOD THAT AMCLATTER-I WOULD BE DRIVING CAR FROM ODUNIT ATTACHE

4

RESIDENCE TO PLANE SIDE, ALIBI WOULD BE THAT AMCLATTER-1 HAD ONLY A FEW DAYS

BEFORE APPLIED TO EMBASSY FOR JOB AS CHAUFFEUR AND WAS BEING TRIED OUT ON

PROBATIONARY PERIOD. ODUNIT ATTACHE WHO HAS BEEN AWAY FOR WEEK COULD CLAIM NEVER

TO HAVE SEEN HIM BEFORE AND MERTON WOULD GIVE THE ALIBI WHICH AMCLATTER-I WOULD

SUPPORT. SINCE IT NOT PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT AMCLATTER-1 IS WANTED BY AUTHORITIES

ODACID COULD HARDLY BE CRITICISED FOR CONSIDERING HIM FOR EMPLOYMENT AS A CHAUFFEUR.

3. IF AT ANY TIME PRIOR TO ACTUAL TAKE OFF IT APPEARS UNWISE TO PROCEED WITH

EXFILTRATION PLAN DUE TO PRESENCE OF CUBAN OFFICIALS AT PLANE SIDE OR FOR ANY

OTHER REASON, AMCLÄTTER-1 WILL CONTINUE PLAY PART OF CHAUFFEUR AND AFTER PLANE

TAKE OFF DRIVE ODUNIT ATTACHE CAR BACK TO ODACID BUILDING.

4. IT IS SINCERE BELIEF OF COS THAT CHANCES OF COMPROMISE ARE MOST REMOTE.

AMCLATTER-1 IS OF PEPRIME RACE, COMPLETELY BI-LINGUAL. WITH A CAP ON AND

DRIVING A CAR WITH DIPLOMATIC PLATES ACCOMPANIED BY TWO OFFICERS IN UNIFORM HE
