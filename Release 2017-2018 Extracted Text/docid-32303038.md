the past

month period. During this time he spent time with PHIL

MATTUCCI, a local gambler, and he frequented a newly opened

gambling establishment known as the Rainbow Gardens located

just out of town.

The informant thought that it appeared

that CICCAREILI was interested in working up some kind of

local

"deal"

...in the gambling business in town.

He apparently

was not successful as he is reported to have returned to

Florida.

On recontact on 3/16/59 this informant advised

that he has not seen CICCARELLI since he left last year and

as gambling in town is having. a hard time, he probably felt

he could do better back in Florida.

Miami will locate and interview CICCARELLI, aka.

Case, re his association with subject.

SUBJECT IS SAID TO CARRY SMALL CALIBER GUN AND WAS

ARRESTED IN 1943. FOR CARRYING A •38 CALIBER. REVOLVER; SHOULD
