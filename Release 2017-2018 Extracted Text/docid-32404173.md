MEMORANDUM FOR :

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Chief, Historical Review Group

Robert J. Eatinger, Jr.

Assistant General Counsel

Litigation Division, OGC

MHCHAOS Material Included Among JFK Documents

1. This memorandum responds to Ellie Neiman's request for

guidance on how to process MHCHAOS material found in the

collection of documents currently being processed by the

Historical Review Group pursuant to the President John F. Kennedy

Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (ARCA) .

2. I recommend that MHCHAOS documents concerning specific

U.s. persons be postponed in their entireties under the privacy

provision in Section 6(3) of the ARCA.

The Agency may present

the materials to the Assassination Records Review Boards at the

appropriate time and argue that release of the records should be

postponed because of various congressional statements that the

collection of information was improper.

Further, the information

does not in any way help identify President Kennedy's assassin.

3. In addition, specific items of information in the

documents may concurrently qualify for postponement under the

ARCA provisions protecting intelligence sources and methods.

Further, any MHCHAOS files on the National Lawyers Guild are

covered by a settlement agreement that precludes their release to

the National Archives and Records Administration until the year

2025. If you identify any such material, please notify me. I

will contact the Department of Justice.

3. I have found no court order mandating destruction of the

MHCHAOS materials.

However, the Agency did undertake to destroy

all MHCHAOS material in 1990. However, this destruction effort

was in furtherance of the Agency's routine records destruction

schedule.

The collection of documents the HRG is now processing

apparently was never searched for MHCHAOS materials during this

destruction effort.

However, the materials in the collection

could not have been destroyed even if found because the

collection was and remains the subject of the FOIA litigation

i eat tor the

Allen v. DOD.
