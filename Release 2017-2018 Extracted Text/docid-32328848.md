The records of the Credit Bureau of Greater New York were checked

by SE RALPH G. MURDY.

HAROLD ISAACS, rat

erences of the applicant, is subject of pending

case entitled "HAROLD ROBERT

SAACS, waS. INTERNAI SECURITY - R," Bureau file

100-286243.

The following information concerning HAROLD ISAACS was taken from

a Bureau letter to Albany dated April 25, 1945, marked personal and confidential

and entitled "AGNES SMEDLEY, INTERNAL SECURTTY - R." The letter was designated

as being strictly confidential information and not for dissemination to other

government agencies. Uhe letter stated that the following information was

received by the Bureau from highly secretive British sources. (

ISAACS first came to the notice of the British sources in 1927

when he was a free lance journalist in Shanghai. He founded an agency known

as the Far East Press Correspondents which was Cormunist in tone and failed

as a business. He next founded the "China Forum."

During 1931, HAROLD ISAACS was known to be staying at one of the

cover addresses used by HILATRE NOULENS, a Comintern agent, at 66 Hart Road,

Shanghai. During this year, ISAACS was in close association with oneFRANK

GLASS and was in correspondence with WALTER DURANTS, Bolshaya Ordruka 53,

Moscow.

In January, 1932, ISAACS solicited support for his paper, the

'China Forum" from R. PAINEDUTI, the well-known East Indian who is e

with NOLA ROBINSOl who was writing to him from Dresden, Germany, in the

preceding year. S

In August, 1933, information was received that ISAACS and his

wife were engaged in preparations for the Anti-War Congress to be held in the

Far East and left Shanghai August 7, 1933, for Japan to "select" the Japanese

delegates to this congress. This congress, however, was a pronounced failure (5)

its only results in China being the Chinese Section of the Anti-War League,

president of which was Madame SUN JAT-SEN and the secretary, HAROLD ISAACS. (S)

In April, 1934, ISAACS and his wife left Shanghai for Peking.

At this time, ISAACS had rec√©ived instructions from Moscow to leave China

and return to the United States.

No reason for these instructions could be

ascertained at the time, but after ISAACS had gone to Peking, it was learned

that in May, 1934, ISAACS had written a letter to the Central Committee of

the

Chinese Cormunist Party announcing his break with the Chinese Stalinists

and

announcing that h

had become a Trotskyist and had suspended his paper

the "China Forum."
