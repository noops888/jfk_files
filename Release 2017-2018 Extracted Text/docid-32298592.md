SECREU

NY 100-42479

ISRAEL EPSTEIN is reported to be closely associated

with TANG Ming-chao the founder of the

"China Daily News"

and

also a contact of the subject. TANG has been reported to be a

head of political intelligence in English speaking countries

for the Chinese Communists.

The subject, in discussing the arrest of EPSTEIN

and the purging of RITTENBERG, has stated that she tends to

discredit the stories but she

has also tended to take the

Chinese Communists position by stating that some people have

trouble keeping the right line.

This is another indication

of the subject's dedication and loyalty to the Chinese

Communists.

It would appear that the subject's impending

trip

to London is not a vacation trip because she

is traveling a-

long. It is to be noted that in all the subject's trips

abroad she has always stopped in London.

It would appear from the above that if the subject

has

any communication with the Chinese Communists this com-

munication is through London,

England.

Proposed Future Investigation

Because of the connection between

the subject and

person or persons unknown in London, England, it is felt that

coverage should be given to her activities while in London.

The NYO by relet of 6/12/68, has requested the Bureau

to seek the cooperation of the British Security Service in

giving coverage to the subject's activities in London. (3)

The NYO is remaining alert for information furnished

by NY 4047-S* which would reveal the identity of contacts

of the subject who could be developed as informants in this

matter.

As the subject becomes more active in the SDS it

is felt that informants, active in this organization, can be

targeted against her.
