More on-Oswald Case

FORMERLY classified transcripts of

Warren

Commission sessions disclosed that Lee Harvey

Oswald was such an "extremely poor shot" dur-

ing his stay in Russia in 1959 that hunting com-

panions had to give him game. The Commission

received this data from Yuri Ivanovich Nasenko,

a Russian secret police agent who defected to the

U.S. three months after the assassination of

President Kennedy, according to an article by

David Wise in the current issue of the Saturday

Evening Post. The same article said the Commis

sion tried but failed to see vital autopsy photo-

graphs to clarify "confusing" evidence about the

bullets which struck the President.

An effort to restore the Baltimore home of

FL. L. Mencken is being drawn up by Dennis Ales-

si, an employe of the State Planning Department

and a fan of the famed journalist.

UPI space writer Edward.K. DeLong said in

New Orleans the U.S. may launch a

massive

space build-up from "sheer fright" if the Soviet

Linion successfully orbits: a manned space plat-

form, in •1968.
