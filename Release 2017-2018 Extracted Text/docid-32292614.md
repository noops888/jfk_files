further insight into Giancana's interests and operations in Las

Vegas.

It has further been observed that since Anjoes Restaurant

does not have a gambling license, that various hoodlums who are

unable to frequent the licensed casinos will use Anjoes as a

meeting place. (U)

The second misur will cover Pignatello's residence, Apt. 131,

Diplomat Apts., 3478 Paradise Road, Las Vegas, Nevada.

Because of

the privacy the apartment affords,

and since it would

be a logical

location for Pignatello to engage

in discreet conversations with

Giancana

and associates, it is expected that valuable information

concerning Giancana and

his associates, particularly with regard

to their interests in las Vegas gambling casinos, could be obtained

through this coverage. (U)

The third misur will cover the residence of Dave Halper, Apt:

141, Diplomat Apartments,

3478 Paradise Road, Las Vegas, Nevada.

Halper is an associate of Giancana and formerly operated the Chez

night club in Chicago..

He is also a former partner of Charles

"Babe" Baron, a Chicago tof

• hoodlum who is also very close to Glancana.

Investigation indicated that Halper may be representing Giancana's

hidden interest in the Riviera Hotel operation in Las Vegas. It is

expected that information concerning Giancana's undisclosed interests

in the Riviera Hotel will be developed through this coverage, in

addition to valuable intelligence concerning the covert

of the Chicago hoodlum element in Las Vegas gambling. (U representation

These three installations will require leasing telephone

lines at an aggregate cost of $11l.20 permonth.

All of these

misurs will be monitored at a plant at the Sun N Sand Motel, 2200

Lay Vegas Blvd. South,

$204

these three installations has been estimated at $2051.52.

Trespass

is indicated in each instance and full security has been

assured by

the Las Vegas office with regard to each installation. (U)
