Details:

(U) Details:

(U) On 10/26/92, President George Bush

signed the legislation bringing the Act

to fruition.

The Act

requires that Government records related to the assassination of

President John F. Kennedy (JEK) be reviewed and processed for

release and sent to the National Archives for public access.

Congress initiated and passed the legislation because of the

public interest in the history and theories of President

Kennedy's assassination. The Act facilitates the release of

information normally exempt from disclosure under the Executive

Order and/or the Freedom of Information and Privacy Acts (FOIPA).

(U) While the Act contemplates maximum disclosure of

JFK records, certain information may be withheld if it meets the

Board's interpretation of the Act's postponement requirements.

The postponement requirements are standards for redactions

established by Congress to limit deletions, since their

intentions were for all the information to

be released bu the

year 2017.

The only exception to this is if the President of the

United States certifies that unique information should never be

released. Attached is a copy of the Act, which specifies the

basis for any postponements,

defines the requirements of the

Board and their decision making procedures, and the process for

handling the JFK assassination records.

(U)

The FBI's goal and standard operating procedure

under the Act is to maximize the release of information to the

public.

Postponements have only been requested where there is

compelling justification for doing so. In July 1995, the Board

began reviewing the FBI's documents containing postponed

material.

The FBI prepared evidence concerning the various

postponements for criminal informants, national security assets,

classified information, and foreign government information.

Concerning the informants and assets, the FBI presented the

judicially accepted legal arguments for protecting the identities

of the informants.

However, the Board has not always accepted

our justification

for postponement and believed the public

interest outweighed the reason for postponement.

Currently, HERU's standard operating procedures

include using more liberal guidelines releasing as

much

information as possible and providing evidence that notes if the

informant was living, deceased, or if no record could be found

identifiable with the informant.

the information provided is germane to the assassination or

theories of the President's death, which has happened with

Information Erom MM 4501-OA.J (5)

( MMA501-OAWas an associate of Antonio Vecianna.

Vecianna had related stories that there was a conspiracy

concerning the Kennedy assassination.

The Board is releasing

information from the informant's file related to the stories

about Vecianna and wants to have evidence as to the assets need

for protection.
