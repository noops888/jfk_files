MR. PIKE'S POSITION on the report of his House

intelligence committee is, in brief, untenable. He agreed

last September i• accepting certain classified in-

formation from the Executive branch that the White

House would be the final arbiter of what part of it would

be disclosed. To claim t'at his pledge applied to the

receipt of information then but not to the reporting of it

now is to make a mockery of his pledge and to undermine

the basis on which any future intelligence oversight

committee could ask for confidential information. That

the information at issue describes "atrocious and

horrendous things," in Chairman Pike's charac-

terization, does not dissive is obligation to keep his

word. Nor is it a suitable alibi that much of the in-

formation had leaked already. That merely raises the

question of whether the Pike committee was living up to

its obligation to maintain confidentiality in the period

before the release of the final report became an issue..

Fortunately, the Rules Committee was of a mind to

preserve the integrity of the House by holding up release

of the report until the full House had acted on it. And the

House followed suit last night by voting overwhelmingly

to delay disclosure. Mr. Pike has insisted that he would

release the full report or no report at all. We cannot

believe, however, that the House will be guided by his

stubbornness in the matter. Enough has leaked from the

report to establish that there is much of legitimate public

value in the sections of it likely to be approved by the

President. Chairman Pike's cry of "cover-up" will only

become reality if he is allowed to make it so.

• The whole episode in fact underlines the difficulties of

countenancing and controlling a secret agency in a

democracy-even an agency whose ostensible purpose is

to protect that democracy. Mr. Pike, not alone. went at

the intelligence establishment determined to root out the

abuses of secret power which had transpired over the

years.

Those abuses were real and frightening, em-

periling not only the liberties of American citizens but, in

the noon

?

some cases, the very security which the agencies were

meant to uphold. It is true, too, that to the extent that

power continues to be wielded unaccountably, there car

st no firm guarantee that it will not again be abused. It is

a fair question whether the costs of secrecy outweigh the

claimed benefits, which in the best of circumstances are

likely to be difficult to confirm. Mir. Pike has no corner on

honest concern.

The opposite risk is, of course. that too little weight will

be given to the "fact" that the world remains a menacing

place and that it would be tempting fate to go over to an

open security system which would deny the country and,

within it, the Executive branch the flexibility needed to

cope with what the President and his advisers perceive to

be grave national threats. This is, we think, the trap into

which Mr. Pike has fallen. Disclosure of the particular

secrets which he would now like to tell may or may not be

as harmful as the administration claims. The point is,

nonetheless, that the right to conduct some national

security affairs in secrecy must be upheld.

There can be no congressional oversight unless the

President takes the Congress into his confidence. But the

Congress cannot take the Congress into his confidence if

secrets are to be betrayed. Just how oversight should be

conducted and to what extent Congress should be em-

powered to veto operations which its overseers disap-

proved are questions being addressed in the proposals

for reform offered yesterday, for instance, by a majority

of the Senate intelligence committee. We intend to return

to these and other such proposals. If there is not a

modicum of mutual confidence and

trust between the

Executive and Congress, however, it becomes foolish

even to consider reform. The security of the country and

two branches. That is why it is so important for both of

them to keep the agreements they do manage to work out

with each other.

The committee rejected 8 to

Beyond that, Representative

Kissinger Contempt

Threat Now Fading

After Compromise

By Norman Kempster

Washington Star Staff-Writer

Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis, said today

he has received indications, that the

White House will permit the House

Intelligence Committee to examine

the documents involved in the panel's

dispute

with Secretary of State

Henry A. Kissinger.

Aspin, a member of the commit-

tee, said the informal agreement

apparently will provide the commit-

tee with the information it is seeking

without the committee's pressing a

contempt

Congress citation

against Kissinger.

Aspin told, reporters that Chairman

Otis G. Pike,, D-N.Y., has agreed not

to seek a flouse vote on the Kissinger-

contempt citation without giving the

committee an opportunity to reverse

its 10-2 vote charging the secretary.

with defying a subpoena,

ASPIN, WHO has been working

behind the scenes to head off a con-

trontation with Kissinger, said that if

Pike had not agreed to delay he was

prepared to make a formal motion to:

postpone action. Aspin predicted his

motion would have won on a 9-4 vote;

Aspin, said if the committee aç-

cepts the White House's informal:

proposal,

the documents. could be

examined only at the White House

and would not be surrendered to the

dommittee.

This informal procedure appears

be, the sort

of under-the table

compromise that could permit both

sides to save face.

""THE

COMMITTEE subpoenaed

documents detalling all proposals for

covert action suggested by the

administrations.

Covert action is the term

for secret efforts to manip-

ulate the politics of foreign.

the CIA they can be pro-t

posed by the agency itself,

IF THE HOUSE voted contempt,

the matter would go to U.S. Atty.

Earl Silbert for prosecution. If con-

victed by a jury, Kissinger could be

sentenced to up to a year in jail, al-

though Pike concedes that such an

outcome is highly unlikely.

"No one is, seeking to place Mr.

it until this morning.

BUCHEN SAID Ford authorized

the proposed compromise

"to meet

the legitimate needs of the commit-

tee for information on covert opera-

Ford has cited executive privilege

as the reason for refusing to comply

with the letter of the subpoena. How-

ever, a majority of the members of

the committee have argued that a

executive privilege concerning the

man who chooses his words carefully,

sat down in the blue-curtained studio of

the House radio-TV. gallery and

of accusing the Ford administration of

of the House Intelligence Committee.

The turnover came about only after

Pike had scheduled his press conferen-

Dellums Charges

Office Bugged,

Suspects FBI

By Norman Kemoster

Washington Star Stalf Wrier

Rep. Ronald V. Dellums, D-Calif,

said today he discovered an electron-

ic eavesdropping device on the tele;

phone in his district office which he

believes was placed there by the

FBI.

Dellums, a member of the House.

intelligence Committee, related

story of the bug as the committèe

was conducting a public -hearing into

illegal wiretapping by law entorce-

ment agencies and private organiza:

tions.

Dellums said he

discovered. the

* eavesdropping device in 1912 but lad

nột previously told the story in public

because he was attempting to deal

with the matter privately,

BUT HE SAID that even a member

of Congress apparently has no re-

course against illegal wiretapping.

Few responsible. citizens would challenge the need

tunity to take part in- the restructuring of the American

intelligence community and, even more important, of its

own future role in providing oversight. What is needed is

a single joint committee of both houses of Congress

which can excercise, the kind of power and discretion

that the Joint Committee on Ätomic Energy has exer-

cised during most of its thirty years of existence.

Recent legislation unfortunately requires six separate

committees of Congress- and about fifty Congressmen

and, probably, twice that number of aides--to be in-

formed oftevery covert activity that the Cald. 'under

revelations to be made about the details of intelligence

" Hearings before the House ethics

committee: into the leaks of informa-

tion from the House intelligence com:

mittee to CBS. newsman Daniel Schorr

have been revealing. One thing they

have revealed is that the intelligence

committee had about as much, talent

for keeping secrets as a Holywood gos-

sip columnist: The committee's own

counsel, James Olphor, said the panel

"did" not follow proper

security rules

during the time it was investigating the

country's intelligence agencies.

phant, top secret material was kept in

individual desks and some was even du:

plicated on office machines. so staff

members could have copies of their

own the more important question is

how capable the committee was to do

the job'it undertook,

The thought of a House panel carry.

ing out investigations into the most Se

cret functions of national security

agencies in such a slipshod manner is

scary: Certainly with this kind of opera-

tion nothing will be kept secret for

very long, and the Schorr incident may

have done the country area service i

exposing such poor procedure.

From the begiming, we felt that the

investigators were looking in the

wrong place in blaming: Schorr for the

leaks. The fault is in the committee it

self and that is where blame should be

placeda

National security is too important. to

be:handled so poorly, The intelligence

committee, which has criticized many

others, now is indicted itself.

White House

Held Lax With

Spy Report

Unauthorized Access

Rampant, Hill Aide Says

United Press Interuational

The staff director of the House

Intelligence Committee has testified

that unauthorized White House per-

sonnel, among many others, had ac-

cess to the supposedly secret intelli-

gence report that eventually leaked

to the press.

"I know of friends in the White

House who had absolutely nothing to

do with intelligence who saw it,"

Searle Fleid told House investigators

yesterday.

The Ethics Committee

investigators are trying to determine

who leaked the report to CBS report-

er Daniel Schorr.

"Who were they?" counsel John.

Marshal asked Field.

"I'LL TELL YOU in executive

(closed) session," Field replied.

Field, who ran the staff of the now-

defunct intelligence panel, was the

Ilth witness to testity in the final

phase or the four-months long, 15u

000 Ethics Committee, probe. He

denied he leaked the report and said

he does not know who did.

The Intelligence Committee earl-

er this year completed its probe of

CIA covert activities with a report

filled with classified information and

seyerely 'critical of U.s. spy opera-

tions. The House voted to keep the

report secret until President Ford

could censor it.

Schorr got a copy from a source he

reruses to identity and gave it to the

New York newspaper Village Voice,

which published much of it verbatim.

Field made

his comment about

"White' House personnet to Mlostrate." "-y

his claim c

supported by several

previous witnesses - that copies of

the report circulated throughout

Washington and eould have reached 2

Schorr in many ways."

FIELD SUSPECTS the leak came

from

someone

in

the

executive

branch and possibly the CIA itself, he

said.

Marshal asked Field to describe

the exterior of the Washington house

he occupied during the intelligence

investigations. After Field, looking

puzzled, did so: Marshalasked:

"Did. Miss"Susan Parker, come to

your residence Feb. 62*

"'I never neara the name." Field

replied.

Asked whether he gave a drait of

the report to Miss Parker, Field said,

"Absolutely not. I did not provide a

copy of the report to anybody."

David Bowers, the Ethics Commit-

tee's director of investigation, had

identified Miss Parker on Monday as

secretary to Clay Felker, editor-in

chief of the Village Voice. Bowers

said Felker sent Miss

Parker to

Washington on Feb. 6 to get the

Schort copy.

"She went to an unrecalled ad-

dress where she picked up a package

from a maid and returned to New

York by shuttle flight aware the

package contained a copy of the Se

lect Commmittee report,"

Bowers

had said Monday.

DURING

afternoon

yesterday, Field toot exet on to an

Ethics Committee investigator's re-

port that the intelligence panel had

lax security standards.

"IVe had better security than the

He said

his staft handled 75,000

classified documents and evey one

was accounted for and returned to

the CIA and other agencies that sup-

plied them.

The Ethies Committee adjourned

its probe until Monday morning.

Droppung the

An underlying condition ot Anglo-

Saxon democracy is that sensible peo-

ple do not press to the limit questions

to which there are no good answers.

That rule of thumb: applies with a

vengeance to the current inyestigation

by the House ethics.committee of the

intelligence committee report given by

Dan Schorr of CBS News to the Village

Voice.

The investigation touches an unset-

tled area of constitutional law. The in:

terest of all, parties including both the

Congress and especially the press: is

that the unsettled area be kept unset-

tled, that the moment of constitutional

truth be avoided

The elementary facts of the case are

simple. A House committee under Con:

gressman Otis Pike prepared a report

on activities of the Central Intelligence:

Agency, Copies of the report were ac-

quired by vr, Schorr of CBS and John

Crewdson of the New York Times. Both

men made known the contents of the

report through, their respective news

agencies.

The full Congress then voted to make

the report secret..

Whereupon, Mr.

Schorr, after some complex maneu-

yers, passed his copy off to the Village

Voice, a weekly put out in New Yors.

which it claimed, possibly wrongly; was;

the tull text of the report.

That sequence of events set up a por

tential conflict between two traditional

rights rooted in the Constitution. One is

the freedom of the press, as guaranteed

by the First Amendment. The other 15:

the right of the Congress to discipline

its members, and to punish by, con.

tempt proceedings persons refusing to

cooperate with legitimate congres

sional investigations.

The freedom of the press; and the

First Amendment need no endorse

ment in this quarter. Democracy. means

government by the people which im

plies open discussion and the circula-

tion of information as distinct from en

forced orthodoxy. The right to a free

press is thus a peculiarly cherished fea-

ture of our system, rightly enshrined in

the Constitution

The exercise of that right was central

to revelation and prosecution of the

Watergate scandal, and to the public

awareness of the true nature of the

Vietnam war. The right deseryes to be

having had its staff ask 285 people (in the House and

Executive branch alike) in vain whether they did the

poena CBS correspondent Schorr or other journalists

to put the same question to them under pain of con-

tempt. wraschorr, in obtaining the CIA report and in

using parts of it on his network, was simply honoring

his primary journalistic obligation fully protected

by the First Amendment-to tell the public what hes

knew. The same can be said about the Byzantine ma

neuvering by which he provided a copy of the report

for publication in the Village Voice whatever you

may think about that aspect of the affair. To demand

that he reveal his source when no allegation of a

crime has been made against him-would be an act

ot vengeance a cheap, way to distract attention

from the ethics committee's failure to find his source

on its own and trom the Pike committee's inapility to

conduct an erfective and orderly investigation in the

Everyone expected that publication would soon be

The answer lies in a considered congressional deci

The President's change of mind came

at a White House meeting shortly after

he read MeClory's letter, and in the:

face ofa strong no-compromise position:

by; both Secretary of State Henry

kissinger and william Colby, then

director of the GIA.

Colby, whose cooperation with the

Senate committee seemed boundless

was bitterly upset at the House com;

mitfee's leak revealing CIA knowledge.

about Egyptian communications on the

eve of the 1973 war Kissinger, a per

sonal target of the House committee,

which wanted him held in contempt of

the House, was equally bitter

Thus, after the:Presidenthimself had

been persuaded to abandon his no-wins

position by McClary and Republican

House leaders, Mr. Ford turned to

Colby and asked: "Bill, can't we give

them what they want?'

Colby's response Yes, sid, but we:

must, retain. the power of prior

clearance for actual publication of any.

classified material that goes to the Pike

committee.

Mr. Ford then in effect offered

himselfas guarantor of the-com

mittee's,good faith. He pledged to Colby

that if the full committee approved the

plan he and Pike had worked out no

release of state-secrets without prior

clearance he personally: would

oversee it and act as final anbiter of

disputes.

Further, the former House member

from Michigan, gave those present to:

understand that no House member and

no House committee would dishonor

any agreement so carefully constrücted

as this one.

That was the background for the

CIA's submission of every, significant

document asked by the Pikeicommittee

and for the incredible decision by nine.

members of the 13-member committee

to release its final report despite the

CIA's objection that it included 240

specific security breaches.

This was the decision the' House

(Mount Clipping in Space Below) .

Was CIA better?

Out of the confused welter of charges and in-

Vestigations of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)

and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), we draw

two tepative conclusions.

First, the CIA, as an intelligence gathering agency,

was more dependable as a rule than its bosses in the

State Department, the Defense Department, and the

White House.

I Second, the FBIs notion of what constituted un-

patriotic or subversive behavior was right out of Russia;

whether Czarist or Communist.

CHAIRMAN OTIS G.; PiKE of the

House. of

Representatives Intelligence Committee said the other

day the Ford Administration is blocking publication.of

the Committeels report because it makes officials like

Secretary of State Henry Kissinger look bad. "It's' the

people who were telling the CIA what to do who are

going, to look bád," he said.

One has no way of judging, since the Committee's

Report has not been published and won't be if the

White House has its way:

But there's a hint from the past. Like many other

people, we were startled by the Pentagon Papers

revelationthat the CIA estimates of enemy military, and

political strength in Vietnam were consistently more

accurate than the public statements from the Pentagon

and the White House that were supposedly based on the

CIA estimates. We learned a new respect then for the

CIA's skill at gathering and interpreting information.

(We consider intelligence gathering separately from

the ClA'si covert political and military activities

overseas; activities which, in general, we believe are a

wrong way for the United States to pursue a foreign

policy..)*

We suspect there's more truth than fiction in

Congressman Pike's charge, and we think the report!

ought to be made public so the public can make its own

udgment.

REVELATIONS abogt the mBrs aude

ty ward Martin Luther king are extremely disquieting.

I, has long been known that the FBl hated and per-

secuted the black civil rights leader. Lately it has been

charged that FBl agents or informants took an active?

part in the 1968 Memphis riots which were designed to!

discredit King's nonviolence and which drew King back

to the city where he was assassinated.

It's never been clear why the FBI. was so harsh toward

Martin Luther King. There seems reason to believe I

Edgar Hoover, the late FBI director, had a personal

hatred for King. But the involvement of many agents

and informants

,in anti-King activities, and the

exultation many agents felt when King was killed

suggest that the attitude had permeated deep into the

Bureau.

*, But why? Did Hoover or his agents truly believe King

was subversive? That he was out to destroy America?

King was absolutely transparent. Heystated his goals

and tactics publicly; again and again. There was no

mystery about him or about what he was doing. How

could the FBI imagine he was a threat to America? A

threat, perhaps; to that old institution, American

racism, but certainly not a threat to the America of

freedom and justice for all — the America the FBI is

supposed to be protecting,

Yet the FBI did misunderstand and misrepresent

King and hundreds of other patriotic dissidents:

One gathers that the CIA is better t understanding

what is going on in foreign countries than the FBI is at

understanding what is going on at home.

Chairman Otis G. Pike D.

ministration yesterday of

trying to block the House

intelligence committee's final

report pantly because it

makes officials, including

Secretary of State Henry A.

Kissinger, lookbad.

"It's the people who were

telling the CIA what to do whò

fare going to look bad," Pike

said. "AndT think, this is one of

the reasons they're very

anxious to sitomb."

"There's no question in my,

mind," Pike added later,

"that Mr. Kissinger was in on

the planningand approval of a

great many covertactions."

Pike was interviewed on the

television show Today"

(NBC-WRC)yesterday.

Siding, with President Ford

in the battle over release of

secret. information in the

report, the' House, in a 246 to-

124 vote Thursday; ordered

the committee to keep the

report secret or.get Mr. Ford's

approvalito publicly releaseit

Pike said the committee put

all 2,293. copies of the report.

clerk on Friday, so he will

have no turther say over what

Pike said. "But.not

recommendations and said

two

proposed

recom-

mendations are vital,

The first is that a tough,

Rules for Covert Action

A tough recommendation for scrupulous

control-but not aban- fall future covert

CIA operations abroad by a special new

presidential committee may now be long

postponed by the madcap deadlock over

release of the House Intelligence Com-

mittee's report.

The recommendation by the com

mittee's staff, which would have been

virtually certain of approval with minor

changes, is now in suspended animation

along with the controversial report itself.

The House refused to make the report

public for fear of damaging the national:

security, It overruled Democratic Rep

Otis Pike of New York, the committee's

chairman, in an explosive and historic

vote last week.

With the report at least temporarily

blocked by the deadlock between Pike and

the White House over whether it contains

vital national secrets, some members are

fearful that Pike will decideto jettison the

panel's still incomplete recommendations

governing future, conduct of American:

intelligence. These are designed to avoid

repetitions of past abuses by the Central

Intelligence Agency (CIA) andiother units,

without hobbling America's essential

espionage operations.

Indeed, the textured tone and substance

of the recommendations are at stark

variance with the gaudy political battle

over the committee's lengthy and now

suspended: report. They reflect a calm

maturity quite unlike the querulous in-

sistence of Pike and the committee

majority to break faith with President.

Ford by including state secrets in the

report. Their maturity also belies the:

climate of leaks and betrayals of con-

fidence that have so injured the com.

mittee.

Section: C of the draft staff report, under

the title "covert' action;"

sets pristine

rules for governing the most controversial

of all the manifold allegations of CIA

wrongdoing the so-called "department of

dirty tricks'or covertoperationa

It proscribes all "direct or indirect"

assassination attempts, except in war

time; and makes stringent demands on the

administration for all other operations:

Item: CIA Director George Bush must

"notify the committee in writing" as to the

detailed nature, extent, purpose and

costs" of any covert operation abroad;

within 48 hours of its approval by the

President.

Item: The President must certify in

writing that the operation "is required to

protect the national security."

Item: A proposed new

congressional

oversight committee to be established by

the House must be given uplicate

originals" of the written recommendations

on the operation by each administration

official on anew.subeommittee to be setup

within the National Security Council.

That subcommittee, called the Per-

marent Foreign Operations

Sub-

committee, would replace the present. "40:

Committee" and;. like the 40 Committeet

would be chaired by the President's NSC

assistant (formerly Secretary of Statel

Henry Kissinger, now retired, Lt, 'Gen,

Brent Scowcroft Further, the recom

mendations would forbid theNSC assistant

from holdingany other job in government;

ruling out another two-hat monopoly such

as Kissinger held for a year and a half as

the resident's national security assistant

and secretary of State at the same time.

Some administration officials are im-

pressed with the still-secret staff

proposals, and hope for their eventual

approval by both the committee and the

House despite the deadlock over the

report One reason: they try to come to

grips with the slippery andiconstitutionally

perplexing problem of preventing leaks of

state secrets to the press andpublic.

The committee staff sets forth a specific

the sharing of operational power with

Congress alarms some intelligence ex

political drama that has daily portrayed

the CIA as devil incarnate for the past

13 months.

This memorandum provides for filing of voluminous birector Soc'y

newspaper and wire service, clippings relating to the House

Select Committee on Intelligence Activities (HSC)•

Since the inception of the HOUSTUDY Project, we have

accumulated 3 thick folders containing newspaper and

wire service

clippings plus some additional material such as magazine articles

and other public source data.

Material maintained in tickler

folder, Sub A file was never opened.

Retained material is in

general, but not

precise chronologica. order.

With the end of the

HSC mandate, it is believed we should now provide for the final and

permanent retention of this material.

This matter was discussed by writer with Messrs

W. L. Bailey and L. W. Brady of the Records Management Division

handling would be to file this material as a bulky enclosure

behind file and that no indexing would be necessary Further;

that the original of this memorandum be filed in the main

and a copy be filed in Sub A

to 62-116464 which should be opened as a repository of it alone.

The presence of a copy of instant memorandum in the Sub A will

serve as a permanent flag advising where the material is actually

filed.

THE COMMITTEE'S PUBLICATION

LAST WEEK OF FOUR HIGHLY CLASSIFIED

THEY HAD FURNISHED FOR ITS INVESTIGATION®

THE COMMITTEE REFUSED, AND SAID IT WILL GO TO COURT

THEN, ADMINISTRATION

POKESMEN WOULD HAVE 24 HQORS TO EXPLAIN WHY

THE MATERIAL SHOULD NO BE DECLASSIFIED. AND COMMITEE MEMBERS WOULD

HAVE 24 HOURS NOTICE BEFORE TAKING A FORMAL VOTE ON DECLASSIFYING THE

SECRET PORTIONS.

PIKE SAID THE PROPOSAL WAS BEING FORWARDED TO THE WHITE HOUSES

WOULD NOT GUESS WHAT THE PRESIDENT'S REACTION WOULD BE. THERE WAS NO

IMMEDIATE REACTION FROM PRESIDENTIAL SPOKESMEN.

MEANWHILE, PIKE READ TO THE HOUSE A LETTER HE WROTE FORD SAYING A

RED FOLDER CONTAINING HIGHLY SENSITIVE MATERIAL WAS MISPLACED BY A .

STAFF MEMBER WHO "SHOULD

" THE LETTER SAID. "HE *

THE ONLY_CABINET MEMBER WITH A HUSBAND IS MRS.

CARLA HILLS,

SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT. HER HUSBAND, RODERICKS IS

A WHITE HOUSE COUNSEL.

COMMITTEE SPOKESMEN SAID LẠTER THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN IN A

TONGUE-IN-CHEEK STYLE BECAUSE "THE CHAIRMAN HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR,"

BUT IS NONETHELESS BASED ON AN ACTUAL INCIDENT.

THEY EXPLAINED THAT HILLS LEFT BEHIND A FOLDER OF SENSITIVE

MATERIAL AFTER A VISIT TO

PIKE SAID HE HAD, AND WHEN HILLS ASKED FOR IT BACK PIKE REFUSED.

EARLIER WEDNESDAY, PIKE REJECTED INFORMATION PROFFERED BY THE CIA

AND RETURNED IT SAYING IT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE BECAUSE IT WAS

INCOMPLETE AND STRINGS WERE ATTACHED TO ITS USE.

THE WHITE HOUSE SO FAR HAS FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE COMMITTEE'S

FUBPOENA FOR INFORMATION REGARDING

INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES RELATING

TO THE COMMUNIST TET OFFENSIVE OF 1958, PIKE SAID, BUT THE PANEL WILL

HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING THURSDAY ON INTELLIGENCE FAILURES DURING THAT

MASSIVE COMMUNIST ATTACK IN VIETNAM.

PIKE SAID THE COMMITTEE "WOULD NOT SHRINK" FROM TAKING THE

PRESIDENT TO COURT IF

• HE FAILS

FOR THE MOMENT PREFERS NOT TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE DELAY WHICH

WOULD BE INVOLVED.

BUTTERFIELD. THE FORMER PRESIDENTIAL AIDE WHOSE DISCLOSURE OF THE

WATERGATE TAPES LED TO PRESIDENT NIXON'S DOWNFALL, HELD A SPECIAL

CIA-MILITARY LIAISON CLEARANCE IN 1959 AND SPECIAL CIA INTELLIGENCE

CLEARANCES WHEN HE SERVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE.

IN A RARE PUBLIC STATEMENT, THE CIA ACKNOWLEDGED THE PRACTICE OF

DETAILING EMPLOYES

TO OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES BUT STRONGLY DENIED

THAT THIS AMOUNTED TO "PENETRATION" OR "INFILTRATION" WITHOUT THE

KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE AGENCIES.

BUT THE CIA

• DENIED THAT

BUTTERFIELD WAS EVER A CIA EMPLOYE OR

WORKED FOR IT "IN ANY CAPACITY."

‹THE WASHINGTON POST REPORTED TODAY THAT A 1973 CIA INSPECTOR

GENERAL'S REPORT SAID CIA PERSONNEL HAD FOR MANY YEARS BEEN DETAILED

TO "THE IMMEDIATE OFFICE OF THE WHITE HOUSE" AND TO OTHER AGENCIES

SUCH AS THE TREASURY AND COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS AND THE PRESIDENT'S

FOREIGN ADVISORY BOARD. ›

BUTTERFIELD, WHO RECENTLY RESIGNED AS HEAD OF THE FEDERAL AVIATION

ADMINISTRATION,.

WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT. HIS WIFE SAID HE HAD

GONE TO CALIFORNIA IN CONNECTION WITH A NEW POSITION. SHE SAID SHE

KNEW NOTHING OF A CIA CONNECTION.

CONFUSTON FRIDAY BY PUBLICLY INSISTING THAT BULTERFIELES ALSSIA

A RETIRED AIR FORCE COLONEL, CREATED CONSIDERABLE

FORMER AIR FORCE OFFICER,

HAD BEEN A CIA "CONTACT MAN" IN THE WHITE

HOUSE WHEN HE WORKED THERE IN THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION.

PROUTY INSISTED THAT AS A "CONTACT MAN" BUTTERFIELD WOULD BE

EXPECTED TO LOOK AFTER CIA INTERESTS. FACILITATING CERTAIN ACTIONS

AND POSSIBLY SHIELDING SECRET OPERATIONS FROM EXPOSURE.

ASKED BY NEWSMEN IF BUTTERFIELD MIGHT HAVE SPIED ON PRESIDENT

NIXON FOR THE CIA, HE REPLIED: "IN THIS CASE.

WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY RON NESSEN. TRAVELING WITH PRESIDENT

FORD TO THE MIDWEST, GAVE REPORTERS A WRITTEN STATEMENT WHICH SAID:

"WE HAVE NO INFORMATION TO SUBSTANTIATE THE ALLEGATION THAT A MEMBER

OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION WAS A SECRET CIA AGENT OR INDEED ANY

KIND OF CIA AGENT: NOR HAVE WE HEARD OF SUCH INFORMATION."

CONCERN THAT THE CIA MAY HAVE BEEN "INFILTRATING" UNDERCOVER

AGENTS INTO THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER_AGENCIES WAS AROUSED BY REP.

ROBERT KASTEN, R-WIS., A MEMBER OF THE HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE.

SEN. FRANK CHURCH. CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE'S SELECT INTELLIGENCE

PANELS SAID FRIDAY HIS INVESTIGATION HAD TURNED UP NO EVIDENCE THAT

THE CIA HAD "PLANTED" SECRET AGENTS IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT ITS

KNOWLEDGE. BUT HE ADDED:

"FOR A LONG TIME THE CIA HAS SUPPLIED PERSONNEL THAT HAVE BEEN

DETAILED TO THE WHITE HOUSE AND OTHER PERSONNEL HAVE FROM TIME TO

TIME BEEN DETAILED TO OTHER EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT.

"THE PRESIDENT HAS KNOWN THAT THESE CIA AGENTS OR OFFICIALS HAVE

BEEN DETAILED."

PROUTY,

WHO HIMSELF SERVED AS A LIAISON OFFICER WITH THE CIA IN

THE AIR FORCE.

EXPLAINED TO NEWSMEN SOME OF THE FUNCTIONS OF A

Insist Nedst

Step Down

By George Lardner Ir

Washington Post Stait Writer

Contending that the integrity

their investigation, of the

Central Intelligence Agency was

at stake, Democrats on the

House Intelligence Committee

demanded yesterday that Rep.

Lucien Ni Neuzi (D-Mich,)-step

down as chairman.

Nedzi refused, first at a tense

closed session of the committee

in the Capitol and then again at

a 75-minute conference

of all

seven Democrats on the panel

with House Speaker Carl Albert

/(D-Okla.).

A showdown

is expected:

next. week. Rep. Robert N.

Giaimo D-Corin:), one of the:

committee's most _influential

members, said he was deter-

mined to resign unless Nedzi

is replaced.

the confrontation was
