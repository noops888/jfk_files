SECRET

Of Mx. WITHERS that a 3,000-ohm resistor across the subscriber's.

line would possibly tend to change the ringer frequency causing

possible failure to ring or an alteration of the sound of the

bell due to the lack of full ringing current.

The "Line Compensating

Rheostat" in the manually

adjusted loop compensator circuit would normally be set at o

on a long cable loop such as in the telephone installation serving

the subscriber in this case.

With the "loop compensator" set

at zero, the 400-ohm resistor is in effect shorted out.

When

set in this zero position it is noted that the switch element

of the "loop compensator"

adds a capacitor and resistor to

the sidetone balancing impedence to more nearly match the

capacitive impedence of the long cable loop.

In installations

where it is desirable to set the compensating rheostat at zero

but where the sidetone balancing network is

not desired in

the circuit, it is the practice to set the "loop compensator"

just off zero where the 400-ohm resistance would be shorted

out but just short of the point where the switch connects the

sidetone balancing network. It is felt that a short could be :

placed across the

"400-ohm resistor of the loop compensator"

to prevent the rheostat from developing an open or becoming

noisy without effecting the operation of the instrument.

The sidetone balancing network could then be either, in

the

circuit if the "loop compensator" is set at zero, or out of

the circuit on any other setting.

On a party line this would

also apply as "loop compensators" are set without regard for

other telephones in the circuit. The loop compensation rheostat

should be set in such a position as to cause 60 milliamperes of

current to flow in the line.

Mr. WITHERS has advised that in his opinion a 3,000-ohm

resistance across the subscriber's line could cause an echo

effect and would make a noticeable difference in transmission

level.

It could possibly cause central office equipment to

reject the line indicating a trouble condition.

A Vincent Rare Gas Relay is sometimes used across:

a subscriber's line to eliminate

interference from nearby

power lines.

It is not believed

that

this will have any

effect upon an

SPNT installation.
