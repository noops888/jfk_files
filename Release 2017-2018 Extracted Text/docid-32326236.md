something, so source lef'c. MATTHEW and went over in the corner

and talked to MATULA.

MATULA' wanted to go outside; however,

source told him he could not inasmuch as he was with MATTHEW.

MATULA told source that he had just arrived at

Lennie's Restaurant a few minutes before the meeting, after

a trip from san Francisco. MATULA pointed to his right breast

"The bundle here is for the old

MATULA indicated he was going to deliver to HOFFA that

evening. Source estimates that MATULA had a million dollars

in cash

in his pocket.

When questioned as to how he arrived

at the million dollar figure, source stated that he has

carried as much as $500,000, and he knows how much money

you can carry, in your pocket.

Source stated that the money

was probably in $100 bills and he estimated that MATULA had

a bulge in his pocket of approximately six inches.

Source was asked why MATULA would tell him that

he was carrying a "bundle" for HOFFA, and

stated that

when he was active in the Teamsters Union,

he and MATULA

often competed for the favor of HOFFA and

source believes

that MATULA was trying to "show off" to source.

Source

stated that there is no question in his mind that MATULA

was carrying money to deliver to HOFFA and that the amount

being carried was around a million dollars. Source did not

actually source did not know

Source did not know the significance of the unknown

woman being with MATULA. He noted that MATULA takes great

pride in traveling with extremely good-looking women and that

the woman who was with MATULA at the restaurant did not

meet the standards of MATULA's usual female companions.

As a result, source concluded that the woman was somehow

involved in

business being transacted by MATULA.

Source

had never seen this woman before and had no idea who she

might be.

He furnished the following physical description

of this unknown woman:
