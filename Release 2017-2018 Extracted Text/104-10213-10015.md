"Angelo"

Cuba.

The subject of the report, leonor Ezequiel

JIMINEZ-

Valdera, knew Angelo by

sight only, since sometime in 1960.

In about 1961 JIMENEZ knew that Angelo was a member of the

G-2, because Angelo rode in the car used by the G-2 to

apprehend anti-Castro suspects. In November 1961, JIMENEZ

witnessed a trial in Camaguey, Cuba, at which Angelo was

present as the official in charge of the prisoners from

Moron who were on trial. A Cuban national known to

JIMENEZ only as Moralito accompanied Angelo everywhere.

e. Attached are LA/MP input sheets, for your

information, on Angelo HERVANDEZ, JOSe ANELLO, and

Martin AVELLO Meijides.
