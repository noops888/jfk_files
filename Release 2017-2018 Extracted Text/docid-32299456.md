The above conversation indicates that NORMAN

FROMKIN's contacts in the Dominican Republic are the Ministers

of Finance and Justice who appear to be named SALITA and

CASALAS.

The Chief of Police of Santo Domingo, not named,

appears to be an enemy of FROMKIM.

The above conversations and analyses are being furnished

Interested Offices in view of the possibility the above information

may be of interest.

Identities of persons not known to Phila-

delphia were pointed out in the explanatory paragraphs.

PH 614-C-IE furnished the following information:

GOLOB, while vlesting In Philadelphia, told him on

5/21/64 that he wanted BRUNO to intercede for him and remove

NORMAN FROMKIN as operator of Coney Island in Dominican Republic.

GOLOB stated that BENJAMIN ABRANSON, Intercontinental Homes,

Inco, does not have any investments

nor is he selling homes

and contacts with officials in the Dominican

Republic as to

establishment of gambling activity have not been

FROVKIN 1s afraid of 1s ANGELO BRUNO, and the only person to

whom he will answer is BRUNO.

GOLOB mentioned that there are

three owers of Coney Island, these being FROMKIN,

BERNARD

BUCKY AITEN, and ANGEIO BRUNO. FRONKIN, in an effort to carry

out a pretense of having little or no money, has called from

the Dominican Republic several times to CARL "PAPPY" IPPOLITO

In an effort to borrow money. (IFPOLITO is a resident of

Trenton, No J.,

and is a known associate of ANGELO BRUNO as well

as being a member of the Philadelphia Family of La Cosa Nostra.)

on 5/22/64, GOLOB told Informant that throughout

Guatemala there are slot machines owned by

supervised by the Mistress of the President of Guatemala for

charitable purposes. COLOB said he saw the mistress in an

effort, to run the operation for hers however, his offer was

declined by the Government and they so informed him by letter.

He said he did not get to see the President of Guatemala, but

he did see the manager who was operating the slot machines for

her. (Information from PH 623-0" Indieates he did speak with the

President at the Presidential Palace. The manager wanted to

s how COLOB all the records and the amount each machine netted

for a sum of $500, which BEN GOLOB declined.

GOLOB, after receiving the letter, said he wrote a

letter to the Government, stating he would work for the Government

as an agent of the Government and would give the Government

the same proposition as he gave before.

The proposition he

offered was to place all new slots in existing machines

guaranteeing $100,000 a year, whereas they apparently realized

$32,000. BEN would then service all the machines and place

them at the locations.

(PH 623-C* stated guarantee would be

$250,000.)

On 5/23/64, COLOB told PH 614-C-TE that he had dinner

at the home of ANGELO BRUNO during previous evening and that during

day, 5/23/64, he saw his accountant JOE WIISON, Camden, N. J

concerning his Income tax returns.
