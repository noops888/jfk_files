INFORMANTS

Extreme caution should be used in the

use of information furnished by the following sources.

In most cases the information furnished by each

of the following sources can be easily traced back

to the respective informant.

CG 9561-PC advised on 7/30/74, that a

good friend of his recently was at a conference where

the Teamster Union Pension Fund defense attorneys were

gathered. The place was at TOM O'SHANTER's and the

conference was called mainly to determine what should

be done about Judge BAUER.

The attorneys claimed BAUER has given them

nothing but a hard time. Obviously, they have not been

able to reach him in any way.

conference that if they can postpone this case long enough

tim they

It was decided at this

BAUER will be promoted to the United States Court of

Appeals and they would get another judge. It was stated

the prospects look good for such a promotion.

Informant stated their strategy for getting

continuances is to use "JENNER". They can always claim

JENNER is tied up on important matters in Washington.

It is also well known JENNER will not be involved in this

case when it does come up for trial.

CG 9561-PC advised on 8/2/74, that

The was vacationing near Rheinlander, Wisconsin, with JIMMY

DI ANTONIO.

While driving in this area, they

were "spotted"

by two other persons in another vehicle, namely; IRV WEINER

and ALLAN DORFMAN.

The occupants of the other approached

the informant and asked " What he was doing in the North

Country".

Whereupon the Informant told WHINER he was on a

vacation trip.

Infornant stated he was then invited to accompany

DORFMAN and WEINER to a luxurious lodge near Eagle River

called "Jack O Lantern".

This lodge covers several hundred

acres of land including a lake. Apparently, it is owned

by the Teamster Union of Chicago and is used by Teamster

Officials as a summer retreat.

This lodge also has a

landing strip

and informant stated he was told it is only

a 38 minute flight on a Teamster jet from Meigs Field in

Chicago to this resort.

Informant stated he then accompanied WEINER and

DORFMAN to the Jack 0 Lantern Lodge.

There he met RAY SMITH

who represents one of the defendants in the Teamster Union

Pension Fund Case. Also, he met several attorneys from

"JENNER's" office. These

individuals invited him to attend

discussions and he was told the purpose of the meeting

in

the north country was to study the strategy to be used in

the upcoming Pension Fund Case.

The informant stated all during the session at

the Jack O Lantern, WEINER appeared very much concerned,

but the only concern that DORFMAN showed was for hig

mother, ROSE, who went off on a drunk after her son got

into his recent trouble.

Informant stated she has done

this before and used to do it when her husband was alive.

Informant stated from hearing the conversation

in this lodge, it was apparent they recognize their biggest

trouble is United States District Court (USDC) Judge BAUER.

Apparently they have made no headway in "reaching" him and

he has turned down numerous petitions as proposed by

the

defendants.

They also discussed the possiblity of using

JENNER and his problems as a motion for asking for numerous

continuancesto prevent the case from coming up before

BAUER.

They also stated that BAUER 1s noW lined up as

successor to the recently resigned Judge OTTO KERNER.

Informant

witnesses

stated that they have now lined up a

to discredit the testimony of HAROLd LurIE.

His name was given as MAURIF GRAY who had prior business

dealings with HAROLD LURIE and now claims LURIE took

him for$100, 000.00.

From the discussion heard at this resort, informant

stated the defendants all realize that they have a

"problem" and that their problem is further aggravated because

of the position of Judge BAUER, and getting this case

taken away from BAUER is going

to be their main objective.

Informant stated they discussed the prosecuting

attorney, MATT LYDON and were not too concerned with

LYDON •

The general trend of conversation was that they

were not too concerned with the United States Attorney's

(USA) Office as a whole. Informant stated the only

interpretation he could

: make of comments along this line

was that they were confident they had the best Republican

attorney in the country (JENNER) and felt certain JENNER'S

credentials would have some effect on the

and his

assistants..

(The following information 1s being set forth

for the benefit of

the Agents

to whom

the cases are assigned.

It is obvious from the contents that this information

cannot be used in the details of any report.)

The informant on August 2, 1974, advised he had

just recently got in touch with GUS ALEX. ALEX made

reference

immediatoly, to the surprise of informant, that he wa: aware

informant had just returned from northern Wisconsir where

he had attended a meeting with all the defendants and

attorneys involved in the Teamster Union Pension Fund

Case.

Informant sald he did not ask ALEX how he cane upon

this information but was aware of the way theChicago Outfit"

works and their close association with the Teamster

Union Officalls and the defendants. ALEX freely discussed

the "WEASEL" (IRWIN WEINER) and the now deceased PHII,

ALDERISIO.

He also discussed the job of ART NASSAR who

recently became involved in the teamster case.

Concerning the "WEASEL". ALEX stated he never

had any use for this individual and several years ago

when PHIL attempted to introduce him to the

"WEASEL" he

walked away from both of them. Informant stated that

from the sound of GUS ALEX's conversation, he got the

impression that he held nothing but contempt for both

IRWIN WEINER and PHIL, ALDERISIO, who they referred to

consistently as the

"Mad dog".

At one point in the

conversation, ALEX stated that "they" did not blame

HAROLD LURIE

for doing what has apparently been done

already and that is testify against his old pals.

ALEX stated

that ALDERISIO and WEINER treated LURIE like a "dog" and

like anyone elge, LURIE now has a chance to get even with

the "WEASEL".

Also during the conversation concerning the

"WEASEL",

ALEX made a significant remark.

He stated,

"I wouldn't be surprised what side the 'WEASEL' 19 ON."

Informant stated when "Outfit people" start

to think along these lines, and they have other important

people involved in the same case, there is a good chance

that WEINER may become a "real loser."

CG 6890-CTE advised on 9/27/74, as follows:

At about 9:30 a.m., "BUCKY" ORTENZI was at

Papa Joe's when JOE LOMBARDO walked in and took a counter

seat beside ORTENZI. LOMBARDO arrived in an auto being

driven by "DIESEL" DE SANTIS. ORTENZI handed LOMBARDO

some papers and LOMBARDO nodded toward the back room.

ORTENZI said they would have to wait which gave informant

the impression that the person LOMBARDO was looking

for was not there.

CS CG 9565-E, advised on 10/1/74, that on the

evening of 9/30/74, he

came in contact with an individual

known to him as LEMKE formerly of Lockport, Illinois,

and who is a former inmate of Statesville Prison.

LEMKE related to source that he is currently

working for an asphalt company which was doing business

across the street from an automobile dealership where

suspects in the killing of a plastic factory executive

switched cars.

LEMKE further stated to source that he

has been assisting local police in a composite drawing

of the individual he observed; however, he does not want

to get involved in this matter any deeper than he is already.

LEMKE then advised source he thinks one of the men

resembled an individual by the name NICK IACOVETTI who

used to work for the Syndicate in Chicago.

Mrs.

(Protect),

143 Front Street, Braidwood, Illinois, was contacted

on 10/1/74, at her residence and she furnished the

following information:

She advised that her sister, LAURA (WILLIE)

is married to MARVIN LEMKE, and she is married to

MARVIN's brother, RICHARD

LEMKE.

She was told by MARVIN that he had seen an

individual at a construction job he was on, near

Chicago, on Friday, 9/27/74.

MARVIN stated to her

that he felt this individual was named "PEPE" and

that he had served time with "PEPE" at the Joliet

Prison.

MARVIN stated to her that he was quite

concerned for the safety of his family, in view of

television and newspaper coverage concerning

the murder

of an individual in gangland style.

She further advised that MARVIN told her

he saw all the individuals involved in the murder

and the vehicles left at the parking lot.

CG 6348-C advised on 10/2/74, that one

AL (LNU), a white male, with swarthy complexion,

being 6' tail, 200 pounds, dark hair, a neat conservative

dresser, has been known to have been in town with

FRANK SCHWEIHS on the afternoon of 9/27/74.

Source also learned AL was in town at the time of the

murders of RICHARD CAIN and SAM DE STEFANO.

Source

learned AL and SCHWEIHS went to the American Bonding

Company office on the afternoon of 9/27/74, and

reportedly conversed with MICKEY KAPLAN and IRWIN

WEINER.

Al has the reputation of being "a class"

hotel jewel thief. AL was born and raised in Chicago

and has for some time resided in Miami, Florida.

Source speculated that AL was involved

in the hit

with FRANK SCHWEIHS, JOEY LOMBARDO and some other

individual.

CG 6348-C advised on 10/3/74, that he learned

IRWIN WEINER

was surprised at the murder of DANIEL

SEIFERT. Source learned that WEINER reportedly received

CG 87-40262

a phone call at approximately 2:00 on the afternoon

of the murder from one JERRY (LNU) • WEINER was

visibly shaken by the phone call and stated "those

two guys got in a jackpot". Reportedly 30 minutes

after that phone call ALOIS SMETANA and FRANK

SCHWEIHS met with WEINER at the bonding office.

Source felt WEINER referred to SCHWEIHS and SMETANA

as being the two who were in a jackpot.

Source stated that JOSEPH LOMBARDO has

stated that DANNY SEIFERT is his partner and has been

giving him a "screwing".

Source learned LOMBARDO was

attempting to collect $5,000.00 he felt was owed to him

by SEIFERT.

•On 10/17/74, source advised that it is

difficult to obtain direct information regarding the

murder of SEIFERT. JOEY LOMBARDO is acting very strange

and is livid regarding contacts' by the FBI with his

girlfriend, BONNIE VENT. JOEY feels this is harassment.

AL SMETANA has been at the American Bonding Office daily

since the mirder.

ALl is residing at a hotel with his

wife, a young beautiful girl. Source was unable

to provide any information regarding installation of

electronic equipment in cars.

The group of LOMBARDO, SCHWEIHS, and SMETANA

will not be seen together.

They make a point of staying

apart, yet they appear at American Bonding Office.

JOEY LOMBARDO is not acting like himself and recently

started to grow a mustache.

IRWIN WEINER has voiced fears for his life.

WEINER knows that SPILOTRO and LOMBARDO are vicious

killers of the SAM DE STEFANO type. Source learned

WEINER feels that if he was removed from the scene

the Government would not have a case against the

other defendants. WEINER is acting paranoid. Source

advised JOEY LOMBARDO purchases his Dodges from

Southwestern Dodge.

CG 10018-CTE advised on 10/4/74, that

JACK CERONE is becoming more concerned about the

activities of TONY SPILOTRO and may take some

action against SPILOTRO if SPILOTRO continues to grow

in power.

Rumor has it that JACK CERONE was not pleased with

the Bensenville hit of businessman DAN SEIFERT.

In

the first place CERONE did not want SEIFERT killed

but he was overruled and furthermore CERONE was

discontented with the sloppiness of the hit.

CG 6914-C advised on 10/4/74, that

LARRY MACK, Owner of Southwest Dodge, was a former

Vice Officer with the Chicago Police Department

and he was known as an "outfit cop". His brother,

FRANK, is currently a Chicago Police Officer to

traffic at Wabash and Lake. MACK also owns a

Dodge dealership in Harvey, Illinois.

Source advised that in the past, thieves

and the criminal element have hung out at Southwest

Dodge and have obtained cars there. FRANK SCHWEIHS

has obtained cars and trucks from

Southwest Dodge.

Informant advised that the girl (DONNA

ANDERSON) who was struck by the getaway car in the

murder on 9/27/74, originally indicated she could

identify the occupants of this vehicle.. She was

with her girlfriend on 9/29/74, who dates PHIL, a

Chicago Tribune Crime Reporter, and went with a friend

of the informant's who is also close to PHIL. PHIL'S

girlfriend stated that PHIL knows the criminal element

and "can keep your name out of the paper". When

ANDERSON found out that the murderers appeared to be

hoodlums, the girl decided to play "dummy".

CG 6890-CTE advised on 10/9/74, as follows:

DOMINIC "DIESEL" DE SANTIS, friend of JOE

LOMBARDO, about six years ago served

time in prison

for the sale of narcotics to a Narcotics Agent. He

was such a mean individual while in prison that he

spent about 90% of his time in isolation. Informant

heard that he abused other prisoners to such an extent

that they ganged up on him and broke both of his hands

on a chopping block. He thinks DE SANTIS was in the

prison at Joliet.

He described DE SANTIS as a white male,

late 30s, 6'1" to 6'2", 225 to 240 lbs., blond curly

hair, good looking, very muscular, not fat, mean

disposition.

SPILOTRO told the informant he is still

concerned about the Federal prosecution pending

against him in Chicago, and that the Government

has other witnesses who could possibly convict him.

He told the informant there are other witnesses in

the case they would like to kill but that the

same "crew'' of hoodlums would not be used.

The informant advised that he returned to Las

Vegas on 12/11/74, and again contacted SPILOTRO.

SPILOTRO is now very worried about the prosecution

pending in Chicago and indicated the trial would

probably start around 1/20/75. SPILOTRO complained

that he and his co-defendants had spent nearly $150,000.00

alone in private investigation fees and the case against them

did not look good. He told the informant that while he

is away from Las Vegas, he will leave his brother there

to protect his investment in bankrolling card players and

bookmakers. He wanted the informant to meet his brother

and give him any assistance he needed in the event someone

tried to cheat his brother while he was gone. SPILOTRO

told the informant he was not able to spend the weekend

in San Francisco recently as a guest of MICKEY COHEN

because he had become involved with NICK CIMPONIS,

bankrolling him in a big card game, and could not get

away.

CG 9561-PC advised on 12/19/74, that TONY

SPILOTRO recently was in Chicago, and was together with

JOE LOMBARDO. The two of them reportedly were discussing

the DAN SEIFERT case. Apparently they are very much

concerned about the purchase of a radio receiver

set, which the Government is now tracing and which was

purchased for them by another individual.

In connection with the SEIFERT case, informant

stated his sources mentioned that the Federal

Bureau

of Investigation (FBI) is on the right track when they

-V-

tied in NICK IACOVETTI to the SEIFERT murder.

Some

years ago when IACOVETTI was in trouble, JOE LOMBARDO

fronted for him and helped get him out

of a jam.

LOMBARDO

and IACOVETTI were associating together about the

time of the SEIFERT murder.

He stated IACOVETTI

is "nuts" and the way the murder was committed, it

was a typical IACOVETTI deal. The matter was poorly

planned and almost botched.

Informant stated he also

heard from other sources that IACOVETTI could not be

located after the murder and that this would be nothing

unusual if IACOVETTI was involved.

CG 9561-PC advised on 1/21/75, that attorneys

for the defendants in the "Weiner Case" are now

looking for help from the jury panel. Informant

mentioned that a source he has, told him'they have a

furrier on the jury panel" and they hope to get him on

the case because "he is one of theirs".

The best

informant could find out was that the.

"furrier" had

a place downtown on State Street.

Informant added that he knows most of the

attorneys involved in this case and several of them

are capable of pulling a deal like this.

They only

need one guy on the jury to make the

whole trial a

waste of time.

CG 9561-PC advised on 1/28/75, that sources close

to the Teamster Union pension fund case have indicated

all of the defendants are very much concerned with

the pending trial.

JOE LOMBARDO is aware of the fact that he is

to be dropped from this case. LOMBARDO is suspicious

of the Government's intentions. He is certain that once

he is dismissed from the "Teamster case" the Government

will turn around and indict him on the murder charge

of DAN SEIFERT. Informant stated that LOMBARDO feels

the Government has a case against him, because of the

fact it was him who purchased the resistors for the

radio found in the getaway car

These resistors are

necessary for tuning in on FBI and police frequencies.

Again this informant stated that he

was sure that the murder had been committed by NICK

IACOVETTI. He also stated it was his belief that TONY

SPILOTRO was "one of the short masked men seen at the

murder site". He stated again that the way this murder

was committed and almost botched, that it was a typical

IACOVETTI deal. He also stated there was a good chance

that LOMBARDO was with IACOVETTI at the time of DAN

SEIFERT's murder.

Informant added that the defendants. and their

attorneys have had numerous pre-trial conferences some

of which were held at the Jack-0-Lantern Club in northern

Wisconsin.

CG. 9561-PC advised on 2/21/75, that IRV WEINER

is in real trouble as "the people" blame him for all

their troubles.

ALEX recalled a conversation some years

ago wherein IRV WEINER discussed the position of HAROLD

LURIE with whom he was doing business.

WEINER at this

time told TONY SPILOTRO and others that he had receiving

information indicating HAROLD LURIE was an informant of

the Government. WEINER discounted this story, expressed

his confidence in HAROLD LURIE and stated that the person

who gave this information to him was definitely a

questionable source.

ALEX related as things worked out, LURIE has

been a Government informant for a number of years.

All the defendants in the Teamster Union trial blame

their present troubles on LURIE who is the Government's

most important witness.

Informant stated actually WEINER is completely

alone and has no friends..

He also related that information

has come to him from several sources that once this trial

is over, if WEINER does not go to jail, he is going to

get "hit"

Informant stated also in conversations with

ALEX, GUS brought up the fact that there are a number of

"wild guys" now running around with the approval of

AIUPPA and NICOLETTI and who are causing nothing but

trouble to other members of the organization. Named

among the "wild guys" were the two SPILOTRO brothers,

JOE LOMBARDO, "BIG JOHN" FECAROTTA, NICK MONTOS, FRANK

SCHWEIHS, and NICK IACOVETTI.

Informant stated that these individuals or

any combination of them has been responsible for most

of the gangland violence in the past year. He stated that

apparently this group has been given a free hand and as

long as they are running loose, gangland killings will

continue.

Informant stated that FECAROTTA's name now comes

up frequently whereas this individual was completely

unknown to the informant until several months ago.

Informant stated he personally knows some of this group

and there is no question that they are "gun happy".

CG 6457-PC advised on 3/8/75, as follows:

Her 28 year old daughter, DERYLE, was found

dead in her car in the garage of her home at 1401 24th

Street, Melrose

Park, Illinois, 12/28/74. The wake was

held at Prignano's Funeral Home, Melrose Park, and she

was buried 1/1/75. A report of

an inquest is on file

at Cook County Coroner's Office, December, 1974 file

# 320.

DERYLE was married to NICK CIOTTI. He is

related by marriage to the EBOLI family. His sister

PAT is married to TOM EBOLI.

Source described CIOTTI as a "gutless, tough

guy wop" who frequently beat her daughter and whose sole

means of support was picking up and distributing football

parlay cards for LOUIE "THE MOOCH" EBOLI.

Source recalled that on an early evening

in late September, 1974, her daughter rushed over to source's

house in Hillside with her baby and in an excited manner

told her mother that she would have to watch her baby

for a few days, saying she and her husband, NICK, had to

go to the Wisconsin Dells.

Source had other plans

and said she would not watch the baby unless it was

very important:

Her daughter made her promise never to reveal

what she told her and then said that her husband NICK,

was scared and probably in some way involved in the

shooting of

a man and wife connected with a plastic

plant which was then in the news. An off-duty police

officer had also been injured in the caper... LoU

EBOLI had brought the getaway car to their garage

(a blue car) that day and said they would have to

keep it there for a while. They then painted the windows

of the garage with black paint.

Her daughter returned from the Dells in about

three days and appeared at her home. She said the car had

been removed from the garage but she was worried about

NICK and he in turn was afraid she might talk about what

she knew.

Her daughter named four of the men involved

in the shooting, but since the trauma of her daughter!s

death subsequently, she can only remember two. LOU

daughter's

"THE MOOCH" EBOLI and "BUTCH" were positively involved.

When the composite description of the man

appeared in the papers, she said the one of EBOLI was

excellent and considered it humorous that Chief JOE

CIMINO of Melrose Park would not recognize EBOLI

immediately.

She said the photo reflected EBOLI with

a growth of beard and a moustache.

He removed this the day

the car went into her daughter's garage.

One night in November, her daughter appeared

at her house in a beaten condition. NICK had hit her

so hard her eyeball had popped out. DERYLE explained

that a few nights previously she was in Ori's Lounge

and met JOE DE VITA from Schaumburg She considered

DE VITA as one she thought as one of her husband's

closest friends. She admitted to her mother that she

drank too much wine and then asked DE VITA to talk:

to her husband about doing things he should not be

, doing. She told DE VITA about the car in the garage,

among other things.

The next day LOU EBOLI called her. husband

NICK in and told him that DE VITA contacted him, told

what his wife said and warned him that his wife could

get in trouble because she had a big mouth.

On 12/28/74, the Melrose Park Police were.

called to her daughter's home where her daughter was

discovered dead in her car in the garage.

Source advised her daughter had a "thing"

about parking her car in the garage, was afraid of

hitting the garage doors, and never

parked in the garage.

NICK the husband, said they went out to a bar that evening

and when they got home he went to bed and DERYLE must:

have committed suicide. She is currently contemplating

the exhumation of her daughter's body so she can know

what really happened to her.

Source states that her daughter's husband is

staying away from the house, that her daughter's car

is still in the garage (1401 24th Street, Melrose Park),

Source is certain her daughter's death was

the result of her knowledge of the caper involving

EBOLI and others. She stated' her daughter, if for

no other reason than love for her children, would nou

have committed suicide.

It should be noted that PC was once the

paramour of SAMUEL M. GIANCANA. GIANCANA arranged

the murder of source's boyfriend, ANGELO FASEL,

many years ago and to this day GIANCANA is of the

opinion one of source's sons is his son. DOMINIC

"BUTCH" BLASI is this boy's godfather at GIANCANA'S

request.

CG 6457-PC furnished the following

information on 3/13/75:

PC recalled that shortly before the time of her

daughter's death on 12/28/74, at Melrose Park, Illinois,

she received a call from her daughter's husband, NICK

CIOTTI, who inquired as to DERYLE's whereabouts. CIOTTI

indicated that DERYLE was not in the house and he asked

PC, DERYLE's mother, to determine if DERYLE had spent

the night at the PC's home.

PC advised that it was

shortly after that her daughter, JENNIE, who had spent

the night at the CIOTTI residence as a babysitter, called

her

and in a very hysterical fashion told her to

get over to the CIOTTI's residence immediately.

PC recalled that approximately two weeks prior

to the time that the "hot car" was located at the CIOTTI

residence by her daughter, DERYLE, NICK CIOTTI had demanded

that the garage where this vehicle was stored be cleaned

out by DERYLE and the PC. PC advised that CIOTTI was

not usually concerned with things of this nature leaving

the management and upkeep of the household exclusively

to his wife, DERYLE.

PC felt that this was an extremely

unusual request;however, the garage was cleaned out

and items that had previously been stored in the garage

were restored elsewhere.

PC further advised that she had been involved

in a conversation with an individual whose name she could

not recall, but whom she described as a waitress at

Dante's Lounge located on North Avenue in Melrose Park.

This conversation took place sometime after the death

of her daughter and the waitress was offering her

sympathy.

The waitress indicated that she had been in

the company of NICK and DERYLE CIOTTI on the morning

ot 12/28/74 and indicated that the Clotlls did not

leave Dante's until closing time, which on this

particular morning had been extended to 5:00 a.m.

The waitress further indicated that the CIOTTIs did

not leave the restaurant until approximately 5:30 a.n.

PC indicated that this was not what NICK CIOTTI had

indicated at the inquest which followed her daughter's

death.

With regard to the inquest previously mentioned,

PC indicated that she had never been advised by anyone

that the inquest was to be held and in fact, did not find

out that there had been an inquest until several days

after the inquest had been held by the Cook County

Coroner's Office.

PC recalled that prior to her daughter's

death and subsequent to a conversation her daughter had

with JOSEPH DE VITA, 634 Balboa, Schaumburg, PC received

a call one evening from NICK CIOTTI, who indicated that

he wished to speak with the PC. PC later in the evening

complained that PC's daughter, DERYLE, and his wife,

had

I been talking "too much".

The subsequent discussion involved inquiry

with CIOTTI as to whether PC could control her daughter

and specifically control her daughter with regard to

some of the comments she had been making about her husband,

NICK, to various people. Specifically, CIOTTI mentioned

that JOSEPH DE VITA had called LOU EBOLI and had revealed

a conversation that he, DE VITA, had with DERYLE, who

at the time complained

about NICK's involvement with

LOU EBOLI. She requested DE VITA's assistance in attempting

to convince her husband that he should have no further

dealings with EBOLI in any illegal activities. CIOTTI's

involvement with EBOLI in a gambling and possible

juice situation was discussed, including the presence of the

"hot car", which DERYLE had discovered sometime in the

latter part of September, 1974.

NICK was extremely upset about the fact that

DERYLE had such a conversation with DE VITA and was

concerned exactly as to what should be done about

preventing or at least controlling any future incidents

of this nature.

At the time of this conversation

which took place to the best of PC's recollection,

at the end of November or early December, 1974, CIOTTI

described the vehicle which had been parked in the CIOTTI

garage, as a "very very hot car".

PC indicated that she did not realize her

daughter was dead until she arrived at the Westlake

Hospital. From the time of her daughter's death,

she has had a very strained relationship with the CIOTTI

family, including NICK CIOTTI.

She recalled that subsequent to her daughter's

death on 9/28/74, NICK seemed to be avoiding her. .

In

fact, she could not recall any particular conversation

with NICK except a comment which he made to her at the

funeral parlor following her daughters death. CIOTTI

had been avoiding her all day but at some point during

the wake

walked up to her and stated, "I didn't want

for this to happen". No further explanation of this

statement or any additional conversation with NICK

CIOTTI followed.

PC indicated that DERYLE had many acquaintances

but not too many individuals that she would describe

as "close friends". PC did identify one individual

whom her daughter was close to as VICKI CIMINO, the

daughter-in-law of DOMINIC CIMINO, Chief of Police,

Melrose Park. Police Department.

She advised that VICKI

was married to JOSEPH CIMINO and it is possible that

DERYLE CIOTTI confided and had pertinent conversations

with VICKI CIMINO prior to her death.

PC indicated that subsequent to the death of

her daughter, NICK had the telephone service at her

daughter's residence in Melrose Park temporarily disconnected

sometime during the early part of January, 1975.

She indicated that NICK is living with his

parents

in a house immediately behind her daughter's former

residence at the time and has not touched the automobile

in which DERYLE was found since her daughter's body

was discovered on the morning of 12/28/74.

On 3/20/75, PC advised that to the best of

her recollection her daughter, DERYLE, had indicated

that she and NICK were staying at a hotel or motel located

in the Wisconsin Dells by the name of Chula Vista.

This trip was rather strange, she thought, even at that

time, since her daughter and NICK had just returned

from a trip made to the Wisconsin Dells.

In conversation with her doctor, identified

as DI. JAMES ADRIAN, PC described to DI. ADRIAN the

percentage of ethanol in milligrams as reflected in

her daughter's blood at the time of her death. This

percentage was reflected as 173.0 milligrams.

The

doctor, upon hearing the amount of ethanol reflected

in the coroner's report after an analysis of her

daughter's blood, commented that the only way such a

percentage of alcohol or ethanol could be placed in

a human body is to have such an amount injected.

The doctor indicated that no human being could ever

consume that much alcohol.

people involved in the case now on trial on the Teamster matter.

BELLOWS told him two things were significant. First

of all HAROLD LURIE turned out to be an excellent witness, but

even after this attorneys for the defense were sure they had

a 50-50 chance. After the government put on their undercover

IRS Agent, the

defendant's hppes really sank.

They continue

to blame WEINER and BELLOWS claimed this trial is taking it's

toll on WEINER and he is losing weight.

disappointed with JERRIS LEONARD, his attorney.

DORFMAN. has

stated openly that LEONARD is not doing a good job for him and

he has his doubts LEONARD is the sharp attorney he's supposed

to be.

Informant stated that just about every

the attorneys and their clients meet at Papa Zeke fIght all of

They all

gather at the big round table in the rear and discuss this case.

With the recent turn of events, DORFMAN has been hard to handle.

At the present time, DORMAN's mother is a problem and she now is in

Florida drinking too much.

Informant stated he has known ALLEN DORFMAN for a

number of years. DORFMAN's real father was "Spider" MEYER, who

was killed

some years ago in Texas.

DORFMAN's mother later

remarried. She has been very knowledgeable of Teamster Pension

Fund affairs, and informant stated her son's present predicament

is not helping her drinking problem.

CG 10651-PC advised the following on 3/18/75:

PC advised that LOUIS EBOLI is basically

a "'loner" and has few friends in which he confides.

He is currently close to DOMINIC "DIESEL" DE SANTIS

who: works for EBOLI's M&D Company and collects money

frow vending machines, EBOLI and DIESEL are

capable of pulling off most any type of crime.

In the past, AMERICO DE PIETO worked for EBOLI at the

M&D Company and was a trusted ally, Since DE SANIIS'

release from prison he has not not worked for EBOLI

as it was felt he would being too much "heat" on the

Company. However, they remain close friends.

who are in her office and stated "They are two of the guys

who did the killing".

On 4/14/75, EUGENE ZIPERSTEIN made the comment
