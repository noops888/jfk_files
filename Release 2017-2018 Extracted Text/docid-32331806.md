captioned "CHESTER ZOCHOWSKI, was.

ITSP - MAJOR THEFT."

which sets forth background information re

results of interview with him on 10/3/57. It is noted

In this interview,

FESSALANO admitted he was born and raised

in New Kensington,

and grew up with the MANNARINO brothers.

He said during airplane flight from Miami to Pittsburgh, he

became acquainted with JOE MEROLA, a fellow passenger,

also livee in Miami.

He said MEROLA told him that he too

knew the MANNARINOS.

Regarding the CECIL HONDOURA mentioned by PESSALANO, it 1s

noted that during the investigation of the MANNARINO brothers

by Pittsburgh, ARTHUR NEWMAN, PCI, contacted by Legat,

Havana, Cuba,

advised that in the past the MANNARINO brothers

had shipped slot machines into Cuba, probably through ALBERTO

ARDURA, aka. Alberto Ardura Moya, who PCI deseribed as the

"bag" man for ROBERTO FERNANDEZ MIRaNdA, brother-In-law

of Cuban President FULGENCIO BATISTA.

PoI reported that since

MIRANDA received 50% of the "take" from all slot machines

operating in Cuba, ARDURA is normally the individual to whom

slot machines are exported from the United States.

PCI

advised this is done by ARDURA to insure control of slot

machines."

*(И)

The above is mentioned in view of the similarity of names

between ARDURA and HONDOURA and should be considered whe

PESSALANO is' re-interviewed.
