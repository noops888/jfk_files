It would appear from the above that PIGNATELLO

is undoubtedly a front for GIANCANA in Las Vegas

and

specifically at the Coach and Four Restaurant.

GERALD

IV 10-C has previously reported that O'HARE in

the past has handled the bets for employees and guests at

the Desert Inn Hotel.

In June, 1961, MORRIS B. DALITZ,

principal owner of the hotel and a top hoodlum, national,

issued instructions that O'HARE was not to be permitted to

make any calls through the hotel switchboard to any race,

book in the City of Las Vegas.

AS VEGAS, NeA

O'HARE resides at 2401 Santa Clara Drive/ and is

known to have at least two phones in his house.

Hoodlums

fromcother parts of the country have called these numbers

during recent months.

As reported under the above heading; SAMUEL M.

GIANCANA was in the Las Vegas area during July, 1961, at

which time he made arrangements to purchase an interest

in the Coach and Four Restaurant.

He indicated he was

going to set JOHN DREW, referred to hereafter, and others

up as possible "dummy owners". Information appeared in a

local Las Vegas newspaper in

August, 1961, that JOHN DREW

and

JERRY O'HARE had purchased the Coach and Four Restaurant

and had been approved for a liquor license to operate the

restaurant.

It would appear from the above that in addition

to handling bets on various sporting events, O'HARE is also

possibly acquainted with GIANCANA and has been set up as

a Iront by GIANCANA in the Coach and foux Restaurant.

LONNIE JOE

& CHADWICK

N PL

Las Vegas sources had

advised that CHADWICK is

a close personal associate of JOHN DREW. CHADWICK was employed

until a few months ago as a pit boss at

the Stardust Hotel,

Las Vegas.

He subsequently quit this job and has since

been traveling to Los Angeles and other parts of the country

with DREW. He was recently gambling in Reno when IRS Agents.
