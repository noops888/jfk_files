On his recent visits to Miam, JIMENEZ

several occasions expressed strong sympathies in

opposition to the present Panamanian Government and

President, and the current Panamanian Government policies.

He indicated he wanted to hire several gangsters for possible

future action in Panama.

Accordingly, he was trying to

make contact with a group of local Cubans In this

connectior.

$(U)

Is June of 1962, JIMENEZ had stated he wanted

to buy a quantity of arms, and he was involved in a plot

to shoot the President of Panama.

He indicated the

assassination was to take place during an uprising in

Panama, and offered as

proof of the alleged plot the

fact that there would be an uprising in the near

• future

in Panama.

In connection with the plot, JIMENEZ

hạd

contacted General MANUEL BENITEZ, a Cuban exile

in

Miami, who had recommended that JIMENEZ contact

SERGIO

CASTRO and Captain HUMBERTO RODRIGUEZ DIAZ to a8818t him

in this plot.

DI. RAFAEL CARCIA NAVARRO explained he had

obtained the above information from General MANUEL

BENITEZ VALDES, who was a personal acquaintance of GARCIA

NAVARRO. He characterized General BENITEZ as an opportunist

involved in

various plots and intrigues. General BENITEZ!

had reported the activities of J'IMENEZ and JIMENEZ' contact

with RODRIGUEZ. DIAZ and CASTRO EO DI: GARCIA NAVARRO;

and stated he (BENITEZ) would follow the activitles of

this plot through SERGIO CASTRO and furnish Information or

a continuing basis to DI. GARCIA NAVARRO..

DI. GARCIA NAVARRO

stated in his opinion,

General BENITEZ was attempting to ingratiate himself with

the Panamanian Government, and apparently planned to try

to obtain economic aid from the Panamanian officials in

return for information in the alleged plot. fu

General BENITEZ had subsequently advised DI.

CARCIA NAVARRO that JIMENEZ had paid some $500.00 to SERGIO

CASTRO in connection with the alleged plot, but that CASTRO

and RODRIGUEZ DIAZ had taken no action to further the plot,

but were only standing by awaiting further developments.

No further developments apparently materialized. d/u

DI. GARCIA NAVARRO advised he had not taken

the above allegations of a plot by JIMENEZ, as reported

by General BENITEZ, at all seriously, in view of General

BENITEZ' reputation.

subsequently, however, at the time

of the

uprising on the part of members of the National

Guard in Panan, wich appeared to coincide with the threats

made by: JIMENEZ, DI. CARCIA NAVARRO felt that there might

be some basis for concern, and accordingly had furnished

information concerning the alleged plot to United States

Government officials, as well as to Panamanian officials.

Subsequently, an Inspector from the Panamanian National

Police had been sent to Miami to investigate this matter,

and had interviewed BENITEZ in connection with the alleged

plot. A(u)

Subsequent to that time, no further information

has been developed concerning the alleged plot, either

through the Panamanian Investigator or General BENITEZ,

and In DI. GARCIA NAVARRO's opinion, the matter is

closed.

plot against the President of Panama as serious. He

had felt, however, that he should report this matter

to his acquaintance, Di. GARCIA NAVARRO, Panamanian

Consul in Fort lauderdale. Accordingly, he had made the

above information available to DI. GARCIA NAVARRO, who

subsequently reported it to his government. General

BENITEZ indIcated in his opinion, DI. GARCIA NAVARRO may have

over-emphasized the significance

of this alleged plot in

order

"to enhance his (Dr. NAVARRO'&) position with the

Panamanian Government.

General BENITEZ saLd probably the primary purpose

Of JIMENEZ' visit to Miami during the sumer had been

to visit his Cuban girl friend, who subsequently. has

moved to Puerto rico.

General BENITEZ stated since this all

- happened,

an official of the Panamanian Government had come to Miami

to investigate this matter, and had interviewed several

of the participants in the alleged plot, including

SERGIO. CASTRO.

It was determined at that time that

no further action had been taken in this plot, and that it

considered & closed matter.

General BENitez advised that he has recently l

learned from a friend of his, one JOSE LUISALPARO,

a former police official In Panama, that JUAN JIMENEZ

recently received an appointment with the Panamanian

Gowernment. JIMENEZ is reportedly now assigned in a

diplomatie

capacity for the Panamanian Government, and

reportedly in Washington.

no longer unhappy with the Panamanian Government.
