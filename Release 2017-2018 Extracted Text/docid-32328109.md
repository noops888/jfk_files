On February 13, 1958, PCI

whose

identity must be kept confidential and who is in ex-

cellent position to obtain photographs of Americans in-

volved in gambling operations in Havana, furnished the

enclosed photographs, which are 5x8 full-face, of BILL

MILLER, HEIM HELLER,

and BILL, HODGSON. The source ad-

vised that these photographs were obtained with the con-

sent of the operator of the casino at the Hotel Capri

but with the understanding that no one except the casino

N operator, who is NICHOLAS DiCOSTANZO, wa. "Fat The Butch"

@would receive copies thereof; therefore,

these photographs

should be used only for identification purposes by Bureau

Agents and should not be shown to informants except under

extraordinary circumstances.

BILL MILLER is identical

with the individual who formerly operated Bill Miller's

•Riviera in Palisades, New Jersey.

Informant is unable

to identify, except by name, the other two individuals.

The Laboratory is requested to copy these photo-

graphs in a smaller size and furnish two copies each of

each photograph to Newark and New York Offices and the

Legal Attache,

Havana.

It should be noted that these

photographs were taken by the source on February 8, 1958,

at the gambling casino

the Hotel Capri, Havana.

Extra copies of this letter have been prepared

for possible use of Newark and New York Offices.
