COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION.ABOUT. COMMUNISM

Classifed

Direst

SarA

tenasty on.

Attached is a list of members of captioned committee, of which I

am a member. In the past, members of this committee and of the Advisory

Committee to it have all been included on the Special Correspondents List.

Because of a reorganization of the committee, many in the list are not

presently on the mailing list. The attached list is appropriately marked and

it is believed that those not currently on the mailing list should be added.

AMERICAL

ADVISORY

I have checked files on these individuals and there is no derogatory

information which would preclude their addition. Adverse information in files

on some which would not preclude their addition to the list is as follows:

U. S. District Judge Sherman G. Finesilver - Our investigation

of him prior to his appointment to the District Court of Colorado developed

information critical of his judicial temperment and legal ability. Nevertheless

man est at

Councils of Mississippi during the mid 1950's. The Citizens Councils were

particularly active in the Jackson area and, of course, were designed to

oppose integration. There is no indication that they engaged in violence such

as did the Ku Klux Klan and there is nothing in our tiles to indicate that

Overstreet was engaged in any unlawfuljactivity.
