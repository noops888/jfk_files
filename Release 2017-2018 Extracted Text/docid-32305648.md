that information in government possession in respect to hood-

lums which we got from BROWN and RUSTON would, in any case,

be most properly presented to any Defense Counsel from the

files of the ATTD itself.

The Bureau is requested to advise Albany in the

event it is desired the information in the memoranda regard-

ing BROWN and RUSTON be obtained from them on a current basis

with clearance to disseminate it. It is noted both BROWN

and RUSTON have been reported as having testified before the

Special Grand Jury in the SDNY which returned the indictment

in U.S. vs. BONANNO, et al.

Both BROWN and RUSTON have been interviewed in

hoodlum perjury

cases and their interviews reflected on

FD 302's were, of course, all furnished on a non-confidential

basis, after obtaining clearance and with the understanding

that testimony might be required and this, of course, presents

no problem. It is recommended that only the letterhead memoranda

reflecting interviews with BROWN and RUSTON designated on pages

following as items 44 and 45 (BROWN) and item 111 (RUSTON) be

disseminated.

In respect to

the Bureau's

attention is particularly directed to the fact that he was

formerly Confidential Informant AL 3002-C, discontinued by

Albany letter. 3/24/59. Of course, he is known to the Attorney

General's Special Group at New York City and his name undoubtedly

has been mentioned in testimony before the Special Grand Jury.

In addition, he has been interviewed and carried openly in the

hoodlum perjury cases in the recent past.
