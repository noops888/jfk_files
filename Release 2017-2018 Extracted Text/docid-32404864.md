l. It vas tho :ntenti a of the undersigned to attend every sessiun conducted

by the dictor in hope to gain sonething new and useful for our future

interrogations. During these sessions, I managed only to refrash my

menory of things NOSENKO had proviously aald. lothing now or significant

developed during these sessions except for a fow minor facts which have no

great value. It should be centioned that many of the facts that NCSENKO

stated about his past life were noro mixed up than the story he had

proviously related.

2. It

Is not the intent of th a paper to criticize the work which tha

roctor hus done because the sessiuns have alreadly taken place ana

the work is conulated. My main objoction to this type of interrogation

1s that the doctor tried to mintain a noutral attitudo and nover

my opinion that

challanged any of NOSENKO's statements. It is/ the doctor made a mistako

in the lust session when he told NiSENKO "Y ou are NOSENKO." Thia leads

NOSENKO to balieve we accepted his life story and family backgrouna, and

it would bo vory hard to question him agahn on this subject. It is uy

opinin that we did not have enough infornation to make a definite

c.nclusin that he is NOSENKO. What NOSENKO told us could bo obtained

or Learned by another person very well briggon these netiers. los of

the infornation that lOSENKO gave to us about his parents is stillnst

convincing to make corclusiong. Most of the questing during the recent

sessions were of a leading nature and NuSENiO's answerug appared to

bo of the type that the doctor wanted.

## In sy opinion, NOSENKO did not say nore about his father, and in many

instanco loss, than the newspaper Pravda said in 1956.

3. In the doctor's opinion, NOSENKO sentioned to us quito a fow family

frionds who were around the NOSENKO family and at the first look 1t 1g

c nvincing that he ig NiSENKO. In uy opinion, NOSEKO gave to us

associated

only hases who logically would be auscratad with NOSENKO or NOSENKO's

rovealing

lather, and nothing aaazzliny about their activatios or privato lives.

Significantly, most of the information NOSENKO has given us is about

people who are rotar sither dead

or ne longer in authority. For examplo,

MALYSHEY, (fortor doputy chairnan of the Council of Ministers, d1od);

VAKHRUSIEY, (died); SABURCH, (ne longer a VIP); KABULOV

BULGANIN, ( no longot

(VIP)) KUZNEISOV, #O., (shot); SCiERBAKOY,

(died);

others,

40 Ho

mentioned a fow nates who are ViPs now, but did not say anything

nterest. ng about them. For examplo, ho sentioned SHVERNIK who liveson

Lately he nentioned Marshal ZHUKOV's ca ghter who he knew we/have

a good picture of Rina

The only cinclusion ve can cone to from the foregoing is that NOSNEKO

Soviet officialsa, or this nan is not NOSElIKO and ail he knows is the

6. Withr regard to his rother, he did not sention anything of importanco to

us. He did not mention any of his rother's friends anung Soviet VIPB, and

tried to avoid or obange the subject when this matter was kanught up.

7a I am not convincos that NOSENKO lived on Serimovicha and Granavelly

Streets because he gave so littlo information about these areas that

It is Impossi: lo to judgo 1f he actually lived there. Although ha

gave correct inforcation about a fow VIPs who lived in housesin that*

area, other details are lacking which would confirm his residence there.

8. NOSENKO's latost infornation on his educational background 18 so

nixed up and be nade so Iany mistakes regarding Saviot realities that it

is impossible to believe titor any part of his aducation.

9. I don't believe any part of NOSEliKO's story about his mil tary sorvico,

"The laval Preparatory School in Beku and Loningrad:" According to Saviot

regulation; a persen was usually called in the army when he is 19 (those

calied be culled at ago 18:

SOLE POINI'S FROM THE DOCTOR'S INTERVIEW

1. NOSENRCIAX stated (7 Miy 1965) that hs took the cath in Baku

In 1943 when he was 15 years old, but ho did not rorember how he enrolled

in the B aru school. In the sare reoting, he stated that while he was in

the Baku school he was konandir otdelentya • Also in the same interview he

stated that ho was in the loskovskly Flotskly Elipash. It should be said that

the Moskovskly Fiotskly Ekipazh was only for naval personnel who were called

in the regular naval service. All of this should be considoredas a lio.

2. On 10 May 1965, NGSENKO stated that sorewhere he was arrested

when he was l6 years old and was nox put under hose arrest. If this nizart

Incident really took place, 1t 1s nor a likoly that papa helped him to

got out of the arrest of it is possible to think that after this arrest

for some crime unknown to us he was put in jail and then in a corcentration or

Labor camo. This is why NCSENSO tells us a story that in 1944, in the fall,

ha was working for two or three sonths in the forest, where he got sick

and cunditions were very bad. As NCSENKO described it, the enditio s

were nore joix like a labor camp than a regular idlitary unit.

3a Accord. og to NOSENKO's latest story, ho voluntarily wont to

the naval proparatory school of Frunze in 1944 but he didn't start any

studies until November or Decembor 1944, because the wholo school was

24407÷

working in the forest.. Then in February of Varch 1945, the shooting

accident took place and he spent some tibe in the hospital and in May

ho onrolled in a shipbuilding tochicur. NOSENKO tried to mako us

bolievo that whilo ba was in the naval preparatory school he studied

Loth grade subjoats, but as we can see, in actual fact, he did not stuay

anything because he had no time. Intors he stated that sian he enrolled

and

In the shipbuilding technicun in May , the next sonth ho graduated

and rocolved his cortificate as 1f he graduated fron a bigh school,

and got the right to go to a higher institution. only a crazy person

could believe this story.

Lo During all tho interrogations, we never got a clear picturo

internal

how he received his first/passport in Leningrad and how he received his

first silitary ticket. If he really wus denoblized and put in the reservo

1t should take place somewhero later than October 1945 when he became

18 years old. Dofinitoly there will be no talk about any military ticket

beforo you reach 18 years old. And nore likoly at that time he should have

been 19 years dad to have been called into the service or posted to the

reservo. It bhould be noted here if NOSKEIlO really was in the naval

preparatory schoal in 1944 and 1915 and recoired his military ticket in

1945 then he definitely should be two years older than he claims.

On 5 May, NOSENKO naked wore friends. He nonticned again SABUROV®s

sons. Uno of then killed his vilo (Valya lefrinoval, the daughter of

another ran. De uty Minister V. V. YEIRIMOV was deputy to NuSENKO's father.

an example of a person isocosoentieied who is no longer a VIP.

6. On 6 May NOSBNKO told us stories about the oldest san of SABUROV who per

married the daughter of the forrer Minister of Railroads KOVALEV • It

should be noted here that the full story of KOVALEV wis published in my

book The Secrot World, KOVALEV was punished and lost his ViP status in

1950.

7.. On 21 May, In answering the doctor's questions# about his first work in

the KGB , NOSENKO told us a story hit ho received an order to writo a statement

lo arrest a Soviet citizen who was connected with foreigners. (XXXsaX The

Soviet citizen wrote a lotter to the American Enbassy) According to NOSERKO

he rejected this type of work althuugh there was BERlYA's resolution for

felt

arrest (Russian word is raznotat!). Further, NCSENKO extricia that the

man was not guilty. The point of this story was to prove that he was working

in the SCD.

8. On 20 May NOSENKO ones again randinned that the barking hours of the

KCB were from 10:30 in the morning until I o'clock in the corning, with a

, especially

about his early life and schooling up to 1953. Andfrom 1952-1953 and on,

possiblo to nako the interrogation as hostilo as it might bo and to needle

I will not speak fast in order to rake it understandablo. It is understood

that I am going to be correct; but not polito. I would iry to avold getting

In caso of sy participation, I would lika to bo able to use all the information

tha t NUSENKO has previously told us. In utilizing this inforration, I would

like to have a free hand to press him on certain points which I feel would

be of value to usa in gaining a confession from hin. I need pormission to

use the names of Bagley, Big Georgo, and Murphy, of courso, only in the

proper way and when it is necessary. The use of the changes in the

Soviet governmont could be discussed having in mind thauso those events

is at the proper tiro when it 1s apparent that 1t will help hin to cinfess

(the use of only the fall of KHRUSHCHEV without revealing the rise of

SHELE IN and SEMICHASINII.) It could ba used in vari us ways, for example,

a newspajor on the tridex table with inly the headline showing. He could be

allaved to seo the paper inadvertantly and we could seo what his reaction

19. Or, the Inforcation could be brought out at a point in the interrogation

when we are srying to sttees that he must confess since we know he is

tolling lies, and furtheriore, his bosses are no longer in authority in the

S.viot Union and all is lost for him anyhow.

2. During the interrogatin stress should constantly be given to the fact

that NOSENKO 1s be ng used as a tool of the KGB without proper training

of American realitios, and that his missi: n was doned fron the start because

of this.

3. Il it is deciced tu give hin sone drugs, fitshould be given prior to trio hos-

really was at that period. At the same tino, NOSENKO should be questioned

abou t where his parents lived fron October 1941 tara 1942. Also he should

likoly in 1946. If he was postodin activo roserve in 1945 or 1946 then the

question is why he was not called into the ainy.

Tegother with this gies the question of N SENKO's education # in the

Institute of International Relations. The story he told us is

unbellovablo. First he siates that it was a four year course and that

he giaduated in 1949 and later on he changed hisstory and

baid that it was

a fivo year courso and that he graduated in 1950.

2. NOSENKO's first narriago io TELEGIN's daughter and divorce. On this

subject, NCSENKO should be quastioned about his registration of the

nar lago, assports, what district was the narriage registered in, about

apartments on the First leshchanskaya Street, Including his military

status at this tine, what kind of nilitary ticket he bad, when it way

Streats, keeping in mind that these subjecte will really show if he is

NOSENKO. If we do not got proper answeres on hhe first twe subjects,

If ho continues to lie or fivo unsatisfactory answers, then in my

opinion it is not necessary to question him about his study in the

foreig relations Institute. Il the answers are satisfactery or naro

realistic then we would move to the Institute of International Relations.

4. NOSENKO's Entry to tho KGB. Because we have 4 or 5 different dates

on his ontry into the KGB I think it would be a good idea to start goustioning

his froi: the point when he said that once prior to 1952 he bad*

"complete

in the KCB, but he rejected their proposal because he did not like 1t.

From this point we would go on fron the beginning somewhere in 1952 when he
