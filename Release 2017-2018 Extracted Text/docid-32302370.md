/ MM I-I IS RAMON MACHADO, who furnished information

the reference of this letter.

(u)

MM T-3 is PSI-UD

a Cuban exile

who had been residing in the Dominican Republic.

On 6-18-64, JOSEPH VIDAL, CIA, Miami, was contacted

to determine if CIA had an operational interest in the DRE

action described in the CIA Information Cable dated 6-12-64.

It was pointed out to Mr. VIDAL that by letter dated

6-3-64, U.

S. Customs, Miami, had advised

of the "Control

Departure"

of the moton vessel "Susan Ann" from Miami for

the Dominican Republic.

Mr: VIDAL stated that CIA had no:

interest in the DRE operation described in the Information

Cable and

that "Control Departure"

did not mean that CIA

was directing the departure.

On 6-18-64, Mr. STANLEY

SCHACHTER of U. S. Customs,

Miami, stated Mr. VIDAL had contacted him to clarify the

meaning of "Control Departure" and Mr. SCHACHTER agreed that

it was a routine inspection of a departing vessel and did

not infer that there was a U. S. Government operational

He stated the U. S. Customs letter of 6-3-64,

advising of the departure of the "Susan Ann" from Miami

was classified Secret because it reflected the issuance

of re-entry permits to the Cuban exiles on the authority

of the Office of the Coordinator of Cuban Affairs at Miami.

Mr. SCHACHTER stated that he had previously informed Mr.

VIDAL that the movement of the "Susan Ann"

and its crew

did not involve the military action against Soviet or
