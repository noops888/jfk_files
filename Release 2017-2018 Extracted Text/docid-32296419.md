In connection with the top echelon criminal informant

program and the investigation of DE 1027 PC, the following in-

vestigation was conducted by SA BARRON T. CONKLIN.

CODE YSI-C on November 13, 1964, furnished a list of

toll calls of the telephone avenue 4-2803, non-published, which

is located at 1076 Linberg Avenue, in the name of PALAZZOLA, a

relative of DE 1027 PC, who resides at the same address.

tinent telephone calls

were made to CAESER BADALAMENTI

Per-

at. 18860

Santa Marie, Mt. Clemens, a relative Of" ROUGH' EMANUELE

BADALAMENTI

of Monroe, to j. TOCCO, 977 Langlois, Windsor,

Ontario, a brother of

WILLIAM "BLACK BILL" TOCCO of Detroit,

and a telegram was sent to Italy.

This telegram was sent to ANTONIO VIVIANO, 294 Via

35

Corso, Terrisini, Palermo,

"arrived safely, yours truly,

SALVATORE ALUGIOR ALUIA."

The bill was paid by JIM PALAZZOLA.

ARTHUR LA VERDEIER of the Immigration and Naturali-

zation Service (INS), Detroit, was contacted on December 7,

1964, and asked about SALVATORE ALUGI.

LA VERDEIER stated

that there was no reference to SALVATORE in their files but

he heard about this person when investigating SALVATORE

BARTOLOTTA, who now owns and operates the Frog Leg Inn in Erie,

Michigan, and SAM PALAZZOLA of Monroe, Michigan, believed to

be a brother of"WYANDOTTE" JIM and an uncle of DE 1027 PC.

He stated that in 1963, 'ROUGH' EMANUELE BADALAMENTI

and SAM were both supposed to go to Sicily.

SaM did not go

at the last moment and it is believed that ALUGI visited them

in 1963 or 1964 and,

â€žthen returned to Sicily with" ROUGH' EMANUELE

BADALAMENT I.

ROUGH" EMANUELE BADALAMENTI took a trip to sicily.

in the summer of 1964, stayed two months, and returned. The

purpose of the trip was to be married.

LA VERDEIER stated he has done a great deal of

investigation in and around Monroe, Michigan,

in an effort

to determine the present citizenship status of'ROUGH"' EMANUELE

BADALAMENTI, SAM PALAZZOLA, SAM BARTOLOTTA and Wyandotte JIM

PALAZZOLA.

He stated years ago he heard about SALAVATORE

BADALAMENTI had been tried in absentee in Sicily many years

ago, charged with being a member of the Mafia.

He stated

INS was recently able to obtain a transcript of the

trial which took place during 1928 in Palermo.

A translation

of this 28 page document is enclosed. He also furnished a

five page appeal, which is likewise enclosed.

Of those who

were tried in absentee, the following are in this area:

5. ' SALVATORE BARTOLOTTA, SOn Of TOMNASO, from

Cinisi.

This man is identical with SALVATORE

BARTOLOTTA who resides in Erie, Michigan, and

who operates the Frog Leg Inn.

7..

VINCENZO PALAZZOLO, son of ANTONINO, who is

believed to be WYANDOTTE JIM PALAZZOL, father

Of DE 1027 PC, now deceased.

8. SALVATORE PALAZZOLO, son of the deceased

GIUSEPPE from Cinisi, is believed to be the

father of SAM PALAZZOLA, presently living in

Monroe, Michigan, at 440 Riverview. SAI

PALAZZOLA was born July 2, 1904, at Cinisi,

Italy. He was naturalized December 3, 1928.

LA VERDEIER stated that the INS in Washington would

have much more information than he had as to where these 11

persons went.

He stated it is his understanding that ANTONIO

PALAZZOLA, listed as number one, came to the United States,

went to New York or Pennsylvania, and is now dead.

Number

two, GIOVANNI GIUNTA, came to the United States, resided at

either Pennsylvania or California, and is now dead.
