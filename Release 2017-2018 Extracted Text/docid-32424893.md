TOP SECRET

Considerations

In our Operational Representatives discussions, it was generally

acknowledged that a widespread revolt of the Cuban people against the

regime might well lead to an open appeal by Cubans for help by U.S.

military forces, as the regime's security forces attempt to crush the

revolt. The Cla operational people, who would implement a stepped

up Course B as Phase Il of Operation Mongoose, do not believe this

course of action by itself would bring the overthrow of the regime in

Cuba; they believe that the use of U.S. military force in the final stage

must be anticipated, for success.

At the close of the attached CIA section on "coyert activities, "

there is a list of policy approvals deemed required. It is suggested

that this be read in cor

with the ClA: eperational suggestions ar

outlined in the section

It is noted that authority would be required

for overflights (resupp

teaflet drops, infiltration, exiltration), use

of U.S. submarines for infiltration and exiltration, major sabotage

operations, stepped up psychological actions (including propaganda

balloons and establishing a medium-wave Radio Free Cuba), training

Cubans on U.S. bases, some operational use of Guantanamo, and

more flexibility in the composition of paramilitary groups (section

of Cubans in U.S. forces and strengthening with non-Cubans)

In the "covert activities" section, it is noted that ClA would sup -

port State in any feasible action to develop individual Latin American

country support and would provide covert support to the CRC and appropriat

Cuban groups, to assist in the achievement of the goal of Operation Mongoos:

My own comment is to urge that you give the fullest possible con-

sideration to the concept of actions by Cuban groups, and actions from

and by Latin American countries, to achieve the goal of Operation

Mongoose. Consideration of this concept is urged, since it alone

could offer making the responsibility for initiative and actions reside in

groups and countries other than the U.S. If a support concept is

possible which would permit U.S. assets to assist such non-U.S.

operations, with reasonable assurance of mutual objectives and methods.

then this would be the most desirable concept for winning our goal.
