"October 17, 1942

"My Adored Turrocckka:

"I received your letter from Washington and the one

you wrote me when you returned to New York.

I received them

today, and one bears the date of the 7th, thus it took 10 days

when it should have taken 3 at the most, it is a scandal and a

shame. But we can only tolerate the law of the stronger. I

have received notices from Washington and they are very

pessimistic. It seems there have been persons who have made

declarations against you and have sworn, Gringo style, to their

declarations.

Also they do not forget your expressions and

opinions, that you have foolishly and unwittingly made so

many times in public.

And It seems that all of those personages,

high personages, to whom you used to say you were related, have

said these were your lies, and that they deny being your

relatives even remotely, nor do they even care for being your

friends. How much I regret this life of mine and the bad part

Is I do

not know 1f it will have a solution or when. I do not

know what to say or to whom to turn.

"I am completely certain that the friends whom I have

trusted the arranging of this matter are true friends of mine

and that they have done with complete sincerity and interest

all that is necessary.

You already see how I was able

obtain your permit to enter Mexico, when there exists a

Presidential Decree strictly prohibiting the entry (to Mexico)

of all European aliens. But the matter of Washington is beyond

my reach and only you, asking for a conscientious investigation

and asking them to clarify your situation, only you can get

something.

If you continue patiently enduring your situation

in the United States then detained you are. Now that they will

not let you leave there, you are playing the part of a coward

or culprit.

Firmly demand that they show you what gives them

the right to treat

you thus, and if they do not have the right

that they let you leave that country and let you go wherever

you please. It seems that neither do they like your economic

situation,

that is to say that you do not receive income from

employment business and naturally the poor things cannot obtain

from you the corresponding taxes. I think that is the only

reason for they do not have the

right, nor is it their business,

"If your income 1s from practicing the noble profession of

gigo1o or hiring yourself as a Sodomist. I am sad and furious,

and disconcerted. I could come to join you there or at least

we could spend some two or three months together. From the

Embassy (Mexican in Washington) they will give me telephonically

the visa and airplane priority. This they have promised me

formally, but unfortunately my economic situation at the present,

what with the construction of the house and the payment I have

just made for the College will not permit me to be able to make

the trip to spend a few months with you, something which I

desire with all the forces of my body and sould, and which would

make me very happy: But I am seeing if soon they pay me a

mortgage, and my adored if I have a little money I will go to

give you all my life in my kisses.

If you could see how unhappy

I feel. I cry so much thinking that even the 'Morito' has

the happiness of being with you, unless in his ignorant brutality

he should know the happiness he

has, and of which I am so

cruelly deprived. I kiss you a thousand times, adored, write

and love me.

"you yesterday, you cannot do this by correspondence, neither

by telephone.....luckily.

Do you know that Dr. Arvizu's wife

died last night, at the moment of having her first chila, after

eight years of being married. I think that is what might

happen to me, but no matter,

life of mine, what better proof

could I give

you of my love, than to die for you, suffer unto

death?

"My adored one, when you have the money for me, please

deposit it in the Bank of Julio Beache on Wall Street, deposit

it in my name, telling them to communicate by direct wire with

the Leishman Bank here in Mexico, and put at my disposal here,

immediately,

the amount that you deposited there, that way I

can receive

"You know, that you should not be surprised that the

ambassador does not answer you, nor will he answer you, I will

explain later the reasons, but two or three days ago, I sent

him a letter, like the ones I can write when I want to, and I

am certain that I am going to make him ashamed of his conduct,

after all he offered me here. In the first place, I am certain

that Duhart has influenced him with his black opinion of you

that he has, I do not know why, and in the second place there

are certain personal and egotistical motives that make him act

like a fool, like there was nothing he could do to arrange 1t.

I do not think that they will giver you a permit to leave, but

I again insist that you do not need it. If you accept my

suggestion, which I assure you is a good one, for I have all

my documents in order, the line of conduct you should take is

to go to the Mexican Consulate, that they may give you documents

to enter here and calmly leave the United States.

Several

persons in the

needed this departure permit, but they told you this only to

cause you trouble and

complications, for they know very well

that they are not going to give it to you and want to

laugh at

you, when you ask for this permit to refuse you, when they know

perfectly well that you can leave the United States without

needing this permit. In any case, the Polish Ambassador should

complain as to why and with what right they are detaining you

there.

"I do not believe, life of mine, that you have worked

on these people with the energy that you should have. You

should cause a real scandal for all of these unjustified

abuses that they have made you a victim of, and I believe that

sooner or later you should make them pay dearly, all of the

money, time, reputation and even health,

that they are making

you lose with their stupidities, fear and petty vengeance.

four or five in the morning. With whom were you out so late?

the loving lok of your eyes. Save yourself for me, as I

taining Interesting and unusual people. MOHRENSCHILDT was

a professor of geology at the University of Texas sometime

during the 1940s and it is possible that he was with the

University at the time that LA I-4 met him.

LA I-4 and MOHRENSCHILDT became good friends, primarily

because of their mutual interest in women, and saw each other

frequently in Houston from about 1942 to about 1946. They

were also involved together in "

1946 to about 1950 when LA I-4 left Abilene, MOHRENSCHILDT:

came to Abilene frequently on business, although he never lived

there permanently. During these visits MOHRENSCHILDI often

visited at a cottage owned by LA I-4 on a lake near Abilene

where they sometimes entertained girl friends.

After leaving

Abilene and returning to Dallas, LA I-4 was visited. by MOHREN-

SCHILDI several times a year, up until about November, 1962:

MOHRENSCHILDT has been married at least four times.

The first three times he married women of means, but never

seemed to have any real love for any of them.

He was very

interested sexually in the daughter of one of his wives.

His present wife is a white Russian from China. LA I-4 knows

nothing regarding her beliefs or convictions.

His mother was a "pure white Russian" who died

early. MOHRENSCHILDT spent a considerable amount of his

youth in Russia.

During their Abilene days especially, LA I-4

and MOHRENSCHILDI discussed politics frequently.: LA I-4

stated,

"There is no doubt concerning the strong pro-communist

convictions of GEORGE DE MOHRENSCHILDT. "

He is an opportunist

and without moral scruples.

He has contempt for the American

way of life and for capitalism and has stated that he appreciates

the security derived from a communist government. After one

of these discussions in Abilene, LA I-4 told MOHRENSCHILDT

that if the United States ever

would get a gun and "take care"does to war with Russia, he

of MOHRENSCHILDT.

MOHRENSCHILDT

merely laughed. In reply to a question by LA T-4, MOHRENSCHILDI

stated that if

this country is ever invaded by Russia, he

would have a very good chance of coming into a top position

with the Russians.

Because of IA T-4's personal convictions concerning

MOHRENSCHILDT, he declined to sponsor MOHRENSCHILDT.

for

citizenship in this country when requested by MOHRENSCHILDT.

AlSo LA I-4 alluded to MOHRENSCHILDI's pro-communist belieis

and convictions when talking to MOHRENSCHILDT up until the

activity, but considers him intellectually shallow and

incapable of originating or executing a complicated scheme.
