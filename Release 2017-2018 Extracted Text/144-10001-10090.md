Minister, to President DORTICOS, who told Dr. ROA to inform'me

that on that same day he [ESCALES] had been executed, before

Cuba knew about Mexico's note.

In any event, the sentence of

capital punishment would not have been commuted, because he was

one of the principal persons responsible for an attempt Ã¤gainst

the life of the Prime Minister, Dr. FIDEL CASTRO.
