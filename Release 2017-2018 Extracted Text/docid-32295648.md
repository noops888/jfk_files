I contacted Rosie Ellen ROSENCRANTS (Mrs. Maynard Burton

ROSENCRANTS, D. B. 3 MAY 1888 this date.

She is presently

living with

her daughter, Flornce May. DARRES (Nee ROSENCRANTS)

Who appears to be about 60 yrs.

of age.

Both ladies could not

remember much about Michael MORO's activities in the U.S.A.,

but were sure that he had no business attachments in this

province outside of the buying and selling of antiques on

MiCH

one occasion.

selling antiques, and they were married around 1934. None id

Irene MORO, met Micheal MORO when he was

of the family knew very much about MORO at this time, but

they intormed me that he was born in Italy, and had beer

brought to the U.S. by his parents as a young boy. Neither

of the ladies knew that he had lived in Buffalo N.Y. After !

the marriage, Micheal MORO came to Bear River N. So nearly

every summer, accompanied by his wife, and on occasions

his brothers Albert, and Harry MORO.

While in Nova Scotia,

they never travelled around, and usually spent about two months

here on vacation.

Mr. and Mrs. MORO moved to Phoenix Arizona

shortly after their marriage and on the advise of his doctor

a doctor CUNNINGHAM, who was practising in Chicago about 1936

and is now believed

deceased.

While in Chicago,

moro operated

a barber shop,

Phoenix.

but his

present business is not known.

His last residence

was in Berwin Illinois.

3. When Moro moved to Phoenix Arizona, he operated the

rosevela Tavern, the Venice Cafe, and the Italian Gardens.

He lived on Ocanto Drive, Phoenix, and was well known in that

area.

Florence May DARRES, visited with him for two winters,

in 1938 and 1939 as she recalled, and also worked as a waitress

in the Venice Cafe.

She stated that although none of these

places had been licensed, Italian wine was always served with

Mrs. DARRES could not recall many of MORO's associates,

but named a David GOLDBERG, who owned a jewelry store in Phoenix,ARIZ

and a lawyer by the name of WHITNEY. He also had dealings

with MichealXLANZO, who was an employee in the printing office.

A lawyer by the name of "SARACA" also visited MORO on

Went ins

occasions, and he also travelled to Detroit on several

occasions

to see him.

Mrs. DARRES stated that she could

MrS. MORO (Irene) came to Bear River. alone, as the climate :

would not permit Micheal MORO to come back

to this area due

to a bronchial condition.

Irene was subsequently murdered

by Myron Randolph SELIG over a dispute between them that does

not apper to hinge on anything to do with Micheal MORO or

his associates.

After his wife's death, MORO re-married, but he kept this

marriage a secret where it concerned the ROSENCRANTS, and

it was not until after his death on 10 APR 65 that Rosie

ROSENCRANTS received a

letter from MORO's second wife.

A Christmas card

dated 12 DEC 64 was received by Mrs.

ROSENCRANTS frOm MORO,

and it was post marked Pomona

California. The letter Mrs. ROSENCRANTS received from hi s

wife had the return address 550 Webster St. Pomona California

on it. Nothing has

been heard from Mrs. MORO since then.

Micheal MORO had three brothers, and one sister. They

are Albert MORO, last known address

Berwin Illinois, Harry

MORO, Berwin Illinois, Tony MORO, whereabouts unknown, and

(Mrs. Frank) CAPPERRELLI, who's husband worked in the City

Hall, Chicago, about 15 Yrs ago. Albert and 'Harry were both

barbers when they were known to Mrs. DARRES and Mrs. ROSENCRANTS.

Insofar as this investigation relates mainly to John ROSELLI,

neither Mrs. DARRES, or Mrs. ROSENCRANTS recognized the name or

any of the aliases..

Neither had ever seen ROSELLI, and they

did not recognize the photographs which I showed them.

Through

conversation with Mrs

DARRES however it was learned that

MORO

employed one Victor STEWART STEWARD) as a bouncer in his

establishments in Phoenix The latter, she stated appeared

to be a very close friend of MORO, and

that she was told

that he belonged to a police force in Phoenix. Mrs. DARRES

stated

that she had no reason to question this explanation, and it

does not appear to be information of any significance.

ARiZ

7.

As far as can be determined at this time, MORO was not

well known to either of the two ladies interviewed.

They could

not supply accurate dates, and in most cases attempted to guess

when certain incidents happened. These dates have been

reported but may not be accurate. I feel that if MORO was

engaged in questionable transactions, his relatives were not

aware of same.

Photographs are being returned herewith.
