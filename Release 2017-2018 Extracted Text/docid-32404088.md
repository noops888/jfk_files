Dear Dr. Gunn:

Re: Request for Additional Information and Records

No. CIA-16 (Oswald Pre-Assassination Files)

and

No. CIA-IR-24 (Defector File)

This is a partial response to the ARRB's referent

request for pre-assassination files this Agency may have had

on Lee Harvey Oswald. It is believed the following comments

and two enclosed documents fully respond to the Office of

Security questions.

The Do response is pending.

1. At Tab A is a 22 December 1997 memorandum

containing information from the Agency's Office of Personnel

Security which provides details about the files it had on

Oswald prior to the assassination plus when and why they

were created. These include the Office of Security file on

Oswald, a general file on Americans who had defected to

another country and information about HTLINGUAL files.

2. Also enclosed at Tab B is a 27 October 1977

memorandum from the Office of Personal Security which

explains the numbering of that Office's file on Oswald. In

particular, it explains why the "missing" volume V may never

have existed.

3.

An ARRB staff member has reviewed the Oswald

Security file and the file on American defectors.

4. The Oswald Office of Personnel Security file and

those pages of the defector file deemed relevant by the ARRB

staff member have been forwarded to HRG for review and will

be processed

according to current release guidelines.

If you have any questions about this response, please

advise.

Sincerely,

J. Barry Harrelson
