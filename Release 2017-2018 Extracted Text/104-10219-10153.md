a "valuable long tern asset with stay behind potential."

In order to place the matter

1n the apropriate fome of roterence 1t 1s felt irat a few back-

ground points should be noted.

In Jemary 1956 the IINITY/LILYIC baseiouse was set up end placed in operation

1n a site balch provided visul coremye of the LIstICk Installecion. A deposit or

three monthe rent was node per teres of the rental contrect at tha: time (2,160 yesos.)

In April 1961 the building in which LIMPTY/LILYRIC 1s located was sold by the owner.

lorrally tle rental deposit would have been trnsferred to the new ciner as fart of

However, epproximately tirce months after the transfer of the

property to the new orner,

the renirl doposit was returned to the basehouse operator,

LISNTY-1}.

The dejosit was then returned to OBRENDE, GRINDE did not infor the

then LIarY case officer nor the present case officer of the retir of the LIMPTY/

about the incident and has twice stated that nothing of this nature vould happen again.

With the reality of suture LOPINTER teste

set firaly in ORED2's mind, 1t 18 belleved

that he will not atreapt any such action again.

As to what can be done of a positive nature (other than perfoile re-ICPIUITER) to

prevent recutence it Just be roted that GlE kept ejart the s lor preon whieh were

really still charged to hig and the Statior had no waj o! knowin; t'et the nores tai

Only when the close soon of the lsdr!

LILYRIC barchouse sould be effectel wani the Statlon exject to haie the rental deposie

Until such tige the deposit would remain crarzed to canaida.

The only way

to completely safeguard against this type of action vould be for the case officer to

meet directly with the basehouse keepers, thereby eliairatine G339,03 Iron the operetlor

and causing unaccepteble security risks.

It la belleved that periodie ICPLUTTER 0E

GEKENDE 18 the best insuranco against a slailar occurence in the future.

As to GERSIDE's regular operational revolving fund, Irregularities have never

been discovered in his handling of these funda. Cash counts are colucted b. the

case officer to control the uispent portion of tho revoliing lund by coparison vith

accountings (receipts) GIM: -aies every ewo weeks.

GOURDE's revolving fund 15

kept at the minims agount consistant with efficient conduct of the operation for vich

OBRINDE 1s responsible.

The "other false claims" ORINDE admitted making involved occasional use of his

@ vehicle for personal drivino wile entering all recelpts for gas on his KUlARK

accountings, Station does not consider this a major problem. If GANDS used hie

car for only operational employment any hostile surveillance of him vould be relatively

easy (1.0o, surveilling only when he is using his l' vehicle) and it 13 belleved that

latitude must be allowed in this arca for indigenous agents.

In the area of OERENDE's morale and his statement that he "Is not being

ut1lized to his full potential" the station 19 as fully concerned as Headquarterg. It

should be noted however, that GaUNDE has never vritten the report setting forth biat

he thinks he can do and thon proided on this has stated that he had been thinking about

that additional work he could assume and that ho "just does not know". The reason he

Elves 18 he does not know what alce is being done in the operatiors aren other than thet

to wnich ho lo already exposed. Alditional operational work 10 assigned to abRina

when this can be done securely and taking into account compartmentation of operations.

An example of this vas his introduction to the AMROD operation. Station 1s reluctant

to expose O'H-ITE to additional operations anly for the purpose of Iaproving big borale"

since he alroady has considerable knowledge of uny Station past and going operations.

The Station appreciates Hcarqunners coments on the resulta of GRaNDE's LOPLITER

and will make every effort to determine the best possible utilization of GRaDE in

the future.

2. In the Statton's opinion, GERENDE's continued Superlor per-

formance of his LIEMPTY PrIncipal Agent duties justlfles another salary

Increase. Headquarters attention Is invited to the recent Request for Renewal

of Project LIEMPTY wherein GERENDE's dutles were specifled.

3. It is requested that Headquarters intriate an appropriate amend-

In compliance with the KUBARK regulation, CSI-F No. 230-60,

Annex A, concerning contact arrangments under emergency conditions, the

following information, Including recognition signals and bona fides, Is

forwarded for Headquarters records. Due to the sensitivity of the information,

it was believed more appropriate to forward it separately rather than to

include ir with reference (Request for Renewal of Project I.LEMPTY).

2. Insofar as can be determined at the present time, GERENDE could

probably be contacted at one of the following places:

a. Present Residence: IDENTITY A

b. Mother's Residence: IDENTITY B

c. Cover Employment Address: IDENTITY C

3. The following oral recognition signals, using the English language,

are to be used as indicated:

CONTACT:

GERENDE:

CONTACT:

GERENDE:

4. For use as physical bona fides, the Station is forwarding a one peso

note with the serial number T348510 for Headquarters files. GERENDE has

been given a one peso note with the next higher serial number, T348511, to

keep in a safe place pending his having to show it to some furure KUBARK contact.

It has been explained to GERENDE that he is to show his half of the physical

bona fides only after the recognition signals have been completely and

accurately recited and his new contact has requested to see his physical bona

fides. GERENDE has also been instructed to assure himself of his contact's

bona fides by asking to see the contact's one peso note (T348510).

5. Assuming that adequare time will be avallable at the beginning of an

emergency condition, it may well be possible to instruct GERENDE in Secret

Writing so that correspondence could be conducted using IDENTITY D or E

addresses.-

A.

HMMA - 13063, 5 June 1959.

HMMW-7959, i2 August 1959.

1. Forwarded herewith as Attachment No. One is GERINDE's signed

contract amendment. GERENDE is most appreciative for the raise in salary

and is delighted with the new Terminal Payment claus:.

The Station interprets the Terminal Paynent clauss to mean any

termination by the Government or acceptance uf GERENDE's restination in

the "beat interests of the Government."

Examples in connection with the "best

interests of the Government" Interpretation would involve GERENDE's resignation

for health reasons or other logical personal reasons such as a clunge of residence

to some geographical area where hig services could noi be utilizid by KUBARK.

Assuming thai no securiry problems are involved in making such & payment, the

Station also interprets the clause to be applicable for payment to CERENDE's estate

in the event of his death while in the cinploy of KUBARK.

3. The Station understands clearly why the clause was not written as

originally requested and concurs in Heauquarters reasoning. Certainly, the Station

would not want to give GERENDE a terminal payment, and he has been so informed,

it he elecis to resign just to reccive some extra money or to pursue some other

carcer. The Siation hastens to add, however, that to the best of its knowledge,

GERENDE has no intention of resigning from his present KUBARK Job.

4. As requested in Reference B, enclosed as Attachment No. Two are the

original and one copy of the contract amendment dated 1 September 1957. Head-

quarters wili note thai the amendment was accepted by GERENDE and approved by

the Chief of Siation, but was not formally witnessed. li is suggested that

who is presently in Headquarters, be requested to witness the

document.

that CPD was deleting the original compensation figure of $3600

Instead of the figure sent by the Station which was 940ß0. In

chocking this out, we find that we have no copy or notification

of the amendment dated 1 Septeuber 1957 increasing bis salary

from $3600 to 84080, CPD 18 reuritting the contract ulthout

using & compensation figure for the amount to be deletod.

When we send thie to the flold, ast then to send us a copy

of the contract amendment, dated 1 Septeaber 1957. Also inform

them that they are to execute and retain the original copy of this

new contract amendment. It may by well to point ut that Subject's

tormination clause stipulates that he will received this beneflt

only if ve terminate the contact.

Friarys

1955 under provisions of an oral agreement. Effective 1 October 1955 GERENDE

was placed under a written contract, prepared by Headquarters, with an annual

his salary to $1, 080.00 per annun:, which is the salary he is presently receiving.

It Is requested that a new iwo year con raci be prepared, to be effective 1 July 1959,

providing an increase in salary to $4,500.00 per annum and including a termination

clause which will give GERENDE a termination payment of one month's salary,

calculated at the prevailing rate of compensation at the time of termination, for

each full year of his KUBARK employment.

All other provisions of GERENDE's

Initial contraci should remain in force. (The increase in salary to $1, 500. 00

per annuin is already covered by the LIEMPTY Projeci.)

2. As pointed out in the attachment to HMMA-11368, 22 October 1958,

paragraph three of MEXI-2336, 25 November 1958, and in the LIEMPTY Pield

Projeci Outline, GERENDE is a highly valued full-time Station assct who carries

a significant work load and who has a great deal of responsibility. He is :he

LIEMPTY Principal Agent who handles the LIMITED, LILYRIC and LICALLA hase

houses, the LIENTRAP operation, the outside photographic processing and trans-

lation service and all the agents participating in these activities. He performa

his dutles in a conscientious and professional manner and his already excellent

abilities are showing continued improvement.

3. Paragraph eight of HMMA-12095, 4 February 1959, indicated that the

Statton was considering amending GEREVDE's contract to provide for some type

of retirement benefits.

Although it is Iccognized that indigenous agents are not

usually granted such contract provisions, the Station believes that GERENDE should

have monetary incentive, in addition to his idealogy, to make a long career with

KUBARK. Accordingly, the Station recommends that GERENDE's new contract

provide for a rermination settlement of one month's salary for each full year that

le has worked for KUBARK.

In other words, should GERENDE's career with

KUBARK last for 24 years and his yearly salary at the end of this period is $3,000. 0,.

then he, or his heirs, would receive a lump sum payment of $16, 000. 00. After

considering different types of insurance plans, an escrow account and several

other ideas, the Station considers the above proposal to come closest to meeting

the criteria of control, production incentive and creation of the desire to make

KUBARK acarcer. The date, 18 March 1955, should be used as the beginning date

for the computation of GERENDE's termination benefits.

OPERATIONAL SECURITY REVIEW OF

RAYMOND R. CERENDE'S

OPERATIONS AND ACTIVTTTES

SITUATION

ot Scarton on is une the lure 1958 LAST Lap, ad decle by che conten

with several

GERENDE. After being Introduced to GERENDE[

assumed contact responstbltrica with GERENDE on 2 July 1958.

+27491

J July 1958, the Chief of Station decided tha

permanent responsibiltry for the management and handling of GERENDE and

GEKENDE a operartoas.

PURPOSE

The purpose of this operational securtly revlew is threefold:

To Identify possible security problems and conditions;

To establisa a framework for recommendarions which will

result in the Station's submiasion of a new support project

(LIEMPTY) with Raymond H. GERENDE as a principal agent; and

To acquatnt the new case officer with the operational problems

and agent personnel with which be should have a comprchensive

knowledge aind detalled understanding.

3.

PRINCIPAL AGENT - Raymond H. GERENDE

Background - GERENDE has been employed by KUBARK since

Is March 1955, which was just prior to his graduarton from the Mexico

Ciry College. L

but in the Station's opinion,

le a mature, experienced and dedicated KUBARK contract agent. During

the three and one-half years that he has been working for

Station, GERENDE has participated in a varied assortment ni support

and release c

and intelligence operations. Intrially, he was trated and used I

as a member of the LIPSTICK survetilance team, In addition,

to survetllance work, he was used as an investigator to collec operational

data on persons and organizations of interest to the Starlon. He quickly

demonstrated a capaciry for leadership and at one time was the leader of

the LIPSTICK team. He has been used aB & LIFEAT Base House operator

and processor of tapes; he has crcelled In thia tune if work because of

his bl-lingual Spontsh/ English facily and, more Importantly, due to

his diversified expertence in clandestine operattons which permits him

so spor operational leads much more readlly than the average LIFEAT

monitor.

Dutles - GERENDE la currently serving as the principal agent

In charge of LIMITED, LICALIA, LIPSTICK Photo Truck, LIJERSEY

Surveillance Team and LILYRIC.

In addition, he montiors and processes

the EGMORNING and Cuban Extes LIFEAT taps. He alao supervisea

the photographic processing of LIPSTICK-38 (his brother-tn-law) and the

translatlon work of LIPSTICK-40 (nis atater). He maintains contact with

and provides administrative support to LIMITATIUNS 5 and 6, LIOOOL-7

Base operators. Quie obvlously GERENDE's many dirtes overlap the

bounds of several Station operarions, namely LIPSTICK, LUERSEY.

LIFEAT, LIOOOL and several activites which are nor listed under

wir: formal projects such as BGMORNING, It is recognized by the Station

that it is not advisable to have one principal agent connected with as

many operarlons as 1s GERENDE. However, the present scarcity of

both staff and contract agente of the principal agent type neceastiate

such efficlency measures. Every effort is being made to compartment

the varlous segments of GERENDE's operations and to decrease, and

to elimtnate where posalble, all lateral communications between

agents.

ecurity Problems • The most serlous security situatio

surrounding CERENDE and his many activiries is the fact tha

LIPSTICKS 12 and 30 (two of the LIPSTICK Team members arrested

ta the June 1958 Nap) know GERENDE by true name, and knew that he

also worked fur KUBARK: In iact, LIPSTICK-30 is a close personal

friend of GERENDE's and was originally recommended for KUBARK

employment by GERENDE. The operatonal security hypothests that

can be constructed from these existing acquaintances are too numerous

to list in this brief review, suffice to say that should GERENDE be

arresied by one of the local police agencies, most of the remaining

support asacts would be destroyed or so serlously compromised that

the Starion would indeed be foolish to conttnue using them. It ts

appropriate to stare here, however, that netther GERENDE nor the

Starion believes that GERENDE has yet been named or otherwise

Identified as a result of the LIPSTICK flap. It ly granted though that

any future questiona by one of the local police agencies to the compro

mised LIPSTICKERS represents a continuing type of danger for GERENDE,

Based on the duties which GERENDE is currently performing, the readers

of this revlew can well Imagine what the consequences to several operations

would be ll GERENDE were arrested by one of the local police agencies

and Inierrogated in detall. Also, the Stailon must forever be aware ua

the Incal police ngencles are certalaly capable, for only a lew dollars, o

selling informarion concerning KUBARK t0 the Soviets and/or Satellties.

Recommendations - It would be unwise to consider terminating

GERENDE since he is a highly compercht agent and since his termination

would not elimtnate the inct that he knows a great deal about the Statton's

support opcrations. He has becn reminded several times, and the Case

Officer wUll conttnue to remind him, that his tradecraft proissionalism

must Improve and stay ahead of the Ircreasing sophisiication of the local

police agencles and oppostiton services

* It is the opinion of the Starton that GERENDE should continue

to be used in about the same manner that he li predently being used, Is

would be advisable, however, to separate him from the two Life easts

functtons -he la currently handiing, BGMORNING and the Cuban Exile

taps. This is suggested nor only because of the possible future securly

ramificitions, bur also because GERENDE does not have time to run

properly ble aupport mechantam and to monitor laps seven days a week.

To provide for a situarion whereby one of the local pollce

agencles becomes aware of GERENDE'& Illegal activities and assuming

that elther CERENDE or the Station leamns of thia before the local police

agency can take postiive action, it is imperative that a warning system

i communications be establiahed to facilitate GERENDE'S remoVa

Arrangements such as those used _

could be set up or local arrangements could be made with ODUNIT oF

The Case Officer

date he decided to reslyn from his LIMITED job and, arange

as li may seem, to devore full time to working on a chicken

farm. LIPSTICK-28 made this decision on his own and against

the wishes of his lather. He will continue to live at the

Ease lE known to LIPSTICKS-2, 14, 27 and 28 and to

Jand Raymond H. GERENDE and possibly to

LIPSTICK-12 (CERENDE's opinion). Since LIPSTICK-14 has

LIMEWATER is LIPSTICK-2'& brother, li Is important to recognize

that the destrable degree of compartmentarion between LIPSTICK/

LIMITED and LIFEAT probably does not exist. Altholigh LIMEWATER

in thia connectton, GERENDE has been Instructed to reorgantz

hts extering communications arrangements with LIPSTICK-14 to

Include a new regular system, a rapid non-acheduled system and

a reserve svatem.

LIPSTICK-14 was instructed on 8 August 1958 to cease all

social and buziness contact with LIPSTICK-2. L

_Rho has prevously handled LIPSTICK-14 and sees

him occasionally even now, has been directed to cease all

serving as a spotter for potential nurvetllance team members, he

also serves as the cout for the LILYRIC Base. GERENDE

manages and directs the LILYRIC Base through LIJERSEY-5.

LIJERSEY-5 maintains direct contact with LIJERSEY-l, the

Base House operator, and his wife, LIERSEY-12, who does

LUJERSEY S contacte LIJERSEY- 2

at prearranged car contact potnts and receives the "take"

LUERSEY-2 directly, but this procedure is used only when LIERSEY-5

1e out of town or otherwise not avallable, GERENDE does not

know LUERSEY-12 or vice versa. No reserve syßtem of come

muntcations exists whereby a Station officer could contact

LIERSEY-2 directly should the need arise; however, GERENDE haB

been instructed to set up slich a system of communicattons. The

same will be done with LIJERSEY-5, although he ta known to

several Starion officers and little ditticulty would be experlenced

In contacting hin directly.

(4) Security - The securly of the LILYRIC Bae вуревтв,

at least on paper, to be in better shape than the Limied or

LICALLA Bases, Insotar as the Case Officer has been able

1o determine, the only indigenous agents aware of the LILYRIC

Base are GERENDE, LIJERSEYS 2, 5 and 12, and LIPSTICKS

38 and 40, and all of these individuals have a close connectien

with the operation of the Base.

The only tie-in the LILYRIC Base

has with the LIPSTICK operations la through GERENDE.

(5) Recommendations - GERENDE has been Inatructed

so change his meeting plans with LIJERSEY-S and to revlew

the communications ser-up berween LIJERSEY-5 and LIJERSEY-2

(L-5 and L -2 are long-time friends and, consequently, the

cover problem la mtnimized). A staggered schedule of

coverage of the LIMERICK target between LILYRIC and LIMITED

was tairlared on 18 August 1958. Although the operators of

these two bases are unaware of the existence of the other,

a suitable cover story has been worked our to saristy any

Is would be possible to contact him through

should

something happen to GERENDE. However, to facilitate proper

and secure communications procedures, GERENDE has been

directed to establish a reserve system of communications with

Lipstick-39, using the customary oral and physical bonatides.

(1) Security- The most serious securly problem concerning

LICALLA Is the fact that LIPSTICK-39 is the brother of

LIPSTICK-47 |

Although it ta generally

belleved by Station officers that LIPSTICK-39'e name was not

mentioned by LIPSTICK-47 nor that any indication was given

concerning LIPSTICK-39's Job, it must be understood that

should the local police agency l

interrogate

LIPSTICK-47, the probability exista of compromising LIPSTICK-39

and LICALLA, The Stacion sees no way to overcome this

possiblity.

SECRET

## Page 102

1d-0d0d

SECRET

It le Important to note here that LICALLA occuples one of the four

LIMUST properties,

While it te believed that LIPSTICK-39 does

not know that KUBARK owns the Base or has anything to do wich

the other three houses, il le entirely concelvable thai should one

of the local police agencies or the LIMLAICK pirsonnel become

aware of LICALLA activities, they could very eastly arrive ar

some logical conclustons about all of the LLMUST property, Thle

would be detrimental, lí no: lainl, to our aims. However,

another Starlor viewpoint on thie same problem is that if compromised,

LICALLA would divert suspicion from, rather than 1o, LIMUST.

Should one of the local police agenctes begta an Invesilgatton which

mighi tavolve LIMUST and LICALLA, then LICALLA could be

sacrificed to protect the LIMUST Base. These possibilities

become somewhar theoretical and perhaps impractical due

to the lack of predictiblity of the local polfceagencies, but neverthe.

less must be welghed one agatnet the other.

In view of the apparent importance of the LIMESA/LIMUST

operation a lor of thought and discussion have transptrer at the

Station about co tinuing the LICALLA operation in lls presens

location or suspending it fur the immediate future and attempting

to find another sultable locerion away from the LINUST property.

A sound argument can be made for termlating the base since such

an alemative might have the effect of limiring any knowledge

LIPSTICK-39 may have about the LIMESA/LIMUST Installation.

However, the terminarion of a produciive base such as LICALLA

would require an explanation to LIPSTICK-39 which could not help bur

leave him a bit suspicious. For Headquaners Information, the

local rental laws are such that LIPSTICK-39 would not be able to

comprehend why we did nor insist on him maintaning " squatters

righia" (as stated prevlously, LIPSTICX-39 apparently does not

know that we own LiCALLA or even have an interest in any of the

other LIMUST properties) which can eastly be done l

Therefore, any attempt to terminate LICALIA mighi cause more

of a security problem with LIPSTICK-39 than permuring

LICALLA to operate as it is now. Another posstbiltry would be

terminaring LIPSTICK-39 and putting another ager? in the present

LICALLA Base. I this measure were followed, is would nor

elimtnate the fact that LIPSTICK-39, even if terminased, would

still know of the extstance of the present LICALLA Base. Still

another possibllty would be to terminate LIPSTICK-39 and the

LICALLA Base; however, since LICALLA and the other LIMUST

properties are ostensthly owned by one man, LIMOUSINE, suspicions

and investigatlong could still lead to LIMUST.

seycral years. At the present time LIPSTICK-2 la responsible

for the day to day operation of the photogruphic survetllance

In the past, LIPSTICK-2 has served as ream leader

of a low level survelllance team (which was compromised and

subeequently disbandod), as a LIFEAT line Inspector (when he

was not busy with the photo truck), and as a start survetllance

man (Le., used as an outside sentry during the March 1958

entry of the LIMUST Base by KUTUBE/D, KURIOT and KUCLUB

rechnicians. (NOTE: LIPSTICK-2 was assigned the sask of

watching the entre area during the day for any unusual acrivity

on the part of target persornel.

He was not told that he was to

watch a spectfic house. He was dismissed from his stalle sur

velllance before dusk and the Headquarters technicians did not

enter LIMUST until after 2030 bours.) LIPSTICK-2 Le the brother

(LIPSTICK-34) is the listed owner of the photo truck. The personal

knowledge of LIPSTICK-2 about the LIFEAT operation also represente

a security hazard of the first class. For example, if LIPSTICK-2

were compromtsed and arrested as a result of his activities,

there in a possibiliry that he could compromise his brother,

LIMEWATER, the LIMITED Base and LIPSTICK-14, GERENDE

and our interest in the highly sensitive LIMESA/LIMUST operation,

(NOTE: According to the LIFEAT Case Officer and the former

LIPSTICK Case Officer, both LIMEWATER and LIPSTICK-2 have

been reminded on several occasions during the past few years

that they were not to diacuss any aspect of their operations with

each other. Also, LIPSTICK-2, to the best of the Station's

adcress. LIPSTICK-2 has already been Informed that he la lo

have no contact with LIPSTICK-14 or any other uperational

personnel he may know except, of course, LIPSTICK-24,

with wisom he works, and GERENDE, who supervises hla

activlites. In addiion to the above, the Statton should begin

thinking about a replacement agent for LIFSTICK-2 and every

effort should be made to set up an independent and compartmented

photo truck operation. Thia would permit the eventual terminarion

of LIPSTICK-2, after we have given him several months to

reduce lila knowledge of current operations.

LIERSEY 4 lu of a low social class and

He la

the sole support for his mother and several younger brothers

and sisters.

He la described by GERENDE as having a lot of

ambition and a strong desire to improve hts standard of living

and poeition in life. The Station has found him to be a good

observer and, consequently, adequate for static survelllance

work.

Although he now has his drivers license, he is not a

capable driver and probably will never develop into one.

GERENDE has been encouraging LIJ ERSEX-4 to obtain employment

_to supplement his KUBARK Inoome of $1, 000. 00

(MIN) and to establish himself in a cover job. However, LUERSEY-4

has not yet obtatned such employment. It is the Starton's

opinion that LIJERSEY-4 la defintrely an asset of limited value

and will never develop Into the high-calibre survelllance asset

which the Starlon really needs.

LIJERSEY-8's struation is about the same as LAJERSEY-4'8.

He lives with his famtly and is currently taking highschool

COUTBES (LIJERSEY-4 is doing the same). He ta not an imaginative

talker and has difficulty making up cover storles and spur-of-the-

mometil excuses and explanaticas - the vital quallficarions for a

money. However, as In the case of LIjERSEY, LIJERSEY -8

le at best an asset of only limited value. LIJERSEY-8 aleo

recelves a salary of $1, 000.00 (MS) per monch.

LUJERSEY-13 does not know LIJERSEYS- 4 and 8 and vice versa,

LIERSEY-13 le better dressed than the other two team members

and can pass as a berter educated and more socially flexible

....... Indtvidual. He speaks fairly good English." He performs pretext

tovestigatton assignments with faculty and imagination and is

adept at making up cover stortea. In brief, be makes a good

impression on the people he interviews. He le not a good

driver and ls too nervous to develop into one. Hle salary la

are used

week and the LIJERSEYS are

Instructed to go to each meeting. They have standing Instructions

to continue sotne to thetr meeting sites

setting up new and more complete communicatione arrangements

with the three LIERSEYS.

(* Security - Insofar as knowledge of other operations,

personnel and assets is concerned, the LIJERSEYS appear to have

the best security of any of the operations handled by GERENDE.

New communtcarions plans with the LN ERSEYS w lll do much

toward increasing security and ability to mees contingencles.

GERENDE will be Instrucied to give refresher training to all

three LUERSEYS in operational security, cover and communications.

The ma for danger existing with the LIERSEY team, and with any

survelliance team, Is the possibilly of compromise and arrest

by oue of the local pollce agencles. Should the happen, GERENDE

and his other operations would be placed in considerable danger,

For this reason, is la not advisable to have GERENDE

prospectire candidates of a higher soctal standing for use on a

new survelllance team; however, even under optimum condlilons,

one and a half years will be required to ger such a ream functioning.

In order to recruti the type of team member that will be most

worthwhtle to the Starion, we musr plan to pay a mulmum starting

salary of $1, 600.00 (MN) per month. The cost of livlig In

Mexico la continually on the rise and where $1, 000.00 (MA)

was a good salary one to two years ago, li really la nor adequate today.

CONCLUSIONS

I would take several weeks of minterrupted study of tues to wrie a

really comprehensive security review of GERENDE's operations and activities.

Ilenwever, based on the facts contatned in this paper, li la the Station's opinion

that GERENDE probably la not now known to the local police agencies as a

KUBARK or FBPRIME agent. It is belteved that GERENDE could be Identfled

by the local police agencles at any sime they choose to Interrogate LIPSTICIS 12

and 30 in detail or when one of the other agent assets formerly or currently

assoclated with GERENDE is compromised. Furthermore, If GERENDE la

arrcated, he could compromise most of the Station's support assets, plug the

BGMORNING and Cuban Exlles portions of LIFEAT.

Given several months time, the slow procesa of compartmentarion

can be introduced into GERENDE's operations. Such compartmentation, however,

will never reach the truly desirable polni, bur some improvement over the

cxisting siruation can be made.

I GERENDE can emerge basically unscathed

from the current Incidents, then KUBARK will have an extremely valuable

Jung-range support asset.

toll all to the police.

Recommendations:

LilE be briefed so as to be ever ready with an insocuot

GERBIDE be told to contact one of already blown Station

6. Re para. l C, LICAILA Is a very special problem and should

I thought LICALLA had been cancelled out when Inesa began to shape upo

I consider it a danger to LIMESA.

Has LICAIIA produced anything of

value? I think we could vacate this in such a lay that the agents in

LICALLA would have no cause to ba suspicious.

Racosmendation: Get rid of LICALIA unless vory productive. Better

do this before the remodeling begins.

Re para l d, photo truck. LIPSTICK? does know of the locations

of sone of the basehouses on LIFEAT since he was a line inspector.

Recommendations:

so New compartmented truck should be set up. Don't use false
