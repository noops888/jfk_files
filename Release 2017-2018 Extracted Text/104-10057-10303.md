Marina and Lee Harvey OSWALD

The subject of the OSWALDs was introduced into the

Interrogation during a discussion

about the difficulty a

Soviet citizen, who marries a foreigner.

encounters in

attempting to leave the USSR if the KGB

chooses (for some

reason) not to permit the Soviet citizen to emigrate:

Subject stated that it goes without saying that prior to

receiving KGB's sanction not a single Soviet citizen, whether

he or she is married to a foreigner, would be allowed to

leave the USSR.

Asked If the case of Marina OSWALD's departure from

the Soviet Union was typical, Subject replied that her

departure from the Sovlet Union was neither typical nor usual,

particularly in vier of the fact that her husband, Lee Harvey

OSWALD, was a very strange individual. He had been in Cuba,

and then came to the Soviet Union not as a tourist, but as

an American defector who renounced his American citizenship

and attempted to become a Russian citizen.

This In 1tso1t

is unusual for an American - lt is not typical and very rare

for an American to do so, and Subject belleved that an

American doing what OSWALD did (seeking Soviet citizenship

and renouncing American oitizenship) could only do so because

he was a traitor.

In answer to a request for his opinion regarding the

OSWALD case, Subject said that all of bis information was based

only on what was known to everyone who read the newspapers

after the KENNEDY assasination and on what he read in a con

densed version of the Warren Report while he was in Western

Europe, When pressed for his personal opinion he said it was

& very.

unusual situation.

Normally a Soviet citizen (11ke

Marina) would not be allowed to leave the Soviet Union, in

fact the Soviet authorities would try in some way to convince

the citizen not to leave.

However, 1f a Soviet married a

foreigner, and insisted on leaving he or

"There have been

cases where a Sovlet eitizon married a

foreigner and received

an exit visa, however, in such cases the Soviet authorities

have conceded to the elt visa requests only because they felt

that the foreign spouse may have had some Influence, and could

have created adverse publloity for the Soviet Government had

the exit visa not been

granted.

This was definitely not so

in OSWALD's case.

OSWALD could not insist that Marina be

granted an exist visa since he was not in a position to do so.

and consequently the Sovlet authorities were not compelled to

do so unless they specifically wanted to let her go to America

with OSWALD.

When asked to stl11 further elaborate on bis bellefs

regarding the case, Subjeot stated that in this case (OSWALD's).

the KGB kept OSWALD In "their flold of vision" and

undoubtedly worked with him.

To Subject it is unthinkable

that the KGB would miss such an opportunity, since it

always considers using persons (such as OSWALD) for work

agent, or in any

other way "to infliot damage to

Asked whether the assasination of President KENNEDY

could be considered as

"being damaging to the West", Subject

ansvered in the affirmative.

Subject explained that the existence of a government

such

as the United States 1s a threat to the Soviet regime.

The United States is an example to the rest of the world

(Soviets Included) that people can live,

survive, and have

a higher standard of Ilving in a democracy.

Therefore, the

Soviet Union tried, and tries, to cut the U.S. Government

down at every opportunity.

Since President KENNEDY was looked

upon by many: in the Soviet Union as a popular personality.

KENNEDY's personal attraction further raised this feeling

that living in a democracy had its benefits, to an even higher

lovel with the general population of the Soviet Union.

When asked 1f It was possible that KGB could or would

over sanction such an operation (the assasination) Subjeet

answered "yes, at that time (KHRUSHCHEY's) It could have".

CHRUSHCHSV was considered by Subject to.be an ignorant

individual who was willing to take risks and adventurous under-

takings.: Subject said,

however,

that this could never occur

under the present Soviet leadership.

Subject considered that

the decision to carry out such an operation, (the assasination)

could not have been made by the Chairman of

the KGB since he

does not possess such authority, and, therefore, could only

have been made by KERUSHCHSV himself.

Subject was asked if such an operation might not have

Involved a terrific risk which could have possibly resulted

in an armed confilet between the two nations, had Soviet

Involvement been proven by the Americans.

Subject felt that

even if the Americans did accuse the Soviet Government of

complicity in the assasination,

the Soviet Government would

certainly deny such an American accusation, claiming that the

Soviet Union

and in all probability would repudiate such American claims.

To underline his point, Subject mentioned that even

though OSWALD was. In the Sovlet Union.

and was suspected

because he was in

Cuba, nothing happened and the Soviet Union

wasn't accused by the Americans.
