Re:

Bureau teletypes 11/22/63, 8:00 P.M.;

11/22/63, 10:29 P.M.; 11/23/63, and 11/24/63.

On the evening of 11/22/63, upon instructions of the

SAC and the ASAC, the following steps were taken in

accordance with Bureau teletype 11/22/63, 8:00 P.M.

SA WILLIAM F. GLOSSA AND SA THURL STALNAKER, who

coordinate the criminal and security informant programs,

respectively, were instructed to furnish to night clerk

MICHAEL BARLETTA the identities of logical criminal and

security informants and sources to be contacted and

Clerk BARLETTA Was instructed to notify each senior

resident agent to have these sources contacted. Clerk

BARLETTA, SAS GLOSSA, STALNAKER and SLIFKA also notified

appropriate headquarter city agents to contact logical

sources.

The above was done on the evening of 11/22/63, and the

morning of 11/23/63, and the informants and sources

contacted advised they had no information bearing on

the assassination of the President.

The New Haven Office in the past has conducted a survey

to develop information concerning any known Klan, hate

group, and bombing suspects in Connecticut, and this

investigation did not develop any concrete information

indicating individuals in groups of this type existed

in Connecticut..

Bureau teletype 11/23/63 instructed that daily summaries

need not be submitted, and, accordingly, the you 18958-8

the above were not furnished the Bureau.
