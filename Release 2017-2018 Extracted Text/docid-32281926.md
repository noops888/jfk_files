operational lead, not intelligence, was la Mr. John Martine,

born sAugus

• AT the

time in question, that is, April 20 June of 1963, he was a

resident of Miami Beach, Florida, and, as I told you in my.

previous testimony, he provided a series of operational leads

to some Soviets who were allegedly defectors from a missile

site and were in the Province of Oriente in Cuba, which we

were attempting to establish contact with Me Marcino is

the only individual that I am aware of during my tenure as

the Station Chief in Miami that we were in touch with who

was involved with gambling syndicates in Cuba prior to his

arrival in the United States.

MI. Baron.

And was

Martino connected in any way,

to your knowledge, with any assassination efforts against

Fidel Castro?

Mr. Haley.

Not that I know of.

Mr. Baron.

There was one other matter that we asked

before we began today, and that is a remark that you made at

page 30 of the transcript of your previous testimony, where

you said, "I never recall discussing assassinations with

John McCone.

Now, in terms of discusssiong with Richard

Helms, these were conversations in which atmospherics in

Miami and problems like that would be discussed and I am sure

somewhere in some of these conversation's the mood of the

community, the subject of assassinations undoubtedly came up.
