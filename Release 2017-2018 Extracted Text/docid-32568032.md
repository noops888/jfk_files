Moscow. At this hotel one orders coffee at a serving bar, then

carries it to any available table.

On this occasion, JONES Was

occupying a table where Dr. McDANIEL found an enpty seat.

le described JONIS as about 28-30 years old; slender

face, and large prominent nouth. JONkS has a really out-soing,

bubbling personality. He introduced himself and told Dr.

MCDANIEL that he was an Amorican citizen and lived in lavana,

Cuba. Dr. MCDANIEL became interested then and talked with JONES

for about an hous, starting at 11 P-".,September 4,1903 • 30N2S

said that he had not finished his education and wanted to return

to the United States to do so. Although Dr. MCDANIEL, cannot

recall the verbatim conversation, there is no question in his

mind that JONS was sympathetic to communism. He asked if JONES

was a momber of the Communist Party. JONES said he was not a

member but was fully sympathetic with the aims and goals of the

communist novenent.

This was almost an exact quote of JONES'

response, to De. MCDANIEL's recollection.

JONES did not say why he was in Moscow. However, he

was greeted by a number of Spanish speaking people, mostly wonen,

who treated him with some deference as if he were a guide of

sone sort for a tour. This, however, was only an impression of

Dr. MCDANIL's and he had no conversation with JONES to verify

1t. Dr. MCDANIEL did not see JONES! wife in Moscow and had the

impression that she was a psychologist like him.

JONES said he went to Cuba on vacation about the time

of the revolution in Cuba,

He considers CASTRO a Great man who

has done so much for the Cubans that they can never repay him.

JONES described CASTRO as a humanitarian who does not like

violence.

When Dr. lcDANIEL asked him about the executions by

CASTRO, JONES defended CASTRO and explained the executions in

during the revolution when the citizens of Cuba

caught followers of BATISTA, CASTRO told them not to take the

law into their own hands but to let the revolution handle

these people. If CASTRO had not done this, thousands would

have been killed.

Then, although CASTRO did not like to do it,

he had to execute some

JONES waS
