SENHTDENTIAL

As of August 13, 1964, BATISTA did not leave

the United States for his

military training camp, or the

Dominican Republic. He planned to leave en August 13th

but canceled his plans for some unknown reason.

The MDC previously maintained a clandestine

radio at its military headquarters, 837 S.W. 28th

Avenue, Miami. This clandestine radio was recently re-

moved and reportedly returned to its owner.

On August 17, 1964, ANGEL VEGA and CESAR GARCIA,

two members of the military section of the MDC, went to

Key West, Florida. The purpose of the trip was to try

to locate a commercial shrimp boat to buy for the MDC.

BATISTA feels thât if the organizatim had a commercial

fishing boat, money could be earned to support the or-

ganization's revolutionary activities.

At the MDC military headquarters, self-study

courses in military training and theory are being given.

These courses do not deal with the actual firing of

weapons or the use of detonators or explosives.

During the middle of August, 1964, BATISTA was

studying a number of detail maps of Cuba. Some of these

maps bear the stamp "For official U.S. Government use

only." These maps were obtained by BATISTA from ROBERT -

". BROWN, an American adventurer, part time writer,

former University of Colorado student and U.S. Army

Reserve Captain.

be classified and are regular military type maps used by

the United States Army.

On August 24, 1964, BATISTA stated he would

now concentrate on raising funda for the MDC. He planned

to meet a number of leading Americans for the purpose of

soliciting contributions:

He also planned to contact Dr.

FRED CROCKETT, a Miami Dentist, and an active member in

the JOHN BIRCH Society. BATISTA felt that through

RE TORN BEETH SC

CROCKETT he could solicit funds from the JOHN BIRCH

Society.

BATISTA was working on a 12 page memorandum

designed to show the organizations needs, what could be

accomplished with sufficient money and material, and re-

quested individuals to contribute to the MIC. This memor-

andum was written in English and was planned by BATISTA

to serve as a stimulus for money contributions from

Americans.

On September 9, 1964, classes were given in

the theory of demolition at the MDC military headquarters.

BATISIA stated he planned to leave Miami about four days

previously but he has had problems with the U.S. Immigra-

tion and Naturalization Service (INS), and consequently

he had postponed his trip.

On September 15, 1964, BATISTA's followers at

the MDC military headquarters were getting ready to ship

military equipment out of the United States. They were

packaging and crating miscellaneous

nilitary equipment

and planned to make the shipment on

September 16, 1964.

This military eqipment did not include any

automatic or semi-automatic weapons. BATISTA stated

a number of different types of guns were stored at an-

other location, not identified, but they were in the

process

of being made ready for shipment and those

guns would meet the MDC boat. BATISIA did not identify

the name of the boat or its location.

The previous day, BATISTA was in possession of

85 dynamite caps and about 50 nen-electrical dynamite

fuses. He had two new rifles, some grenades, parachute

had not yet sent the shipment of military equipment out

of the United States. He said that in view of the recent

sinking of the Spanish freighter SIERRA ARANZAZU by

Cuban exile raiders, there was considerable pressure on

Cuban exiles in Florida from federal law enforcement

officers. BATISTA said he had postponed the shipment

and it would be made at some time in the future.

States for his training camp located either in the Dominican

Republic or the Bahamas. It was unknown hew he left the

United States, who might have gone with him, or what he

took. His followers figured that he took his military

equipment with him when he left and this equipment would

be shipped to his military training camp.

PATRIA is a Spanish language paper published

weekly in Miami, Florida.

On September 11, 1964, PATRIA cortained an article

stating that the Muc issued a lengthy document accusing

American agencies of being led by exile movements that are

split up and divided. The MDC claimed the United States

goverment artificially creates leaders for the Cuban

• edle movements, persecutes independent Cuban exile organ-

izations, and interferes in Cuban exile affairs. The MDC

uses the

term "check-eaters" to refer to those persons er

organizations which have received financial aid or backing

from the United States government.

MM I-2, another government agency which conducts

Intelligence investigations, on September 30, 1964 advised

as follows:

A Cuban exile with excellent contacts in the

Antillean Marine Shipping Corporation, on September 15,

1964, reported that BATISTA spcke with officials of the

Antillean Marine Corporation about the unloading from the

M.V. TITAN in the Dominican Republic of one 23' Viking

class boat, equipped with twin Mercruiser engines, and a

radio telephone.
