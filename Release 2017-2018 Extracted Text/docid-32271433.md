At this point, the Central Intelligence Agency

determined that it would ask the Mexican Government-- w.FX

whom it had a good relationship with--to arrest Sylvia

Duran because she might shed some light on the circum-

stances surrounding the assassination.

Sylvia Duran was

A1sã a Mexican citizen, and aid not have diplomatic immunity.

The Central Intelligence Agency's Mexico City Statior

identity paition

sent a note to Luis Echevarria requesting that he arrest

Sylvia Sylvia Tirado de Duran

immediately.

'he agency

stated that she was a Mexican citizen who had put oswala

in touch with the Soviet Embassy

The agency

gave Echevarria

a note with Duran's address,

her mother's address, her

brother's address, her license plate number, her home

phone number and her place of work. The Mexico City

Station also suggested that Duran be held incommunicado

until she could be questioned on the matter. (Note to Luis afove

Similar logic dictated when Headquarters asked the Mexico

rogate Sylvia Duran to the extent necessary to clarify

the outstanding points raised in their fables the previqus

forty-eight hours. Headquarters stated that the Mexico

City Station could provide questions to the Mexican

interrogators but that they wished no Americans to come

in contact with Duran. (Cable CIA Headquarters to Mexico

When the Central Intelligence began to deal with

the Warren Commission, Headquarters cabled the Mexico

City Station that their present plan in passing informa-

tion to the Warren Commission was to eliminate mention of

telephone taps in order to protect their continuing opera-

tions. Headquarters stated that they would rely on Sylvia

Duran's statements and on the Consular files which the

soviets gave the state Department. Headquarters stressed

that exact, detailed information from Tetamil-7 and

Tetamil-9 (Penetration agents in the Cuban Embassy) on just

what Sylvia Duran and other officials said about Oswald's

visits and his dealings would be valuable and usable

corroborative evidence. (CIA cable from Headquarters to

Headquarters further cabled that the Warren Commission staf-

fers knew that the Central Intelligence Agency had tap

assets and that they might have guessed from the coverage

that they had photo points and a source in the Cuban Em-

bassy, but that they did not know the details on the Agency's

arrangements with the Mexicans. Headquarters stressed

that the Chief of Station should lend them all the needed

assistance with the minimum possible disclosure of assets

and technigues. (Ibid,) - Reminl Bent to explaini
