A source who is a high ranking Cuban military officer who has

contacts among Cuban officials the has not submitted many

reports,

September 1963 that Major Jose Ramon FERNAYDEZ Alvarez, Chief

of Training, General Staff of the Cuban Rebel Army, 1s

Communist and a military type in the strictest sense of the

all political elements.

He is proud of his present status

and thankful to CASIRO for it; for fear of losing it he

appears unwilling to undertake any kind of activity against

FERNANDEZ' attitude and has suffielent confidence in him to

retain him in his present position.

CASTRO also is aware

that he has few officers with

the military disciphine,

know-how, and experience possessed by FERSIDsZ.
