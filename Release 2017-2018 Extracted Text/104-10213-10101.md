"Fersistent questioning by sheriff's deputies,

and conteminating the breathing apperatus visa tubercle bacill.

Gottlieb does not remember that cane of the scheme or what happened

to the scube sult. San Halpers, who was in on the schere, at first

said the plan was dropped because 1t vas obvicusly impracticable.

He later recalled that the plan was abandoned because it vas overtaken

In learning of the Roselll-Ho gun lin's, ve are relleved of sce

need for speculation as to how the story has gutten out. It 15

quite likely that Rosell1 1s the scurce, Morgan the channel, and

the need for speculation as to why the story is beinz told. The

suspected.

a-He may now assume that Pearson's story Is not patcked

together fran bits and pieces picked up here and there. His

ultirate source, Rosell1, knous more about certain detatle of

the gambling syndicate operation than se do, and he evidently

has talked. Irfing nou to hush up further leaks night dó sore

harm than good; the story is already out and probably in
