REGINO and wife

have been in Fla. for several weeks but that LA ROCCA was

first observed on 10/21/63.

Fisur shows LA ROCCA's house is partially shuttered

but is inhabited.

Shutters may be due to hurricane threats

in area. LA ROCCA not observed by BuAgents but source is

reliable and she states REGINO's house keeper confirms that

subject is here.

Iwo cars have been seen in subject's

driveway, a Studebaker bearing 1963 Pa. plate 625-10P and
