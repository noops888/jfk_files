MEMORANDUM FOR: Director, Center for the Study

of Intelligence

FROM:

John Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT:

Meeting with JFK Assassination

Records Review Board

This memorandum is for your information.

1: On 18 May 1995, members of the Directorate of

Operations and the Historical Review Group met with the

JFK Assassination Records Review Board to discuss the

declassification of CIA records. The Board had requested

the meeting for purposes of educating its members as to the

categories of information that probably will require

continued protection i.e., by deleting words or inserting

substitute language.

2.

The discussion focused on some 30 documents that

describe CIA operations in Mexico City at the time of the

assassination. Among the categories of information

discussed were: locations of stations, surveillance methods,

intelligence liaison relationships, names of agents and

staff officers, and pseudonyms and

cryptonyms. In a number

of instances we suggested alternative ways of describing

sensitive information, which the Board seemed to find a

reasonable approach.

3. No decisions were made by the Board during the three

and half hour meeting, but the session was highly productive

in terms of providing

the Board a basis for understanding

material in documents related to sensitive sources and

methods:

Board Chairman John Tunheim told me that the Board

found the discussion very helpful in helping them fulfill

their responsibility for approving or disapproving all

recommendations to withhold information.

The Board's

Executive Director, David Marwell said it was a valuable

meeting, and he complimented the Agency representatives for

being willing to engage in an open-minded discussion that

not scripted."
