"End Ih1s Confusion"

The editor of the "Herald Express" today demands

that the law governing wiretapping must be amended... "to

protect the rights of law-abiding citizens; and amended 1n

such clear language that the shield of 'civil rights'

cannot be employed by hoodlums, murderers, kidnapers."

He points out that evidence obtained by wire-

tapping cannot be used in federal cases, and other courts,

state and federal, have held that this

prohibition extends

to states in which the laws permit the use of wiretapping

for gathering evidence in criminal cases.

"Without legal wiretapping, law enforcement

agencies would be powerless to deal with many kinds of

criminal activitles, and the imposition of the federal

stricture upon the states would, in the opinion of police

and prosecutors, result in a 'gigantic legal jailbreak.'"

The decision of a U.S. Appeals Court that federal

courts should not interfere with state prosecutions in

which state-approved wiretap Information 1s used as evidence,

Is acclaimed by the "Herald Express" editor because it

"returned the element of common sense to the law." However,

he does not feel that this ruling 1s enough.

He thinks the

Federal Communications Act, Section 605, needs to be spelled

out "so that even judges and justices can understand 1t.

"It was never meant to protect the criminal,

but has been so construed in hair-splitting decisions."

According to

This conversation between the CI and SAs followed

PERRY MASON television series who the informant has known

for years.

He said TALMAN was recently bemoaning the

adverse publicity he had received from his Involvement in a

swing party with SUSAN SNOW, one of the best known nude

models in pornographic circles, and her husband.

Informant said he has many times attended swing

parties with TALMAN and a motion picture actor, DANE CLARK,

usually at KENNY DUNCAN's place.

Another couple often t

these parties'e actor WAYNE MORRIS, now deceased, and his

wife, as was PAr-BUTTRAM, the comic reflef actor in Gave

AUTRY's shows.

According to Source, swing parties often go on

through the night and morning, and getting a second Invita-

tion depends on a guest's "sportsmanship" which 1s said to

be judged by DUNCAN who keeps a sort of scoreboard. One
