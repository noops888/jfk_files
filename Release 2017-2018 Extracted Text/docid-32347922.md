25 November 1963

SUBJECT: Mr. Lee Harvey Oswald Caule

walter Po HALTICAN Flint

It makes little difference now, but REDWOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswalß's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed -- sometime in Summer 1960 --

with the then_Chief and Deputy, Chief of the 6 Research Section the layeng

on of interview(s) through KUJUMP or other suitable Channels.

At the

moment I don't recall if this was discussed while Oswald and his family

were en route to our country of if it was after their arrival.

I remember that Oswald's unusual behavior in the USSR had struck

me. from the moment I had read the first ODACID dispatch on him, and I

told my subordinates something amounting to "Don't push too hard to get

the information we need, because this individual looks odd." ; We were

particularly interested

in the OI Oswald might provide on the Minsk

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual.BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3.

I was phasing into my LPOVER cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's ariival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

Addendum

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6:

the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually,

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "honé"

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases. We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's vife would actually accompany hin to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the Harvey story.
