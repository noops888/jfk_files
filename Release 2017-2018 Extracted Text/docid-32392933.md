Forwarded for Headquarters retention are 70 volumes

(5 packages) of the photographic take of LLoNION from late

to

reduce its volume of hard copy records, it is requested that

Headquarters retire these volumes to the Records Center so that

in case a need arises, they can be

reviewed by Headquarters.

The Station suggests

that a retention period of 10 years fro

the date of information may be desirable.

The above volunes are being

forwarded Headquarters
