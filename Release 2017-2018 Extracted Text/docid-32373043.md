dated 10 January 1964.)

According to

SD & SSD, in September

Russian official at the Brussels

World Fair, and "was the center of a

great deal of activity for (him)".

stated that Belitskiy, who was

the Head of the British Division of Radio Moscow, had been an interpreter

for the Russians at the Brussels World Fair.

He previously had been in

the United States with his father, who was with AMPORG in the late 1920's/

early 1930's.

basaid that Belitskiy attended school in New York City

and that the family returned to Russia in 1936 or 1937.

With further reference to Mosby,

noted that there was a direct

relationship between Mosby, Koch (Carl Henry Koch, #50001) and Volkoff

(George Volkoff, #152385 - SSD) - all of whom had been of interest with

reference to Belitskiy.

Others whom Mosby knew included Alexander Dolberg, #165651 - SSD,

to whom she was introduced by McKinney H. Russell, 183853 - SSD, still

another who was of interest in connection with Belitskiy.

CI/SIG was advised in late 1958 regarding the above individuals and

informed that CI/OA was also interested in them.

Another who knows, or has known, Aline Mosby is former Agency employee

stated during an interview in November/

December 1960,

when discussing Americans in Moscow who lived beyond their

means, that newspaperman Harry Schapiro*was a very heavy loser at poker -

to the extent that "one got the impression he was on the Soviet budget."

Schapiro, he said, had a Russian wife who was more aggressive than he.

added that newspaperwoman Aline Mosby was in Schapiro's office;

and commented that she "stuck mostly to the Foreign circuit rather than

the Embassy circuit."

He said that she had been in the hospital on several

ocassions during the previous year, so that "one didn't see too much of her";

and added that

according to gossip one hospitalization was ocassioned by an

abortion.

Another newspaperwoman in Moscow, whom

mentioned, was Priscilla

Johnson, #71589-DI.

She has been mentioned in newspaper articles as one who

recalled having come in contact with Lee Harvey Oswald in Moscow, where she

interviewed (or talked) with him. Her name, like Mosby's, was listed in his

address book under her

last name only

Mosby was born on 27 July 1922 in Missoula, Montana; and graduated

from the University of Montana in 1943. She was employed by United Press

in Seattle, Washington, from 1943 to 1945, and was Hollywood Correspondent

for UP

she resigned voluntarily in 1957 and her employment was satisfactory. Ac-

cording to Confidential informant R-1, during an Agency investigation in the

fall of 1958, she was dropped by UP when she was subpoeaned in connection

with legal suits against Confidential Magazine, for which she had done re-

write work without

the knowledge of UP. She went to the Brussels World Fair

as a stringer for the North American Newspaper Alliance. She was considered

loyal by her associates during the above period; but was described as "the

co-existence type who associates with Russians" ("plays footsie with the

Russians"). No informant questioned her loyalty.

In January 1960, Mosby reportedly was introduced on the Dave Garroway

show,

"Today", as NBC News' Correspondent; but in a State Department dis-

patch of 12 December 1960, which listed "Western Correspondents in Moscow",

she was named as representing UPI.

According to HUA records, Mosby did a motion picture critic type

article for the Daily Worker in 1947; wrote an article for the Daily Worker

at Laguna Beach, California, in 1949; and contributed a column to the Daily

Worker on 23 November 1956.

According to records of the Civil Service Com-

mission, the Daily Worker of 26 July 1957 and 29 August 1957 carried infor-

mation regarding her.

* Harry Schapiro is Isaac Henry Shapiro, #402610-C, who (with his wife)

was the Subject of an FBI Espionage investigation in 1963.
