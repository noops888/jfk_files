Participant in tie CIA Fetirement and blonbflity dysica.

1. do yuu may know, ie are

the process of revieding the employment

history and current carcer field of ail employeco in the girey to idencity

those wio are cliglble for designation as a participant in thu new CIA

Reclinent aud Disubility System.

In this process, the initial review or

each case is mude by the individual's Career Service.

Career Serrive nominates him for participation in the cyston, tils nomina-

cion 1s reviched by the CIA Retirement Board which recommende final action

to me. Forever,

If the lead of the Career Service advises that the copiejes

does not meet the basie reguirements of 89 20-50 for participation, I bare

this finding without further review by the ClA Retirement Board.

This practice has been adopted in the interest of expediting this cercening

that those employees who are eligible to participate in the sji-

com my de deoignated partlilpante as soch as possible..

case, the leud of your career seivice has surloes me that

you do noi met the requirements of Ha 20-50 lor designation as a partici

pant and I have accordingly mude the fornal determinution required by the

regulation cut you are not eligible for desigation. From a revier or sour

record it appeurs that the decision of your Career Service was baseà upon

the fact that you have 15 years or more of Agency service, but have not as

yet perfored 60 months of qualifying service as requireá by regulation. My

determination that you are not eliglble at this tine for desiration in no

way afrects your current status under the Civil Service Retirement System,

nor does it preclude reconsideration of you: elialbility to participate in

the CIA System if you should meet the reguirements for designation in tie

Should you desire further information concorning the requirements

for desigation as a participant in the CIA Retirement System, I Suggest crat

you read paragraph e of MR 20-50 and paragrarà 5 of the Employee Bulletin

dnted 30 July 1965, entitled "Public Law S0-643, The Central Intelligence

Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Ampioyces"

It is always possible that the records upon wrich the determinaiios

made in your cuse may huve been incomplete or inscourste regarding your situal

employment history wiil the Agency.

siter stuiing the materials cited

above, you have questions regarding the determination that you are not el gi-

ble to participate in the CIA Retirement Systes, ploase feel frec to contact

offlelals as your Career Service:

Tney are Familiar with the cctalls en your

case und will gladly discuss them with you.

In adultion, you may wish in disa

cuss your case with the CIA Retirement Stati locuted

quarters (extension 0001). If such discussions do not resolve any mercare

you have czarding your eligibllity, you may request that your ease ke inali

considered by the Board. Ebrever, this reguest must be made within 30 aajo vi

NARRATIVE COMMENTS

For approximately four months during 1967, Mr. VItale

worked with me in providing Headquarters'

support to JNNAVE

1n its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN. In such

a role, Mi. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanics,

requirements and BRUMEN personnel of these operations was

invaluable in (1)

the preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee,

(2)

the provision of timcly opcrational

information periodically requested by the front offices of

both WIl/COQ and WIlD, and (3)

the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newly assigned to JMVAVE to assist in these

operations.

While

under my supervision, Mr. Vitale

was a conscientious,

cooperative employec

who readily

tasks

assigned.to him

in

and willingly porformed

an exceptional manner.

always

expressed

his willingness to work

For approximatoly four. months during 1967, Mr. Vitale

worked with

me in providing Headquarters'

support to JMWaVE

in its conduct of special operations into PBRUMEN.

In such

a role, Mr. Vitale's knowledge of the history, mechanies.

requirements and PBRUMEN personnel. of these

operations was

invaluable in (1) the preparation of operational proposals

for the 303 Committee, (2)

the provision of timely operational

information, periodically requested by the front offices

of

both wH/COG and WHiD, and (3) the briefing of WOFIRM personnel

newlj assigned to JMWAVE to assist in these operations.

While

under my

supervision, Mr. Vitale was a conscientious, loyal

cooperative

employce

who

readily and willingly performed all

tasks assigned to him

in an exceptional manner.

He nlways

expressed his willingness to work as many hours as necessary

to finish the task at hand.

He has a very pleasant person-

alitY, gets along well with his fellow workers and exhibits

cost consciousness

in the use of government

equipment and materials. The rating letter "S" most accurately

reflects

the level of performance of Mr. Vitale during the

COMMENTS OF REVIEWINO OFFICIAL

I have had opportunity to observe subject's performance closely

for

nine months and while I generally concur in his supervisor's ratings

of the duties as

ana hor tunity to obsery

listed, it should be noted that these same duties could

be performed ecually well by a nore juntor Intel Clerk or Intel Assistant

and, therefore.

the overall rating as a GS-8 Intel Assistant does not

accurately reflect his capability.

In my opinion it would be very diffi-

cult,

if not impossible,

His maturity and many

years of experience in his field, in addition. to his grest general

knowledge, make hin a nost valued employee when compared

colleagues of similar rank.

It is because of this that I have

again rated Mr. Vitale very high. Although Mr. Vitale has no

fully realizing his limited

undergraded and should be promoted to the next higher grade

at the carliest opportunity:

Because Mir. Vitales job and

The fitness report for the period of his duty with the German Branch is

accordingly only a record of the fact that he loyally and diligently carried

out assigned tasks to the best of his ability.
