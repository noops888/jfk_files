Rifforty has alleged that Hayes piloted tho plano which made

the alr strike over the Niagara sugar mill in northem Pinar

del Rio Provinco on 17 January 1905.

Hayes rentod

an alrcraft

in Orlando and

flew to Immokalco,

Florida,

near Naplos,

whorU

ho knows a man who owns a molol

close to a landing strip.

The

strly

is equipped with night-landing lights but no towor.

Thore

the plane was refueled and lunded with bombs supplled by

"Mino," It then took off for Cuba.

The MIRR's 12 - 13 Fobruary raid of the Babia Honda sugar mill,

also to Pinar del Rio Provinco,

was handled directly betwen

Hayes and Bosch. Johnson was eliminated when layes reported

Johnson's failure

to turn over all of Hayes' fee. for the Niagara

7.

Johnson gave Hayos only $300 and kopt the rest.

Hayes Informod Bosch that be bad only recoived $300, Bosch pald

him $1,000 and arranged for the second flight which took place

without Johnson's knowledge.

Hayes is divorced from his firat wife but is in tho process of

re-marrying her.

Hayes,

who to been working on date to .

in Arkansas,

was recently Jailed for using his employor's credit

card.

He was later released when he agreed to pay or work off

the debt.

8.

A Texan naned Dennis Overstreet, who claims to know layes since

childhood, said that Hayes is a

tough customer who would traffic

In anything. He la a very good pilot and can fly a B26.

Field Comments:

1. "Mino" may be identical with Daniel Orlando Ramiroz Denis,

an explosives specialist.

2. This is probably Carl Riddel of Riddel's Flying Service.
