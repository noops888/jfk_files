Re Chicago letter 6/3/65, to NYawhich requested

Ny to furnish daily contacts of SUE WARREN FRANK to

Chicago in

order to devise, if at all possible, a plan by

which CG 5908s could reasonably contact this person.;

Through a coincidental combination of circumstances,

It now appears we have a unique opportunity to put CG 5908-s

in contact with SUE FRANK.

FRANK has been in contact

with the Algerian Mission to the UN and on 6/15/65,

through Western Union,

she made reservations for a

double

hotel room in Algiers

for 6/27/65.

This means she should

be leaving NYC on or about 6 26/65 which is the day

CG 5908eS plans to go to Albania.

If Ny can findsout what

plare she is taking, we may be able to put CG 590%-s on

the same plane.

In fact, they couldend up on the same plane

with no planning on our part.

ANG'S whereabouts during this period through CIArror h

Chicago's information, TANG wrote

to SUE FRANK in 1963

and asked her to recommend people to come to China.

He

said she knew the procedure, the working conditions, and the

kind of peogle they want. All SUE had to do was prepare

a letter of recommendation and the Chinese would take care

of the rest including expenses.

It could be that this is

the reason CHARLES LOMAN (see below) 1s in contact with

FRANK.

The NY file on SUE FRANK does not contain any

Intormason showing she visited Chicago during the time

appropriate Chicago files, however, may show she was there.

order through Western Union on that date in the amount of

She said she would be gone then.

He also said he Is sending 50 (dollars). LOMAN continued

by saying there is so much to talk about

phone is no good and the mail is bad too.

LOMAN said there

just did not want to write about them.

LOMAN wished her a

good trip, said he would see her in the Summer one way or

another.
