Mexico City - Oswald

This would not involve CIA directly. Appreciation

for our sensitivity

on the sources-and-methods issue was

stated.

They want to concentrate on Oswald in Mexico.

Who did he see, what company did he find, what did he do.

For instance, there is testimony that he threatened

President Kennedy when there.

There is conflicting

testimony, and they want to introduce it.

We pointed out that the only real hard evidence of

Oswald's contacts with Cuban and Soviet officials was

from CIA teltaps.

It was in this way that we knew that

he had dealt with Sylvia Duran in the Cuban Consulate,

so we had the Mexicans question her.

The Warren Commission

was able to quote her, alluding to the existence of con-

firming evidence (thus protecting our telephone operations).

He stated that they hope to have her testify (although it

appears that her appearance is not yet sure). In any

event, CIA sources and methods are to be protected.

We noted that CIA was

for other types of

reporting, but not constituting as firm evidence.

HSCA approach to private citizens who had been reported

as saying things about Oswald--without being operationally

connected with CIA--permitted direct evidence from them,

without reference to CIA.

He agreed in this, although

he did not state what witnesses in this category he

may use.

Blakey asked if photographs could be used to show

witnesses.

They would be CIA surveillance photographs.

He thought they could be cropped, noting that others

had been

so treated (the unidentified man

in the Warren

Commission report).

We replied that

it may well be

possible, but we would want to have our

experts check

the photographs and discuss how they would be used.

We touched briefly on the earlier unauthorized use of

CIA photographs in a press release, for which he

apologized:

SECRET

He asked if actual transcripts of telephone

conversations could be used.

He spoke of techniques

of cross-examination to get

witnesses to acknowledge

or recall things they otherwise would not or had not

testified to. We made the point that it probably

would be very clear what the source was.

Shepanck

pointed out that this would be equivalent to acknowledge-

ment of the teltap operations--implied confirmation.

Hawkins pointed out the extreme sensitivity of Mexican

officialdom to this publicity, in addition to its exposure

of an operational activity that continues.

We expressed pessimism about agreement to this, but

undertook to study it upon receipt of the transcripts

the Committee wants to use.
