H9715 BAt

On March 27, 1975, Mr. Roderick Hills, Associate Counsel

to the President, came to my office and advised that he is preparing

to discuss with Bill Miller, Staff Director of the Senate Committee,

several questions concerning the procedures that will be followed by

the Senate Select Committee in asking for testimony and documents from

the Executive Branch. He said the Committee plans to publish rules

concerning their procedures today or tomorrow and therefore his

discussions must be conducted with them promptly.

Mr. Hills said that it is proposed that the Executive Branch

agencies provide counsel to represent them before the Senate Committee

when Government employees or former employees are called to testify.

He said that CIA has agreed to start that procedure and he inquired

if the FBI would agree to have counsel present during irt erviews or

testimony of witnesses from the FBI. He said the White House is con-

cerned that if the suggestion is made by a representative of the White

House it could appear that the White House is attempting to interfere with

the Committee proceedings by intimidating witnesses and having a repeat

experience similar to that which occurred when former Counsel to the

President John Dean insisted upon sitting in with employees during inter-

views with the FBI.

I told Mr. Hills that I saw an important difference between

the efforts made by the former Counsel to the President and the effort

that would be made by counsel appearing before the Senate Committee.

The distinction is that in the former case the effort was intended to

intimidate witnesses in oreg

to conceal criminal activity and in the present

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

case the effort would be made to protect legitimate, but sensitive

operations which are currently in being. I suggested to Mr. Hills

that the Executive has the right to negotiate with the Senate Committee

an arrangement whereby a representative of the executive agency

would be present not to stifle testimony, but to suggest that testimony

be given in Executive Session or be limited only to the Senators them-

selves in order to protect information of such sensitive nature as to

require special treatment. I told Mr. Hills that it may well be that

the representative of the agency appearing with a witness should be an

individual with specific expertise in the subject matter involved in the

testimony rather than a legal counsel. Mr. Hills agreed that such

expertise would be essential. Therefore, I advised him that we would

support efforts to have counsel present during the interview or testimony

of FBI employees or former employees.

Mr. Hills' second point was executive privilege. He said

that he has researched the available references to executive privilege

at the White House and found that all relate to material prepared as

defensive measures and there is little in the way of positive statements

of principles of law concerning executive privilege. It is the feeling of

the President's Counsel, Mr. Buchen, that the White House must develop

a statement of principles to be applied by the President when it becomes

necessary to claim executive privilege in the face of a demand for

Itestimony or documents by the Senate Committee which the President

decides should not be complied with. Mr Hills said that the President's

counsel believes that it would be an improper course for the President

to wait until a crisis arises before this matter is reviewed. I told

Mr. Hills that I thought it would be more destructive to the presidency

if the President were to claim executive privilege over a matter which

could not be justified under law. Mr. Hills said that was the exact

concernof Mr. Buchen and that they wanted to avoid at all cost having

the President claim executive privilege over matters that would merely

embarrass an agency and didnt go to the heart of the agency's

responsibilities or to the independence of the presidency itself.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

SECRET

Mr. Hills said that he has been discussing with the publisher

of the "Washington Post," the publisher of the "New York Times,"

Daniel schorr, and others in the news media the question of why the

pre recent past, andritice am the laim a executies esion that

their concern is that the claim has been misused. He said his eftorts

were to convince the members of the press that a responsible claim of

executive privilege should be recognized by the press and given reasonable

support.

Mr. Hills said that in an effort to develop some general

principles by which the President could clearly indicate that any claim

of executive privilege that might become necessary is reasonable, they

wilf/rranging for conferences with the Attorney General, responsible

law professors who are experts in the area of executive privilege, and

others who might be able to help Mr. Buchen prepare a paper for the

President stating the general guidelines under which the President will

claim executive privilege. In order to understand the areas of concern

to the various agencies that might result in a request for the President to

claim executive privilege, Mr. Hills said that the President's counsel

has requested that the agencies furnish them a summary of such critical

areas. He said that he had been advised by Larry Silberman that he should

approach the Bureau carefully because it would be most difficult to obtain

such information from the FBI. Mr. Hills said that he did not fully under-

stand the relationship of the Director with the Attorney General and the

Deputy Attorney General but that he wanted to request that the Bureau

consider briefing the President's Counsel.

I told Mr. Hills that the Bureau had no difficulty with the

Attorney General or the Deputy Attorney General when it was necessary to

brief them concerning sensitive matters but that we operated as much as

possible on the "need-to-know" principle_ and that should we receive

requests from any source outside the FBl we would be reluctant to

furnish sensitive information unless there were in fact reasons for

the inquirer to have a need to know. I told him that in regard to the

request from the President's Counsel, I was confident that the Bureau

would be willing to provide representatives and a briefing on sensitive

matters that could become subject to a claim of executive privilege

Re: Senate Select Committee, etc.

because there would be an important need to know on the part of the

President's Counsel in developing his guidelines for the President to

use in considering requests for executive privilege.

I asked Mr. Hills how urgent his request was and he replied

that on Tuesday, April 1, 1975, he is scheduled to have a formal conference

with Bill Miller

and Frederick Schwartz, Counsel for the Senate Select

Committee, and he expects that meeting to concern the problem of Executive

privilege. Therefore, they would like to have the briefing as soon as

possible in order for the study concerning executive privilege to be under

way on the weekend of March 29-30, 1975. I told Mr. Hills that we would

recontact him as soon as possible to advise as to the arrangements that

could be made for such a briefing.

I advised Mr. Adams of the request from the White House

Counsel and he agreed that the Bureau should arrange to provide a

briefing to the White House Counsel.

I called Mr. Wannall and advised

him of the request and of Mr. Adams' suggestion that he and Mr. Wannall

represent the Bureau in the briefing and that the briefing could be held on

Friday, March 28, 1975. Mr. Wannall was requested to prepare a

summary memorandum for use by himself and Mr. Adams describing the

areas of concern which the Bureau might anticipate would require a

request of the President to exercise a claim of executive privilege.

Mr. Wannall agreed to do so at once.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. That depending upon the circumstances and on a case-by-

case basis the Bureau designate a representative to appear with any FBI

employee or former employee called for interview or testimony by the

Senate Select Committee.

On 3/28/75 Mr. Wannall and I met with Mr. Buchen and Mr. Hills

at the White House. The purpose of the meeting was to review the role of

The White House in coordinating the responses of the various intelligence

agencies to the Senate Committee to insure that there was uniformity in

complying with Committee requests in that any restrictions on the furnishing

of information were uniform.

It was determined that there is a unanimity of opinion that access

to raw files would not be granted Committee members or staff as a matter

of practice, although it is not inconceivable that some particular horrendous

event might arise which is of such significance that access to the files on

that matter might be granted to the Committee Chairman or a select number

of Senators.

We discussed items which we felt were particularly sensitive such

as identities of informants, sources and cooperative citizens as well as

information received from foreign sources. The sensitivity of specific

details on confidential expenditures was pointed out although we had no

objection to discussing or making available the gross figures.

JFK Act

We briefly discussed activities which had previously taken place

yet which might be subject of current interest because of newspaper publicity

and allegations. We were reminded on more than one occasion that it was

absolutely imperative that the White House not be surprised without being

forewarned of any earthshaking incidents which might come to light. In this

context, we mentioned the Anagram program, the various mail and pouch

(5)

intercepts, the Karot and related cases, surreptitious entries in connection

with CP, Klan and such investigations.

Mr. Hills again asked if there were any other items which we

felt should be brought up which might be sensitive because of the embarrassing

nature of them and we pointed out that we felt we had covered the more

significant items although there were of course various allegations from time

to time which have been addressed, such as the Anna Chanault surveillance

and other allegations raised by former Assistant to the Director Sullivan.

He suggested that if after reflection we think of any other matters which should

be mentioned to have no hesitancy in bringing it to their attention.

Finally, we discussed the first request from Senator Church dated

March 19, 1915, for information on legal authority, jurisdictional agreements,

organization, policies and procedures, and studies and reports. We were

pretty much in agreement on how to handle that request and Mr. Wannall will

submit a separate memorandum in that regard.

During the period of these investigations it was

determined that Enbassy of Israel officials recruited

U. S.

scientists for employment in Israel, and extensive liaison was

established with individuals within U. S. scientific, political,

academic and industrial communities.

During this period it was also determined that the

IIS was attempting to penetrate the United Nations (UN)

Arab diplomatic establishments in New Yorl City. An informant

of the New York Office, who previously engaged in intelligence

activities in the Middle East for the Israelis between 1955 and

1960 while working at the UN, was recontacted by Israeli intel-

ligence in August, 1968, while visiting Israel.

This informant

had access at the UN to extremely sensitive information from the

office of the Secretary General.

Israeli intelligence had

directed him to obtain and furnish, through a mail drop in

Belgium, interoffice communications between the Secretary General

of the

UN and his undersecretaries,

and information regarding

the Middle East, particularly relating to Arab matters. (5)

In lay, 1958, another informant of the New York Office,

who previously resided

in the Middle East and was active in the

Egyptian intelligence service, addressed a personal letter to

General Dayan of Israel in which he expressed his opinion the

Israelis should force the Egyptians to surrender and sign a peace

treaty. Informant was subsequently contacted in New York City by

an Israeli intelligence agent who furnished his name as "Michael"

who showed informant a copy of his letter to Dayan.

On 6/26/75 James J. Angleton, former Chief,

Counterintelligence Operations, Central Intelligence Agency,

telephonically furnished the following information to

SA ho I. Schwarti.

: 133

702215

Angleton recently testified

under oath before three

Senators and Staff Members of the Senate Select Committee (SSC) •

He appeared without counsel. During his testimony, Angleton

was asked numernus questions concerning his knowledge of

Israeli capabilities to conduct intelligence collection in the

United States.

Among the questions asked Angleton vere questions

bearing on Israell efforts to gather nuclear information in

the United States. Angleton indicated that the SSC apparently

Is avare of Angleton's past close relationship with the Israelis,

and Angleton feels that the questions directed to him by the

SSC may be related to information provided to the Committee by

correspondent Tad Szule who, according to Angleton, is writing

an article concerning Angleton's relationship with

the Israelis

for Penthouse Magazine.

Angleton understands that Szulc has

either testified or has been intezviered by the SSC.

Angleton stated that he avoided any direct answers

on the above questions by stating that any knowledge he might

have would be secondhand and fragmentary. He advised the SSC

thet such questions night more properly be directed to che FBI.

When asked who in the Bureau might be knowledgeable in this

Memorandum to Mr.

Re:

62-116395

area, Angleton replied that he did not know but that he believed

the current senior Bureau official concerned with operational

matters to be Deputy Associate Director James B. Adams.

In addition, Angleton advised that certain questions

he was asked dealt with alleged Soviet attempts to infiltrate

the CIA and other agencies. Again, Angleton avoided a direct

answer and indicated that the FBI would be the appropriate

agency to direct such questions to. Finally, Angleton commented

that in the event the Bureau thought it desirable he would be

happy to personally brief the Director or other appropriate

Bureau official concerning his- testimony. He commented that

he has not been asked to, nor has he offered to, brief William

Colby, Director of Central Intelligence, concerning his testimony.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. We are checking for any available information

in files concerning Israeli intelligence collection capabilities

in the United States. Results will be summarized in separate

memorandum. (S)

2. It is not believed appropriate to raquest

Angleton to brief the Director or other Bureau official

concerning his testimony: particularly since Angleton has

not seen fit to brief his former superiors at CIA. A request

by the Bureau for a briefing by Angleton might be misconstrued

if it were to come to the attention of Colby or other CIA

officials.

In a letter dated 5/14/7s directed to the si, senato

from both the Department and the FBI. Appendix C III, page four,

to internal security, intelligence collection and/or counterintelli

Question 23 requested all memoranda, files, or

statements was furnished AG Levi. Following receipt of these,

the AG, accompanied by the then Associate Deputy AG James

Wilderotter, visited the Bureau and personally reviewed a

number of files from which the summary statements were. developed.

It was based on this review that the AG made his statement before

the House Judiciary Committee on 2/27/75.

In order to comply with the requests from the SSC dated

5/14/75 relating to the O & C files, it is suggested we permit

Senator Church and Senator John Tower, Minority Chairman of the

SSC, be allowed to review the 164 summary statements prepared

by the Inspection Division without any deletions or. excisions.

We believe this effort would demonstrate a willingness on the

part of the Bureau to be forthcoming and would allow the Committee

in the persons of Church and Tower to satisfy themselves that

the AG's statement of 2/27/75 correctly represented the contents

of the 0 & C files.

If after this review Senators Church and

Tower feel they would personally like to review a file or files

from which the summary statements were prepared, we would be in

a position to excise from the file or files any information which

might reveal highly sensitive investigative techniques or the

identities of sources, either of which could jeopardize FBI ongoing

investigations.

. It is recognized, of course, that the manner in which

we respond to the SSC in this or any other requests is a decision

that the AG must make.

ACTION:

That Deputy Associate Director Adams personally discuss

this matter with the AG as to how the AG desires the Bureau

respond to the 5/14/75 request regarding the contents of the

0 & C files.

John Baborian et al.

Rhode Islans - Maine

As you knows

the decision of the Supreme Court on March 10,

1969, in Willie Israel Alderman, et al. V. United States expanded

the concept of standing with respect to electronic surveillance and

held that an individual has standing not only with respect to his own

overheard conversations but also with respect to overhearings on

premises in which he has a proprietary interest, even though he was

not present at the time of the conversations.

Because of this decision,

it will be necessary in future requests for electronic surveillance

information to ascertain whether or not there was coverage on premises

in which the subject had a proprietary interest. Accordingly, it is

requested that you advise as to each of the individuals on the

attached

(a) Whether the named individual appears to be present at,

or a participant in, conversations overheard in any electronic surveillance

by your agencya

(b) Whether an electronic surveillance was conducted on any

premises of which the named individual was the oner, lessee or licensee.

(c) Ií the individual or the premises of which the individual

WaS

owner, lessee or licensee was the subject of an electronic surveillance,

did the surveillance consist of wiretapping or an electronic eavesdropping

device.

(a) In the latter, please advise us of the method of entrat

utilized in the placement of the device

Was the iniormation from any such device disseminated in

any manner to any other agenor. If so, when and to dory

SUBJECT:

XElectronic Devices

NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION

Unauthorized Disclosure

Subject to

Criminal Sanctions

In recent months the Department has been, confronted with serious

problems concerning the prospective or continued prosecution of individuals

who have been the subject of prior electronic surveillance.

These problems

have sometimes arisen comparatively late in the investigative or prosecutive:

process. For example, we recently were forced to close an important

investigation involving major gambling figures in Miami because we were

advised that the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted. In

els cases the problem arose after indictment (United States v. Davis,

Bufile 49-16547; United States v. John Drew) or in the appellate stage after

trial (United States v. Black; United states v. Kolod).

This ent

In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable

that the Department have full knowledge of the extent of any device probler

at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to

determine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what

responses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to

produce statements.

Accordingly, I feel it is imperative for us to establish between

the Bureau and the Department (and perhaps United States Attorneys in

cases of direct referral) some sort of "early warning" system.

This may

require the Bureau to set up and maintain appropriate dices with respeci

to electronic surveillance and the materials derived therefrom

I have discussed this suggestion with the Attörney General and tne

Deputy Attorney General, Both feel that the establishment of such indiões

is necessary. They have suggested that I discuss the details of their

establishment with representatives of the Bureau. I should therefore®

appreciate your designating

an individual, for this purpose at your earliest

convenience.

contained on the cards.

INT'D feels the transmission of this list in open Eureau

mail could compromise security of certain sensitive investigations

and that the above procedure should be amended to prevent the

listing of those persons surveilled and those persons overheard in

an open communication.

INTD recommends that as a security measure, current

instructions be amended and that the inventory of the names of

persons overneard or subjected to electronic surveillance be

included in the enclosure with the index cards and the cards and

(A) INDEX SYSTEMS -- In an important case with great public

interest, an individual was not identified because of the failure of

an office to properly index a nickname.

Recent court decisions have resulted in the public

disclosure of electronic surveillance logs and related material

which heretofore were confidential. The information in these

surveillance matters is being afforded close scrutiny by the news

media, the general public, Federal, state, and local officials:

therefore, the importance uf pioper indexing has hecome

increasingly significant.

Each Special Agent in Charge will be held strictly

responsible for insuring that all names, nicknames, and aliases

appearing in electronic surveillance logs and related material

' are properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set forth

in Part II, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and Regulations.

Re: Electronic Surveillnnce

This systen will enable each office to deterine

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals; as in the past,

and the blue card rill be easily recognizable as coverage under

a court approved electronic survaillance.

These cards are to

be subaitted to the attention of the Special Investigative Division,

Criminal Intelligence and Organized Crime Section, each Friday

in line with existing instructions.

You will note that, as to each individual on rhom &

card is prepared, the card must indicate whether or not the

individual was the subject of direct coverage, a participant in

..convorsation or meationed by others who were monitored.

Only

one of the last three items on the index cards should be utilized.

The Bureau

regultes only one card in the special indices

for an individual monitored or mentioned in conversation covered •

by an installation. Il the individual was nonitored or mentioned

in conversation by more than one installation, a separate card

must be submitrod on each indiviquai tot each

installation.

In the event an index card is forwarded, disclosing •

an individual was mentioned in & conversation covered by an

electronic device and subsequently the individual is monitored

by the same device, an appropriate indox card revealing this

coverage must be forwarded. It is not necessary to list all

dates on which he was montlored by a particular source; only the

•firet date:

Each source will be identified as to judicial district

where the court order was approved followed by a number starting

with number 1 for the first order, and each subsequent order

receiving one number larger.

In addition, the abbreviation for

the office which obtained the court order should be utilized to

identify the source (for example: AL NDNY 1).

You are reminded of the necessity to handle these sources

on a strictly nood-to-know basis in order to afford maxinum

security to this typa of surveillance.

Insure that appropriate

aduinistrative procedures are established for such handling.

Keep In mind that all electronic surveillance logs

must be properly indexed in accordance with the instructions set

forth in Part II, Section 3, page 4, of the Manual of Rules and

Rogulations.

As you know, the decision of the Supr 'ne Court on March 10,

1969, in Willia Israel Alderra, et al. V. United States expanded

the concept of standing with respect to electronic surveillance and

held that an individual has standing not only with respect to his own

overheard conversations but also with respect to overhearings on

premises in which he has a proprietary interast, even though he t's

not present at the time of the conversations.

Because of this decision,

it will be necessary in luture riquests for electronic surveillance

information to ascertain whether or not there was coverage on premises

in which the subject ad a propriciary interest. Accordingly, it is

requested that you advise as to each of the individuals on the attached

list:

-

(a). Whether the named individual appears to be present at,

As you are aware, Department is submitting by letter to

Bureau names of individuals presently being prosecuted or being

considered for prosecution in all types of cases with request they

be advised if any of these individuals have been involved in any

electronic surveillances. Indications are that there will be

thousands of such requests received. These names are checked

through special indices maintained in Special Investigative Division

(SID) and Domestic Intelligence Division (DID), and Department is

advised by letter of results.

SID is co-ordinating program, but

some correspondence will be prepared by DID and General Investigativel?

Division if substantive cases supervised by them involved. If any

record is located, Field Office where surveillance occurred is

requested to furnish pertinent logs which are subsequently trans-

mitted to Department.

With representatives of SID; where majority of correspond-

ence will be handled, we have worked out mechanics of processing

•and filing record material. Purpose of this memorandum is to set

forth these details.

A control file has

been opened entitled, "Department of

Justice Requests for Electronic Surveillance Checks" (62-318).

All

requests from Department will be filed in this file. Outgoing

answers to Department will also be filed in this file unless subject

of communication is subject of a Bureau investigation in which case

As set forth above, if subject of communication is subject

We will not index names of individuals on which no record is located

similar to procedure followed in handling Bureau's name check program.

Communications relating to these negative checks will be filed in

control file.

In order to appropriately cover necessary files, uniformity

of caption of communications is most desirable. On outgoing commu-

nications to Field and Department, "Electronic Surveillance Check"

should be in caption to facilitate classifying material. If Bureau

case is involved, subject of case should also be part of caption

with sufficient copies to cover both case file and control file.

When Bureau has record on name check, Field is requested

to send in logs and copies are hand-delivered to Department.

Departmental official receiving logs is required to sign receipt

which should be attached to related outgoing yellow for filing

purposes by Supervisor preparing outgoing communication. Supervisor

should prepare sufficient copies of receipt appropriately designated

that tainted evidence has inadvertently been used by

us in the prosecution of criminal tax cases, or exists

tion. Under the assumption that if this exists at all,

Organized Crime and Racketeering cases are the most

likely source, the attached list relates to criminal

cases pending in the Tax Division which appear to be

Organized Crime Drive matters. Some of these matters

are currently under consideration as to whether prosecu

tion should be undertaken; some have been referred to

the United States Attorneys for prosecutive action; some

are the subjects of indictments, and a few are pending

on appeal.

It is requested that the names on the attached list

be checked against the indices which you have set up in

relation to electronic listening devices and you advise

this office as soon as possible whether any name on this

¡list appears on your indices.

We wish to know:

EMDR6

SUBJECT, SPECIAL/ INDICES OF ELECTRONIC

SURVEILLANCES

-SP-2 ALm/7TG

PURPOSE:

The Special Investigative Division and the Domestic

Intelligence Division are maintaining separate special indices of

individuals monitored or mentioned through microphone or telephone

surveillances.

Those of the Special Investigative Division contain

names obtained through coverage of criminal matters.

Those of the

Domestic Intelligence Division contain names obtained through

coverage of internal security matters. The purpose of this memo-

randum is to recommend that these two special indices be consolidate:

and operated by the fiies anú Communicaiivis Divisiou.

BACKGROUND:

In accordance with the Director's instructions, special

indices were established in October, 1966, because of the

Department's insistence that the Bureau provide a rapid determin-

ation as to whether any given person subject to prosecution was

overheard, present, or referred to in the course of a conversation

covered by electronic devices.

Based on available information at

.. that time from the Department

that there would be selective cases

to be reviewed, it was determined to be most logical that two

separate indices be established, one to cover criminal matters

and

the other security matters..

Subsequently, the Solicitor General

publicly disclosed that an extensive review would be made on past

and pending cases to determine if evidence had been used from

electronic devices and the Department requests that all names

be

searched through both the criminal and security files.

This

completely changed all aspects of the operation of these indices

and the amount of work involved, particularly when the Department

began submitting not. only names of persons subject to prosecution

but names of attorneys involved and associates. af the bjects.

CURRENT STATUS:

There are approximately 60,000 cards of the special

indices

in the Special Investigative Division and approximately

Memorandam to Mr. C. D. DeLoach

RE: • SPECIAL INDICES OF ELECTRONIC SURVEILLANCES

66-5815

200,000 cards of the special indices in the Domestic Intelligence

Division.

Furthermore, because of the telephone surveillances

currently in operation

in the security field, approximately 300

new cards are being received weekly in the Domestic Intelligence

Division.

CURRENT OPERATION OF SPECIAL INDICES:

Since the special indices were established in

October, 1966, the Department has submitted approximately 1,000

names for searching. Each name is searched through both of these

special indices.

There is attached a sample of the form being

used requesting searches and a copy of three cards from the

special indices.

The Department has indicated

that in the immediate

future it contemplates

asking the Bureau to check as many as

25,000 names through ine special indices.

milvut a doubt, all

future cases involving prosecution will require search of

these

indices.

OBSERVATIONS:

The position adopted by the Department in these matters

makes it impossible for us to maintain these indices separately

'as originally established.

The checking of these indices would

have imposed no great burden on either the Domestic Intelligence

: Division or the Special Investigative Division had the Department

followed a logical and reasonable course in the submission of

names of persons to be checked in connection with a particular

criminal or security prosecution.

But as matters now stand,

these separate indices should be consolidated to avoid duplication

of effort in checking the same names through each as we now must

do to comply with the Department's requests. Both Divisions are

in agreement on this point.

Consolidation of the indices into one raises the

question of where it should be maintained. We believe the

consolidated

indices should be maintained by the Files and

Communications Division.

There is no reason for it to be main-

tained either by the Domestic Intelligence Division or the Special

Investigative Division.

The maintenance of this indices and the search functions

involved fall logically within the normal operations and

responsibilities of the Files and Communications Division and

can be carried out in the most efficient manner by that. Division.

RE:

RECONNENDATION:

It is recommended that the special indices under

discussion of the Domestic Intelligence Division and the

Special Investigative Division be turned over to the Files

and Conmunications Division and be maintained and searched

by that Division.

ADDENDUM: W.S. TAVEL FILES & COMMUNICATIONS DIVISION 1-16-67

I am opposed to the maintenance of this index being shifted to the Files

and Communications Division. It would not save personnel, since this division

is expending every effort to keep up with the greatly increased volume of other

types of name checks and could not absorb an additional 25, 000 or more with

existing personnel.

This index has no relation to the Bureau's master index.

ADDENDUM: Continued

data. For this reason, each check where possible identity is established

necessitates correspondence with the field, which must be handled by the

substantive supervisor. Since the cards disclose names of all persons

mentioned in technical surveillance logs, it would appear essential to limit

the number of employees having access, to keep to a minimum those who

might be subpoenaed to testify concerning these matters. We do not have

room or personnel in our special file room to operate such an index, and

since this room is in the Identification Building, moving it there would only

serve to further remove it from the supervisors handling it, who now have

immediate access. It is similar to other specialized indices now maintained

by substantive divisions, such as the Fugitive Index, Security Index, index of

library cards on communist material, etc., which serve a specific purpose

and arc most efficiently operated by the divisions using them.

..Acting Attorney Gene

The instructions issued to the United States Attorneys by the

l are as follows:

"You will recall that in May 1966 the Department advised the

Supreme Court of facts relating to the case of Black v. United States,

October Term, 1965, No. 1029. Its memorandum in that case stated

in pertinent part:

'Notwithstanding the Department of Justice's conclusion

that the monitoring of conversations between petitioner and

his attorney had no effect upon his conviction or the fairness

of his trial; we have no doubt that in the circumstances

outlined above petitioner is entitled to a judicial determination.

We also recognize that petitioner has standing to raise, in a

district court, the question whether other conversations fi. e.,

conversations not involving an attorney-client relationship)

which were overheard as a result of the listening device

installed in his suite furnished any leads or evidence

in his case. At an appropriate fearing, the government

proposes to submit all of the facts upon which a full

judicial determination can be made.

"This Department must never proceed with any investigation or

case which includes eviaence illegally obtained or the fruits of that

evidence. No investigation or case of that character shall go forward

until such evidence and all of its fruits have been purged and we are in

a position to assure ourselves and the court that there is no taint or

unfairness. We must, also, scrupulously avoid any situation in which

an intrusion into a confidential relationship would deny a fair hearing

to a defendant or person under investigation.

"For this reason we are in the process of requesting each

investigative agency concerned to review its files in order to determine

whether there has been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching

a particular case or matter. We are making a similar review of cases

and matters pending in the Department. You will be informed im-

mediately whenever a case or matter in your office is found to fall

in this category.

"Many matters are referred directly to your offices by the

investigating agencies. Special attention must be given to these. But,

it is imperative that you and your assistants make every effort to

ascertain whether any cases, now pending or hereafter received, present

the problem of wiretapping or electronic surveillance. No single means

of checking is infallible but you should keep in mind that the same

person or matter may have been investigated by several Federal or

State agencies and the information supplied to you may in fact come

from more than one source. You should be particularly attentive

to those cases which involve, directly or indirectly, hard core elements

of organized crime.

IW 55016 DocId:32989601

## Page 104

"It is, of course, the very rare case--one out of thousands--

in which you will encounter the problem to which this memorandum is

addressed. The problem will arise in cases in which some investigation

was conducted prior to July, 1965. Present practice, adopted in July

1965 in confirmity with the policies declared by President Johnson on

June 30, 1965.for the entire Federal establishment, prohibits the

installation of listening devices in private areas (as well as the

interception of telephone and other wire communications) in all

instances other than those involving the collection of intelligence

affecting the national security. The specific authorization of the

Attorney General must be obiained in each instance when this

exception is invoked. Intelligence data so collected will not be

available for investigative or litigative purposes.

"If you have any reason whatever to believe that there has

been wiretapping or electronic surveillance touching a particular case,

you should immediately notify Mr. J. Walter Yeagley, Assistant

Attorney General, Internal Security Division, so that further inquiry

may be pursued by the Department. "

immediately notify Mr. J. Waller Yeagley, Assistant Attorney General,

Internal Security Division.

With reference to this subject matter the Bureau is currently

handling numerous requests from the Department to check the names of

various subjects against the special indices set up at the Bureau on all

persons who have been subject of any FBI electronic surveillance. It

is expected that any cases questioned by the United States Attorneys

and referred to Mr. Yeagley will be given the same examination on the

request of the Department.

Although instructions to the United States Attorneys by the

Acting Attorney General do not specifically require contact with the

various investigative agencies at the field level, it is quite likely that

some of our field offices will receive inquiries from the United States

Attorneys. In case such inquiries are received by field offices requesting

that information obtained from electronic surveillances be furnished, the

Bureau should be immediately advised of the request and all'pertinent

details. No response should be made to the United States Attorneys in

such instances without prior Bureau authorization. This procedure is

nécessary in view of the possibility that the subject of a case may have

been in some way covered by an electronic surveillance in a field office

not, participating in investigation of the prosecutive case in question.

-SUBJECT: MICROPHONE AND TELEPHONE SURVEILLANCES

310/24/00

In connection with problems arising out of past

electronic surveillance coverage of individuals now under

prosecution, or against whom prosecution is being contem-

plated, the Department, as you know, made a general request

that we establish an

"early warning system" in the form of

system" Soneral ontem-

an index or other administrative device to enable a check

to be made to determine if we have so monitored the voices

of such individuals.

The Department was advised that we

had such

a system in operation.

In line with the Department's requirements, this

index, which is now in operation, is made up of names oi

individuals whose voices were monitored by microphone

surveillances, technical

surveillances, or other similar

(electronic listening devices since. January, 1960.

As you know, the Department has recently forwarded

a list of 151 names of individuals currently of prosecutive

interest in the Tax Division, with a request that these names

be checked through our index

to determine if they were the

subjects of direct electronic surveillance coverage; whether

an individual in question appears on any records, logs, notes,

memoranda, et cetera, either as a participant in

conversations

¿'overheard, er as s person mentioned or discussed.

This new and belated category introduced by the Tax

Division will require additional work on the part of the field

It should be noted that the

Criminal Division has never required any information concerning

the names of persons mentioned in microphone logs and has always

satisfied themselves with information concerning those whose con

be an additional example of the Tax Division going far beyond

what is required by the courts or even by another division of

the Department.. Nevertheless, in order to answer any inquiries

along this line with the dispatch desired, it will be necessary

to include in our index the names of persons mentioned in

microphone logs.

Attached is a communication to the field divisions

on thy na

involved alerting those offices to this additional requirement

on the pact of the Tax Division and instructing those offices

to prepare index cards on individuals who are mentioned in

monitored conversations.

The field is being instructed to use a certain

amount

of common sense in recording names in this category inasmuch as

there are literally thousands of instances in which a subject

covered engages in completely inconsequential conversations in

which he may mention the name of a

third party. Examples of

this would be instructions to a maid or servant to get in

touch with a particular merchant or serviceman to handle menial

errands such as handling dry cleaning, gotting a car washed and

like situations.

a name is mentioned in this way, no

purpose is served by including it in this index. We are, of

course, following the Director's instructions in connection

with furnishing everything of possible pertinence to the

Department and allowing Department personnel, not FBI personnel,

determine if it is relevant.

ACTION:

Attached for your approval is an airtel to offices

involved in the compilation of this index, instructing that

cards also be prepared on all individuals who are mentioned

or discussed in monitored conversations,

except those in the

completely inconsequential category cited above, in addition

to names of individuals already being included as those whose

voices have been monitored.

10124100-

In accordance with the Director's instructions,

there is attached a teletype to all field offices which have.

had microphone and telephone surveillances at any time since

January, 1960.

The teletype instructs. that by 10/31/66, each office

is to transmit to the Bureau names of all individuals whose

voices have been monitored through a microphone installation

or through a telephone surveillance operated by the office

at any time since 1/1/60.

These include all types of

• electronic devices such as those carried on a person or in a

cax.: The review is not to be limited to subjects of instant

surveillance but is to include any and all individuals whose

conversations, however slight, were monitored.

In order to make certain that every individual's

name is submitted to the Bureau, field offices are being

instructed to review all microphone and telephone surveillance

logs and records. Thereafter, a 3 by 5 card must be prepared

on

each person whose voice was monitored.

The cards will show

the name of the individual monitored, the initial date of

monitoring, and the identity of the subject on whom the

installation was placed, plus identity of the office.

If a voice was monitored through a particular

installation on more than one occasion, only one card need

be submitted; however, if the voice was monitored through

more than one installation, a separate card must be submitted

identifying each installation. Those pertaining to criminal

investigations will be sent to the attention of Assistant

Director j. H. Gale and all others to me.

Each office is to advise the Bureau by airtel every

BO0OBY SPEALMLETE

This is in reference to your memorandum of September 28

to the Attorney General concerning information developed through

• I electronic surveillance devices. I am pleased to learn that the

Bureau maintains indices on such information which will be avail-

able to Department attorneys. However, to make effective use of

such records, I believe we should know how any such index is

constituted. Specifically, it would be helpful to know whether or

not there is a central index which will permit a rapid determina-

tion as to whether any given person was overheard, present, or

¡ referred to in the course of a convorsation.

I assume that in all cases investigated by the Bureau you

will advise the appropriate Division of the Department as early

as possible concerning information derived from an electronic

surveillance bearing on the case or any person involved in that

case. We would, of course, propose to set up machinery to

advise the Bureau promptly of our interest in any case which is'3

being investigated by another agency.

n+0-1947-1207

• We look forward to a discussion of the general problem?

with Mr. DeLoach, but feel that such a discussion will be mora

fruitful after we understand the nature and extent of your index,

system and can evaluate its impact on our operations

Thank you for your cooperation.

FROM

Fred M. Vinson, JI.

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

SUBJECT:

XElectronic Devices

NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION

Unauthorized Disclosure

Subject to Criminal Sanctions

In recent months the Department has been confronted with serious

problems concerning the prospective or continued prosecution of individuals

who have been the subject of prior electronic surveillance.

These problems

have sometimes arisen comparatively late in the investigative or prosecutive

process. For example, we recently were forced to close an important

investigation involving major gambling figures in Miami because we were

advicei that the evidence necessary to obtain a conviction was tainted: In !

• Other cases the problem arose after indictment (United States v. Davis,

United States v. John Drew) or in the appellate stage after

trial ( Jrited States V. Black; United States v. Kolod).

In view of these experiences, it appears necessary and desirable

that the Department have full knowledge of the extent of any device proble

at as early a stage of preparation for prosecution as possible in order to

determine whether a particular case may or may not be tainted or what

responses will be necessary with respect to a motion under Rule 16 to

produce statements.

Accordingly, I feel it is imperative for us to establish between

the Bureau and the Department (and perhaps United States Attorneys in

cases of direct referral) some sort of "early warning" system. This may

require the Bureau to set up and maintain appropriate indices with respect

to electronic surveillance and the materials derived therefrom

I have discussed this suggestion with the Attörney General and tne

Deputy Attorney General. Both feel that the establishment of such indices

is necessary. They have suggested that I discuss the details of their

establishment with representatives of the Bureau. I should therefore

appreciate your designating an individual for this purpose at your earliest

convenience.

The discussion centered

about the means by which NSA could be most helpful to the FBI in

processing some 20,000 messages received each month in NSA coverage

of Cuban matters.

The messages relate to commercial and personal

cummunications between persons in Cuba and in the United States. (5)

most desirous of furnishing to the FBI material which would be most

helpful to our operations. After considerable discussion, it was

decided that, of the raw traffic now available, the material which

woula be most helpful to us would consist of periodic listing of

and the Cuban, Government.
