to monitoring bank accounts of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. and

It has not been-

done to date because security would be lacking under the

circumstances.

The only Atlanta accounts of KING and

0f Southern Christian Leadership Conference are located

at the Citizens Trust Company, a Negro owned and operated,

bank in a Negro section of Atlanta about three blocks from

the Headquarters Office of Southern Christian Leadership

Conference.

The owner of the bank, I. D. MITION,

and has a good reputation in the community.

He has been

contacted in other matters by the Atlanta Office over the

past number of years but he is also a long time acquaintance

of the KING family.

It is believed that other sources can determine

whether BAYARD RUSTIN is actually working for Southern

Christian Leadership Conference. At the present time it

appears that he is not on their payroll based on information

from confidential sources both in Atlanta and in New York.

Therefore, Atlanta will make no recommendations at this time

for the monitoring of the account of KING or Southern

It appears that RUSTIN is no longer

rather than to work for any specific organization.

He went

so far as to state to CLEVELAND ROBINSON that he was not

interested in working for the SCLC or for anyone.

It was also reported that RUSTIN had encountered

opposition to his becoming the Northern Director of the SCLC.

CLEVELAND ROBINSON reportedly stated that he would not

On March 11, 1964, a confidential source, who

has furnished reliable information in the past, furnished

Information which indicated that Stanley Levison contacted

Clarence Jones on that date. Levison stated that he had

spoken to Martin (Martin Luther King) in regard to Bayard

(Rustin), and he mentioned that a conclusion had been

reached.

Jones asked Levison if King had told him about

Wyatt (Walker, who is Executive Director of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLO) ), and Levison

indicated that he and King had discussed

this at great

length.

In regard to this, Jones mentioned that Walker

had informed him that he (Walker) is going to be Director

of the New York Office (of the SCuC).

Jones also mentioned

chat Walker is concerned that he could not be director

*i Rustin is to be the Northern Coordinator (of the SCLO).

According to Jones, Walker claimed that this is the reason

that the decision to hire Rustin is to be vetoed.

Levison

also stated that he agreed with King that it is not wise

to take rustin on now with a filibuster (on the Civil Rights

Bill in the Senate, apparently in the offingl, but he said

there is no question that he should be hired

after the

filibuster. Levison said that he made the point with King

that rustin should be paid at once, inasmuch as it would

not be right to have him committed

to the job and expect

him to fend for himself for a period of perhaps two months.

He stated that King agreed with his position.

Levison said

that he made this point, not only because he

felt that it

was proper, but also because he

"wanted it pinned down."

Levison stated that he "violently objected to the

Wyatt thing"

(Walker's opposition to Rustin), but he mentzonec

that he could see that Rustin and Waller would be unable to

get along. Levison remarked that King 1s noù anxious to

have walker as an enemy and does not want Walker to lzave

(the SCIC) under circumstances where he would be hostile.

According to Levison, King said that "wyatt and Bayard will

be subject to the same committee"

, and Levison stated that

he told King that under those circumstances they could

suffer along with wyatt.

Jones remarked that Walker wanted

to make it clear that Rustin would be responsible to him

(walker), and this prompted Levison to reply that was not

right that both would be responsible to "the committee,"

continuing, Levison said if walker leaves the SCLC, he

(Levison) would not nesitate to tell walker where he stands.

Levison also said that he does not agree with King on "the

hostile thing," and he added that he is afraid that walker

will stay with the SCLC to its detriment:

Levison stated that King wanted Jones and himself

to see Rustin in order to explain the delay and when he can

plan to start. Levison mentioned that he feels Rustin has

much to do in the next 60 days in the way of preparation

with which he can busy himself.

Levison advised that Rustin

should be paid Inasmuch as he will be setting up an office

and working out procedures, and he added that none of this

has to come

•to public attention.

Levison told Jones that they would have to talk

about some observations of things that exist there (in

Atlanta).

Jones indicated that he would try to arrange an

appointment to see Rustin tomorrow, and Levison replied that

would be all right with him.

MANE Of CONTRE AND

It was pointed out to Mr. ALTER

that there had

been previous publicity that some

Nassau banks have numbered

accounts. He was also advised that the Bureau has informa.

tion that one of the holders of such numbered accounts in

Nassau may be MARTIN LUTHER KING, JI.

It was pointed out.

to Mr ALTER that the Bureau is not investigating the legiti

mate activities of KING in the civil rights field but that

the Bureau's interest, rather, pertains to communist attempts

to influence the civil rights movement.

In response to inquiry, AlTER specifically

stated that he has no information that MARTIN LUTHER

KING

II, presently has, or, at any time in the past, has had

a numbered account in any Nassau, bank.

MCALLEE advisec

that he had previously been the Executive Vice President

Capital cities BankataoinVassau-Bahamas and can

positively state that while he held that position, there

were no numbered accounts at that bank.

Accordingly, he

stated it would not have been possible for KING to have

ALtER did mention that he had heard some comment

during the early part of 1965 or in 1964 on the occasion

of one of the several visits of MARTIN LUTHER KING, JI,

to the Bahamas. that KING probably was putting money in a

numbered account in a Nassau bank.

ALTER, explained,

however, that he had placed no credence in that comment

as he recalls that it was merely a wild conclusion that

had been previously drawn by someone whose identity he

does not now recall. ALtER, considered the aforementioned

comment as being without substantiation and typical of the

many such remarks that one may hear in Nassau, concerning

any well-known person who may visit the Bahamas from time

to time.

It was ALTER's opinion that if KING did have a

numbered account,

Of the legitimate banking institutions in Nassau rather

than in one of the less reputable banking institutions

where it would be risky to place large amounts of money.

Among the reputable banking institutions where it would

be logical to place a numbered account, ALTER enumerated

In view of

the statement by the Bureau in re

Bureau airtel that the Bureau has been unable to penetrate

numbered accounts in Nassal, ALTER was queried concerning

the identity of any person who would be knowledgeable

concerning numbered accounts; and the identities of the

holders of such accounts.

AlMinindicated that there would

be people who would have information in Nassau concerning

the identity of such persons, and he recommended that

in Nassau as a person who would be knowledgeable concerning

She identities of various people who have numbered accounts

in Nassau and, further, as a person who would be in a posi-

tion to acquire information from other sources concerning

remarked that FRANK/SHULz,

Mr. ALTER suggested that if the Bureau aid

any other pertinent matter, that the Bureau may desire

to advise My. SHULy that he was being contacted on the

recommendation of Mr. ALTER. Mr. ALTER is cognizant of:

international implications, but persisted in his comment

that he felt that SHull would be a good source for the

POPPER discussed several items which appeared in

a letter of KING, written while he

was in jail in Birmingham

which had not actually occurred it that time.

LEVISON stated

that KING later edited this letter and inserted the additional

material. He advised her to include it but to be very

general, for example, in the part about police dogs attacking

six unarmed Negro children, she should omit the six and put

in the rest.

They also discussed the theme of the book which has

to do with the making the Negro movement for economic progress

tie in with the president's war on poverty.

LEVISON said that

CLARENCE JONES tuld him that he, JONES, and KING discussed

this at length at the meeting in North

Carolina and they wanted

the Negro movement to advocate economic progress, not only for

the Negro, but for the poor whites in the south in order to tie

in Negro economic progress with the President's war against

poverty.

NY 40995

advised on February 1, 1964, that

MARTIN LUTHER KING was in contact with CLARENCE JONES

that date.

JONES mentioned that he had some cash which he

had been holding for KING, and he said the purpose of the

money was to pay HERMINE POPPER for editing KING's book.

JONES and KING discussed the last chapter of KING's book, and

they indicated that that chapter dealt with equating Negro

preferential treatment (in employment) with poor white people

of the south and the poor all over. KING said he thought

the whole book would have to be changed if they included

that, but JONES said he and "his friend" (STANLEY LEVISON)

had discussed that thoroughly and they felt the book would

not have to be changed.

JONES mentioned

that he was seeking

"an intellectual bridge (to be ) made between compensatory

treatment and treatment which seeks to take into consideration

those who have suffered

from the effect of slavery and racial

discrimination. "

KING stered that he thought It was excellent,.

but he said that

he did not see how he could say through the entire book

that Negroes should have preferential treatment and then in

the last chapter say this treatment should be extended to all

underpriviledged and not just the Negro. KING stated this

could be an excuse for asking for preferential treatment for

Negroes, but that they also know that there are others, other

than Negroes, who are also in the same condition or worse than

Negroes, and

that they are interested in all underpriviledged

people.

JONES mentioned that he believes if they can get their

point across effectively enough their idea might even be

picked up by the Administration."

JONES stated it would be an

historic contrivution if the Negro could come up with a

program which not only explains and takes into account

the deprivations which the Negro has suffered but also

takes into account the new objective situation of the

fact that thousands of both whites and Negroes are now

unemployed and that something must be done because poor

white poople aiso suffered from slavery.

JONES advised

that their main purpose was to link preferential treatment

with the struggle against poverty.

KING mentioned the treatment

of (President)

JOHNSON in the book, and JONES stated "his friend"

(STANLEY LEVISON) saId HERMINE (POPPER) felt that kING

should give his personal views of JOHNSON. JONES

stated that this is particularly appropriate since the

book will come

on the

"threshold of the election."

JOAN DAVES

contacted CLARENCE JONES on that date.

She mentioned

that KING had called her in regard to the book, and asked

her about giving creait to abDucKett in the book. JONES

that he thought it would be and right.

STANLEY LEVISON contacted CLARENCE JONES and LEVISON said

The Attorney General was contacted at his request this after-

noon.

he had before him our memorandum of October 7, 1963, requesting

authority for technical surveillances on Martin Luther King at his residence

at Atlanta and at the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

of which he is president, at New York City.

The Attorney General said that he recognized the importance of

this coverage if substantial information is to be developed concerning the

relationship between King and the Communist Party. He said there was no

question in his mind as to the coverage in New York City but that he was

worried about the security of an installation covering a residence in Atlanta,

Georgia. He noted that the last thing we could afford to have would be a

discovery of a wire tap on King's residence.

I pointed out to the Attorney General the fact that a residence.

was involved did not necessarily mean there was any added risk because of

the. technical nature of the telephone system. He was informed that the

Bureau had had years of experience in this field and that we continually

reviewed our procedures to insure that every measure possible to secure

such installations was taken.

It was nevertheless noted that of necessity

we had to deal with established contacts in the telephone company, to get, the

necessary leased lines, but once again we had procedures which minimized/

the risks to the nth degree.

REG- 32

5 NOV * 1963

After this discussion the Attorney General said he felt we

should go ahead with the technical coverage on King of a trial basis, and to

continue it if productive results were forthcoming. He said he was certain

that all Bureau representatives involved would recognize the delicacy of this

particular matter and would thus be even more cautious than ever in this

lassignment. He asked to be kept advised of any pertinent information

developed regarding King's communist connections.

DATE 10

The Attorney General spoke to me with reference to pur

memorandum of October 18, 1963, recommending a technical surveillance

on the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference at Atlanta, l

Georgia. It is noted that last week the Attorney General authorized

similar coverage on the residence of Martin Luther King, JI., President

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

The Attorney General is apparently still vacillating in his

position as to technical coverage on Martin Luther King and his organization,

it being recalled that he had initially suggested such coverage and then

changed his mind and felt it might be inadvisable.

The Attorney General said that he is still uncertain in his own

mind about this coverage. I reminded him of our previous conversation,

wherein he was assured that all possible would be done to insure the security

of this operation.

The Attorney General advised that he was approving the

October 18, 1963, memorandum but asked that this coverage and that on

King's residence by evaluated at the end of 30 days in light of the results

secured so that the continuance of these surveillances could be determined

at that time.

This will be done.

This morning at 10:00 a.m., I introduced Sheriff-elect Joseph I. Woods

to the Director. Sheriff Woods is a former Special Agent of the FBI and was only

recently elected to the position of Sheriff of Cook County, Ulinois. The Director

congratulated Sheriff Woods on his election and told him that he was glad that a man

of his caliber had been elected to this important law enforcement position. Sheriff Woods

assured the Director of full and complete cooperation in all matters and stated he was

looking forward to cooperating and working closely with the Chicago Office of the FBI.

The Director explained that the FBI was able to work with most police

¿ departments across the country. He outlined the difficulties we had with former Chief

i such as Lieutenant Nash who recently committed suicide. Sheriff Woods explained that

Nash had called him just two days before he died andasked him for a job. He said he

thought Nash had cancer and that is probably the reason for his suicide. The Director

explained our relations with Richard B. Ogilvie, former Sheriff of Cook County, and

Director said the FBl ought to be able to work with the top man in order that a mutual

because he felt now our SAC in Chicago could deal with him in complete frankness.

felt this organization should be run by the members and not by the Headquarters Staff.

He said the organization has been letting the Executive Director, Quinn Tamm, run

wild and he hopes thät Morris will put the damper on Tamm and stop Tamm's empire

building. Sheriff Woods told the Director he intended to appoint as his Undersheriff

a lormer-Bureau Agent, Clarence B. Carey, and that he was releasing his Chief of

Police, Art Bilek, Who he understood was going to go to work as a teacher for the

Southern Police Institute.

He said that Bilek was. a theorist and he was going to hire

a National Academy man as his Chief of Police. Sheriff Woods said he was considering

a National Academy man by the name of John Kistner,

a graduate of the 59th Session

of the National Academy (March - June, 1956), currently a Captain on the Chicago

Police Department. The Director said he was glad to hear he was considering

appointing a National Academy man as the Chief of Police because we have established

recommended a good administrative school since it is important in these days that

law enforcement is faced with so many problems that the administrator be educated

in good business techniques and management procedures as it relates to the law

enforcement profession.

The Director reviewed with Sheriff Woods his relations with Martin

INTERVIEW RED'NEWSWEEK' ARTICLE

HAGGLING

•SAC Brown of Detroit called this afternoon and reported that

he had just had a call from former SAC Fred McIntire. McIntire said that

Hugh McCann, reporter for "Newsweek" magazine, had just finished inter-

viewing him. McCann told McIntire that "Newsweek" was doing a cover

MICH

story on the Director and among other things he was asked what kind of

a person Mr. Hoover was, how did he function as an administrator and

what type of cases does the Bureau do an outstanding job in and in what

_cases does the Bureau not do an outstanding job. McCann also asked

McIntire if he had heard if George Edwards was a rumored successor

to the Director..

Former SAC McIntire said he told McCann that Mr. Hoover

was the greatest administrator he had ever known, that he ran a tight

organization and that the Bureau does an outstanding job in each and every

type of case. Mcintire said that he had an impression McCann was attempt-

ying to bait him somewhat but that basically the interview was cordial.

Mcintire also mentioned that he learned from McCann that

he was going to interview bugas, George edwards, the police commissioner

in Detroit, among others. Mcintire suggested to McCann that he might want

to talk to Harry. O'Conner regarding the Director.

The Director approved my memo of Saturday, 11/21/64, that I

confidentially advise BenyBradlee, Bureau Chief, "Newsweek"' Magazine, Washington,,

DanCe, that we could not honor his request to bring his New York writer, Dwight Martin,

in to see the Director on Monday morning, 11/23/64. Referenced memo set forth con-

siderable derogatory information concerning Martin's wife, who, according to State

Department, ONland Army, information, associated considerably with Chinese communists

and participated in running a Chinese brothel. It was recommended and approved that 1

MART US WIFE

Bradlee was advised of the above information upon his visit to FBi head-

quarters 11/23/64; he stated he would keep this strictly off-the-record and that we could

trust him implicitly in this regard:

Bill Moyers, while I was at the White House today, advised that word

had gotten to the President this afternoon that Bradlee was telling all over town that the

FBI had given him considerable information concerning the wife of a "Newsweek" writer.

Bradlee was also telling around Washington that the FBI had told him that Martin Luther

King was a sexual degenerate, Bradlee, according to Moyers, had stated to several

people that, "If the FBI will do this to Dwight Martin and Martin Luther King, they will

undoubtedly do it to anyone for personal reasons."

Moyers stated the President wanted to get this word to us so we would

know not to trust Bradlee. Moyers also stated that the President felt that Bradlee lacked

integrity and was certainly no lover of the Johnson Administration or the FBI._ I tola

Moyers this was certainly obvious.

At 6:00 p.m., 12/3/64, Bill Gray, who is a reporter of Newsweek maga-

zine, with whom we spent some time in the gathering of material for the story, telephoned

savina

and talked to Wick.. He said Newsweek is focusing in its next issue on the "King-Hoover

matter" and will also "correct some of the errors in the Hoover cover story."

He asked if we could inform him what transpired within the meeting

between the Director and King, Tuesday, December 1, 1964. He said Newsweek had

only King's side of the story.

He said this might give an imbalance and would be one-

sided. Wick told Gray that this kind of talk, coming from him, was laughable, that

Newsweek should not spoil its record for unfairness and we would be no party now or

a henceforth to their deceitfulness.

Wick told Gray we had no comment. Gray asked if I would call him and

Wick told him I was out of the city and was in travel status and didn't care to talk to him

EVELYN HAMM, Corporation Clerk, Office of the

Secretary of State, State of Alabama, Montgomery, Ala., ad~

vised on 6/15/62,

that the Southern Christian Leadership

Jonference (SCLC) is not registered in Alabama as a foreigr

(out of state) corporation, or as a domestic (Alabama) profit-

Miss HAMM advised that there is no re-

quirement that domestic (Alabama) non-profit corporations

register with the Department of State, and that such a corpora-. :

tion may register with any of the 67 Probate Judges in the

state and do business anywhere in the state.

It. WILLIE B. PAINTER, NA, Alabama Department of

Public Safety, Montgomery, advised on 6/19 and 20/62, that

his investigations of racial matters type organizations have

included investigations of the SCLC. He said that his files

pertaining to this group include brochures published by SCLC

which name the officers and officials of that group, but he

has not had occasion to receive a letterhead or other corres-

pondence of SCIC. He said that the literature he has obtained

does not include in any way the names of STANLEY DAVID LEVISON

or HUNTER PITTS O' DELI.

In view of the activity of SCLE in Alabama in the

past, and the likelihood of further such activity in the

future, New York is requested to furnish Mobile any informa-

tion which reflects that LEVISON, OiDELL, or any other CP

persons are influential in SCLC.

Mobile has not been

fur-

nished with any basis for a Cominfil investigation of SCIO,

•but if such information has been reported to N; it is be-

lieved that such an investigation should be undertaken.
