told him he could not retire "right now."

Pa., group

still receives all numbers bets of more than

$4 from the North Side area of Pittsburgh.

Informant

said he thought he could obtain a key to unlock the backroom

of Burko's Poolroom, Federal St., Pittsburgh, where MANNARINO

has had occasional meetings recently with large numbers

operators.

on 7/18/62, a PCI advised that he was compiling information

he hoped would show that VICTOR STANZIANO, New Kensington,

had committed fraud in connection with his bankruptcy of

1961-1962.

STANZIANO is a contractor who has been closely

associated: with SAMUEL MANNARINO for about one and

a half years

and is scheduled to handle the construction of a

shopping

center
