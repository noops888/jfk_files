BIN 105-21892

Interview was conducted by SAs ROBERT JAMES DWYER and

GEORGE D. DAVIS, Ih., alter intormation was received

from Chiban exile leader MANUEL ARTI'lE that FUSTE had

received a

"Zero"' extortion letter and wanted to furnish

it to FBI.

It is noted "Zero" has claimed credit for

April 12,

1974, assassination of JOSE ELIAS DE LA

TORRIENTS, Cuban exile leader, at his Coral Gables residence.

After obtaining "Zero" letter and details from

FUSTE, Agents then questioned him concerning Frente de

Liberacion Nacional de Cuba (Cuban exile terrorist organi-

zation), which claims credit for a series si recent bombings.

Investigation has reflected that a number of FLNC members

propaganda over

FUSTE orally acknowledged this

fact, but denied responsibility.

He was informed that

ILNC claims credit for acts which are in violation of

U.S.

laws, and FLNC is presently subject of a Federal

Grand Jury investigation, Miami.

On 4/24/74, MM 1337-S advised on 4/22/74, LEOPOLDO

JUSTO, General Manager, WAB, overheard conversation at

WAB between FUSTE and Miami

City Commissioner and Vice

Mayor MANOLO REEOSO, who called upon FUSTE shortly after

departure of Agents.

REBOSO reportedly told FUSTE that

next time SA DAVIS talked to FUSTE, REEOSO would telephone

his friend, Congressman DANTE FASCELL, and make complaint

against DAVIS.

MM 1337-S said that JUSTO is deeply upset about

FLNC visits to NAB and is opposed to FUSTE's policies and

associations with regard to such hostile elements.

On 4/24/74, JUSTO confirmed that FLNC members

frequent WAB and said he is willing to testify and would

have no objections to any other employees of FAB being

subpoenaed to testify before the Federal Grand

Jury

regarding FINC activities.

He then related that he

is in

pover struggle with FUSTE, who has allowed "FAB. to

be used for political purposes by FLNC and other Cuban

exile groups contrary to FCC regulations.

He related

that his opposition to FUSTE came to a head when FUSTT fired,

without any justification whatsoever, WAB news reporter

OSCAR ANGULO, several days previously, against orders of

RICHARD EATON, owner and President of United Broadcasting

Corp., Washington, D. C., who strongly supports ANGULO.

On morning 4/26/74, MM 1337-S advised that as

a result of EATON's order that OSCAR ANGULO be rehired

Immediately, FUSTE is resigning from WAB and has declared

that he will immediately hold a press conference and

announce that his resignation results from pressure applied

by the U. S. Government.

SAS DAVIS and DWYER during the separate interviews

of FUSTE and JUSTO explicitly informed each that the FBI

was not investigating WAB, and that the FBI interest in

making this inquiry related only to the "Zero" extortion

letters and the activities of the FLNC terrorists.

On 4/30/74, MM 1337-S advised that FUSTE returned

to his position as program Director at WAB on the morning.

of 4/30/74, despite the fact that he had resigned on

4/29/74.

On both occasions;

FUSTE was accompanied by

Miami City Commissioner NANOLO REBOSO.

MM 1337-S subsequently

learned that his own status had become in doubt but he

expected to receive some definite word from Mr. EATON.

Re

speculated that REBOSO and FUSTE had succeeded in placing

pressure upon Mr. EATON to retain FUSTE, as a FCC hearing

is pending on FAB in the near future.

At 3:00 p.m. on 4/30/74, MM 1337-S advised that

JOSE ANTONIO ARIAS,

JR., an employee of WrAB, told him on

a confidential basis that he had overheard a conversation

that morning between FUSTE and MANOLO REBOSO. He heard

REBOSO state, "Don't forget the information I received

from LESNICK that ANGULO planned to work for DEA and may

now be working for DEA."

On the morning of 5/1/74, MM 1337-S advised

that he still does not know what is his present status, and

he has not returned to the station.

Information has been previously submitted to the

nute ng that in the do g x Listick lis

of Spanish language publication Replica, came to this office

on, two separate occasions to make allegations against

RICARDO MORALES NAVARRETE, Claiming that MORALES was engaged

in illegal activities under the protection of the FBI.

It is to be recalled that MORALES. was a key witness in

the 1968 prosecution in federal court of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA

and eight co-defendants, all of whom were convicted on

charges relating to ship bombings, extortion, and conspiracy.

He also served as a key witness in a narcotics case which

resulted in the conviction of MANJEL PENABAZ, who was a

friend of LESNICK and a writer for his publication.

Investigation has reflected that since BOSCH

was released on parole on 12/15/72, he has become an almost

daily visitor to LESNICK's office at Replica, and one of

BOSCH's co-defendants, JORGE GUTIERREZ, IS employed by

LESNICK.

Also, shortly after LESNICK's first visit to

this office, MANOLO REBOSO,

Miami City Commissioner, who

has subsequently become a Vice Mayor of Miami, came to

this office to make similar complaints against MORALES.

REBOSO disclosed that he himself had recommended that

LESNICK complain to the FBI.

REBOSO confided to SA DAVIS

on the occasion of his first visit that his own former

girl friend, PILIR ALTONSO; was the current girl friend

of MORALES, and that PILAR always contacted REBOSO

immediately after any contact with ORALES to inform

REBOSO concerning her relations with MCRALES. REBOSO

also stated that he planned

to make complaints to congress-

It later came to the

attention os this office that he did contact one or

more law enforcement officials in Miami to make similar

complaints against MORALES, alleging MORALES waS

receiving protection.from both the FBI and certain

officers of the Miami PD and the Dade County SO.

On 5/25/73, an attempt was made by two

nen to assassinate MORALES.

This occurred at 9:00 p.m.

after MORALES had telephoned PILAR at 8:00 p.m.

He notified no one else of his plans.

The assassination attempt, which resulted in minor

injuries to MORALES, was

made sharply at 9:00 p.m.

as he arrived at the residence of pILAR.

Shortly thereafter,

REBOSO came to the Miami

to lodge another complaint against. MORALES.

that time, he denied any connection with the assassina-

tion attempt against MORALES, but declined to sign a

Waiver of Rights.

On 3/11/74, at about 11:30 p.m., shortly

after leaving his place of employment, an unidentified

man in an automobile fired two shots at MM 1337-s, who

not hit.

Subsequently, MM 1337-S received information

confidentially from OSCAR

IBORRA, an employee of Prolica,

that the plan to assassinate iM 1337-s had been drawn up

In LESNICK's office and had been financed by LESNICK.

The identity of the would-be assassin is unknown. At

that time,

MM 1337-S conjectured that LESNICK may have

found out

that MMl 1337-S had filed an application for

employment by the DEA,

This speculation is based upon

the fact that an individual known to be a friend of LESNICK

had been interviewed by DEA concerning MM 1337-S' applica-

tion.

in criminal activities..

BOSCH also denounced TORRIENTE.

During the investigation of the murder of

TORRIENTE, the police found a small scrap of paper,

presumably left by the

assassin on the porch of

TORRIENTE'S home.

This scrap of paper reflected

TORRIENTE'S initials, bore a

On 4/12/74, ROLANDO MORALES, brother of

RICARDO, furnished this office with

information

concerning. a new plot, allegedly financed by LESNICK,

to assassinate MORALES.

ROLANDO MORALES' source has

subsequently informed MORALES that the triggerman

was allegedly associated with LESNICK and PLOY GUTIeRREL

MENOYO in the Second Front of the Escambray, a number

of years ago.

O0 4/13/74, MM 1337-S reported that LESNICK

invited him to accompany him to dinner at a restaurant

in Hialeah.

LESNICK was accompanied by two individuals,

one of whom he addressed as ROGER..

unidentified individual got in the back seat of the car,

and AM 1337-S noticed that 'one man had a gun in his belt.

After arriving at the restaurant, LESNICK and MM 1337-S

sat at a separate table, during which time LESNICK told

MM 1337-S that he should not believe any reports that

LESNICK was responsible for the attempted assassination

of MM 1337-S.

LESNICK also made a point several times to

impress MM 1337-S that ANTONIO VECIANA iS LESNICK'S very

Of ROGER REDONDO has been exhibited to MM 1337-S,

who is almost certain that he is identical to the

man with a gun in his belt who accompanied LESNICK.

MORALES has also advised that he had

personally observed REDONDO working on construction

at & schoolhouse which is located directly across the

street from the apartment complex where MORALES resides.

He has also ascertained that REDONDO is carrying a gun.

The assassination plan calls for the shooting of

MORALES by the assassin with a silencer equipped weapon

aS MORALES enters the gate to his apartment complex.

RAUL DIAZ and other officers of the Organized Crime

Unit of the PSD have been advised andare in close

contact with MORALES relative to this threat.

On 4/16/74, ARTURO RODRIGUEZ RIVAS, Cuban

exile residing in New York City, was assassinated.

There

is speculation in the Cuban community of Miami that the

assassination of RODRIGUEZ and of TORRIENTE are related:

MM 1550-KS and MM 1337-S have advised that RODRIGUEZ

RIVAS was formerly associated with BOSCH,

but left

BOSCH's organization in about 1967 or 1968 to join

the Cuban Power organization of HECTOR CORNILLOT in

the New York area.

Miani has also received information that BOSCH

was in New York two days prior to the assassination of

RODRIGUEZ, but no specific evidence of this has been

received, and BOSCH's probation officer has advised that

BOSCH did not ask for permission to go to New York City

at that time. (Miami is attempting to obtain more

information along this line.)

Previous investigation has reflected also that

both LESNICK and REBOSO have unsavory reputations among

respectable Cuban exiles in Miami.

Unverified information

has been received reflecting that REBOSO, prior to

becoming a City Commissioner, was involved in an

abortion racket, that he has

been a receiver of

stolen goods, and has been associated with well-known

Cuban hoodlums in the Miami area..

He is also sus-

pected by MM 1337-5, MM 1550-KS,

and other reliable

informants, as well as by some

police officers, of

being involved in narcotics on a high level in

Miami area.

Information has been received that

REBOSO is collecting kick-backs for political favors.

previous investigation has reflected also

that MAX LESNICK, who conducted a radio broadcast

from Havana, Cuba, during the early days of FIDEL

CASTRO, alrays concluded his programs with the statement

"Cuba Si, Yankee No."

LESNICK, according to MM 1337-S,

has bragged that he

"owns Miami." He is

accompanied in his travels about the city by armed

bodyguards, according to reliable sources, and he

has been involved in one altercation where he

allegedly attempted to pull a gun on his victim

during a street scuffle.

He is also suspected by

when he lecame General Manager.

The hearing relates

to an allegation concerning an advertising accounting

matter. JUSTO expressed the opinion that EATON had

been compelled at the last moment to support FUSTE

because of this pending hearing.

He pointed out that

FUSTE has considerable influence and the support of

REBOSO and REBOSO's political connections.

JUSTO said

that on or about 4/25/74, he was present during a

conversation involving FUSTE, REBOSO, and himself,

at which time JUSTO was trying to convince FUSTE

to put ANGULO back on his job.

At that time, REBOSO

remarked that he could talk to Congressman FASCELL

at any time and could stop the FBI from "harassing"

JUSTO said that FUSTE suspects that ANGULO may

be working for the FBI and the police. JUSTO pointed

out that ANGULO's function as a news reporter requires

him to visit the police and other investigative agencies

on almost a daily basis in order to acquire news for

broadcasting. JUSTO also said that REBOSO spends four

or five hours with FUSTE almost every day.

On the same day, MM 1337-S expressed the

opinion that FUSTE and

REBOSO, through some form of

pressure bordering on blackmail and extortion, have

convinced Mr. EATON to reverse his position on the

matter of the hiring and

firing of ANGULO and FUSTE.

The above information is set forth to reflect

what appears to be an interlocking conspiracy involv-

ing members of several terrorist organizations. It

also appears that these terrorist organizations are

receiving aid and comfort either intentionally or

coincidentally from REBOSO and LESNICK.

Miami is pursuing investigation vigorously

in order to obtain evidence for prosecutable purposes

and to assist the police in any violations of a local

criminal nature involving these organizations and

individuals.
