O Politiand Matters-Cubes

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I want to thank you for your personal letter of 22 May 1961,

providing information from a source who claims to have an official

position in the Castro Regime in Cuba until recently and to have a

personal association with Raul ROA, Cuban Foreign Ministerg (S)

From a counterintelligence point of view, I am most inter-

ested in the allegation by this source that Raul ROA said that the :

Soviet Intelligence Service had told him in late December 1960 that

the United States planned to attack Cuba and change the Cuban Govern-

782115

ment prior to January 20, 1961 in order that President Eisenhower

would not have to leave this problem to President Kennedy. Of par-

ticular concern is the report by this source that ROA said the Soviets

asen

claimed this information came from a Soviet contact in the Central

Intelligence Agency.

The information reported by the source to have been received

* from ROA, who in turn is alleged to have received it from the Soviet

(u)

CAs of December 1960, no plan as described existed:

Intelligence Service in December 1960, is inconsistent with the facts.

While this does

does raise questions both as to the existence of and the accuracy of

the so-called contact in the Agency.
