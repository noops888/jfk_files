Dear Chuck,

Your welcome phone call stirred

.a. lot of dead (or almost

dead) embers of memory. First, as I reflect on it, there was

no complete

record of all the documents that the Church Coum-

ittee saw. I think that there would be records in transmittal

letters of what was sent (in whatever records are left from

Seymour Bolten's staff -- over which I held a temporary role

he was recovering from his heaert atack).

My recollection (which can be in error) was that the

different Church staffers who came out to the agency did

their own thing their own

way. When they wanted

some document

it

was

always

sanitized and they carried it away. I can,

on reflection, can think of instances

when

they saw paper

in which I was involved.

Senator Baker (an

attractive, talented and highly regard-

ed legislator) did

a hatchet job on CIA when he was Nixon's

personal representative on

Senator Ervin's Watergate Committee.

He brought up from Tennessee a man who eventually became his

successor, who did it. They published a "report" in early

â€¢ July 1974, trying as best they

could raise all

manner of

likelihoods that CIA was involved

in the Watergate break-in.The

CIA IG conducted an extensive inquiry into all manner of

rumors and questions that had been raised. Colby did

a first

run, replying to the so-called "Baker Report." As I fretted

about it, Seymour Bolten and I did a later 70$ page comment

on Baker's report. Later, when the Church Committee came on

the scene, Baker's personal staff man, Mike (last name lost

man's aging memorj) came to the IG's office.

I said I wouldn't give him access to our Watergate file

(I recall as some two safes full) until he. had read the

Bolten-Breckinridge critique of the so-called Baker report.

In that case they saw our paper as well as the IG "Watergate

and an unfinished paper being done by John Richards

when he underwent surgery, from which he didn't recover. I

tell some of that story in my "CIA and the Cold War"

170-172, 182-184, 225-226.

229-226. "y

Anyway, the Church staffers saw the paper Seymour and

I did, as well as the IG file,

and

the uncompleted draft

lone by John Richards. I don't know how one can retrieve

those records, much less that they were seen by the Church

people.

Anne Karalekas, an impressive young lady, was the

professional

historian on the Church staff, and I recall

that she got into CIA's history shop. She saw

just about

everything they had produced, eventually doing a book

on CIA that I recall was well received. Without looking

now I think some of her

work will appear in the Church

report. But she saw a lot of that material.

You will recall the dramatic exaggerations about

MHCHAOS, which some Church people wanted

to be

seen as

proof that CIA conducted massive surveillance inside the

U.S. In fact. CHAOS was a foreign CI program, which is

discussed in my "CIA and the Cold War,"

pages 164-166,

202-206. Anyway, the Church people saw the "Eyes Only"

IG report on CHAOS, where ever it

may reside (probably at

least among the papers on

the EUR inspection in 1972).

I suspect that rather than a formal record center

the Church

people, for the most part asked to take papers

that seemed relevant. to whatever issue they pursued as of

a moment, and carried it away

with them (or had it sent

to them

-- hence the above mention

of transmittal letters).

You mentioned seeing Church staffers' notes; would any such

papers accompany them?

That's the best 2nd thoughts can produce after all

these years. If more occurs

to me I'll try to

summarize

it if it seems worth while.

'Twas good to talk with you. Good luck

Best wishes,

Another 248 thought. I did have a special.

File roon established fon all IG paper

coming out of the Church attair, 14

thought was it might some a late

purposed By no way was all that

seen by Church, Committe people,

but if it

can be found it

man sheer something that wads

seen by I20m.
