AND HIS COOPERATION AND RESPONSE TO AGENTS HANDLING IMPROVES WITH

EACH CONTACT. IT IS FELT, HOWEVER, THAT IF TE WAS IN POSITION

TO COME OUT OF HIDING, HIS ABILITY TO OBTAIN FURTHER VALUABLE

INFO RE LEN ACTIVITIES, SAN FRANCISCO AND NEW YORK AREAS, AND

SKIM INFO, LAS VEGAS, NEV., WOULD BE GREATLY ENHANCED. SPEC-

IFICALLY, HE WOULD BE IN POSITION TO DIRECTLY OBTAIN DATA RE MOVES

AND LEADERS BEING MADE WITHIN LON AS RESULT OF VACUUM CREATED BY

RECENT DEATH OF VITO GENEVESE. IN THIS REGARD, TE IS CURRENILY

IN HIDING AND THEREFORE, LIMITED IN HIS TRAVEL AND CONTACTS IN

ALL AREAS DUE TO AN OUTSTANDING FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR SHYLOCK

OBLIGATION IN NEW YORK WHICH HAS RESULTED IN A CONTRACT BEING

ISSUED FOR HIM. TE IS CONFIDENT THAT REMOVAL OF ALL OR A

PART OF THIS OBLIGATION WILL RESULT IN WITHDRAWAL OF CONTRACT.

HOWEVER, BUSINESS COMMITMENTS AND HIS CURRENT FINANCIAL STATUS

PRECLUDES HIS PERSONALLY HANDLING THIS DEBT.
