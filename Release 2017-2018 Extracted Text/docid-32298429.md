On 1/22/53, John Costello, a PCI of unknown reliability

advised that about twelve years ago one Gasper Morganti was arrested,

sentenced and became eligible for parole about five years later for

a murder committed in Indiana County, Pa. Costello was approached by

John LaRocca (62-69922) and Gabriel (Kelly) Mannarino in a restaurant

in Pittsburgh, to use his influence with the Indiana County Judge in

behalf of Morganti. Costello told them he could arrange for Morganti's-

parole for $10,000, but they would not accept his offer. LaRocca's

partnership with the Mannarinos of NK, Pa., was forced on them by

activities of Gabriel Mannarino in NK, Pa., in connection with the

investigation of a robbery of the Pittsburgh National Bank, Hillcrest

Office, Lower Burrell, Pennsylvania, 9/15/63 (91-18301). Mannarino

believed the persons who perpetrated the robbery were from outside the

New Kensington: area. He "chewed out" Nicholas Conomos, formerly of

Vandergrift, Pa., a bank robbery suspect, whose father befriended him

in years past.

Later he had Conomos physically beaten and told to

get out of town and stay out since the robbery "brought heat down"

on the area causing

the rackets to be suspended. Thomas Ciancutti,

i to the

a right-hand man of the Mannarinos,: felt that Mannarino would retaliate

against the persons responsible for

• the robbery. The Adri Lee Motel;

Irwin, Pa., was heavily patronized by Mannarino and other racketeers

from NK, the Pittsburgh area and elsewhere in Western Pennsylvania.

On 12/2/63, CV-581-PC in revealing how the Cleveland

a debt, used the Mannarinos as an example. If someone in Cleveland

put pressure on an individual in Pittsburgh to come up with the payment

using the name of the Cleveland "outfit" and this was brought to the

attention of the Mannarinos, they in turn would tell this individual

to make the payment. This also worked in reverse, for in such a

situation there was no jurisdictional problem.

On 1/15/64, CV-344-C advised that Gabriel Mannarino of

NK, Pa:, was unquestionably a member of the "organization"', but he
