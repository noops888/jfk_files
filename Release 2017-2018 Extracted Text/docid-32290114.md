Sergeant H. J. LADNER, Harrison County Deputy

Sheriff,

Gulfport, Mississippi;

advised SA WILLIAM F. DUKES

confidentially on March 22, 1962 that on or about March 6, 1962,

the same date that SA's DUKES and RICHARDSON interviewed

Sheriff CURTIS O. DEDEAUX and ASA GARRIGA, JR., about

GARRIGA's prostitution activities, Sheriff DEDEAUX called

LADNER in and accused him, LADNER, of having furnished the

information which instituted the FBI's

investigation of

GARRIGA and his associates LADNER advised DEDEAUX intimated

strongly that if he could prove this, he would fire LADNER

on the spot.

LADNER stated he got the definite impression that

DEDEAUX was concerned about the investigation, for fear that

it might develop information which could prove embarrassing

to him, both individually and as the sheriff. LADNER

stated he doubted seriously whether he, LADNER, could hold

his job much longer, inasmuch as DEDEAUX and

Deputy Sheriffs

HUGH R. BROACH,

JR., and GEORGE ROSETTI were

talking against

him. He advised he considered Detective DOUG THOMPSON (since

resigned)

with the Sheriff's Office to be the only reliable,

trustworthy officer presently associated with the department,

other than himself.

Mr. GASTON H. HEWES, Harrison County Prosecuting

Attorney, Gulfport, Mississippi,

advised SA WILLIAM F.

DUKES confidentially on May 25,

1962, that he has had considerable

difficulty in recent dealings with Sheriff CURTIS DEDEAUX,

in the course of which DEDEAUX has interrogated an emotionally

upset witness in a murder

case, contrary to specific instructions

by HEWES and District Attorney BOYCE HOLLEMAN.

NO 1017-C, Gulfport, Mississippi, advised SA

WILLIAM F. DUKES on June 21, 1962, that he

was recently

with ASA GARRIGA, JR., when GARRIGA slipped on

a service

station grease rack, and injured his shoulder in the ensuing

fall:

He and GARRIGA both have liability insurance and they

thereafter contacted Harrison County Deputy Sheriff ROBERT

and proposed that they fake an automobile accident

Bad split the "take" from the insurance company.

They planned

to fake a head-on collision between Informant and GARRIGA

on Pat Harrison Avenue in Biloxi,

Mississippi, with GARRIGA

subsequently using the bruise on his shoulder to justify a

personal Injury claim, the accident to be investigated by

PARKER. Informant advised that both PARKER and GARRIGA

appeared as planned, but that he, Informant, arrived later

than planned, so the deal did not take place.
