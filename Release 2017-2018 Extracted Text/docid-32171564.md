REASON:

DECLASSIFY ON: X

The sentine contents of this communication are

classified "SECRET" unless otherwise noted.

This matter was predicated upon receipt of information

from I-I that ALFREDO MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had arrived in Miami,

Florida approximately in June, 1988. He was sponsored by his

mother in entering the United

States and resided with her for a

short period of time.

MIRABAL-ALVAREZ departed Cuba in 1987 for

Spain where he established residency until entering the United

tates. While residing in Spain, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ became involve

politically with HUBER MATOS and his organization, ARMAND

ALLADARES and MANUEL SANCHEZ PEREZ (Cuban official who defected

to Spain in 1985). MIRABAL-ALVAREZ'S father (now deceased)

served as a Vice Minister in

the Ministry of Interior until the

"microfaccion" (period of purge of numerous officials in the late

1960's).

According to T-1, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was apolitical while

residing in Cuba.

MIRABAL-ALVAREZ'S Immigration and

Naturalization Service

(INS) file reflects he exited Cuba for

Spain in approximately

february, 1987, until entering the United

States on June 3, 1988

as a result of

being petitioned by his

mother, who was granted United States citizenship in 1976.

In

Cuba, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ'S occupation was an electronic technician

and it appears he applied to leave Cuba in 1967 and was denied

exit by the Government of cula because of pending military duty Lyla

On September 11, 1990, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ was interviewed

at the Miami Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

MIRABAL-ALVAREZ advised he arrived in the United States on June

3, 1988 through New York.

MIRABAL-ALVAREZ left Cuba on February

14, 1987 for Spain, where he remained until his arrival to the

United States.

MIRABAL-ALVAREZ advised that in 1980 his wife and

children were allowed to leave Cuba for Spain, but he was not

allowed to leave because he was an engineer.

Prior to his

attempt to leave Cuba, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ had just concluded a trip

to East Germany for approximately 20 days in November, 1979.

In

approximately March, 1980, MIRABAL-ALVAREZ asked to leave Cuba
