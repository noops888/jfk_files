see Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, Medical Doctor, at the Abbey

Clinic, 5190 S.W. 8th St., Coral Gables, Fla., where BOSCH

is employed.

MM 635-S had a foot infection which was

examined by BOSCH, after which BOSCH, in the presence of

MM 635-S, typed out instructions for

MM 635-S to follow

in treating this foot infection.

The typewriter was ob-

served by MM 635-S to be an old model Underwood. MM 635-S

was accompanied by his young son, who was also examined by

BOSCH for a minor ailment. (8) (4)

The Miami Office is in the process of attempting

to obtain more

extensive specimens of this Underwood type-

writer, as well as of all typewriters at the Abbey Clinic.

In the

meantime, a cursory examination by Agents of this

office reflects

that the above-described specimen obtained

by MM 635-S appears to be extremely similar to the typing

which appeared in the letter postmarked 9/28/64, sent to

ROBERTO MENDOZA - victim.

For the information of the

Bureau, investigation to date has reflected that the Abbey

Clinic

is in disrepute with the local Medical Association.

It has also reported that BOSCH is held in high regard by

the doctors who operate the Abbey Clinic.

Consequently,

The FBI Laboratory is requested to expedite

its examination o the enclosed specimen.

Also enclosed to the Bureau are two Immigration

and Naturalization Service (INS) documents containing

typing from a typewriter in possession of JOSE RICARDO

GARCIGA-ORBE of 1575 N. W. 2nd St., Miami.

These INS documents

were obtained on 1/20/65, by INS Investigator JAMES C.

De LISLE in cooperation with his immediate superior, Mr.

CHESTER WOISH, Chief of Investigations, INS, Miami, in

The FBI Laboratory is also requested to examine

the typing on these two documents with the extortion letters

mentioned above.

It is requested that all of the enclosures be

returned to this office after completion of examination

by the Laboratory.
