11 you would please call us, we will try to make arrangements over

12 there for that to be done.

which were directed against the Batista regime?

5

Mr.

11 tage operations?

Was

14 there anything that comes to mind?

Mr.

Espinosa. No, not really.

16

17 individual members of the Batista regime?

Mr. Blackmer. High level officials?

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

to go to school in the same town in which I was

born in Cuba.

3

Mr. Blackmer. So you had known him many years before your

started.

5

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes.

6

Mr. Blackmer. At the University?

7

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

8

Mr. Blackmer.

Who were some of his associates in the

9 underground activities?

10

Mr. Espinosa. For example, one Cubela and Machado.

11

Mr. Blackmer. Do you have the first names?

12

Mr. Espinosa. I cannot remember the first names because

13 we used to call him "Machaletto" and Joe Westbrook.

14

Mr. Blackmer. Is that an American?

15

Mr. Espinosa. No, he was a Cuban.

16.

Mr. Blackmer. Do you know what any of these individuals

17 are doing now?.

18

Mr. Espinosa. They are dead.

19

Mr. Blackmer. Are any of these individuals now with the

dead.

2

Mr. Blackmer. When did your interest change from being

• 3 anti-Batista

to pro-Castro?

4

Mr. Espinosa. I was never pro-Castro; being against

5

Batista

does

not mean you are pro-Castro.

6

I think

very shortly after Castro took over I began to be

7 anti-Castro.

8

Mr. Blackner. Did you ever meet Castro?

9

Mr. Espinosa. No.

10

Mr. Blackmer.

Do you know of any people who were closely

11

associated with him?

12

Mr. Espinosa. Only one person.

13

Mr. Blackmer. And that was whom?

14

Mr. Espinosa. That was Jose Smith, and he landed in Cuba

15 when Castro

landed and he was killed at that time. That is the

16 only person whom I knew was close to him.

17

Mr. Blackmer. When Castro landed in Cuba, was that in

18 1956?

19

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes, 1956.

20

Mr. Blackner. So your activities began approximately in

211957.

22

Mr. Espinosa.

No, I would say 1955.

23

Mr. Blackmer.

During this period of time, did you know

24 Pedro Diaz Lanz?

25

Mr. Espinosa.

No, I did not.

6

9 hotel, the social manager of the hotel was

a friend of mine.

10

11

Mr. Blackmer. And his name was what?

• Mr. Espinosa. It was Callejas, and he subsequently

12 introduced me to Bill MeLaney who ultimately introduced me to

13 Mike MeLaney.

14

Mr. Blackmer. And what was the nature of your

15 relationship?

16

. Mr. Espinosa.

It was just social in Cuba.

17

Mr. Blackmer. Did you go out with them to dinner?

18

19

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, sometimes.

Mr. Blackmer. Were either of the MoLaney brothers

20 involved in any clandestine activities against either Batista

Mr. Blackmer. Could you tell us your first contact with

11 the Central Intelligence Agency and your first role in the

12 Cuban exile movement prior to the Bay of Pigs in the United

13 States?

14

Mr. Espinosa. Well, I heard when I came to the States

15 they were forming some kind of a brigade or something to invade

16 Cuba,

and I told different

friends of mine in Miami to let me

17 know when the thing was happening. I went to New York to work

18 and they contacted me at one point, and they were recruiting

19 people to take part in this activity, and

I went back to Miani

20 and I enlisted myself.

21

Mr. Blackmer.

could you tell us who it was that contacted

22 you?

23

Mr. Espinosa. I think it was Mario Jiminez.

part of this?

11

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

12

Mr. Blackmer. Can you recall any of the specific details

15 kilometers in Havana and we were supposed: to knock out this

installation somewhere, and all of the raids were a

17 different nature, like

if we went into the country, and

9 of Pigs?

10

Mr. Espinosa. After the Bay of Pigs, I think I went in

11 two or three times.

12

Mr. Blackmer. And do you recall the last raid that you

13 went on that was sponsored by the CIA, approximately what date

14 that was?

3

4

Mr. Espinosa. There was a little hustle at that time;

5 everything was very much in the air and we were on stand-by,

6 but we were not sent back.

7

Mr. Blackmer. Do you recall whether or not any members of

8 Customs or Immigration in the Miami area were made aware of any

9 of your particular raids so as not to stop you?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Would you rephrase that again?

11

Mr. Blackmer. The various raids that you went on, I

12 assume many of them were from the Miami area:

13

Mr. Espinosa.

They were from the Keys; down toward Key

14 West.

15

Mr. Blackmer. Were you aware of any monitoring by Customs

16 or Immigration officials of the United States Government?

18

Mr. Blackmer. These agencies are charged with the respon-

19 sibility of enforcing the neutrality acts. They try to limit

20 any hostile acts emanating from this country.

21

Were you aware that they were told specifically about your

22 operations so that they did not stop you?

your intended mission, which was to bomb an oil

3 refinery in Havana.

4

Could

you tell us whose idea that operation emanated

5 from?

6

• Mr. Espinosa. From me.

7

Mr. Blackmer. It was your idea?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

9

Mr. Blackmer. Did you get any assistance from any other

10 individual for the

raid?

11

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, I got assistance from Carlos

12 Hernandez, from Miguel Alvarez and that is the other kind of

13

assistance you are

asking for?

14

Mr. Blackmer:

Financial or other?

15

• Mr. Espinosa. Financial assistance from MeLaney.

16

Mr. Blackmer. How much money did. McLaney give you for

17 this project?

18

Mr. Espinosa. I cannot recall. He gave us whatever we

19 needed to buy the

explosives and so on.

20

Mr. Blackmer. Who got the airplanes?

21

Mr. Espinosa. It was Sam Benton.

22

Mr. Blackmer. And how did you

kno'

Sam Benton?

23

Mr. Espinosa. I met him at MeLaney's house several

24 times.

25

Mr. Blackmer. How was he introduced?

1

Mr: Espinosa. You mean in what --.

2

Mr. Blackmer, What you understood to be his particular

3 role.

4

Mr. Espinosa. He was like a friend of mine and a friend

5 of Mike's and I guess Mike wanted him to front

for him or be

6 the one who got the airplane.

7

Mr. Blackmer. Did he have any specific knowledge of

8 planes or munitions or anything of that nature to where ne

9 would be a person

that you would go to get these things?

10

Mr. Espinosa. I wouldn't know that but I don't think so,

11 and I wouldn't think so.

12

Mr. Blackmer. So, you think it was really Mike who

13 secured the planes and used. Sam as the front man.

14

Mr. Espinosa. No, I think Mike told him to get us what

15 we wanted more or less and he got it.

16

Mr. Blackmer. Nas

it your understanding that benton was

17 connected with the government in any way, the U.s. government?

18

Mr. Espinosa. No, at no time did I believe he was

19 connected with the U.S. Government.

Mr. Blackmer. And had. Mike at any time to your knowledge

20

21 been

connected with the U.S. Government?

22

Mr. Espinosa. Not thai I know of.

23

Mr. Blackmer. Where did you get the explosives that you

24 were going to use?

25

Mr. Espinosa. I think we got them in Fort Lauderdale.

20

Mr. Blackmer. Did you personally get them or someona

2 else

got thenn?

3

Mr. Espinosa. I think Miguel Alvarez got them.

4

Mr. Blackmer. Can you tell us a little bit about what

5 the plan was for this bombing raid?

6

Mr. Espinosa. Well, the plan mas to try to get the

7 refinery out of service or out of production so instead of

8 bringing crude oil into the country and be refined in cuba,

9 they would have to bring in the gasoline. So, that would have

10 made a very easy target

for us in order to blow up the tankers

11 or whatever vessels were used to bring in the gasoline.

12

Mr.. Blackmer. Were you aware that any of these vessels

13 that were carrying oil to cuba may have been flying a Russian

• 14 flag?

15

Mr. Espinosa. No, this was a hypothetical thing at the

16 time.

17

Mr. Blackmer. It was not your intention at that

time to

18 provoke an incident between the U.S. and Russia?

19

Mr. Espinosa. No, that would have stopped us from

20 blowing up the Russian

ship.

21

Mr. Blackmer. So, you had some knowledge, I understand,

22 of the particular oil refinery that

you vere going after?

23

Mr. Espinosa. les.

24

Mr. Blackner. How did you acquire that knowledge?

25

Mr. Espinosa. Nell, through

family busineses.

21

Mr. Blackmer. And what specifically was that business?

2.

Mr. Espinosa. It was--there were industrial inspectors

3 who used to inspect sugar refineries,

alcohol and places where

4

alcohol was being made and gasoline

refineries, or oil

5 refineries, et cetera:

6

Mr. Blackmer. And you had personally gone over this

7 particular refinery?

Mr. Espinosa: Yes, as a younger man I used to go there

9 with inspectors sometimes to make some pocket money or

10: something.

11

Mr. Blackmer. A part-time job?

12

Mr. Espinosa. A part time job, yes.

13

Mr. Blackmer. Did you talk McLaney into financing this

14 operation?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Blackmer. And did you know what his particular

17 interest was in seeing this operation successfully completed?

18

Mr. Espinosa.

well, I mean, first we have to say that if

19 the operation was successful, perhaps we had a chance to

20 economically cripple the country and consequently bring about

21

a change in the politics. Of course, a change in the

22 political situation at the time would have

been

a favorable

23 change for Mr. MoLaney's economics or business out

there.

24

Mr: Blackmer. So, MoLaney was personally interested in

25 regaining some of his possessions in cuba.

22

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, exactly like that.

2

Mr. Blackmer.

Do you

know if he was

involved in any of

3 the internal politics in Cuba in the sense--do you know if he

4 was sponsoring any particular exile leaders who could possibly

5 in

the

foreseeable future go back to Cuba and take over once

6 Castro was eliminated?

7

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know that. I don't think so.

8

Mr. Blackmer. So, is it your opinion that Mr. MoLaney

9 was doing what little he could and hoping that others would do

10 a little and

add to the possible fall of the Castro regime?

11

Mr. Espinosa. Exactly.

12

Mr. Blackmer. In July of 1963 outside of New Orleans,

13 Louisianna, a large catch of dynamite and home-made bombs were

14 found in the home of Bill MeLaney. Could you tell us what you

15 know about that catch of arms that was discovered?

16

Mr. Espinosa.

It was

taken thare by

me and it was to be

17 used in other raids.

18

Mr. Blackmer. A similar raid?

19

Mr. Espinosa. As the one that was in cuba.

20

Mr. Blackmer. I understand that some of the people that

21 participated with you in the June 15 attempt also participated

22 with you in the july attempt.

23

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

24

Mr. Blackmer. First of all, it is my understanding that

25 you planned

on using a B-25 or B-26 bomber.

Mr. Blackmer, was it the B-25 or B-26?

3

Mr. Espinosa. I cannot remember, one or the other.

4

Mr. Blackmer. Who was it that was to get the plane?

5

Mr. Espinosa. The

plane was to be delivered

to us over

6 there.

7

Mr. Blackmer. At Pontchartrain?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, and we were to go over there on the

9 plane and take off.

10

Mr. Blackmer.

Specifically, who was going to go on

the

11. actual flight?

12

Mr. Espinosa.

It was going to be a pilot, whose name I

13 can't remember right now.

14

Mr. Blackmer. Was it Antonio Soto Vasquez?

15

Mr. Espinosa. I am not sure; it could be.

16

Mr. Blackmer. Who else was to go on the plane?

17

Mr. Espinosa. There were only three people to go on the

18 plane. It was going to be Antonio, if it was--I am not sure,

19

and Miguel and myself or either Migual or Carlos Hernandez.

20

Mr. Blackmer, Was Sam

Benton,

once again, going to get

21 you the plane?

22

Mr. Espinosa. No.

23

Mr. Blackmer. Who was going to get you the plane?

Mr. Espinosa. I have no idea. We were tried; the whole

25 thing was departmentalized.

Mr. Blackmer. Whose responsibility was it, to your

2 knowledge -- was it to get the plane?

3

4

Mr. Espinosa.

Financial responsibility, you mean?

Mr. Blackmer. Financial responsibility.

5

Mr.. Espinosa. It was Mike McLaney.

6

Mr. Blackmer. And to the best of your knowledge, Mike was

7 going to make sure that the plane was at a specified location?

Mr. Espinosa.

That is right.

9

Mr. Blackmer: And as to the pilot, did you take the

10 pilot with you or was the pilot supposed to be there with the

11 plane?

12

Mr. Espinosa. No. I went there first to that place, and

13 then the guy who was going to go with the plane, Carlos

14 Hernandez, came from Miami; and the pilot was supposed to meet

15 us there once the plane was there or we knew the plane was

16 coming, and he was going to fly from Miami to New Orleans.

17

Mr. Blackmer.

The pilot didn't come with Carlos

18 Hernandez?

19

Mr. Espinosa. No.

Mr. Blackmer:. Do you know an individual named Lauchli

3 to drop in the raid.

4.

Mr. Blackmer. This individual that told you about him,.

5 what did the individual tell you about Luchli?

6

Mr: Espinosa. It was just the John Birch Society who had

7 helped some of the cubans and different officials before.

8

Mr. Blackmer. You telephoned this individual and met

9 him, I assume, where?

10

Mr. Espinosa. At his place, at his house.

11

Mr. Blackmer. That was where?

12

13

Mr. Espinosa. In Colesville, Illinois.

Mr. Blackmer.

Did you then go with him to pick up

14 explosives?

15

Mr. Espinosa.. First, we picked up the explosives but we

16

left them at the place where he had them and then we went on

17 for three or four days making the detonators which were made

18 from the heads of 61 millimeter mortar shells or ó0 millimeter

19

mortar shells.

20

Mr. Blackmer. I assume Mr. Lauchli supplied all of the

21 individual parts

and you and Luchli together made the bombs?

3

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

4

Mr. Blackmer, When you went to New Orleans, where did

5 you stay?

6

Mr. Espinosa. I stayed at MoLaney's house.

7

Mr. Blackmer. The

same cottage at Lake Pontchartrain?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes but let me say something first. I

9 stayed

the first night in a motel, and the next day I drove

10 because

I wasn't sure I could find a place at night and then

11 the next day I drove over there.

12

Mr. Blackmer. Did you at any time contact Bill McLaney?

13

Mr. Espinosa. I can't recall if I did or not, I probably

14 did.

15

Mr. Blackmer. Do you recall if

someone else may

16 have given you a key or was the door left open?

In other

17 words, what I am trying to establish is: Did Bill know about

the whole operation?

19

Mr. Espinosa. I can't say for certain.

20

Mr. Blackmer. And you do not recall whether or not he

21 physically came to the cottage where you were?

12 Mr. Blackmer. Could you tell

us at what point you

13 decided against going on the operation?

14

Mr. Espinosa.

well, somehow the father of Fred Gill, who

15 was going to arm the plane, died and subsequently we had to

16 restructure and the guy had to go to Miani and shortly after

17 the burial or something we found out he had been picked up by

18 the

FBI, so we had to call the operation off.

Mr. Espinosa. He was always a good

gambler and he took

Mr. Elackmer. When you learned of the assassination--and

18

I assume you saw newspaper articles and television coverage oî

19 the assassination-did you recognize Lee Harvey Oswald as

20 having seen

him before?

21

Mr. Espinosa. No.

22

.Mr.. Blackmer. Had you heard anything after the

23 assassination from any of your friends in the Cuban exile

24 community that may have implicated any one of the old Cuban

25 exiles in the assassination?

Mir. Espinosa. No, never.

2

Mr.

Blackmer. After the Bay of Pigs, what was tre

3 reaction to him

of the cuban exiles that you

knew? I am sure

4

they were very disappointed and were many of them violently

5 angry against Kennedy himself or the U.S. Government?

6

Mr. Espinosa.

Not really against him, against the CIA

7

mainly or against the government and not against Kennedy.

8

Mr. Blackmer. What was their general feeling as the

9 cause of the failure of the Bay of Pigs?

10

Mr. Espinosa. The CIA.

11

Mr. Blackmer. How do you mean?

• 12

Mr. Espinosa. Nell, should I go into this a little?

13

Mr. Blackmer. Yes, I think so.

14

Mr. Espinosa. When the question was risen by the pilots

15 in Guatemala, if you are going to go to the Bay, go in with a

16 B-25 or B-26. B-26, let us say, is a tactical somoer plane

17 and now this kind of plane, if I remember, it has eight

1850-caliber machine

guns. in

the nose and two in the tail and so

19 on.

20

And in order for this plane to fly from Guatemala to Cuba

21 and be able

to have a feeder for 30 minutes operation

in

the

22 area and bomb or machine gun for 30 minutes and come back to

23 Guatemala, all of this ammunition and all of the machine guns

24 have to be taken from the plane and put additional gasoline

25 tanks in.:

36

So, the question was aroused -- and how do you say in

2 English -- it was raised of what happens when we get there

3 without any fighter protection and the planes are going to

4 be

in the air and

they

are going to be knocked down?

5

So, the answer to that was that there were going to be

6 two or three bombing raids and one in San Antonio Bay in

7 Havana and another one in another place and another one in

8 Valdo Beach at the airport, and just destroy it and make it a

9 pretentious strike and destroy Castro's air force on the

10 ground.

11

So, everybody was very content with this explanation, and

12 the strike took over and Roa, who was a Cuban ambassador to

13 the United Nations, made a big fuss at the time. So, there

14 was

a big fuss

in the United Nations and they came up with the

15 pictures of the planes, and then it was found that this story

16 that the air force had been bombed by Cuban pilots belonging to

17 Fidel Castro's army who had defected, it was a lie because

18 the models of the cuban planes were a different model;

19 like you have a DC-9B or DC-9C, or is that right?

20

So, when Stevenson, who was ambassador to the United

21 Nations - when he went to kennedy and the third strike was

22 called off, which left Castro with about two or three planes

23 were left as a consequence of the Stevenson convincing

24 the president at a time to call off

1 the third raid; so consequently we lost all of the planes.

2

Mr. Blackmer. Is that one of the specific reasons why the

3 invasion failed?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, I would think so.

Mr. Blackmer. Because Castro's air force was able to

6 annihilate the bombers and also the supply ships?

7

Mr. Espinosa. As long as

we had a boat we could really

8 take and maintain a piece of land over there until the forces

9 of the Organization of American States would come in, and as I

10 understood by friends of mine who were there, all of the ships,

11 the battle ships were right there and the carrier and the

12 whole thing.

13

So, I guess the whole thing was that somehow people

14 thought it was as usual, the usual CIA screwed-up thing, and

15 they thought it was Stevenson who really precipitated the

16 whole thing. But nobody -- maybe because they were sympa-

17 thetic, but nobody bothered about blaming Kennedy for it.

18

Mr. Blackmer. So, it was your feeling at the time that

19 the CIA was noted for inefficient operations. In your

20 training, did you feel like you were given

adequate and

21 sufficient training?

22

Mr. Espinosa. As I said to you the other day, I did, and

23.300 guys did, but not the whole force that invaded Cuba. And

24 then this might not have been a CIA decision and might have

25

been a decision

saying you have to get the guys over there and

1 it is now or never.

2

So, what I am saying is, as I said to you the other day,

3 it is the fault of the Cubans. If we had gotten in there in

4 the beginning and so on and so on.

5

Mr. Blackmer. Did many Cubans understand this to be the

6 situation; that the failure should fall on their shoulders?

7

Mr. Espinosa. They were all heroes, even if they never

8

saw a gun in their lives. They are all heroes, and so you have

9 to blame things on other people and not on yourselves, and the

10 main reason why we failed should fall upon our shoulders to

11 begin with.

12

Mr. Blackmer. It is your testimony then that you par-

13 ticipated in an infiltration before the Bay of Pigs, and

14 after the Bay of Pigs you were on three or four more infil-

15 trations into Cuba?

16

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

17

Mr. Blackmer. And as I recall, what we are trying

18 to do today is get on the record all of the things we had

19 discussed in our interview with you.

20

Mr. Espinosa. Let me tell you something. There was a

file somewhere with the days and the people that went into

22 this infiltration,

and you didn't do that because. I have

23 seen it many, many years ago.

12 of the operations that you personally were involved in?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, and the persons involved and

friends

14 of mine and people involved in the other operations with

me

15 from the CIA and the whole thing.

16

Mr. Blackmer. Is it your feeling that, as you expressed

17 the other day, that these subsequent operations were merely

18 done by the CIA just

to keep control or taos on some of the

19 Cubans?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Either that or to get us killed, one thing

21 or the other.

22

Mr. Blackmer. And you

felt that the operations them-

23 selves ware meaningless?

Mr: Espinosa.

Not only that; you two have

Mr. Blackmer.

In

February of 1963 there was a story

2 circulated that certain Russian technicians were hiding

3 in the hills in

Cuba and that they wanted to defect.

As

4 a result. of this a man by the name of Eddie Bayo or Eduardo

5 Perez, with 10 other men, were infiltrated into Cuba. They

6 were never seen again.

7

Had you heard during the time this story about the

technicians?

Mr. Espinosa. It is the first time that I heard of it

10 at the time, yes.

11

Mr. Blackmer.. That the Russians were in Cuba; but had

any of them were hiding and ready to defect?

13

Mr. Espinosa. No.

14

Mr. Blackmer. What had you heard about the Russian

15 technicians

at the time?

16

Mr. Espinosa. Well, what I heard at the time was that

17 long before that time, long before 1963, there was Alphonzo

18 Carol and there was Siva -- the last name, and I cannot

19 remember the first name -- and they were in a CIA mission in

20 Cuba and they reported to the CIA, or at least they said they

were

1 John.

2

Mr.. Hornbeck. Can you

state the first time that you met

3 Rolando Cubela and what your relationship was with

him in

4 Cuba?

5

Mr. Espinosa. I must have met Rolando when I was about

6 12 or 13 years old. because he used to go, or we used to have a

7 very good

protestant school in the city in which I was born.

8 And a lot of people from all over Cuba used to go there to get

9 an education.

10

He was going to this

school and I met him at that time,.

11 and I was 12 or 13 and he must have been 15 or 16 years old at

12 that time.

13

Mr. Hornbeck, Were you friendly with any of

his

14 relatives and was he friendly with any of your relatives?

15

Mr. Espinosa. I was friendly with his father and with

16 his mother and mainly with his brother, and his

father, I saw

17 him and he was always lost somewhere and I was very friendly.

18 with his mother and with his sister, Cari.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. After this

first

schooling with Rolando,

20 did you continue to stay in contact with him?

21.

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, mainly because he was a very good

22 friend

of

Jose Antonio Echeverria.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. And I take it Echeverria was a good friend

24 of yours?

25

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, we used to live about 20 minutes

4

Mr: Espinosa. Ne all went to the University of Havana.

5

Mr. Hornbeck. Were all three of you there at

6 approximately the

same

time?

7

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, they were there before I was there

8 and by the time I got there they were big shoes already..

9

Mr. Hornbeck, What was Cubela's course of study at the

10 University and what political activities at the University was

11 he engaged in?

12

Mr. Espinosa. It is funny, Rolando started to be a

13 doctor and he was

studying to be a doctor.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. You are speaking of a medical doctor?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, and I do not know whether he

16 graduated or not

and his political activities

were very, very

17 limited in the sense that he would sort of follow the

18 activities of Antonio mainly.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. And was this their pattern at the

20 University when you arrived, that echeverria was a real leader

21

and Cubela was associated with him?

8 there was anyone candidate?

9

Mr. Espinosa. What is that?

10

Mr. Hornbeck. Who did the students support or was it

11 just against Batista?

12

Mr. Espinosa. Mainly the last president, Prio. There

13 was a lot of good nature and idealogical politicking in the

14 University, and there was a lot of politicking done by other

15 guys who had been in the University for a long time and the

16 kind of students who never graduated, professional students;

17 and I think prio was to butter them up and keep them flaming,

18 and there were different sections.

Sut in general, everybody liked prio and there was a

20 democratic government and here

came Castro and he screwed it

1 in any anti-castro activity or anti-Batista activities?

2 Mr. Espinosa. I will explain to you. I was in the

3 University for one year and I didn't study, and all we did the

4 whole time was

just trying to get something going against

5. Batista. There were so many clashes with the police and

6 people shot and this and that.

7

And my father took me out and sent me to LSU. I stayed

8 there one year and then I became of age, 18, and my grand-

9 father died, and so I decided to quit and go on andtake over

10 the ranch that my grandfather had left me at the time.

11

So, I went over there and minding my own business and

12 working and not messing in politics and l used to spend three

13 or four weeks over there or 40 days and then go to Havana for

14 a weekend or three or four days. And then one time l went to

15

Havana and Rolando called me and he had just--or Antonio had

16 just been to Mexico to see Castro and they had a meeting in

17 Mexico.

18

So, he said, "we are going to have a meeting with about

19. 10 or 12 guys in the University and Jose Antonio told me to.

call

20 you."

21

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you

tell us approximately what year

22 this was?

23

Mr. Espinosa. 1956.

This was the day before Colonel

24. Blanco was shot, the day before he was shot.

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you identify what position he held?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

6

Mr. Hornbeck.

And that day, what

-=..

7

Mr. Espinosa. That day Rolando called me and he said, "We

8 are going to meet at the square in the University at 1:10

9 o'clock, and jose Antonio told me to call you." And so I got

10 over there and we were about 10 or 12 guys, and Castro was

11 going to come, and he sent me regards from the guy who was

12 killed and we had to start really cracking and getting things

13 done over there, like shooting the big guys or chief of police

14 and so on; and military intelligence and all of that.

15

So, we made three groups of four people each, and I can

16 remember who was there in case you want the names, but I don't

17 think it is of interest to you because most of them are dead,

18 and maybe except for Rolando.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. If you can remember the groups and what

20 targets those particular groups had.

21

Mr. Espinosa. The people who were there were Rolando,

22 Antonio, Machin and Machado.

6 areas with specific targets

in mind?

7

9 and we got the

easiest one, who was Blanco Irco, and then the

10 others were together going to take care of Taberinalla.

9 took a nap and I took a shower and I went there at 10:00

10 o'clock and they iere not there.

11

So, I went to three or four different places

where we

12 were supposed to be because the guy was supposed to be there,

13 and I thought maybe I was late or they were early. I thought

14 it was my fault and I couldn't find him and about half past 12

15 or 10:00 o'clock, I said, "well, nothing happened," and I

16 don't know what happened and I went to sleep. The rext

9 about a year. Then, he called me one day and we had a meeting

10 and we were talking about making an assault on the Presi

11 dential Palace

and that is the last time that I saw him.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately what was the plan date of

13 the assault on the palace?

14

• Mr. Espinosa. I think he got a letter--I am sure--from

15 Castro that he showed to all of us who were there at

that

16 meeting that day, and the letter was saying, "well, after 120

17 days or 90 days or 200 days that I have been

in the Sierra

18. Mastros, in the hills, you haven't done anything yet."

19

It was a kind of a letter that was really trying to make

20 him

feel like a shit, and I know this was a much more

21 complicated thing and it was only going to be the students who

22 were going to do it.

23

Then, in came

people from other organizations and

2 never got in touch wiüh me.

3

Mr. Hornbeck. Did there come a time when Cubela returned

4 to Miami?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

6

•Mr. Hornbeck. Can you

tell us approximately when that

7 was?

• Mr. Espinosa. It must have been the end of 1957.

9

Mr. Hornbeak. And from the period?

10

Mr. Espinosa. It was the middle of 157, three or four

11. months after that time of the Presidential Palace.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. From the period of mid '57 through the

13 first part of 1959, what was your association with Cubela?

14

Mr. Espinosa. You see,

everybody was so burned up all of

15 the time in Havana, everybody had to go to the hills and I had

16 a very good relationship with the son of the actual president

17 of the senate in cuba at the time, and he was

a very good

18 friend of mine.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Who was that?

20

Mr. Espinosa. Alfred Gonzalez.

21

Mr. Hornbeck. Would

you tell us about the old man first?

22

Mr. Espinosa. The old man was Anselmo Alliegro and he

23 was president of

the senate at the time, and he was one of the

24 big shots.

I met his step-son when I was in Louisianna State

25 and we were close

friends.

ar. hornbeck. They were fighting independently?

2

Mr. Espinosa. Independently, and trying

get to Havana

3 verore Castro did, and so you have an idea what the realities

4 were at the time, when Castro: sent Che Guevara from Oriente

5 Province to the province of

Santa Clara. And I think that he

6 hac

150 or 160 men.

7

In Santa Clara there were plenty of people fighting,

8 because this was not such

an isolated place as Oriente nas,

9 and

it was not only the student group; there ias also the

10 people of the william Morgan group which were the third front,

11 and they alone with 2,500 people. But Castro wanted to have a

12 chair over there somehow to control the situation, and one of

13 the things, or the orders was to dispose of Rolando Menoya.

14

Mr. Hornbeck, You are saying one of the missions of che

15 Guevara was to eliminate or kill both Menoya and cubela so

16

that castro would de the only leader?

17

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

18

Mr. nornbeck. How do you

have that information?

19

Mr. Espinosa. From Cubela and from other peogle who vere

20 Enere at the time, because the thing is that somehow they

21. found out by some of the students from the University of

22 Oriente who were with Castro.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. was there any confrontation with either

24 Che Guevara or Castro?

25

Mr. Espinosa. Che arrived there and took him and put nim

Mr. Espinosa. This would have been October, September or

8

Mr. Hornbeck. Batista leaves Havana approximately the

9 first of january of 1959?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. What arrangements, if any, were made

Mr. Espinosa. Nothing.

Nr. Hornbeck. How

did it come about that Fidel Castro

came to power and Cubela and Menoya and some of the other

leadars

did not come to power?

17

Mr. Espinosa. I con't know. I always vondered about

18 that myself. And

as I said to you, I used to be in the

19 hospital room with rolando at the time when he vas wounded,

20 when he was soing through the operation with the arm, ano I

21. was there when Castro came to see him, and when Che came to

1 course, and they knew exactly what we were doing and we didn't

2 know exactly what we were doing. we were fighting a war and

3 once the war was over, we didn't know what to do and we didn't

4 have any ambition of power.

5

And when I say "we," I don't count and I am talking about

6 the people who were there; mostly i am talking about Rolando.

7 and there was no ambition of power or any of that. There

was

8 just to set the guy out and that is it. Our aim was to stoo,

9 when these

people's aims were very well planned for far ahead.

10

iir. Hornbeck. Did there come a time when you and Cubela

11

split as

to your views of Castro?

12

Mr. Espinosa: Yes.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. Can you tell us approximately when that

14 happened, and

can you describe how you came apart?

15

vir. Espinosa. well, as i said at the beginning, when he

16 caine into fiavana, immeciately they called me and they said,

17 "Rolando is going to be here in about one hour and they want

18 you to be at the university.

19

he came in 15 or 20 minutes late, and he said

to me, 1

20 think we are going to have a lot of problems with Castro and

21. the 26th of July as a symbolic thing, because so many of our.

22 friends got killed on the attack of

the Presidential Palace,

23 and Antonio was killed. that day, and not there but another

24 part of Havana, and we went and took the Presidential Palace

25 as a gesture

and a symbolic thing.

57.

The first two or three months we were together all of the

time. Then I started aisagreeing with him on things, and 1

guess I was a wise ass

the time, especially about the

4 things that we were letting Castro get away with, especially

5 where he had to take absolute power over everything and we

6 were

getting oull shit in return.

And the fact was I never

I liked the guy; and as a matter of fact, I hated him, and I

8 never knew his politics because I don't krow.

9

Some

people find out their wives or girls are fooling

10 around with somebody else for two or three years, and just

11 from the beginning I thought this was going the wrong way. So

12 I started having arguments with Rolando and asking for

13 explanations

from hin, because this was not what we fought for

14 and not what our friends died for, and "So you are becoming

15

accomplice of Castro and I cannot understand this."

16

He said, "Why do you say that, and why are you putting up

17 with this?"

18

I said, "and

they are taking land away from people and

19 they are shooting soldiers who never shot in the whole war and

20 just shooting. them and there was no trial, and I have seen

tha

21 trial's and they were mockeries, and whether they were guilty

22 or not guilty, they got shot and that is it."

23

so he wouldn't give me the right answers, and he would

24 say, "well, there is a revolution." And I said, "I don't

25 understand that,

Rolando, and I don't understand it, and I

HH 54756 DocId:32246514 Page 58

53

1 don't understand the things that are happenina: and you are

2 being an accomplice because you are in a position to co

3 something and you

are not doing anything, and you are playing

4 his ball game."

5

In the beginning we discussed these matters, and

then we

6 started

getting very close in, and I really didn't understand

I it. And to the point one day we had a discussion in my house

8 and he told my mother, "when your son goes to jail, then call

9 me," and I said, "I won't call you."

10

Mr. Hornback. Rolando said that to your mother?

11

12

Mr.. Espinosa. Yes.

Mr. Hornbeck. Approximately when did you leave Havana?

13

Mr. Espinosa. I left Havana in 1959.

14

Mr. Hornoeck. When in 1959?

15

Mr. Espinosa.

I don't know if it was

october or

16 September or

november;

somewhere between Cctober and December.

17

Mr. Hornbeck. During

the period of time that you came to

18 the United States and went to train in the bay of Pigs and

19 came back to the ünited States, did you have any contact with

20 Cubela?

21

Mr. Espinosa. well, some guys and myself, we thought at

22 the time we were allowed to go to south America and I and some

23. others were joing to Panama or licaragua, and so we got the

24 idea -- and there is one thing I forgot to tell you.

25.:

At the beginning when things began, there was a lot of

2 from an arsenal in some base outside of lavana, and it must

3 nave been 500 w-1 rifles and

few 50-calicer machine guns and

4 copule of hundred of Thonpson submachine duns, and some

5

mortars, a 190 tank gun, and somenow all of the things vere

6 nidden by me.

7

Rolando told me to hide it in a place, that we were going

8 to need it one day. So I hid it in my house, and we had a

9 very

big house, so big that when they came looking for these

10 they couldn't find it because it was like an old castle and

11 there were like hidden doors, hidden panels and things like

12 that.

13

They came looking for it and they didn't find it, and so

14 about two or three weeks after that I put the whole thing

in a

15

truck and took it to a resort very near to where I was born,

16 in

Varadero.

17

so I took it over there and we decided, a few guys who

18 were going to do something, go to the hills or do something,

19 and we came out with this idea to go to some other country and

20 do something so we could get away and cover our activities.

21

we got caught.

22.

Mr. Hornbeck. By whom?

23

Mr. Espinosa. By Castro.

24

Ne got caught, and we were taken to Military

25 Intelligence, and there were about six or seven of us, and

1 they got all the weapons. Someone squealed and they

2 infiltrated somebody in the group. And I don't know what vas

3 going to happen, out it was a little bit scary at the time,

4 and so we were uncommunicated for several days and we were

5 questioned, and we were sticking to our story we going to

6 Guatemala. or someplace

else.

And I can't remember now,

anc

7 Rolando was in Spain and my mother called him and he came over

8 and he got us out.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. Was there any particular reason he was

in

10 Spain at that time?

11

Mr. Espinosa. He was a playboy.

12

Mr. Hornbeck. It had nothing to do with Castro?

13.

Mr. Espinosa. No. He went over there to have a good

time, and so actually the threat that he made, "Call me and I

15 will help you,"

and my mother called him and he came over and

16

he got us out.

17

Mr. Hornbeck. After your

period in the United States,

18 did you have any contact with him?.

19

Mr. Espinosa. No. The only time I had contact was when

20 I told you that I went to paris and these people contacted me.

21

Mr. Hornbeck. I am going to get to that, and i want to

22 establish whether or not, during the years that you wererin

enough to really clano

5 down on the people that they should

or should not have in

6 their consulates, and there were so many things to put

7 together over there and it was a very bad situation, and

8 otherwise,

he wouldn't have been there and they hadn't clamped

9 down.

was something going on but he didn't want

wanted somebody else to tell me the whole

15 thing.

16

Mr. Hornbeck. Is there some reason why he didn't want to

anything for money, or what is it?

Mr. Espinosa. He was a bad boy; and do you know what

He was a bad boy. When he used to be a kid, if

13

there was a blind

man crossing a street. with a stick, he would

14 take the stick from the blind man, is that right? That is the

15 kind of thing he would do when he was a kid and man, what he

16

Mr. Hornöeck. Did Cubela say anything about any soviets

17 in Cuba during this conversation?

18

Pir.

Espinosa.

No. They didn't say anything about

19 soviets in Cuba, but blanco --I cannot remember his first

20 name; we used to call him the crazy Blanco --I met him and

21 he was on his way to cuba from Prague, Czechoslovakia, and ie

22 was on his way from Russia to Cuba via Czechoslovakia and

23 Paris and he was the one who mentioned about the Russian

24 technicians; to make sure and to make sure to tell the CIA

25 that if there was going to be any kind of coublecrossing o

were

3 in their particular place.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. All right. How did you know blanco?

5

rir. Espinosa. I knew him from cuba.

6

vir. Hornbeck. And was it just coincidence that blanco

I was coming through paris at the same time that you were there?

8

Mr. Espinosa. I don't know.

9

Mr. Hornbeck. How did he know

how to contact you?

10

Mr. Espinosa. Secause anybody who would come to Paris

11 will always

contact this guy Trasancos; at least this kind of

12 people because we all knew each other from Cuba.

13

Mr. Hornbeck. Had Blanco been with you and Cubela

in

14 activities prior to 1959?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

16

Mr. Hornoeck. When Blanco gave you this particular

17 information about the Soviet technicians, was there anyone

18 else

present during the conversation?

19

Mr. Espinosa. No, it was only he and I.

20

Mr. Hornbeck, were there any conversations between you,

21 Blanco and Robreno in Paris?

22

Mr. Espinosa. No.

23

Mr. Hornbeck. And no conversations betveen you, slanco,

24

and Trasancos?

25

No. But there were conversations between

3

Mr. Espinosa. The one I mentioned before, everything

4 that Cubela told me about the CIA and williamson in Spain he

5 said to me in front of Irasancos.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. Is your testimony that there was then

•an

7 agreement between

the three of you that cubela needed to

8 change his CIA contact?

9

Mr.. Espinosa. I didn't agree to anything. All

I said,

10 was. they landed

the story on me in the middle of my Parisian

11

vacation, and because it was Rolando and it was something that

12 I could have some importance or sense in the future, I came

13 over here and I contacted them the best way I could...

14

Mir. Hornbeck. In other words, you were going to be the

15

messenger for the contacts they felt that they didn't have?

16

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, more or less, that was the idea.

17

vir. Hornbeck. And you then traveled

from Paris to lew

18 York?

19

Mir. Espinosa. That is right.

20

Mir. Hornback. And who pays for your ticket?

21

Mr. Espinosa. If I go to Paris and I live in the States,

22 I have to have a round-trip ticket.

Mir. Espinosa.

He lifted two bans against traveling, and

all the things that I mentioned before.

17

Mr. Hornbeck. You first contacted him, and what did you

18

tell him?

19

Mr. Espinosa. I said, "I have to contact someone in the

20 CIA, and of course I have no idea how to contact anybody."

2.1

So he said, "Okay." He picked up

the telephone and he

22

called somebody in the FBI office

in New York and he sent me

23 to see this fellow.

Mr. Espinosa. I talked to one

6

Mr. Hornbeck.

now much of the cubela's story that you

7 learned in Paris did you relate to him?

8

Mr. Espinosa. Nothing.

9

fir. Horribeck. What did you tell him, basically?

10

Mr. Espinosa. I told him, I guess he must have spoken to

11 Cavasantos before, and I said, "Look, I just came from Europe;

12 there is

something happening and I would have to contact

13 someone in the CIA, and I used to work for them and I was

14

involved in the Bay of Pigs. Anything you want to check what

15

I am

telling you, you can check with that."

16

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you mention Cubela's name to either

17 Cavasantos or to the FBI?

18

Mr. Espinosa. Maybe; I can't say for sure, but maybe.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Your best memory is that you did not

No.

Mr. Espinosa. The meeting took place at the fel office

in lew York, and there was only one person present.

4

Mr.. Hornbeck.

This is someone

from the Agency?

5

Mr. Espinosa. Again, I assume he was.

6

Mr. Hornbeck. Could

you physically describe this

7

individual?

8

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes. He was a man in the late forties or

9 early fifties, gray hair, and he must have been blond, but

10 very heavy

gray at the time, and blue eyes.

11

Mr. Hornbeck. Glasses?

12

Mr. Espinosa. No glasses. Very well fit and very

13 handsome guy.

14

Mr. Hornback.

Approximately how tall and how much did he

15 weigh?

16

Mr. Espinosa. He was, I would say, about 5'10" or 5'11"

17

170 pounds.

18

Mr. Hornbeck. During your conversation with this

individual, did

you relate all of the details of the

very cool, composed man, and ne

3 said "I am going to washington and I will contaci you in the

4

next couple of days or three, mayoe, and mayce we will go to

5 Spain together or somebody will go with you."

6

I was so upset about this that I got a friend of nine in

7 New York, through Senator Javits, to set me a meeting in

8 washington here with some sub-secretary of foreign affairs in

9 charge of the cuban thing, and I never neard

from this

guy and

10 time was

going by, and I told this friend of mine and through

11 Javits he got me to come here and see this zuy,

and I came

12 here and I told him the whole story. And he said, "We will

13 get in touch with you," and they never did.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you have any idea who it was that you

15 met with in

washington?

Mr. Hornbeck. Did you ever keep a diary or on a caro?

Mr. Hornbeck. Do you think that you might be able to do

that?

Mr. Espinosa.

Yes. I would have to call this guy and

trace the thing oack to the time when

24 it happened, but I am sure it can be traced.

Mr. Hornbeck. Your best memory is that it was some

Mr. Espinosa. Yes, it was some official in the state

7 Departinent;

some kind of sub-secretary or something in charge

8 of Cuban

affairs. But I was there and he didn't put me on to

9 some monkay room. I know I saw sonebody, the right person.

10

ir. Hornbeck. I assume that you did wait the two or

11 three days in New York before you contacted your friend to

12 reach Senator Javits?

13

Mr. Espinosa. I waited longer than that. I waited a

14 couple of weeks and nothing happened,

and then I got in

touch

15 with this guy because I knew he is very friendly with davits,

16 and I said, "I know you nave friends in rashington: and all of

17 that, and there is something that I have

to discuss."

18

vir. hornbech. Did you ever think about contacting the

19 CIA directly through one e:

your old contacts?

20

Mr. Espinosa. I never had any contacts. What contacos?

21 They are guys living in Miami for two or three or four months,

22 and one day they disappear, and "Freddy Gomez," and

you never

23 see him again, and maybe he

is

sent to Guatemala or central

Mr. Espinosa. Let me make a parenthesis now. This guy,

14 one of the reasons why I assumed he must

have been from the

15 CIA, is when I touched the thing about George Robreno,

16 immediately he said to me, "El Maga," this is like a name that

17 only people that are close to him or that know him very well

18 or fron the Agency would know his name.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Could you spell that?

20

Mr. Espinosa. M-a-g-a. It is magician in English.

And

21 he didn't have any accent when he said "El Maga."

11 did you have any information about him personally or about the

Mr. Espinosa. Mothing whatsoever. In my mind I thought,

14. well, probably he got wise to the whole thing and just dropped

15 it, because some tine elapsed between

the time that I spoke to

16 his people in Paris and until the CIA and the time he dot

17 caught in Cuba.

from some public source or from a personal

Public source.

was somebody else arrested. And the first thing I read

about

2 it, there were four people arrested, and I knew blanco and

3 didn't know the others.

4

Mr. Hornbeck. I am sure then if you have the public

5 accounts of that trial, you know that cubela was not executed,

6 and dia you find that a strange event?

7

Mr. Espinosa. Yes and no.

8

vir. Hornbeck. Can you tell us way "yes" and "no?

9

Mr. Espinosa. "Yes," because, to iny knowledge, Castro

10 had never commuted

anybody's death sentence in Cuba yet, and

11 on the other hand, I knew he liked the guy very much.

12

Mr. Hornbeck.

It was a personal relationship between

13 Cubela and Castro?

14

lir. Espinosa.

Yes. Whatever it was, love, hate, or the

15 faggots --I don't know what it was -- out they had a

16 relationship, an

especial relationship between them.

17

vir. Hornbeck.. Can you give us any examples of a special

18 relationship between the two?

19

Mr. Espinosa. Well, I remember one time when Rolando

20 pulled a gun on Castro in front of his bodyguards and

21 everything and called hin every name in the book, and of

22 course nobody moved or said anything, but i thought when this

23. is over, he is going to 50 to

the can

forever, and nooning

24 happened to him.

4 alive and he is in prison.

5

Mr. Hornbeck.

Were you told of the method by which

6 Cubela was supposed to assassinate Castro?

7

Nr. Espinosa. Mo. I heard the story about the rifle

8 the telescopic site, and i had a story that he had met Artime,

9

walen of course I thought was stupid of him, and I had a story

10 that Artime had promised hin some boats through the cIA to get

11 him out.

12

I repeat to you today what I said the other day, the

13 whole thing doesn't make sense to me. And on one hand I hear

14 this, and of course it is very difficult to judge something

15 when you are being told by third parties, and on the one hand

16 I near that there is going to be an

insurrection, let others

17 call it that way, or a military uprising of certain

people

in

18 the country; and on the other hand I hear that Cubela is going

19

to shoot the guy. And if you are goins to shoot the guy and

20 there is going to be an insurrection, why do you need some

to take you out?

7

Mr. Hornbeck..

When you heard these stories about Artine

8 being involved, or a rifle with a scope being involved, what

9 was the source of that information?

10

Mr. Espinosa. This I heard from

Rocreno.

11 Mr. Hornbeck. Was this during the same discussions in

12 Paris before New York?

13

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

14

Mr. Hornbeck. Did Rubreno know Artime, to your

15 knowledge?

16

Mir. Espinosa. I don't know. I think maybe he was with

17 Rolando when he

had the meeting with Artime; maybe, but 1 am

18 not sure. But I know they had never been friends before.

19

Mr. Hornbeck. Are you saying your information

from

20 Rubreno was that Artime met in Madrid with Cubela?

21

Mr. Espinosa..I can't remember if it was Madrid, but

22 positively that he had

met Cubela.

and he had been in touch with artime, but at the

3 moment I was led

to believe

it was the CIA who had arranged

4 the meeting, and I would have been surprised if that ias so.

Mr. Hornbeck. I want to be very specific as io tre

6 information that you are getting iron hoorano and irom any

7 other source.

8

Mr. Espinosa. Yes.

9

vir. Hornbeck.

So just getting back to what me told you,

10 Robreno says to you, on the one hand Cubela has been in

touch

• 11 with williamson

from the CIA, and he also tells you Cubela has

12 met with Artime, and you are not sure whether rubreno tells

you that cubela

and Artime met in Madrid. Is that a correct

14

summary?

15

Mr. Espinosa. Yes. He told me that they met, but

16 can't remember inether it was in Madrid or another place.

17

Mr. hornbeck. Has there anything about the use of a

18 rifle and a silencer by cubela that you would have found

19 strange in

an assassination plot to kill Castro?

20

Mr. Espinosa. I would have found it very strange because

21 Castro is

a touch guy and you can never hunt him with a rifle

22 in the sense you never know where he is going to be or whieh

23 street he is going

to be passing through. So I would think it

24 is very, very unlikely, and

especially Rolando knows this very

25

well, better than I do, that this is a kind of a guy that

Mr. Hornbeck. would the special relationnie you

5

Mr. Espinosa. Incredibly special opportunities;

exceptionally special.

7

vir. hornbeck. Can you dive us something on that?

8

Mr. Espinosa.

Let us say one day Rolando could find out

9 that Castro was

in his home outside Havana, and he could

nave

10 gone over there at a day or night, and even at 5:00 o'clock in

11 the morning and tell the guards "I am going to see Castro,"

12 and they would have let him in without objection.

11 Raphael was Iraificante's lawyer in Cuba; now he gets caught

people are speculating about, or told me at the time.

he was
