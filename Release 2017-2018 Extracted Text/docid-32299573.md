Determine, if possible, if subject BRUNO is receiving

Justification: (Comment on necessity, desirability, productivity, possibility of embarrassment to Bureau.

If necessary continue on extra page.)

In Philadelphia report dated December 31, 1962, is

set forth that information has been received from PH 614-C-TE

that subject BRUNO, who is considered to be a member of the

Commission, uses CHARLES DELMONICO's address

It is felt

that this cover should be placed because of the

high position subject BRUNO holds among racket figures in

to the Bureau.
