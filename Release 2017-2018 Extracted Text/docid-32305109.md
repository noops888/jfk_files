JOSEPH BLUMETTI, & Jeansters Union representative

was recontacted, however no information oe developed concerning

the bozbing. BLUMETTI stated Mes. CAVALIARO had called hig

office several times, so he recently stopped by to see her and

stated she is still in mourning, dresses in black, and talks as

though the bombing only occurred "yesterday".

She advised him the

boy that was Injured received psychiatric treatment, and has become

a problem to her.

She staied she called BLUNENTI for a job for

her oldest son,

as he was only earning 90¢ per hour,

and he was

anlo tn set the boy's probation period in his current employment

saivad,

further

and is now on the union, scale of $1.95 per hour. She

advised BLUMETTI that there is & threatened foreclosure

o? her hoze, as she is behind in her bank payments, and the under-

taker and the doctors have filed liens on the home, for which she

is very bonzied.

In the meantime, at 6;00 o'clock there were people coming home

from work.

•It is to be noted the CAVALLARO bombing took place at

about 11:20 AM, 11/23/62.

The bomb was placed in CAVALLARO's

1956 Ford which was parked in the private garage at the rear of

che CAVATIARO home at 164 Roslyn Dr., Youngstown, where CAVALLARO

had parked the car at about 5:00 PM, 11/21/62.

It is further

to be noted the highest point of the rubble which remained from

the car and the brick garage, was not higher than three feet from

the level of the ground in any place, as all was completely

demolished.

The blast also blew a hole in the concrete floor of

the garage to a depth of two feet.

Had DITTA been in the car or in the garage as he

stated, he too would have been blown up with the victims.

•DITTA

also mentioned CAVALLARO coming from the right,

which would have

been true, however he mentioned CAVALLARO with

a flashlight, which

would not

have been necessary at that time in the morning. It is

true, people would have been coming home from work at 6:00 o'clock,

and it would have been dark at that time, should he have set the

the bombing would not have

occurred at that time.

DIITA also mentioned a bus passing,

and it

is to be noted Chat Roslyn Drive is a rather narrow residential

street, and buses do not use this street for travel.

Summarizing the above, even though the name of CHARLIE

•CAVALIARO was mentioned,

it does not appear that they were talking

of the CAVALLARO bombing; or DITTA is purposely boasting, or changing

the facts for purpose of conversation.

home, and HAVILION told PCI of her "treatment" administered by

ARMSTEAD, PCI stated HAMILION looked very pale, and HAMILION

told her she was very weak when she leît ARMSTEAD'S

orders were to go home and stay in bed for three days to prevent

excessive hemorrhaging, and HOLOVATICH was going to spend this

It is expected that with these photographs and after

to induce her to cooperate and provide information of interest

to the Bureau.

This sane information can also be used in future

interviews with Ds. ARMSTEAD.
