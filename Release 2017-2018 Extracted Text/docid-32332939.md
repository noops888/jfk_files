FROM: SAC, PITTSBURGH (92-226)

SUBJECT: SEBASTIAN JOHN LA ROCCA, aka.;

ReBuairtel to New York, captioned, "CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE

PROGRAM,", dated 2/15/61.

PG 585-C has advised that FRANCES PRIAM, former paramour of LA

ROCCA, is now doing a fairly good business as a medium-priced

prostitute in the Baum Blvd., area of Pittsburgh, where' she is

operating with a girlfriend

who has not been exposed to the

rackets.

This informant advised that the Phoenix Motel at

Monroeville,

Pa., which is operated by MIKE GENOVESE, Pittsburgh,

and National Top Hoodlum, who is the protege of LA RoccA, has

become virtually flooded

with prostitutes who are working on

independent basis with the approval of GENOVESE who ostensibly

has the approval of LA ROCCA.

appear to be extremely active because a free-food spread, buffet

style, is laid out by the motel management for all of the drinking

customers.

Local racket men seeking action prefer this night of

the week and most have light dinners so that they can gorge

themselves with Italian del√©cacies from about 10:30 P.M., to

2:00 A.M.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT TO

KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE MAY BE

ARMED

AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
