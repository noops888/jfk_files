MEMORANDUM

SUBJECT: Frank FIORISI - STURGIS"

Following is information from further review of FlORINI's

official file in response to Daniel E. Schultz' inquiry to

the Agency

dated 27 September 1973:

There are four volumes to FlORiNi's 201 file, the

majority of its content being reports from the fBl dated

from 1958 through April 1969.

Agency information includes a cable from Santiago de Cuba

dated 7 January 1959 stating FIORINI clains to be chief of

26 July Arms buyer Miani and willing cooperate 100 percent.

in supplying info. Cable stated it possible FIORINI nay lose

value to rebels but believe worthwhile CIA endorse his staying

on.

Mas CIA replied that FlORINT had been under fBI

investigation for possible registration act violations and

base should deal with FIORINI under strict

covér:

and not make any connitments which might later be construed

as USCOVT approval his activities. "Wish to reiterate here

that FIORINI was never employed by the CIA.

The following is sorthy of note. FIORINI was involved

in Nov/Dec 61 leaflet dropping flights over Cuba. The FBI

queried CIA about allegations that the flights by FIORINI and

Alexander RORE, Jr., were ontirely supported by CIA with CIA

arranging Air/Sea rescuo, and that all of FIORiNI!s actions

were known to CIA Miami and his activities being done on CrA

instructions,

Ngs CiA was satisfled allegations not true but

troubled in view fact FlORINT was in contact with Cia rep

Florida who used name "Barker" who supposedly gave FlORINI

phonc number for clA Miami office.

FIoRINt was to call this

number if he was arrested or stopped on flights and clA would

"got him out". These Cuban overflights were not authorized

by CIA and the FBT was alerted to fact it was not CIA

operation. (BARKIR was gencrully known in Miami Cuban exile

community as i ClA source.) Since BARKER was a close friend

of FIORINI, BARKER, shortly before the Bay of Pigs Invasion,

was asked hy CIA to attempt to obtain from FIORINI information

concerning FIORINI's activities. BARKER met with FIORINI

several times a month from fall of G1 to July 62: BARKER

insisted when queried by CIA

case officer, that he never

revealed classified info or operational duta including INWAVE

phone numbers to FIORINI. FIORiNI told BARKER that the

leaflec op was conceived by Sergio ROJAS. A llas cable to

JAWAVE dated. July 1062 stated that ROJAS had been non-operational

since Feb. 62.
