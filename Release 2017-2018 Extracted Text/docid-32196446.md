"An informant of unconfirned reliability who is an

officer in a surplus small arms company, advised the office.

Spl Munitions Control on December 1o, 1903,

that he was in

possession of firm evidence-that the ammunition used to

W/ assassinate President KINNEDY was imported into the United

Security Act of 1954, as amended.

"The informant

stated that the annunition had been

positively identified as

Winchester Western 6.5 mn. (Italian);

that the ammunition was manufactured by Winchester in 1951-2;

and that it was furnished to the Government of Greece under

the Greek Aid Program in 1952 or 1953. Further, the informant

stated that two lots of this ammunition were exported from Greece

to Canada by & Greek national named FONTINELLIS who was acting

as an agent for International Firearms, Montreal, Canada. He

advised that Mr. SUCHER is the principal stockholder in

International Firearms Company:

The informant continued that

one of the two lots of the subject ammunition was sent from

greece to Canada after February 1, 1962.

The informant

alleges that this ammunition was imported into the United

States in contravention to the section of the law that

restricts the return to the United States for resale any

ammunition

of United States manufacture furnished to foreign governments by

the United States under any foreign assistance program. He further

alleges that there was no other ammunition of this type available

not that thor: the no

in the United States,

as it was manufactured specifically for the

Greek Government under the Greek Ald Progran.

has reason to believe that the ammunition was imported from

Canada under the provision of the International Traffic in
