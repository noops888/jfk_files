17. Remarks (By SAC):

It is recommended that this surveillance be maintained

for an additional period of 90 days and such will be done UACB.

Attention is drawn to the fact that although the general quality

and quantity of information received from this source has greatly

hoodlums and their associates and activities.

In addition, there is

no expense involved in monitoring this source in that the

employees who monitor the other surveillances

easily monitor this source. Further, it does

not appear that there

is

any particular risk involving the security of this source at Celano's,

except that risk which would be inherent in making an entry to

retrieve the source.
