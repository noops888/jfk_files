JER Law 11(a)

On May 12, 1965, PG 704-C-TE advised

SAW.B. ANDERSON, JR., as follows:

Informant was asked to explain what the real

reason was for MEYER SIGAL's refusal to give evidence

against POSSINO. Informant said that he had previously

withheld this information from the contacting agent

because of its nature but things had reached

the

point pow where he had to divulge it.

He said that

SONNY

CIANCUTTI had come to see MEYER SIGAL

15 or

20 times on behalf. of the New Kensington

people who wanted to be sure SIGAL was not going

to

talk about POSSINO.

He said, in addition, KELLY

MANNARINO had come to see SIGAL four or five times

On each occasion, SIGAL told the informant

that MANNARINO had threatened him with harm if he

said anything at all about POSSINO. Informant said

that on the last occasion, which is about ten days

earlier, MANNARINO had, after leaving SIGAL, come

to the informant, stuck his finger in his chest and said,

"You see that that Jew bastard

partner of yours

doesn't unload on POSSINO or I'm

in one of his orange juice tanks foing to put him

Informant said he

talked with SIGAL and from the

tone of SIGAL's conversation, SIGAL believed

MANNARINO and his threats.

Informant said that MEYER SIGAL is well known

pa

to KELLY MANNARINO, has known him for at least 25

years.

He said that at one time about 25 years ago, when MEYER

was

getting started out in the numbers business, he worked

in a numbers office owned and controlled by KELLY MANNARINO.

Informant said that so far as MEYER SIGAL's

getting the "call" in 1962 from IRS employees about

IRS raids, he wanted to offer the suggestion that

wo men, SKIPPY WOODS and MIKE SIMON, were splitting

their play between the SIGAL, PARROTTO. SARKIS book

on 5/24/65, was conducted by SAS SAMUEL A.

This report has been delayed due to the pre-

occupation of the preparing Special Agent with other

pressing matters in connection with the Criminal

Intelligence Program.

During the period of this report, close

liaison has been maintained with Intelligence Division,

IRS, Pittsburgh, Pa., which is currently conducting

an investigation regarding this subject:

By airtel to the Bureau, 8/4/64, captioned,

"NY 3936-0,"

the New York Office set out the following

information:

Informant advised that he was attempting to

obtain a Teamster pension loan for the LEONE Brothers in

Detroit through an individual named LENNY CIFFONE.

He

stated that both the LEONE Brothers and CIFFONE are

Mich

controlled by racketeers.

Informant advised that

CIFFONE advanced him $10,000 to facilitate the loan

and the informant did attempt to get this loan from

the Teamsters.

He said that CIFFONE did not actually

get the loan and consulted a lawyer to secure the

return of his $10,000. Informant said that when he was

contacted by CIFFONE's lawyer, he brought this matter

to the attention of

• SALLYXCELEMBRINO and EDDYLANZIERRI

PA

N.V

both of whom are subjects of criminal intelligence

investigations in the New York Office. CELEMBRINO told

him that he would go to Pittsburgh and attempt to get

this matter straightened out.

Informant had mentioned

other matters to CELEMBRINO previously, which concerned

him and CELEBRINO had told him on two other occasions

that he would be leaving for Pittsburgh at 3:00 AM, on a

particular Friday morning to go to Pittsburgh.

informant said that when he had mentioned his

troubles on

previous occasions, and CELEMBRINO had told him he would

take the matter up

• in Pittsburgh, he did not believe him

and placed no importance on CELEMBRINO's statements:

He stated, however, that this time CELEMBRINO invited him

to accompany CELEMBRINO and LANZIERRI to Pittsburgh."

Informant advised that they departed from

downtown New York at 3:00 AM in a Cadillac owned by

ROCCOXDO CANDIA.

CELEBRINO, LANZIERRI and the informant

drove directly to New Kensington, Pa., to the home of

JOEXROSA, arriving there at 10:50 AM,

on July 31, 1964.

He stated they drove Into ROSA's garage and CELEMBRINO

brought him into the house where he met ROSA, his son,

JOE, JR., and his daughter-in-law.

About one-half hour

later GABRIEL, "KELLY" MANNARINO came to ROSA's house.

The informant met MANNARINO and was explaining the

Detroit loan situation to him when JOEXSICA arrived

_ PA

at ROSA's house.

MANNARINO indicated to the informant

that they would handle a settlement in this matter

and they were very upset with CIFFONE for the manner

in which he handled this deal, in that he hired a lawyer

to attempt to get his money back rather than go through

channels.

During the course of some small talk which

took plae later, MANNARINO told

the informant that he

had just arrived from "the farm" where he had stayed

two nights with RUSSELL BUFFALINO and LOUIS VOLPE.

MANNARINO said that BUFFALINO has a "kid" who is a

relative of his, and is attempting to gain admission to

the Pennsylvania Bar.

This relative of BUFFALINO is

afraid he might be rejected by the Bar Association be-

cause he had some trouble in New York. MANNARINO

told the informant that a judge in New Kensington is

attempting to influence the Bar Association on behalf

of this relative of BUFFALINO.

Informant advised that at this time during

the course of the conversation, it became apparent

that

SALLY CELEMBRINO was accepted by all of the individuals

there as an equal and a close associate, but that himself

and EDDY LANZIERRI

were more or less treated as outsiders.

(It should be noted that SALLY CELEMBRINO has been

identified as a "captain" in the VITO GENOVESE "Family".)

At this time, JOHNALA ROCCA arrived at ROSA's

nouse with another Individual whom the Informant describea

as a young man who controls jukeboxes, not in the Pittsburgh

N

area.

Informant said LA ROCCA referred to this young man

as a fellow Calabrese.

This young individual told the

informant tht he had driven 50 miles from his home to

ROSA's house.

CELEMBRINO asked LA ROCCA and the individual

who was with him if they knew a person named "Levy" in

Reading, Pa.

The informant therefore surmised that possibly

the person with LA ROCCA had driven from Reading, Pa.

Informant advised they had put their car in

the

garage.

As each individual arrived, JOE ROSA's

son, rather than leave their cars in front of the house,

would drive them to a gas station close to the house

which was located just off Route 22.

He stated that

three of the visitors. cars were parked in the rear of

this gas station.

Informant advised that they ate

lunch and JOE ROSA and LA ROCCA excused themselves

during lunch and carried on a whispered

conversation in

the adjoining living-room.

After lunch, CELEMBRINO Invited LANZIERRI

and the informant

to ride to an amusement park which

he said was owned by LOUIS and JOHNVOLPE. This

PA

amusement park was located between ROSA'S

house and

the Adrilee Motor Hotel, and was approximately a ten

minute drive from ROSA's house.

When they arrived

at the amusement park, RAY (LNU) told CELEMBRINO that

JOHN VOIPE was in Pittsburgh and LOUISXVOLPE had left pA

that day for Florida.

Then they drove to the Adrilee Motor Hotel,

Route 30, Irwin, Pa., and CELEMBRINO introduced FRANK

PA

KAMATO to the informant and told the informant that AMATO

owned® Adrilee.

During a conversation with AMATO, he

said he had put $165,000 in cash in this motor hotel,

and would be willing

to sell it for $50,000 above the

mortgage.

AMATO said he is unable to get a buyer for the

place because of all the unfavorable publicity he is

receiving.

After they left the Adrilee, CELEMBRINO told

the informant that if business does not pick up, AMATO

1s going to run a dice or card game at the place in

order to make it pay for ltself.

They then drove back

tO JOE ROSA's house.

About one

hour later, FRANK AMATO

arrived at JOE ROSA's house, being driven

there by an

individual who did not come

into the house. During the

at ROSA's house:

CELEMBRINO

LANZIERRI

FRANK AMATO

KELLY MANNARINO

JOHN LA ROCCA

JOE ROSA, SR.

JOE ROSA, JR.

JOE SICA

(And the individual who claimed to control the

jukebox industry).

Prior to dinner, LA ROCCA told MANNARINO to

go to the airport and pick up the people from Detroit

who were flying in.

After MANNARINO departed, LA ROCCA

told the informant tha the man who was coming from

Detroit was young but he should be extremely polite to

him since he was very Important.

While awaiting dinner, CELEMBRINO, LANZIERRI,

the informant and JOE ROSA, drove to the Holiday House.

JOE ROSA, JR. told the informant that the owner of the

Holiday House was in very serious trouble and his father

straightened out this trouble.

As a result of this

OSA, SR. now exercises control over the management of

the Holiday House.

Informant was unable to determine 1f.

JOE ROSA, SR., actually owns the Holiday House or 1s

able to obtain favors there. While there, MANNARINO

arrived and stated that the people from Detroit did not

arrive at the airport.

He then placed a call to Detroit

from a public telephone and MANNARINO discussed this

problem of the $10, 000 on the telephone with the individual

he spoke to in Detroit.

He told this person that he

should arrive with LENNY CIFFONE in Pittsburgh on the

9:45 PM flight on that date (7/31/64). When they arrived

back at ROSA's house, MANNARINO told LA ROCCA that he

had spoken to Detroit and was told that they would arrive

on the 9:45 flight and would abide by any decision he

(MANNARINO) made.

During the course of the dinner, MANNARINO asked

the informant where he could get rid of $1,000 bills.

The informant told MANNARINO he could get him in touch with

someone in Europe who could handle this

contract.

MANNARINO told the informant that "they" had a friend in

Europe who had purchased a Swiss bank,

is presently in trouble concerning fraudulent bonds, so

they can't use him.

Informant told MANNARINO that if

MANNARINO would give him the serial numbers on the $1,000

bills, he would verify that the bills were legitimate

and would then proceed to attempt to exchange these bills.

Source stated he wanted the serial numbers to avoid

embarrassment should the bills be counterfeit. He

asked MANNARINO for ten $1,000 bills which he would

attempt to exchange for him and MANNARINO stated he would

have to talk to somebody before furnishing these bills

to the informant.

Informant advised that during the

dinner, they were joined by another individual whom he

could only describe as young, Spanish in appearance, scar

on his left cheek.

MANNARINO stated during the dinner that he has

the police

chief in Pittsburgh,

and the police chief in

home area

"In his pocket."

JOE ROSA, JR. told the

informant that he always

carries a card in his wallet

which was issued by a police official and 1f he is stopped

for a traffic violation or any other offense, he simply

flashes the card and is not bothered any further by

the police.

After dinner the informant told LA ROCCA that

he could not wait in Pittsburgh for the arrival of the

people from Detroit, since he had to return to New York

to pick up his children.

LA ROCCA told him not to worry

about the $10,000 since the problem would be settled.

He further told the informant that he thought the informant

"had guts" and he would like to see him again either in

Pittsburgh or in New York.

flight back to New York. CELEMBRINO told the informant

that he would drive the Cadillac back to New York since

he liked to drive. He told the informant that he was a

"wheel man for CAPONE in Chicago and likes to keep in practice."
