stated that) JUAN DOMINGuEZ and MARCO RODRIGUEZ, two anti-CASTRO

Cuban exiles from Miami, also went to Venezuela (with hinto(s)

that shortly after he arrived in Venezucla, hewent to chile

in February and rented an apartment for the use of DOMINGUEZ

and RODRIGUEZ. He was in Chile for two or three days. CABALA (S)

was unable to recall the location of that apartment.

ZABALA

added that shortly after this, VECIANA and' à Cuban exile named

NAPOLI, drove to Chile from Bolivia with the guns and grenades

to be used in the attempt.

The arms were hidden under the back

seat of a United States Embassy car VECIANA used to transport

the arms.

The arms were later hidden in a closet of the

apartment and NAPOLI and VECIANA returned to Bolivia. The two

cameramen went to Chile in July to await CASTRO's arrival.
