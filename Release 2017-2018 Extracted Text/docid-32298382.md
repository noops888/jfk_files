Re: SECRET ORGANIZATION OF CONTINENTAL ACTION (OSAC)

KOn September 17, 1964, MM I-4 a representative k

of another government agency which conducts intelligence

Investigations, advised that the DRE in the Dominican

Republic 1s operating a location about 100 miles from

where the Spanish ship was attacked. However, at this

responsible for the attack of the Spanish ship el,

M I-Yadvised that the MR has been operatingle

sgainst the south coast of Cuba and that an operation in

the Bahamas would be too far for the MR's PI boats (alM,

MM I licontinued that there is speculation thatle

the Cuban government may have been responsible for the

attack to bring pressure on the Dominican Republic to review

its position in allowing Cuban exiles to operate out of

that country. MM T continued that it is also interesting

to note that

the three persons killed on the Spanish vessel

were the top echelon of officers - the Captain, Second Mate

and Third Engineer and of the persons wounded were the Chief

Engineer, Second Engineer and Radio Operator. *MM T-4†stated e]

there is some speculation that because the officers of the ship

surfered so many casualities there may have been an internal

problem with the ship's crewx (M)

Oi September 17, 1964, MM I-5, a Cuban National who

has been involved In Cuban Revolutionary activities for

the past seven years, said that Juan Mesa Rodriguez, head of

Secret Organization of Continental Action, on September 16g

1964, claimed his organization was responsible for the attack

against this Spanish ship and that the attacking boats left

from Florida. *(M)

MM T-S advised there was no evidence to support this

claim, however, Mesa has been interested in attempting such an

operation as this, and about one month ago was trying to obtain:

a small attack-type of boat AXM)

IN I-68

a Cuban exile active in anti-Castro organi-

zations, advised that Cuban exile groups seriously doubt that

Mesa's organization presently has equipment, money, knowhow and

connections to effect such an atrack Kim)
