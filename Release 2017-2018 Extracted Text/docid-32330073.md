There is enclosed for the Director's information a detailed

memorandum concerning Masferrer which includes information concerning

his background, Government attempts to remove him from the Miami area,

and a summary of the various investigations the Bureau has conducted

of him.

Of primary interest is the present status of the current

neutrality case against Masferrer. Briefly, the facts of the case are:

On 10-4-60, 27 men invaded Cuba from the United States and these men

were either killed or imprisoned by the Cuban Government.

Upon

authorization of the Department, we investigated this incident and

established that Masferrer was behind it and on interview Masferrer

admitted his participation.

During interviews Masferrer told Bureau Agents he would

cease all operations if requested by the United States Government.

We

furnished this information to State, the Attorney General and Central

Intelligence Agency on 11-30-60. On 12-30-60, State asked us to contact

Masferrer and take him up on his offer but we refused on ground we

had no legal basis to act. We have had no indication that any

representative from State or Central Intelligence Agency has contacted

Masferrer concerning his offer.

An informant

reported on 12-30-60 that Masferrer is broke and his group disbanded.

General Yeagley conferred with the Director concerning the feasibility

of prosecution. The Director pointed out the anti-Castro feelings

diplomatic relations with Cuba and

suggested that befoictaking any action Justice
