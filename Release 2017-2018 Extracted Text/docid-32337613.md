She is to remain indefinitely in Cuba. DI. LASTRA

is the only relative in the United States. He recalled that

she conversed with a representative of the U. S. Govt. re

some matter re a person in Cuba but he did not know the details

of the conversation. Dr. LASTRA stated that Mr. JACK EVERHART,

an acquaintance of source, may have info re the matter in reairtel.

on 10/2/61, MT. JACK EVERHART, 13140 SW O2nd Ave.,

Miami, advised that he

1s a close acquaintance of the CIA

source (SERAFINA GIQUEI" He said that she reported to him the

info she had furnished to CIA in 6/61. He stated that the

individual's name was not AMUCHASTAGUI but MARIO GARCIA INCHAUSTEGUI,

the Cuban representative toethe United Nations. He did not

remember the exact info concerning INCHAUSTEGUI, other than

the fact that he was to arrive in the U. S. and

cause trouble.

Details of how he was to cause this trouble was not recalled

by EVERHART.

He said that the CIA source, (GIQUEl, does have

many contacts in Cuba and any info she

may

have furnished, in

his opinion, would be fairly reliabled

Miami indices show MARIO GARCIA INCHAUSTEGUI was

Cuban Ambassador to Montevideo. See Miami letter to Bureau,

2/2/61, captioned "MARIA DEL CARMEN RODRIGUEZ CASANOVA, aka.

IS - CUBA"

Enclosed with letter was a "List of Cuban Foreign

Service Offices Abroad". INCHAUSTEGUI's name appears on pages

74 and 96. Miami indices also show MARIO GARCIA INCHAUSTIGUI

as a member of the Cuban Mission to the United Nations with the

rank of Ambassador. See Miami teletype to Bureau and N. Y.

dated 7/29/61, captioned*"Cuban Mission to United Nations,

-Investigator MICHAEL REDMON, INS, Miami, advised

10/2/61, that INS files contain no info re INCHAUSTEGUI.

It is apparent that INCHAUSTEGUI is not identical to

DOMINGO AMUCHASTEGUI ALVAREZ and Washington Field should remove

stop placed with the central office of INS.
