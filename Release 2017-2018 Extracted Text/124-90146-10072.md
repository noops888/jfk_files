The following information was furnished by a

confidential

source abroad on february 4, 1912:

According to the source, a pro-Palestinian orcanization

called the Palestine Comnittee-Brussels was organized during

1970 within the Belgian National Palestine Comittee for the

purpose of supporting Palestinian revolutionary activitles.

The Brussels Connittee was headed by Lue Dupiro, a Delgian

national born on April 9, 1942, at Haine St. Paul, and the

National Palestine Connittee by Aron Raindorf, & Belgian citizen

born on Decembor 22, 1919, at St. Gilles.

Following a period during which the two groups

worked in harnony, a schism took place in November, 1971, which

resulted in a new group being formed by Dupire and

Yvonne

which was called The Responsible Group for the National

Palestinian Committee and the Palestinian Committee-Brussels

without other members of either group being consulted.

Balndorf,

according to the source, is currently attempting to regain

control over divergent elements and to restore order to the.

groups involved.

In this connection, Raindorf traveled te London where

he remained from December 26

through Decenber 28, 1971, and

met with one Gibson, described only as an American Negro Journallst

and with an individual known as Manchanda, described as being

of Fakistant origin.

The source indicated Manchands is probably

identical to Albert

Manchanda, a British citizen born on

April 9, 1919, 1n India:

Raindorf also traveled to Beirut,

Lebanon, on January 20, 1972, and to Damascus, Syria, to meet

with elements of the Fath and

the O.L.P. which

were not further

Reference is made to your informal memorandum

S.

reports covering contacts of Sugar during his visit to the

United States, September 34, 1970, to October 11,: 1970.

In accordance with your request, the following

comments on and evaluations relating to the validity and

usefulness of the information in the reports are set forth:

1.

Sugar's recent presence in the United States

was reported by two sources of this Bureau.

These sources

expressed no suspicions relating to his activity or cover.

2.

Based upon preliminary review, the information

provided by Sugar appears accurate and generally conforms to

information independently reported

by our sources.

Slight

distortions noted were in accord with existing rumor or "talk't

within domestic

movement circles.

01

3.

The information provided by Sugar is considered

good intelligence value,

but not in itself of high or

exceptional value.

It confirms and supports information

developed by Bureau sources and in several instances

provides

current assessments and useful investigative leads.

4.

Sugar's obvious close association with Richard

Ward (indicated

in reports S-52 and S-56) would appear to offer

hin an opportunity to establish a stringer relationship with

the weekly New York City left-oriented "Guardian," in the

event this is in accord with the projection of his cover.

Ward, in spite of criticism of the "Guardian," continues to

be included as a staff member in the publication's masthead

and his articles continue to be published.

Although the

"Guardiag" has a united Kingdom address (13 wood Ride, orpingto

Kent), no London correspondent is listed in its masthead.

Ward and Wilfred Burchette (current "Guardian" Paris repro-

Republic of North Vietnam representation in Paris and would

appear to be in a position to provide an entree for Sugar

to the North Vietnamese.

5.:. The detailed information furnished by Sugar

relating to Ward (report S-56) suggests Ward as a likely

candidate for approach.

Our files indicate Sugar has been

acquainted with Ward since 1967.

We would very much appreciate

receiving a current personality assessment of Ward by Sugar.

Your interest in referring the reports of Sugar to

this Bureau is appreciated.

Sugar is CIA cryptonym for Richard Gibson who operates

in behalf of CIA from London, furnishing coverage of European

black extremists.

The 29 reports

furnished by the Agency on 10/29/70 covering Sugar's contacts

"Guardian!'

He was in contact with the North Vietnamese

Diplomatic Mission in Paris in 5/70 and traveled thereafter

to Hanoi and Laos for a five-week visit.

According to the

• information made available by Sugar, Ward is critical of the

"Guardian," the Soviets, and

members of the New Left in this

country.

He is currently doing research on a book about

American-Vietnamese relations and he claims this book will be

him, looking towards his development as an informant.

GIBSON mentioned to the informants that he had recently

been in Amman, Jordan where he spoke with GEORGE HABASH,

leader

of the popular tront for the liberation of Palestine. GIBSON

indicated that HABASH was a strong leader; whereas, ARAFAT was weak

and prone to compromise.

GIBSON mentioned that DAVIDA FINEMAN a leader of the

Revolutionary Union stopped in Belgium (probably in January, 191)

Algiers, Algeria in December, 1969 where she contacted SERGE

(Possibly SERGE PATROUX, a Belgium communist) in an effort to

purchase some firearms.!

According to GIBSON, SERGE would not assis:

JINEMAN in obtaining the firearms because she mentioned the name

Of RENE RAINDORE, a Belgium communist who has been active in the

cause of Palestine Liberation.

London, WI2 SNA

19 September 1970

Dear Herb and Comrades,

Just a hasty note to let you know that René and

Gilbert have recently returned from Amman wich news

about the desperately critical

situation chere. Never-

theless, we believe the situation is excellent for the

revolutionary forces, despite the seemingly crushing

weight of the reactionary, imperialist forces.

Throughout Europe, initiatives are being made

by comrades, especially

in regard to Arab embassies,

needling them of coaxing them to show solidarity with

the Palestinians or demonstrating against the most

reactionary (e.&. the Jordan Embassy here was occupied

by students yesterday).

Cables, letters and personal

calls are being made to Arab governments and their

diplomats throughout Europe, and the Iragi and Syrians

shared for their inactivaty, despite all

• their past

verbal support of the Palestinian Revolution.

It would

be especially useful foï you comrades in the States to

inform René and me of any accivity that you are engaged

in on Palestine and please send us for republication

texts of any statements, cables, etc.

Manu and Diane send you fraternal greetings.

They

are now married, by the way; and await reinforcement in

the revolutionary ranks in December.

There is a possibility I might make it to the states

sometime this fall. If so, I vill try to come to Chicago

to give you a first-hand report on the situation in these

parts, as well as the Middie East.

Fraternally yours,

Captioned individual, a Negro male, who was formerly active

in the U.S, as a leader of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, currently

serves as a CIA informant based in England. He operates under the cover

of "overseas representative and correspondent" for "Negro Press

International," which is allegedly a Chicago-based firm. From his

residence in London, Gibson furnishes coverage of European and Third

World New Leftists and black nationalists.

CIA has advised Gibson will be in the U.S. for consultations

with the Agency, during the period 9/20-10/18/70. During this period it

is anticipated Gibson will visit New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Atlanta,

Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Philadelphia to visit old contacts and

to "become reacquainted with the scene in the United States. "

he will probably be in contact with the pro-Chicom Revolutionary Union in

San Francisco and Leibel Bergman and Davida Fineman who are asso.

He very likely will endeavor to contact the

This article was obtained by our Legal Attache,

theoretical leader of the militant Maoist San Francisco-based

Revolutionary Union, according to a source who has furnished

reliable information

time, Davida Fineman, also a member of the Revolutionary Union

(and

the former paramour of Gibson), defended Gibson, repeatedly

stating the charges against him were unfounded and the

"same

old stuff."

Nevertheless, Bergman at the time persisted in

his suspicion of Gibson (5)

As a matter of additional interest,

in February,

1970, Bergman commented that during his travel the previous

month abroad, he had met with Gibson in London and stayed

overnight at the Gibson residence.

At this time, Bergman

stated he found Gibson to be charming, likable, sophisticated,

intelligent, but hung up on a feeling of self-importance.

Bergman described Gibson as doing "good work," but stated

Gibson is not as important as he belleves (5)

From the above it would appear Bergman, who may be

described as an astute tactical Marxist-Leninist, now accepts

Richard Gibson.

Subject's passport file contained a communication

from the American Embassy in Bern, Switzerland to the

State Department, dated 1/23/68.

It reported that subject,

who was traveling by train from Milan to Geneva with his

wife, was removed from the train by Swiss immigration

authorities on 1/20/68 at Brig. Subject's wife contacted

the American Embassy by phone from Brig requesting direct

intervention with the Swiss.

It was subsequently ascertained

from a responsible Federal Foreigner$s Police (FFP) officer

that the subject had been expelled from Switzerland on

9/12/63 for his political activity

and association with the

magazine, "La Revolution Africaine"

On 12/16/63, the

Bundesanwaltschaft (Federal Police

and Justice Department)

issued an order prohibiting subject's re-entry into

Switzerland. However, since his whereabouts were unknown,

notification of same could not be sent to the subject.

The FFP officer stated that if the subject had applied

for entry into Switzerland during the week instead of the

weekend, he might have been authorized limited entry.

According to this officer, the subject should write to the

Bundesanwaltschaft in Bern concerning the incident at Brig

and request that he be furnished a reason for it. He would

then receive a copy of their ogder and youle have opportualty

to appeal the decision within 30 days.

As stated in the above communication, subject's

wife affirmed that the subject had made several trips to

Switzerland subsequent to 1963 without any difficulties.

In view of this latest development, it is most strongly

urged that the Bureau, through liaison, have CIA interview "SUGAR"

specifically concerning the following points:

(1) Any and all knowledge

"SUGAR" has

concerning activities and contacts of

HOWARD BRUCE FRANKIIN while the latter

was in France:

(2) Any and all knowledge of DAVIDA

FINEMAN. In this connection, it is

suggested that CIA be requested to

encourage correspondence between "SUGAR"

and FINEMAN.

(3)

"SUGAR" furnish CIA with all corre

spondence to and from the RU and that

"SUGAR" be directed in a logical way to

encourage such correspondence with the RU.

In view of LEIBEL BERGMAN's admitted difficulties over

communications with Red China and lack of knowledge of current

events in that country, it is believed that if "SUGAR" can

favorably establish himself with the RU as a contact in Europe

he will be able to furnish valuable information on any other

contacts the RU may attempt to establish on the Continent and

might even be utilized as a cutout by BERGMAN for the RU.

In view of the delicate nature of the information

contained in the LFM, the Bureau may wish to restrict dissemi

nation to. CIA only.

In referring the above requests to CIA, the Bureau

should insure the bona fides of "SUGAR" as a CIA operative and

his reliability lest SF 3169-S be compromised.

San Francisco will continue to follow this matter

with SF 3169-S.

RICHARD GIBSON

INFORMATION CONCERNING

In June, 1969, a confidential source, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that at an Executive

Committee meeting of the Revolutionary Union (RU) held on June 8,

Achin visor: whom.

1969, DAVIDA FINEMAN read a letter which she had received from

RICHARD GIBSON, whom she described as a Negro who resides in

Europe and whom she knew while she was in France.

This letter

was a run down on the Marxist-Leninist-Mao groups in various

countries in Europe and described some of these groups as

which would include various members of the bourgeoise.

to this source, BRUCE FRANKLIN in no uncertain

terms described GIBSON as a CIA agent who was exposed as such

and had to flee France lest he be killed. FRANKLIN stated that

he had proof of GIBSON's affiliation with CIA. LEIBEL BERGMAN,

on the other hand, stated in no uncertain terms that BRUCE

FRANKLIN's allegation was completely untrue and that GIBSON

had been thoroughly checked out when BERGMAN, himself, was in

Red China and had been found to be all right.

BRUCE FRANKLIN

continued the argument by stating that he could prove that

GIBSON was

a CIA agent because some friends of his in France

had been exposed and arrested shortly after their introduction

to GIBSON.

At the Executive Committee meeting, it was decided

that LEIBEL BERGMAN and the FRANKLINs were to iron out their

differences about GIBSON

amongst themselves and it was

further decided that the RU may be in contact with GIBSON.

REVOLUTIONARY UNION

In September, 1968, a source, advised

thatsthe

Revolutionary Union, commonly known to its membership as

the Red Union (RU), was formed in early 1968 as a covert;

revolutionary, Marxist-Leninist organization ideologically

oriented toward Communist China, which it views as the

model of the correct revolutionary Marxist-Leninist line as

developed through MAO Tse-tungol The PU advocates the necessity

of violent revolution and open guerrilla warfare to overthrow

the existing political system in the United States and effect

radical changes in this nation, and some members are collecting

firearms, explosives and other weapons and have engaged in

guerrilla warfare and firearms training. In the San Francisco

Bay Area, the RU consists of three locals, one each in San

Francisco, the East Bay, and the Peninsula.

In April, 19693 a second sounce advised that the RU

partially surfaced during that month through advertisements in

select

"New Left" periodicals, identifying three members of the

Executive Committee as public spokesmen and offering for sale

select writings of the RU, including a Statement of Principles,

with the exception of the three

publicly identified spokesmen.. the general membership ofsthe RU

will remain covent: however, individual members are tree to reveat

their RU membership to close political associates as the necessities

of political effectiveness dictate.

The RU's published "Statement of Principles' calls for

the smashing of the existing state apparatus by the United States

working class and the establishment of communism and the dictatorship

of the proletariat; recognizes the necessity of violent revolution

and organized armed struggle to achieve those ends and calls for

the creation of a revolutionary party based upon Marxism-Leninism

as developed through MAO tse-tung:

Through

from CIA that

the Agency has had no contact or connection,

either direct or indirect, with Fineman, Idwards, and Richards

and that these individuals are not under the direction of the

In connection with this operation and the investigation

of the Revolutionary Union, Chicago and San Irancisco should

Referenced communications concerning RICHARD GIBSON

reflect that in 1966 former CG 5903-S, when in contact with

pro-Chinese communists in Italy, was apprised of the suspicion

of the Italians concerning RICHARD GIBSON, specifically that he

was a CIA agent. In connection with their suspicions, the

Italians requested the informant to check on one DAVIDA FINEMAN,

who was ostensibly traveling with GIBSON as a translator. It

was subsequently learned that FINEMAN was residing in

at that time but had been a resident of New York City®

Referenced communications from New York and Los Angeles

concerning FINEMAN identify her background.

additional information concerning this person and does not,

in fact; have sufficient knowledge to determine whether the

person traveling with GIBSON in Europe in 1966 is identical with

the DAVIDA FINEMAN who has emerged as part of the Revolutionary

Union.

The Bureau and Los Angeles

are requested to furnish

to San Francisco any information which would assist in effecting

an identification of this person, it being believed by Chicago

that the definite possibility exists that the person traveling

with GIBSON is in fact identical with the current member of the

Revolutionary Union.

Chicago would desire to know when FINEMAN returned

to the United States and if she has any recorded activities

within left wing movements since returning. It would seem

that her emergence in the Revolutionary Union is highly

suspect in view of the probability of her former association

with GIBSON.

As GIBSON's identify is known to the Bureau and

the interested office, it would seem that the implications

of a CIA operation are clearly apparent.

In this connection, San Francisco letter of 10/30/63

reflects that HODEE EDWARDS has apparently returned to the United

States from England and San Francisco is presently attempting

to verify her residence. In connection with EDWARDS, it will

be recalled thate had

that he naive it con

written to the Ad Hoc Committee while

a house guest of RICHARD GIBSON in London concerning some

theoretical aspects of pro-Chinese ideology and that GIBSON,

while in contact with CG 6547-s in Chicago, had furnished the

name Of PAUL RICHARDS, SOn Of EDWARDS, as a good person who

had been active in the communist movement on the west coast.

RICHARDS recently wrote to the Ad Hoc Committee expressing

his favorable attitude toward the ideology as expressed by

the Committee and the possibility exists,

therefore, that

he was prompted to do so on advice from his mother,

HODEE

EDWARDS.

The totality of these events suggest that CIA has

effected operations in this country with the possible intent

of attempting to arrange for travel to China, and Chicago

strongly suspects not only FINEMAN but EDWARDS and RICHARDS

as being part of these operations.

Chicago respectfully requests any information the

Bureau may have in this matter.

For information Milwaukee, GIBSON is referring to

PAUL RICHARDS in the third

paragraph of this letter.

Malwaukee nay desire to utilize this information in report

form such

must be paraphrased and the source to identify the

characterization as RICHARDS is CG 6547-S who met with GIBSON

last year in Chicago.

Milwaukee is requested to review Bulet

Chicago

would also suggest that GIBSON's name not be used

The Bureau's attention is invited to the comment in

paragraph two regarding M.I. LASKI and in particular that

which notes that LASKI alligned himself with MIKE BAKER in

London who now professes, an anti-MAO. line. It would appear

105

25 April 2963

Dear Hero,

Please forgive my

slowness in

answering your letter

of February 12.

Much has been happening here, not all of

it for the best, as

far as I can see, but I still belleve

that the sharpening

racial. and class contradictions in

Britain - and elsewhere in

Burope -- in recent weeks will

provide an excellent situation in which Marxist-Loninists

can work more vigorously than in the past here. But there

still remain many other internal contradictions,

personality

conflicts, distorted reflections of the Cultural Revolution,

must be-resolved. I wish I could write in greater

detail, but I am certain you understand, with your experience,

lar more than I do.

Concerning "Comrade" Laski, nothing further has

"been

heard of nim since he left here

for Paris.

His great com-

rade here, Mike Baker, who published a huge interview with

Laski in his publication, Red Front, also took to attacking

what he now calls

"Mao's ultra-Lert clique."

Whether Laski

approves of Baker's new anti-Mao line, I cannot, say, but

birds of a feather do flock together...

The person living with me that you mentioned in your

letter is a lady, mother of the young student at the University

of Wisconsin that you met at my hotel in Chicago when I was

last there. He is still very much in the revisionist party,

althoush deeply disturbed by its general reformist, not to

say capitulationist line, yet still greatly swayed

by some

of the CrUSA tame intellectuals, particularly Apteker: I do

wish you comrades might helo him to understand the correct

line and find a way forward.

Give my regards to your wife,..

who I trust has now completely

recovered from her bout of poor health.

Fraternally yours,

Richard Gibson
