MM 105-1742

MM T-1 Is EDWARD THOMAS PIATKOWSKI, former PSI,

Miami, who was interviewed by SA GEORGE E. DAVIS, JR.

Efforts by Miami to locate LUIS CONTE AGUERO at

his residence, 7 N. E. 47th St., were negative, and owner

of that residence advised she was told by CONTE AGUERO

about two weeks ago he and his wife were moving back to

New York City. DIAZ LANZ advised he had not seen CONTE

AGUERO for ten to fifteen days.

He said as a result of

instant matter, Al has fallen apart over the disagreement

mentioned herein.

Since It would appear plans set out in reairtel

did not materialize, Miami contemplates no additional

Inquiries. It is noted split with La Cruz by DANNY VASQUEZ

and MARISOL VASQUEZ was, according to DANNY VASQUEZ, done

at the suggestion of defected former Cuban Naval Attache

to the United States MIGUEL PONS, who, according to VASQUEZ,

is working with CIA.

It is suggested New York might consider contacting

CONTE AGUERO concerning this matter, if his whereabouts in

New York City is lown.
