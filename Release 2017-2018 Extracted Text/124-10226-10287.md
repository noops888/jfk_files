acquainted with Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH of the MIRR but denied

He denied that

he carried any explosives to Mexico in his 1959

Cadillac, which he used on the trip. He denied that

ORLANDO BOSCH had sent him money to Mexico but said a

Cuban friend had sent him $100,00 from Miami.

On July 24, 1967,

married to the sister of Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH. He denied
