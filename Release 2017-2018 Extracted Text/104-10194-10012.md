not been tested

of a lack of potential but 1 am confident they will do the job

well as required. I rate Mr. Moore superior in his ability to

represent

he does a very good job in representing DED within CIA and the

James alton Moore is hereby nominated for a

Career Intelligence Medal in recognition of his

contributions to the missions of the Federal Burchu of

Investigation, the Office of Strategic Services, the

Strategic Services Unit and the Central Intelligence Agency

for nore than 37 jears.

3. Nalzon (Jim) Moore spent most of his boyhood (1920-27,

1950-j6) in Shantung Province, China with his missionary

Following graduation from Hardin-Simmons University

Jin joined the FRI

and served as a Special Agent in

both chicago and

San Francisco.

During the latter assign-

ment he reported

on pro-Communist clements in Chinatown and

directed a US Government panel to interview aliens and US

citizens

returning home to

ensure that enemy agents were not

slipping into the US as rofugces or foreign businessmen.

Jim joined OSS in November 1944 and was commissioned

as an

Ensign,

USNR.

His first

assignment sus in Kunning

where he recruited and trained Chinese

agents to infiltrate

Japanese lines. While in Kunming he took parachute training

and on fugust 17, 1945 jumped into the Japanese

internment

camp at weihsein.

Following evacuation of refugees he

•became Chief of Mission in Isingtao

Returning to the US

in December 1946, he was reassigned as Vice Consul and

Jin Dairen.

Soviet intransigence prevented

his reaching Dairen so he

remained in Tsingtao for an

additional year until

transferred asL

Tin

Calcutta, arriving there in April, 1948.

Jim returned to the United States in October 1949 and

joined the Contact Division,

Office of Operations, CIn.

CD/00 policy favored continuity and Jim was no exception.

Fron 1939 to 1954 he served in the Houston Ficld Office

from 1954-1978 as the Resident Officer in Dallas.

Contac: Division evolved into the Domestic Contact Service

and a reallocation of resources raised the Dallas Resident

Offica to Field Office status.

Jim was the obvious choice

for the job. After nine months training and preparation in

lashingion (where he performed admirably) he was

as Chief of the new office with responsibility also for

Residant Offices in Tulsa, Houston, New Orleans and, even-

tually, Austin.

Appreciation for Outstanding DCD

1.

I want to express the appreciation of the

Office of Strategic Research for the special effort

recently made for us by J. Walton Moorc of your Dallas

urgent request to obtain information on

very short notice.

The subject

of

as an important

issue in a recent conmunity-wide effort to reassess

total soviet military manpower.

The community reassess-

ment was stimulated by DIA reporting of several months

ago that existing estimates of

total Soviet military

manpower were low by almost one million men.

If correct,

the DIA appraisal had potentially serious implications

for the ongoing MBFR negotiations as well as a host

= of

intelligence judgments about the dimensions of the

Soviet military threat.

During the ensuing interagency review of the

individual estinates contributed by various agencies

in the Washington area, we came to the conclusion that

Jestimated by an

Army intelligence group was much too high.

scarch of headquarters' files turned up barely enough

intelligence to prepare an estimate of a portion oi the

but no direct evidence on total

At this point it became clear to us

that an improved estimate might be made with information
