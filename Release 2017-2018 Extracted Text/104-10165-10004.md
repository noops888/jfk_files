Further understandings and impressions of loore may te obtained from

reading his previously publislied tool about Jack Tourgblood, au merican who

participated iu the erents leading to Castro's o'erthrow of battista.

b. In my opinion. Moore has a burning desire to be linown

as a tough, tro-fisted, rip roarin soldier of fortune.

He bas participated

in real mar in liet Jas, and has receised that is probably the best traiuing

in the world for guerilla fighters. hanely. the C. S. Special Forces.

Tois

ke is ilclited to bray. and is probably

inclined to interperate use of

alcobol and suren. and his judgevent of in-

portant matters is probably irmature.

However. he definitely understands

and is experienced iu guerilla fighting, is experienced in nilitary operations,

and eust surely understand military securit;-

He is definitels willing to belp, but cannot contribute

cash directly; is willing to furnish the use of the guest house on his property

for linited periods of time.

Is willing to participate and aid in au operation

to lane people on the scath coasi of luba, but is not milliur to commit the ue

of his property ard facilities as a stagiug area for resuppl; in the future.

d. Is willing to come to liari, for coufereuces if his

expenses are paid.

Site Evaluation

Blue lole is an excellent bartor; protected against

all weather. and with six feet of sater at ine har.

heavily wooded.

Dock faciliries are presently very beager,

ut could be quicklr and easilr improved.

So iuel for a boai is availabie

at Blue Hole, aud at Fort Antonio (the closest source) the fuel arailable

is diesel fuel or autonotive gasoline; to varice shite gasoline is arailable

aurwhere is the area. This is a nost significant factor in selecting a

suitable boat.

The nearest source of food aud other supplies is Port

Autonio; Fred barrett. wanager of the Blue lagoon Club, orders and hauls

supplies fros Port Antorio coustantly, aud could deliver whatever supplies

were desired. Fireares and explosires are not obtainable on the island.

They would have to be smuggled in illegally.

A swall

statiou vagon is arailable for transportation.

provided expenses are paid by users.

Miscellaneous. Information

A local nan. George lunroe, is reported to be a very

experienced saall boat captain und oue who has brought busts dom frum lian!

The SoS. Frameline sails ever, tro weeks from liani

even a loat to lobia loore.

Fred Barrett, manager of the bar-restaur into seera to

be a very capable vau. and for an additional

$10 per reel added to his regular

pay. sould be quite villing to assist any operation.

like lives iu Kingsion, and, if he is not a battista

sepathizer. might prove to be

a rery valuable connection.

The fazily is re-

ported to be quite realthy, and would establish an excellent corer.

4. Operational Considerations

In order to avoid the use of sirificant nazes. I

ustructed loore to refer to larolo as George King. and the operatios of

landing hin in Cuba sould be referred to as Operatiouking.

Ibe cost likely

scheme seens to be to establish a suitable boat it Biue liole, it the cover

story to be that it telongs to lerican frields of Robin Moore. House is

arailable locally for a limited cuber of Cutans, wich loore being able to

acconmodate up to sir on his om property.

The local boat captain, leorge

Munroe. could be employed

as captaiu initially. to train the Cuban crer in

the local parine conditions, as rell as serviug as aù effectite corer.

In

my opinion, it will tot be too difficult for persons to enter Jamaica without

difficulty, provided they know a certain minium amunt of English.

I think a suitable location couldle found for radio

transnission and reception facilities on the hills surrounding Blue Hole, but

this would have to be examined br someone akilled in radio techniques.

rould be excellent.

In summary, I would say that Robin loore and his property and!

buildiug at Blue Hole would

serve as an excellent lage of operations. but tiat

the boat necessar, for the operation muld have to be acquired and equipped

in the states and shipped down

inere, except for the renote pussibilit; thati

a suitable boat could be found in liston. I think a headquarters could be,

established at saall cost through lore's good offices, and I thial that Ruds

be a good choice to coordinate the initial operatians there.
