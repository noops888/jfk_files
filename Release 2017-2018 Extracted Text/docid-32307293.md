It is noted that ROY EMORY HARGRAVES,, an American

adventurer and mercenary;

in July, 1970, advised he was

involved in a plan to effect warfare between the United

States and Cuba.

The plan consisted of attempting to

have defecting Cuban military personnel fire missiles

against the United States Navy Base, Guantanamo, Cuba,

pepe

thus projêcting the United States into a military take

over of Cuba,- HARERAVES HaS ClOSeY associated in this

plan with GERALD PATRICK HEMMING another American mer

cenary and

adventurer and a long-time associate of

L.A., CAte

HARGRAVES .

MM I-I, an American citizen Closely associated

with HARGRAVES and HEMMING in the past ten years, on

September 15, 1970, advised that ME. VINCENT OLLER,.

detective, Dade County, Florida, Department of Public

Safetys

Miami, stated that he had been investigating

ROY EMORY HARGRAVES and GERALD PATRICK HEMMING inasmuch

as the United Statas Coast Guard in Miami had given him

some information concerning them.

and HeMMING had devised some illogical and irresponsible

military plan of action against Cuba which was highly

unlikely of any success whatever

from coming to Miami to join his organization. HEMMING

therefore sent out hundreds of form letters in persons

In March, 1952, most of the leading Cuban exile

organizations had disavowed any cooperacion with HEMMING.

Most of the groups felt NaMiNC was naking à living at

the expense of the revolution and had no real intention
