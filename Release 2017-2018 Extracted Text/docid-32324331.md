IV. General Crime Conditions in Portland, Oregon

A.: Organized Gangs

The "Syndicate" which is headed by AL WINTERS is again active in

Portland after having suspended operations for some six months.

At the first

of the year when all vices were "closed" in the City of Portland due to the

death of Captain TATUM in Portland bootleg joint, all vice operations were

suspended and in the past three months have opened up gradually.

CI 307 has advised that WINTIRS and the "Syndicate" have operated

the Esquire Room located in the Esquire Hotel spasmodically for the past four

or five months.

He states that the "Syndicate's" activities at the present

time are largely confined to book making and bookmaking on the horse races

and in taking the bets on football sheets. CI 307 further states that JIM

ELKINS, reported lieutenant in the "Syndicate" was almost dormant for some

three months after the first of the year but is gradually opening up his

böotlegging establishments. CI 307 advised that during the inactivity of the

gambling syndicate in Portland they concentrated theirefforts in establishing

said that he had recently been told that wINTeRs had decided to give up his

interests in Las Vegas and confine his activities to the Portland area.

Individual Racketeers and Mobsters

It is the consensus of all of the Confidential Informants and sources

of information used in this survey that a number of individuals in this category

are at a minimun in Portland at the present time, They state that when the

city was "closed" in January of 1947, most of these individual left town and

have not returned and probably will not return on a permanent basis until a new

Chief of Police is appointed and they

find out "which way the wind is blowing."

CI 338 states that among the negro population there is a very definite migration

from Portland to the Hanford-Richland, Washington area.

He states that many

of the bootleggers, pimps and gamblers are making plans to shifttheir operations

to this area due to the shift of the negro population to that area.

The following is a list of safe burglars, burglars and ex-convicts

who are known to have frequented and operated in Portland inlthe past ind are

expected to operate in Portland, in the future.

This list was assembled by

Detective Sgt: MYRON WARREN (of the Portland Police Department with the aid of
