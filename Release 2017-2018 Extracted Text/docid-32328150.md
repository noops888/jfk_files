had decided to sell their rights to this concession. He stated it

appeared this decision was brought about by the edict of the Nevada

State Gambling Board requiring a separation of

owning gambling operations in Cuba and Nevada. Interests by individuals

LANSKY advised that

while the combination would have to sell their concession rights in

a poor market, nonetheless they had

made a substantial profit on

their initial

investment in the casino during the first two years of

operation and they would not suffer any loss.

LANSKY stated he was certain the selling agreement would

have to be acceptable to the Hotel Nacional; in that the caliber and

reputation of the individuals buying the concession will have to meet

with the hotel's approval. JACK LANSKY stated the question of whether

or not he would remain in. Cuba and operate the casino would depend upon

the identity of the individuals who bought the concession.,

LANSKY stated the combination had yet not opened the

Stardust, a new gambling casino in Las Vegas which had been built by

them because of difficulty in obtaining a license for the Stardust

until such time as they have sold their interests in Cuba.

LANSKY stated the edict of the Nevada State Gambling Board

requiring a separation of interests was strictly a political maneuver

directed in the main at CLIFF/JONES, former Lieutenant

Governor of

Nevada, and that while the decision

who has just recently invested a substantial amount of money in the

Hotel Havana-Hilton, it was also affecting other individuals with

interests in both places who have nothing to do with Nevada state

He stated that JONES, prior to buying an interest in the

gambling casino in the Havana-Hilton, had discussed the matter with the

Governor of Nevada to insure there would be no difficulty and had been

assured he would have no problem. LANSKY stated that subsequently,

however, JONES, a Democrat, had thrown his support behind other

Democrats in the forthcoming Nevada elections in November and as a

result, the present incumbent, a Republican, had sent the word down

to the Nevada State Gambling Board to "put the squeeze", on JONES.

that SAM TUCKER had received permission from the Nevada State Gaming

Board to take whatever time was necessary to dispose of the interest

that TUCKER might attempt to delay taking action on selling his

interest in the casino until the November elections in Nevada in

order to see whether the present incumbents might lose out thereby

resolving his problem.
