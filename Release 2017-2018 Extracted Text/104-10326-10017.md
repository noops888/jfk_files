CURIOUSLY, THE CLOSE POLITICAL RELATIONS AND OUR

MEANS THAT BOTH PARTIES

-EMBASSY DIPLOMATS AND SENIOR

OFFICERS - - WONDER WHY WE NEED

IF WE CAN GET VIRTUALLY ANYTHING WE ASK FOR FROM

JOFFICIALS.

INDEED, IN THIS RELATIVELY

OPEN, COMFORTABLE ENVIRONMENT, AN INDICATION THAT

_WAS WORKING

ON INCOMPATIBLE

TARGETS WOULD BE ESPECIALLY DAMAGING.

AT THE RISK OF BORING THE READER WITH DETAIL, EMBASSY

| IS SO OPEN A WORKPLACE THAT THERE IS NO REAL CLEARED ACCESS

AREA (CAA), BUT RATHER A "HYBRID" CAA,

TO USE THE RSO'S PHRASE.

JIN THIS ENVIRONMENT,

ÉRIENDLY SOCIETY, OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION OF CIA'S USE

WOULD ONLY REAFFIRM THEIR POINT OF VIEW. OUR FEW

WOULD ESSENTIALLY THEN BE DECLARED. L

CHANGE OUR

PROFILE BY OBTAINING MORE L

OFFICERS WHILE

REDUCING THE NUMBER

AS HEADQUARTERS IS AWARE,

UNDER CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES THERE ARE FEW

JAND THE SELECTION AND

TRAINING OF NEW ONES TAKES YEARS AND IS EXPENSIVE. IN THIS SCENARIO,

WOULD NEVER RECEIVE ENOUGH PRIORITY TO WARRANT SENDING

TO REPLACE THE THREE

SLOTS WE CURRENTLY

THE END RESULT WOULD BE THAT WE WOULD COLLECT VERY LITTLE

ON MAJOR PORTIONS OF OUR OPERATING DIRECTIVE (OD) .

SPECIFICALLY, INTERNAL POLITICAL REPORTING, WHICH IS A FIRST PRIORITY

ÓBJECTIVE, WOULD BE ZEROED OUT, AND REPORTING ON THE

TARGETS, BOTH SECOND PRIORITY OBJECTIVES, WOULD BE NON-EXISTENT.

THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS LOSS TO THE USG, SINCE OUR REPORTING HAS

HISTORICALLY BEEN THE ONLY MEANS OF LEARNING TO WHAT EXTENT THE

ARE RESPECTING INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS AND NOT REBUILDING

THEIR MISSILE PROGRAM.

ON THEL TARGET, WE WOULD LOSE SIGNIFICANT

REPORTING ON REGIONAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY AND THE IMPACT OF THE ASIAN

FINANCIAL CRISIS IN THE AMERICAS. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, HOWEVER,

WE WOULD LOSE THE TRUST OF [

_GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND OF SOME

OFFICIALS, WITH THE PREDICTABLE RESULT THAT IT WOULD

TAKE YEARS TO REBUILD THE RELATIONSHIP.
