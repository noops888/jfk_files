Director

Federal Bureau of Investigation

Washington, D.

20535

Dear Mr. Director:

Chairman Stokes asked me to respond to your letter of

December 6, 1978 in reference to materials furnished to the

Bureau by the Department from Harold Weisberg.

I, too, share your concern that materials that are of a

sensitive character not enter the public domain.

My letter to Mr. Weisberg, of course, is not sensitive,

nor are his two letters to me, both of which he apparently re-

tained copies of.

The other material, a copy of which was attached.to your

letter, constitutes the typewritten notes that one Oliver Patter-

son gave to the Federal Bureau of Investigation while he was

serving as an informant for the Bureau, providing the Bureau

information on J. B. Stoner&Edward Fields, and the National

States Rights Party.

I do not know if Mr. Patterson retained

copies of the materials he provided thet bureau.

-140.

In any event,

In the course of this committee's investi-

gation of the possible involvement of Stoner and the National

States Rights Party in the assassination of Dr. King, Oliver

Patterson was identified as a

possible witness.

He was inter-

viewed by staff investigators

and he acknowledged that he had

been an informant for the FBI.

He also provided to the Com-

mittee a waiver of his confidential relationship with the Bureau.

It was based on this waiver that my

letter of January 26, 1978

requested access to Mr.

Patterson's informant

files, in order

that the Committee could verify Mr. Patterson's present recol-v

lection of events of a number of years ago.

I understood, at

the time, that your release to the Committee of these materials

was done

with the understanding that since they stemmed from?' I?

Mr. Patterson, it was contemplated that there was no objection

to

MI.

Patterson having what he had originally given to the

Bureau.

As you may be aware, this Committee's relationship with

Mr. Patterson parallels that of the Bureau's.

it has not been wholely satisfactory. Mr. Patterson provided

information to the Committee under a promise of confidentiality.

He was not a Committee informant in the sense that he received

compensation for the information. Only witness fees were paid

Nevertheless, that he was cooperating with the Com-

mittee ultimately came to the attention of the Ray family and

Apparently, out of a concern for his personal safety,

he repudiated his relationship with the Committee

and has been

a source of a variety of false charges against staff employees.

I have to assume that the materials in the possession of

Mr. Weisberg were obtained from Mr. Patterson.

If I am correct

in this assumption, what was seemingly a release of sensitive

materials to the public by the Committee can be placed in a

proper context.

I regret that this instance may have caused you any con-

cern.

If my understanding of the facts are correct, in fact

nothing has gotten into the public domain through Mr. Patterson's

actions that he was not capable of releasing independent of the

Bureau's or this Committee's actions.

You may rest assured that the Committee will in the weeks

ahead continue to afford that material that you have made avail-

able to it all measure of confidentiality. As I am sure Danny

Coulson and the other men working with the Committee will assure

report to see to it that the spirit, as well as the tenets, of

the Memorandum of Understanding

are adhered to.

Sincerely,

G. Robert Blakey

Chief Counsel and Director,
