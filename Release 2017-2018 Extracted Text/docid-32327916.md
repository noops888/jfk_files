ADMINISTRATIVE: (CONT'D)

A photograph of the subject was directed to the

Bureau in New York letter to Bureau dated 10/7/63 under

caption

"Criminal Intelligence Program - Hoodlum-Album"

During the period of this report contact was

maintained with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 90 Church

Street, NYC. It was learned that the subject, arrested

in 1961, is presently out on bond. Proceedings in this

matter have not commenced since that agency is attempting

to locate two fugitives named in the same indictment with

thesubject.

It was generally understood that prosecution

in this matter involving GUIGA would commence in the

near future.

Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

indicated that they had a "good" case on the subject and

his co-defendants and that their interest concerning the

subject while out on bail is continuing.

In view of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

pending prosecution of the subject as well as that

agency's continuing interest in his activities while on

bail, additional investigative effort might tend to jeopardize

their case.

Consequently this matter is being placed in a

pending inactive status, in order that

â€¢ the prosecutive status

of this

case may be followedand reported.
