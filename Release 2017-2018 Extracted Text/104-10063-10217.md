1971 largely as a regult of a trip to Africa by Malcolm X

University principal Howard Lamar Fuller. During a 45

day tour, Fuller spoke with leaders of various liberation

fronts in southern Africa who advised him of the need for

support by black people in the United States in the form of

funds and medical supplies as well as homogeneous political

support for all African liberation movement. Fuller began

to organize the ALDCC for the purpose of mobilizing black

people in the Americas (the United States, Canada and the

Caribbean) to demonstrate their solidarity with the libera-

tion movements in Africa.

2. The primary financial and logistical support

Of ALDCC was provided by church sources through the Inter-

Religious Foundation for Community Organizations (IFCO) of

which Fuller is a board member. IFCO was created in 1968

to aid churches in allocating their funds to mutual-interest

projects of the various denominations. IFCO has also had

were out on bail could poseibly be sent from Trinidad to parti

cipate in the Toronto demonstrations.

9. In Canada Douglas with the help of Horace Camp-

bell planned to focus attention on the British, French and Amer-

ican Consulates in Toronto and possibly Montreal. Major

preparations for the 27 May demonstrations in Canada include

extensive press coverage in Contrast, a newspaper for the

black community in Canada, Black Student Union and United

Negro Improvement Association have sponsored social activ-

ities to raise funds. Organizational meetings of the African

Liberation Day Steering Committee are held weekly. The 27

May demonstrations will include marches past the selected

Consulates in Toronto, and rallies focusing on political speeches

and cultural performances by New York poets. Walter Rodney

reportedly will deliver the key note address.

10. No large demonstrations comparable to those

in the United States and Canada are scheduled for the Cari-

bbean as yet. In Trinidad the currently prevailing political

conditions and firm police control are a deterrent to any or-

ganized activity on the part of black extremists.
