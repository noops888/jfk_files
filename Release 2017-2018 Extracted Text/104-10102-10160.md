A Venezualan Christian Democratic friend of mine, Valmore

Acevedo, called ma- from New York. City yesterday worning to ask

as. a personal. favor-that I receive a Cuban exile living thare

who-bad something. "amazing" to tail me. … When I expressed mild

skepticism, Acavedo urgently repeated ais request and I agreed.

Within a surprisingly-short time tha Cuban, Victor Ispinosa,

arrived at my office (he said he had taken the plane imnedi-..

ately). Espinosa gave-his addresa and telaphone number as

Espinosa also referred to a jeweler by the name of

Teppellino (spelling?), located at 47th Street, In New York

City.

Teppellino works for CIA and has frequent contact with

the Cuban Ambassador, in Paris.

The Ambassador regularly dis-

poses of jewelry and other valuables made available from Cuba.

CIA think the Cuban Ambassador does not know he is working for

CIA, but the Ambassador does know.

Espinosa is determined to bring the very dangerous

situation of the Cuban plot to the attention of some top level

official in the United States Government unless he receives

at least some reply from CIA.

Comment:

Espinosa

was not overly tense and did not indulge in his-

trionics, but I felt he was quite determined to push this

matter further if he did not get some response within the very

near future.

I cannot, and do not have to, judge his reli-

ability on the basis of this one conversation.

However, if I

had to guess at this point I would be inclined to accept most

of what he said about actual events.

But of course there are

all sorts of obvious possibilities, including provocation.

Espinosa seemed somewhat mollified and tamporarily reassured

by this.

However, I doubt very much that he will wait longer

than. two or three days more before making another attempt to

bring this situation to a head.
