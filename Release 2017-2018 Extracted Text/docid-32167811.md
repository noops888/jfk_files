Enclosed are 16 copies of

a letterhead memorandum

(LHM)

dated and captioned as above, which states the number of sources

contacted

of Mexico

regarding the reported

interest of the Communist Party

in the OSWALD case, 70

ReBulet 4/21/64M

With regard to ELIZABETH CATLETT MORA's statement

that MARY LOUISE CAMACHO, nee PATTERSON, knew OSWALD while he

was in Russia, MEX-18 and MEX-19 mave been unable to obtain

more explicit information from MORA. The matter was discussed

again with the informants on 5/5/64, at which time they advised

that, according to MORA, she and CAMACHO are long-time friends

dating back to the time

they were both residents of New York

The informants advised that MORA and CAMACHO correspond

frequently with MORA writing to CAMACHO approximately twice a

week and sending her toilet articles, warm socks, and similar

items which CAMACHO has needed while in Russia.

They stated,

created by the informants to say anything more about what

LEE HARVEY OSWALD.

As previously pointed out, direct question

ing of MORA by the informants does not produce information..

With regard to MORA's information concerning OSWALD's

visit to the Cuban Embassy, that information, according to MORA,

came from TERESA PROENZA, then Cultural Attache of the Cuban

Embassy, during a conversation between MORA and PROENZA.

according to the informants, MORA and PROENZA had been close

friends for an extended period of time.

On the occasion of

MORA's relating the story to the informants on 1/13/64 the

informants tried to elicit more information from her, but a

that time and thereafter they have not been able to develop

any additional details and MORA has not revealed any additional

information.

The Mexico City Office appreciates the Bureau's

position that this matter must be pursued in depth and that the

informants should be made aware of the fact that the questions

raised by MORA's original information cannot be left unanswered.

The informants have been impressed repeatedly with the need to

follow this case aggressively with MORA and to clarify the

original information.

They repeatedly have created situations

which would open up a discussion of the previous information,

but have been met with an apparent total lack of interest on

MORA's part.

On 5/5/64 the informants pointed out that,

subsequent to MORA's original indication of

interest in

press

reports concerning the OSWALD case Shey had repeatedly called

her attention to various articles appearing in the press,

including an article in

"Life" magazine, but receivea no

reaction whatsoever and no indication of interest

Under instructions from this office the informants

have tried continuously to set up a two or three-day trip out

of Mexico City with MORA and her husband, FRANCISCO MORA.

Definite arrangements were made on three different occasions

for the proposed trip, and on each occasion MORA was enthusiastic

about it, desiring to get away from the family and other problems

for a few days" rest and relaxation.

On each occasion, however,

she postponed the

trip due to financial problems with the house

she and her husband

are constructing, ill health of her mother,

or pressure of developments such as important visitors arriving

in Mexico whom she had to attend.

The informants made a final

effort to set up a meeting with MORA following the week

019-1t/tt set po co 10 eparture for the United States@U)

on 5/18/64, but MORA again claimed that as much as she wanted

to take the trip and much as she needed the rest she would not

be able to leave Mexico City because of the projects she had

pending.

It does not appear that it will be possible to set up

such a meeting in the future in view of MEX-19's return to the d

United States.

Both

infortants have expressed the belief that further

efforts to obtain more specific data from MORA on this matter

would be "working a dry well."

On 5/5/64 they advised that in

their opinion MORA's complete loss of interest in the OSWALD

case indicates that she has now decided that she and her

associates were not actually involved with him. She, therefore,

does not discuss the matter any more aside from speculative
