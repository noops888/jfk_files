FABBRI advised he had just returned to Venezuela from

England, where he had been permitted to examine all evidence by

NEWTON. NEWTON had stated during personal conversations that he was

convinced in his own mind on the basis of the evidence that the

Cubana Airplane was sabotaged,

that the explosive device was nitro-f

glycerine based, probably dynamite, that a fire had followed the

explosion, and the explosives had been placed in the aft cargo hold

of the aircraft. (s)

FABBRI stated he was very surprised the blast had been

the result of a nitroglycerine-based explosive as anti-Castro Cubans

have not typically used this explosive (5)

He added that the report would be placed in the hands of

the Venezuelan judge in charge of the case on 12/9/76, andepined

that it would be a serious setback for the prosecution as their case

is based upon the concept that C-4 explosive was used, and that it

EXAMINATION OF THE ELOATING WRECKAGE (FLOTSAM) RECOVERED FROM

CUBANA AIRLINES DCS CUT 1201

by

ERIC NEWTON ISO, MBE, C.Eng, FRA€S

Specialist Investigator & Adviser

1: INTRODUCTION

On 6th October 1976, about 8 minutes after taking off from Barbados International

(Seawell) Airport en route for Cuba via Jamaica,

the pilot of the above aircraft

reported to the control tower that there had been "an explosion" and that there

was a "fire on board". About 5 mins later, whilst attempting to return to the

airport the aircraft crashed into the sea about 5 miles off the West coast of

Barbados and sank in deep water. • All 73 occupants were killed. A small amount

of floating wreckage and 15 bodies were recovered.

The main wreckage has not

been salvaged.:

An immediate investigation was initiated by the Barbados Civil

Aviation and Police authorities.

2. STATUS IN THE INQUIRY

On 10th October 1976 I arrived in Barbados at the request of the Barbados

Government to assist both the Civil Aviation and Police investigating authorities

in the role of specialist investigator and adviser.

3. EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS

I am an independent aircraft accident investigator specialist and adviser.

I retired from the British Governments Accidents Investigation Branch in

(3)

February 1975 after 33 years service.: I was Principal Inspector in the

engineering division and, in addition to normal aircraft accident investigations,

I have made a special study, over the last 26 years, in the detection of explosive

sabotage in aircraft wreckage.: I have investigated

a number. of

such cases in

various parts of the world.

I am a Chartered Engineer (C.Eng) 1968 and a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical

Society (FRAeS) 1962.

4: INSPECTION OF AVAILABLE WRECKAGE

All the available wreckage was confined in a Police Building near Seawell Airport

under strict security.

This flotsam consisted mainly of light structure,

personal baggage,

and cabin furnishings, and included 20 seat cushions, 14

suitcases in various states of damage, 5 life rafts,

one escape chute, one main

wheel, one

nose wheel, pieces of wing

aileron trim tab and

spoiler, one fire extinguisher, 3 oxygen bottles, one rear passenger cabin

lavatory door and bulkhead, pieces of the forward bar and

= picee of forward

cabin bulkhead. The fiight recorders were not recovered. The Journey Log was

recovered.

4.1 Explosive blast evidence

A detailed examination of the available suitcases revealed 3 Cuban made suitcases,

of black plastic simulated leather, and all of the same pattern damaged extensive:

and in a significant manner consistent with them having been exposed close to

an explosive blast. Numerous small perforations and

with signs of heat were noted. A number of very small metal fragments were

found embedded in these suitcases (see list at Appendix A). These were

extracted for further examination under the scanning electron microscope.

Preliminary examination on site showed that some of these fragments were

similar to fragments that have been explosively produced. Their very small

size coupled with the fact that they had penetrated into the suitcase also

indicates that they had been subjected to extreme velocity.

these fragments, when examined microscopically revealed small fibres of white

under floor cargo/baggage holds.

Further evidence consistent with explosive blast was a side curtain from the

passenger cabin window.

This took the form of numerous perforations and local

shredding of the material. One passenger seat cushion cover also showed numerous

snall perforations. A tangled and compressed mass of mixed fibres, similar to

a passenger seat cushion material, was found janned into a life raft which is

normally stowed in the ceiling compartment in the rear part of the passenger

cabin.

tories in the United Kingdom (see separate repott).

4.2

Fire evidence

It was evident, from the burnt condition of the left hand rear lavatory door

and bulkhead,

and a piece of coat roon bulkhead, that there had been a fire

at the rear part of the passenger compartment.

The lavatory door and bulkhead

had been torn from their locations and their

surfaces were burnt particularly

at the bottom. The blackened fractures suggested that these items had been

torn off before the fire.

The hand fire extinguisher and oxygen bottles which

are normally stowed in the rear part of the passenger cabin also. showed signs

of heat and soot. It was noted that the fire extinquisher was empty and the

sealed safety wire on the operating trigger was broken. The oxygen bottles,

which had been torn from their locations, were also empty. However, though

they showed signs of heat and soot; they showed no other damage or disruption.

One economy passenger seat cushion and its cover showed evidence of burning,

and damage in one corner after

the burning. A small area of the life raft, which

is normally stowed in the ceiling compartment at the rear of the passenger

compartment, was burnt. The general fire pattern appeared to track from

£100r level up to the roof of the rear passenger cabin.

There was no evidence to support fire at the forward end of the passenger

cabin.

The fire

is considered to be a secondary feature to

the explosion,

other material embedded in the lower torso. These fragments were later

removed and have been gubjected to forensic examination in the forensic

explosive laboratory in the United Kingdom (see separate report). The very

small size of some of these fragments, together with signs of heat and extreme

velocity is. consistent with

the subject being in the vicinity of an explosion.

Some of the material is foreign to that of the aircraft structure.

6. AIRWORTHINESS ASPECTS

Nothing was found in the small amount of aircraft structure recovered which

indicates, or suggests, that any mechanical defect of failure caused or

contributed to this disaster. In addition the Journey Log for this aircraft,

which was recovered, showed no recorded defects up to the time of the disaster.

7: FORENSIC EXPLOSIVE LABORATORY EXAMINATION

A number of specimens (see Appendix A) were selected and with the agreement of

the Barbados Government Investigating authorities these items were sealed and

sent to the United Kingdoms Government Forensic Explosives Laboratories at the

Royal Armament and Development Establishment (RARDE), Fort Halstead and Woolwich

for examination. These physical and chemical examinations, using advanced

techniques, suggested that a high explosive device had been detonated. Traces

of nitroglycerine were found from the surfaces of the suitcases.

ANALYSIS

Analysis of the material evidence obtained from the available wreckage, together

with the circumstantial evidence including the R/T messages from the aircraft,

indicates a sudden and unexpected occurrence unconnected with the airworthines

of the aircraft or its operating crew.

This occurrence, whilst the aircraft

was flying en route over the sea, took place about 8 mins after taking off.

There is little doubt, from the urgency in the voice recorded

that a dire emergency

existed in the aircraft at this time.

Examination of

the small amount of floating wreckage recovered does not indicate,

or suggest,

any technical defect or failure of the aircraft or its systems which could have

led up to this emergency.

The recorded R/T message reported that an explosion

had occurred in this aircraft and that a fire existed.

Inspection of a number

of suitcases, furnishings and post mortem examination of a number of bodies

revealed evidence consistent with a detonation of a high explosive device.

Forensic physical examination, metallographic and chemical analysis is

consistent with a severe disruption having taken place.

The finding of traces

of nitroglycerine on the suitcases suggests that an explosion probably occurred:

The fire is considered to be secondary to the explosion and affected the rear

of the passenger cabin. There was no evidence to support fire existing at the

front part of the aircraft although there could well, have been smoke.

The finding of numerous pieces of white fibre glass

fragments in the upper

xear cabin,

suitcases and a body, and the general, blast direction upwards

through the rear passenger cabin

suggests that the explosive device

in the rear underfloor

cargo/baggage hold, the walls

and roof of which are lined

with panels

of white fibre glass.

Although there is no positive evidence to show precisely why the aircraft

eventually crashed

into the sea after flying for several minutes after reporiing

the explosion, it is considered likely that this was associated with the crews

inability to control the aircraft.

The flying controls (steel cables) are

located under the passenger cabin floor and routed towards the year centrally

along the roof of the cargo/baggage holds.

Disruption of these cables by an

explosion would, of course, result in loss of control. This, apparently did

not occur immediately and the aircraft was able to turn and be flown for

several minutes

towards the airport after reporting "an explosion". The

explosive blast could therefore have been to one side of the flying control

cables probably close to the fuselage side wall. A severe fire at floor level

in the rear cabin could, eventually, cause the fair leads, pulleys and structur

supporting the tensioned cables to collapse with consequent loss

of pitch and

direction control.

A likely alternative, in this particular case, and a known hazard from

internal fires

or cargo hold explosion, would be the obliteration of inside

and outside reference by dense smoke and fumes in the cockpit-resulting in loss

of control:

9• FINDINGS

(1) A high explosive device detonated within this aircraft •

(2) The location was probably in the rear underfloor cargo/baggage hold.

(3) As a result of this explosion a fire developed in the rear passenger,

cabin.

Control of the aircraft was lost, whilst attempting to return to the

airport and the aircraft crashed into the sea.

10. CONCLUSION

aircraft was lost following the detonation of a high explosive device on

board the aircraft.
