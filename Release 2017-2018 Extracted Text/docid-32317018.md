PG 72-107

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 1976, PG ED3-PC, IN RESPONSE IO

A QUESTION REGARDING WHAI SOURCE KNEW ABOUT THE ROSELLI

MURDER, SOURCE ADVISED THAT A RECENT EX-CON BY THE NAME

OF GALENTI (PHONETIC) HAD SOME PARTICIPATION IN THE HIT

ON ROSELLI, AND PROBABLY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT. GALENII

WAS FURTHER IDENIIFIED AS BEING

APPROXIMATELY AGE 6,

AND ASPIRING TO TAKE OVER CARLO GAMBINO'S POSITION IN

NEW YORK. SOURCE ADVISED THAT DUE TO ROSELLI'S AGE, IHE

MOB KNEW ROSELLI WOULD EVENTUALLY TALK IO THE GOVERNMENT

INVESTIGAIORS CONCERNING CASTRO ASSASSINATION PLOTS.

THE REASON THOUGHI TO BE FOR ROSELLI'S TELLING ALL WAS IHAT

HE WANTED TO AVOID GOING TO JAIL, WHICH THE MOB FELI WOULD

BE AN UNEXPECTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO ROSELLI IF HE WOULD NOT

TALK. A FURTHER COMMENI BY THE SOURCE WAS THAT YOUNGER

MOB MEMBERS DID NOI FEAR JAIL, BUI OLDER MOB MEMBERS DID

BECAUSE THE OLDER MEMBERS ARE AFRAID OF DYING BEFORE THEY

GET QUI OF JAIL.
