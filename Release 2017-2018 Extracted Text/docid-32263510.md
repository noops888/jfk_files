HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

Retrievable information contained in files of the

FBI indicates that this Bureau received information derived

from transcripts of tape recordings furnished by another

government agency which conducts intelligence type investi-

gations.

The transcripts indicated that on September 28,

1963, and October 1, 1963, the voice of an individual

identifying himself

as Lee Oswald was recorded by the other

government agency conducting intelligence type investigations.

Additionally, this

government agency provided the FBI with

photographs of an individual who appeared to be an American;

these photographs being taken by said agency on October 1,

1963:1

It is noted that the FBI never received the actual

tape recordings from which the transcripts were derived, as

the tapes were erased by the other government agency providing

the transcripts. (MCM

In response to Question 1 of referenced request,

retrievable information indicates that the photographs of

the

individual who appeared to be an American were transported to

the FBI Division, Dallas, Texas, on November 23, 1963, by

SA Eldon D. Rudd

(retired). Subsequently, on November 23,

1963, one photograph of this unknown individual was exhibited

to Marguerite Oswald, at Dallas, Texas, by SA Bardwell D.

Odum (retired) in an attempt to determine if the individual

was known to Mrs. Oswald as an associate of her son Lee Harvey

Oswald.

Mrs. Oswald could not identify the photograph as

anyone she knew. X'(M

It is specifically noted that a copy of the photo-

graph exhibited to Marguerite Oswald was furnished to the

Warren Commission on February 11, 1964. Additionally, on

July 16, 1964, by letter addressed to the Honorable J. Lee

Rankin,

the Warren Commission was furnished with affidavits

regarding the source of the photographs and displaying of

same to Mrs. Oswald. (U)

In view of the fact that no tape recordings were

ever provided to the FBI, Questions 2 and 3 of referenced request

are moot and therefore are not being responded to. (U)
