Re New Orleans airtelsto Director, 8/23/53 &

10/11/63.

Referenced airtel reported that NO 12030

advised that telephone number 949-9183, had been

acquired near the New Orleans Fair Grounds and

preparation

for disseminating race horse results

from the New Orleans Fair Grounds to ANGELOAROSSETTI

operator of the Sportsday Weekly in Boston, Mass.

Since the opening of the New Orleans Fair

Grounds Thanksgiving Day, 11/28/63, close contact

"has been maintained with 'NO 1203C. The original

plan to disseminate race horse information directly

from the Fair Grounds was abandoned as ROSSETTI did

not pay for the room to be used to observe the

results of the races.

The property owner wanted

$700 rent for the racing season for this room.

Since the second day of the racing season

JERRY,

BROWN and PAULAKING both of New Orleans,

track

forwarding the racing results to the Sportsday

followers, have been working witr NO 12030 m
