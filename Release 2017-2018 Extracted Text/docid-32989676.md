COORDINATING COMMITTEE

A source advised in July, 1968, that the Los Angeles

Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (IA-SNCC), headquartered

at 7400 South Western Avenue, Los Angeles, California, is not a

membership organization but

a loose-knit agency composed of young

militant, black nationalists from South Los Angeles who have

eliminated all Caucasians from their ranks and have initiated a

program against the draft, the war in Vietnam and discrimination

and have proposed a revolutionary program utilizing armed force,

political and economic action to obtain their goals.

LA-SNCC is

an arm of the National Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

organization headquartered at Atlanta; Georgia, and with the naming

Of LA-SNCC Director RONALD IEROY WITKINS aS Deputy Director of SNCC

fox the west Coast, the affinity between the National and Local

I was al that age anti-American, but out of an instinctive revulsion.

I refused to ba one of the eight or nine Blackflegues from B'ham

so naive that I find her virtually impossible to communicated wit.

I looked at Howard helplessly, I guess, as I folt

clear to me, except thai people on the committee (Davis) are being

told that they are not to mention even casually you name, John's

Fleeta's, Jon's Xias', lichlain's or Ruchell's!

I don't knowssExie

whether that is

supposed to apply to me or not. As I said before,

I really couldn't believe that you would ever accuse me (Fania &

Kendra-too) of consciously working against you.

John's visit the

other day did not help matters much-the only message he brought

that you 'assumed' that since you hadn't heard anything from

me, that I was not Involved in whatever it is that is supposed to

have happenea

This whole thing is still weighing so heavily on

me that it is difficult to talk about anything else..

These last

two weeks

I've done nothing and have hardly been able to think

about anything else, I'm a wreck.,.but only because I love you

so unreservedly.

8/5 How long has it been now, three weeks almost? The whole time

I've been as it in a daze, going through the motions of things

which have long since lost all meaning, desperately trying to reacr

you, but failing in each attempt.

M has been reluctant to cone,

because of what occured the last

time ... I had persuaded H, who

for quite different reasons appears to anois want to avoid

direct

• contact with you,

but when he sot there last week, you were in

court.

John promised he'd come by, but I've seon nor heard nothing

of hin. I think that it will try

to see you today, I think, I hope. l

There's not even Ruchell anymore

to at least assure me that nothing

drastic has happened,

It's been a night mare and I've not been

able to keep myself iron falling into those deep depressions.

Since

I. couldn't receive any word from you, I was all prapared to set up

a meeting for last week or was it wielk before.

COMMUNIST INFILTRATION OF THE

FIRST UNITARIAN CHURCH OF LOS ANGELES

A source advised on May 8, 1968, that the premises

of the First Unitarian Church of Los Angeles, 2936 West oth Street,

Los angeles, california, have been utilized for meetings by Communist

Party members and sympathizers over a period of years.

Speakers

and lecturers at the church frequently espouse Communist causes or

follow the Communist Party line. Communist front group literature

is distributed at the church.

The church is used by some Communist

Party members for "mass concentration" work.

This same infiltration extends to adjuncts of the

church such as the Unitarian Public Forum and the Fellowship

for

Social Justice, formerly known as the Unitarian-Universalist

Fellowship for Social Justice.

STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN has been minister of the church

since 1948.

Reverend STEPHEN H. FRITCHMAN is described in the Fourth

Report, Un-American Activities Committee in California, 1948,

as a very active "Communist fronter"

numerous

page 115'" communist front organizations and activities"

and connected

with

Membership in the First Unitarian Church does not, of

itself, connote membership in or sympathy with the Communist Party.

WASHINGTON, D. C.

On August 21, 1970 a source who is in a position to

furnish reliable information advised the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI) as follows:

"Gentlemen:

"The attached letter was received in the mail

today. Perhaps the times we live in have made

me super-conscious of our nation's security, but

the letter sounds a little shady to me. For

example, wouldn't this be a perfect way for a

foreign

power (or even radical Americans) to deter.

mine what it takes to destroy American industry?

" For all I know, the Institute for Policy

Studies could be

a communist front for an

espionage operation.

"At any rate, we're NOT going to provide Mr.

Raskin with the rather vital information he

asks for... and you may put his letter in your

files in case you decide he also sounds

suspicious to you."

The letter to which the first source is referring was

typed with an IPS letterhead, dated August 17, 1970, and signed

Marcus G. Raskin, Co-director.

The letter was addressed to Granite

City Steel, Public Relations Department, Granite City, Illinois.

cerning this question including, a

Thank you very much."

On August 20, 1970 a secona source who is in a

position to furnish reliable information advised that the Corning

Glass Horks, Corning, New York received a letter from Marcus G.

Raskin, which 1s identical to the one described above.

On 9/22/70 another investigative agency provided the

FBI with information that the Hewlett-Packard Company, Palo

Alto, California also received a copy of the above described

letter from Marcus G. Raskin of the IPS.

—Re-the IPS:

The IPS has been characterized in an article in

the washington, D. C. weekly newspaper,

by Edith Kermit Roosevelt.

dated September 24, 1967 page 2?

that the IPS is a Washington based "Think Factory"

and defensive forces). Waslow and Davis have established

liaison with groups around the country.

A man who once had a place of honor in the office

of president kennedy's iational Security Council, Marcus

heads up IPS's Frogram 2 which at the moment is collecting

information about the men who handle security for the nation's

industrial plants. Raskin, another Liberal Papers author, was

directors, and was an out-spoken critic

of the CIA and the National Security Agency and other intelligence

organizations.

In mid-august Raskin sent a letter to the public

relations departments of 500 American conpanies, informing the

PR men: "I am doing a stuay of the problems of

industrial

security. As a starting point I would appreciate any written

materials which you might

your socurity program.

Thank you very much."

PR men habitually

respond to such inquiries without asking questions themselves.

Contacted by "Comvat"

Raskin said he was doing the research for

a book which would show "the class background and educational

background of the men who head various programs, who are part

of the business elite."

He saidlone of his irorests was to find

out what happened to ex-military africers and ex-fBI agents.

Most American firms will not conceal the background of their

security managers, but when a man who in the past has attacked

national security

prograns (e.g, nuclear testing, Skybolt

missiles, etc. tries to compile

a filing cabinet of dossiers

on the men who guard the country's industrial plants, security

agents are suspicious.

Not suspicious

enough though.

Raskin

told

"Combat" that he has receivea more

than 200 replies.

'Combat" is a nevsletter published by National

Review, Inc., and is described as a Newsletter

that "keeps

you informed about the revolutionary struggle in America today."

A second source, who has Iurnished reliable informa-

tion in the past, advised

on December 9, 1970 that li haa come

to his attention

that such

an inquiry had been received by the

Corporate Information Section of the Corporate Relations Divi-

sion, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, New York, la number of

months ago.

A brief reply was directed to the sender informing

him that such

l information as that requested was not available.

A chira source, who has lurnished reliable intormation

in the past, advised on December 9, 1910 that the Industrial

knagement counci. of Rochester, which maintains contact wiür

Industrial Management personnel from Rochester Iirms, was

aware of contact made by dis with the xerox corporation and the

matter was brought up at one of the Industrial Management

meetings, primarily to alert responsible persons to the possi

such an inquiry fron raskin.

No additional

information has come to the sources' attention of any additional

contacts with local industry.

Re the IPS:

IPS has been characterized in an

article in

the washington, Del. weekly newspapers

"The

Examiner"

dated September 24, 190% page 22, by

EDITH KERMIT, ROOSEVELT.

stated in part

the IPS is a Washington based "Think Factory"

which helped train extremists who incite violence

in U.S, cities, and whose educational research

serves as a cover for intrigue anapolitical agi-l

tation.

Through its conference and seminars,

the IPs exerts a continuing influence on the

ideology and tactics of the New Left.

Re MARCUS GOODMAN RASKIN:

RASKIN has been publicly described as Co-director and

I'custee of the IeS; AB University of Chicago; JP University of

Chicago Law School; Trustee of Antioch College, associate

editor of

"Ramparts Magazine,"

and author of many articles on

public policy.

"Ramparts" is a monthly magazine with editorial

offices in San

September 10, 1967 issue

of the "Denver Post"

contained

an article on "Ramparts" which states

in part that it is

INSTITUTE FOR POLICY STUDIES

The Institute For Polie, Studies (IRS), has been

described as the "think tank" of the New left and is self

described as a non-profit, non-taxable, independent center

"or research, eaucation and social invention on public policy

problems.

On August 23, 1972, a confidential source who

has furnished reliable Information in the past, advised that

meeting of IPS fellows was held in Washington D...C. (WDC), bh

1972. Among those present vere Marçus Raskin, Karl Hess,

Leonard Rodberg, Robert: Borosage and Ralph, pravins.

The Fellous were informed that a donor was interested

in funding an International Institute to be established by IPS

In general, the discussion raised the following questions

regarding such a grant.

1. What is the donor's view of the International

Institute and how does his view affect IPS options with

regard to the proposal?

when might Its expect such a grant?

(Raskin suggested early 1973, as a bikely date.

2.

what direccions have been taken by people in

other countries and what sort oi Internacional Institute would

relate to those directions and how? How would such an Institute

positively or negatively affect che direction and coherance oi

IPs and the importance of dealing with this aspect of the

proposed funds?

3. Whether IPS should try

to build an International

Institute dealing the the Third World or Europe, or whether

that is the choice.

Whether

• the money could be

used to fund

various international groups on a project basis.

Whether such

projects would be supported on an on-going basis in terms of years.

Dear Mr. Steadman:

As I explained to you when you were kind enough

to grant me an interview wich yourself and Mr. Howard

C. Anderson, vice president and General Counsel or CuP:

the Federation of American Scientistss-l00king into ine

question of privacy of communications with a view to in-

foring our members. I have left you with three requests.

I wanted to know the number of persons who lad âsked C & P

to check their lines with a view to possible evescropping..

I wanted to speak to the management of the security depar

ment that conducts such checks.

And I wanted the privilege

of interviewing some of the men who deal directly with

customers in installing and checking phones.. I appre-

ciate your wiliingness to consider these

requests ano

"I look forward to your response.

As I mentioned io you over the telephone, I am

still confused about certain questions and wonder if,

the sake of precision, l migne snice you about chem.

The fact of the matter is

that I have received conflicting

reports on some of these questions.

1. As far as is known to 6&.!, representatives

of other Government agencies do not a) own trucks

m that are designed to give the impression that they

are telephone company trucks; b) send their personnal into

homes along with C& P personnel (whether with Goverment

warrants or otherwise) in such a way as to create tre

illusion that both are repair men c) otherwise represent

themseives direcily or indirectly, as telephone company

personnel..

is this correct?

As far as is known to C&?, has any telephone compary

amployee ever been disciplined or fired for electronic evesáropping

whether authorized or unauthorized. How comon is this?

3. You have advised me that the telephone company does not "place

the taps" that may be authorized by court order.

a) lease lines for that purpose b) supervise the placing of the caps

that purpose b)

Does it, however,

c) otherwise cooperate in the placing of the tap.

ordered evesdropping that may use the telephore lines, does the teie

phone company cooperate min law enforcement officiais those warrant

You have advised me that, apart from national security eves.

dropping; the telephone company advises persons on shose lines eves..

cropping devices are found that such devices have been found, even if the

devices were placed by court order.

You said that this is cone after

i the Department of justice is notified.

. May I see a blank copy of à

form advising a private party that evesdropping had been going on on his

line? How many persons were advised that such devices had been found

over the last few years?

How many devices have been found? How many

persons issued requests for inspection of their lines? Are repores of

these statistics made to the F.G.C.?

5. Does the telephone company have written procedures for

verifying and handling requesis of the Federal Government for coopera-

cion in national security evesdropping cases? Is it satisfied that

ali requesis made to it, in this regard, by the Justice Department,

military intelligence agencies and/or the CiA were personally authorized

by the Attorney General acting for the president?

6.

Has the telephone company-found evidence of wiretapping by

Soviet or Eastern European agents?

7: Has the telephone company ever uncovered a bugging device in

the office, or at the home, of a Congressman or Senator? I do not wish

to know particulars of a private nature, of course.

Let me thank you in advance for helping me with these questions.

As you know, a sizable number of persons seriously question the security

of their telephone lines.

A complete and full answer to these questions

would, I am sure, allay many or the anxieties my members feel.

Mr. Bolger:

I am writing to you as Director of the Federation

of American Scientisis to request an interview to

discuss certain aspecis of telephone company involvement

in bugging and wire tapping. The Federation is interested

in such

matters with a view to encouraging appropriate

congressional

action.

If you or one of your associates

could discuss these sensitive questions with me, it would

be most helpful.

MEMORANDUM FOR FILI:

Re: Intervicw with Dr. Jeremy J. Stone

In responss to Dr. Stone's letter to ii. Bolger, a copy os

which is attached, I called Di. Stone on January 7, and arranged io

meet with him on January 8 at 2:30 p.r. in my oifice. Howaxa C.

Anderson was present during most of the meeting.

In response to our inquiry, Di. Stone described the Federation:

of American Scienüsts as à nonprost organization interesiea in legistative

action with respect to issues allecting science and society. With respect

to himself, Di. Stone stated that he held à doctorate in mathematics,

although ho was not actively pursuing that discipline at this time. He

indicated that he had recently written on political subjects, and that

his current activity was directed toward political and social problems.

Di. Stone stated that he was interested in our procedures 10r

handling national security and other authoriced wiretapping. he was tola

that we had specific procedures for handling court-ordered wiretapping

wnich we would outline for him, but that we would not discuss national

security wiretapping and that this aspect of the aubject should properly be

'discussed with the Federal agencies involved.

Dr. Stone expressed dissatisfaction with our refusal to discuas

national security wiretapping; he stated that one of his concerns is that

uncontrolled cooperation beiween the "'bureaucracies" of the Telephone

Company and the I. B.I: was a distinct possibility and would impose a

Ecal nazard to the legitimale privacy of individuals. He expressed a

strong iceling that this arca was a legitimate concern for organizations

such as his, and that a réfusal to discuss the subject was unwarranteà.

We repeated that we would not discuss national security wire-

tapping, and that anything that was said did not apply io this area. With

respect to court-ordered wiretapping, we statea that our practice was

that an employee of the Company would inspect the court oider io

determine that it was valia on its face before any cooperation yas given.

Di. Stone asted to see the form on which a record of suca inspaction

.was mâce. . He stated that the procedure for inspection would undoubiecy

require a lorm and be appeared areptical oi pur statements wit respeci

to our practice. Ho continued to talk di thaaation di the Irrimana

made to the F. C.C., and we said that we did not know whether any such

that our craitsmen knew all about it; and that the Company should

The NYO has summarized the above letter in the IHM

in an effort to further conceal the confidential source.

Boston is requested to ascertain if the writer of

this communication is identical to the son of the long-time

CP member, ISIDOR FEINSTEIN STONE. If identical, Boston

should handle in accordance with instructions contained in

Section 105k of the Manual of Instructions.

Boston should also be alerted to the fact that the

Soviet Intelligence Service is especially interested in

cultivating and using persons of STONe's caliber.

It is

extremely possible that if STOne is the son of the long-

time CP member, the KGB may be aware of this and could

possibly utilize some way to approach. STONE while he is in

MOSCOW.
