SA F. X. Jahn,

senior Resident Agent, Hyattsville, Maryland,

called at 12:30 p.m., 8/2/58; to advise that he was preparing a teletype to

the Bureau concerning a possible conspiracy to violate the Neutrality Act and

other Federal statutes which was brought to his attention by BA 1154-C this

morning.

The informant told of being approached by three men at 9:50 a.m.

today who broached the idea of his obtaining a large amount of arms and

ammunition by stealth or by means of bribery from the warehouse of the

Interarms Company, a munitions dealer in Alexandria, Virginia.

The three

men told the informant they were returning to Miami by plane and that he

should reach them there by telephone on Sunday or Monday at the latest to

advise of progress he was making in obtaining these arms.

One of these individuals was known to informant as Al Dobek or

Dobeck, informant was not sure how name was spelled. He described Dobek

as a seedy character who will do anything for a buck. Dobek told informant

that he was now employed as a security officer at the DeauvilleHotel, Miami,

Florida, and was acting as a go-between for his two companions whom he

introduced as Ed Browder and "Reds."

Inasmuch as this appeared to be primarily a netrality matter and

since there had been no violation of any statute within the supervision of this

division, the facts were furnished to SA J. G. Short, who was on duty in

Mr. Belmont's Office. SA Jahn advised that the purpose of his call was to

enable the Bureau to begin checking on Dobek in advance so that appropriate

action could be taken in this matter without delay.
