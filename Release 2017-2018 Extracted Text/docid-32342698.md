MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Contact with Mr. William Pawley in Miami, 21 March 1960

l'Ime, 1200 hours; Mr. Pawley's Office

Subject was contacted at the express request of Chief, WHD. The

following Items of operational importance were covered:

Final details for a strategy meeting involving Chief, WHD.

CITASTE, Mr. Pawley, and Chief, Branch 4 were discussed.

agreed that the group would convene the second and third of April

at Mr. Pawley's Miami home.

Further details and the agenda were not

discussed other than to say that principal emphasis would be on

reviewing what work could be done throughout the hemisphere and

public opinion on the pending operation against CASTRO.

b.

Mr. Pawley was

told that the time had arrived for careful

coordination of. all activities; that permission hal been granted

for an all-out operation; a government in exile will be formed post

haste; that the acceptable non-BATISTA groups will be put into con-

tact with each other almost immediately; and that Mr. Pawley's contact,

RUBIO Padilla, will figure prominently in this effort.

suggested, and it was agreed, that immediate plans should be made

for the exfiltration of RUBIO from Habana.

It was carefully explained to Mr. Pawley that any action

Involving exiles now should be most carefully coordinated with

Chief, WED and Chief, Branch 4 to avoid any flaps. He agreed to this

arrangement.

2.

Mr. Pawley passed to Chief, Branch 4 some very sensitive information

concerning the Dominican Républic.

He requested this information not be passed

beyond CIA until he, had the opportunity to give this information directly to

Vice President Nixon.

In point of fact, he initially said he diân't want the

information passed on to Chief, WED.

Chief, Branch 4 replied that he could not

agree to this arrangement since he was obligated to pass the information on.

Chief, Branch 4 said, however, in view of the fact he was not returning to

Washington until 22 March, he could not pass the information on prior to that

time.

Mr. Pawley said he would relay the information himself before that date,

so the question was settled amicably. As it turned out, Chief, WHD had already

received the information via another channel by the time Chief, Branch 4 had, fi

returned to Washington.
