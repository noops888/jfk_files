MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT:

Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on

Operation Mongoose, Thursday, S April 1962

PRESENT:

General Taylor, Mr. Johnson, MI. Gilpatric, Mr. McCone

and General Parker

1.

Johnson reported that the Italian representative at

the UN

has now been briefed on the proposal to approach the Cubans

wich an o

of food or medicine in exchange for the Playa Giron

pilsoners.

le noted that no specifics had been agreed on, and the

first

would be for the purpose of establishing in principal

che possibility of such an exchange.

Mr. McCone reiterated that all reports of Cuban inter-

in the Hemisphere are proving to have no substance when they

are actually run down.

In answer to General Taylor's question as to

what the U.S. might do if hard evidence of this kind is obtained,

Mr. Johnson pointed out that a subcoumittee of the OAS, on security,

had been auchorized at Punta del Este.

This coumittee was given the

authority to mobilize multi-national action against the Castro regime

in the event that such hard information is obtained. It was agreed

that whatever information becomes available should be given to General

White, who is the U.S. representative on this subcommittee.

Ms. McCone said that after studying the possibility of

using

Guwan air crews, CIA had concluded that they would not be

suitable for supply drops at night. On the other hand, trained U.s.

civilian crews could be provided by Civil Air Iransport (CAT) in 30

days. Arrangements could be made to have these pilots ostensibly

employed by Cuban exile groups in the U.S. and, therefore, they would

be non-attributable to che U.S. Government. He said that available

Cubans could then be used for less demanding missions such as leaflet

drops. There appeared to be a general feeling on the part of the

Group members that U.S. civillans of this type would not be essentially

different than "shees

Nipped" personnel in the event that any were

shot down over Cuba.
