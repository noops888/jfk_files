INFORMANTS (CONT'D)

Careful consideration has been given to each source

concealed and T symbols were utilized in the report only in

those instances where the identities of the sources must be

concealed.

ADMINISTRATIVE

JOSEPH KONOWE (T-2) advised that he is a personal

friend of VICTOR RIESEL, that he knows RIESEL has accepted

gifts from HYMAN POWELL of the Jewelry Workers Union, and

that although he has no positive evidence, he felt that RIESEL

was on DIOGUARDI's payzoll in some way or

another.

KONOWE stated that DIOGUARDI had paid RIESEL'S

expenses for a trip to Miant in the winter of 1956.

questioned further on this point, KONOWE said,

"I haven't

seen the actual hotel bills. Don't ask me how I know.

know.

This is more than a presumption"

(It should be noted

that

It has been previously reported that RIESEL has exhibited

cancelled checks covering his stay in Miami Beach, Florida.)

KONOWE said that he belleved that DIOGUARDI may

have taken a contract from someone

higher un, or that DIOGUARDI

and RIESEL may have had a personal

falling out, because RIESEL

may have double crossed him in some way.

He stated that 1f

DIOGUARDI had taken a contract, that he must not have known

that RIESEL would have been hit with acid.

KONOWE, expressed

the belief that DIOGUARDI and RIESEL had probably had a

personal falling out.
