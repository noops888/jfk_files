organize a picket demonstration at the UN in conjunction

with the visit of Cuban President DORTICOS to the UN.

NY T-24 informed that LEE told MEDIAVILLA it was difficult

and that he had already initiated arrangements for an

FPCC demonstration on a national basis, which he then

hoped to hold on October 30, 1962.

According to NY T-24

IEE stated that in connection with the national demonstration

which he was then working on, he had communicated with

people in Chicago, California, and

Canada, and had also

notified all FPCC chapters and FPCC student councils.

IEE said, NY T-24 advised,

that he felt five demonstrations

occurring on the same date across the country would produce

effective publicity.

According to NY I-24, LEE further

informed MEDIAVILLA that he could now rally many people

to demonstate against the United States going to war, "but

he added that these people were not all pro-CASTRO, merely

anti-war.(*(Ul)

NY T-27 advised on October 5, 1962 that he had

been in contact with NEDIAVILIA at the

MEDIAVILIA informed NY I-27 he had called LEE into his office

to specifically request LEE to organize a picket demonstratior

sufficient time to alert FPCC supporters and would not have

enough money for paper and stamps to handle the mailing of

notices to FPCC supporters.

that the FPCC happened to be at that moment in the process

of preparing a mailing to all New York members of the FPCC

and that the mailing expenses would be about $60.00 in

stamps plus $15.00 miscellaneous expenses for a total of

about $75.00.

LEE said that the CMUN spokesman promised

to have the money that night at the Casa Cuba Club and

that the money was to be given to ANSELMO RODRIGUEZ, a

member of the FPCC and also a member of the Casa Cuba, for

relay to

LEE so that the necessary stamps could be purchased.
