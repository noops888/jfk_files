with the CP he received a great deal of literature from

numerous organizations.

any money to the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Council.

It is noted that the

subject was a very

aifficult individual to interview, inasmuch as he appeared

to be unable to concentrate on any

one subject and his mind

seemed to wander from one subject to another.

For example,

oneone occasion the subject was talking of the successes

of the European Aid Program In France and Western Germany.

mentally adjusted individual.

The subject was questioned concerning the

individuals that he had been associated with in the CP.

He

said that he did not wish to furnish the names of any

individuals with whom he had been associated in the CP, as

his friends in the Party had since become anti-Communists,

and that he did not wish to cause them any unpleasantness.

Upon additional questioning, the subject declined to furnish

the names of any of his former associates in the CP.

However,

he stated that in the event any infornation ever came to his

would certainly notify the FBI. The subject appeared to

be

sincere in his anti-Communist views.
