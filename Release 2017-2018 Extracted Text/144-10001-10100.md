For

Our

Everything points to the continuation of the internal

struggle [B val based] on the political interpretation of KENNEDY's assassi-

nation.

Immediately after the attempt,

the initial commentaries linked it

with the racist movement, which assumed the offensive by rallying themselves

around the efforts of the Texas police in order to saddlé OSWALD, a reputed pro

CASTRO activist who two years ago wanted to remain in the USSR, with the

responsibility for the attempt.

The arrest of Cubars wás begun in Dallas.

GOLDWATER, who yesterday refused to comment on the assassination, joined the

campaign.

Radio and television suspended all their programs and —- with minor

exceptions which included ABC directed among others by the former EISENHOWER

It is anticipated that immediately after the funeral personal intrigue will

begin. Speculation of RUSK's resignation are being repeated (possible succes-

sors, FULBRIGHT or HARRIMAN If JOHNSON is determined to continue the present

relations with the USSR and BUNDY or perhaps someone comparable but thus far

an unknown politician if he decides to lead the Democratic party to the

elections on a wave of hardfast foreign policy).
