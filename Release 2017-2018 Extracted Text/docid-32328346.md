On February 4, 1972, Intemal Revenue Service

Agent JOE WONDERSHIDE advised

ÜFk Law 11 (a)

by MM 2462-PCI.

MM 2462-PCI is a commercial pilot and presently

flies GREENFIELD to Vero Beach, Florida where GREENFIELD

is engaged in an oyster and clam meat business.

MM 2462-PCI

that he saw DAVE YARAS in GREENFIELD'S office

twice and both times YARAS was accompanied by MAX

ROTHETELD. ROTHFIELD invested in Meter Maid Industries

in return for 70,000 shares of stock which GREENFIELD

ROTHFIELD was also investing $25,000 innthe

now defunct First American Investment Fund.

The fund

was located in the Cayman Islands and was managed by .

BERNARD HOROWTTZ.

ROTHFIELD's former address is 5801 Sheridan

He was born in

1914 and married to CLARETA.

is a go-between for YARAS and GREENFIELD.

STEWART GREENFIELD, as Vice-President of Whirl-O-Wash,

Incorporated, filed an affidavit in Bankruptcy Court

listing the ten largest creditors of the company.
