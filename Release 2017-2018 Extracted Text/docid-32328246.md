ADMINISTRATIVE

Since there has been no indication that

subject has been in the Cleveland area and since CV 428-C

has ascertained that BAPST's relationship with DOMINICK

EDWARD BARTONE is reportedly in connection with

importing sugar from Cuba, transshipped to the

United States through another island, no further inquiries

concerning subject will be made at this time at Cleveland

in order to avoid the possibility of compromising CV 428-c.

It is noted that in the report of SA STAFFORD

dated December 30, 1960 at Miami, it was reported that

subject indicated he had gone to

the Dominican Republic

a "sugar deal"
