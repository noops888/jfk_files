intention of pernitting FPCC policy to be determined by any

other organization.

This source stated that Lee believed

that the FPCC should advocate resumption of diplomatic

relations between Cuba and the United States and should

support the right of cubans to manage their revolution

without interference from other nations. Lee did not

advocate supporting the Cuban revolution per se.

The November 23, 1963, edition of "The New York

Times" reported that Senator Thomas J. Dodd of Connecticut

had called FPCC "the chief public relations instrument of

the Castro network in the United States."

It is to be noted

that Senator Dodd was a member of the Senate Internal

Security Subcommittee which twice conducted hearings on

the FPCC.

The December 27, 1963, edition of "The New York

World Telegran and Sun" newspaper stated that the pro-Castro

FPCC was seeking to go out of business and that its prime

activity during its lifetime had been sponsorship of pro-

castro street rallies and mass picket lines,

and the

direction of an active propaganda mill highlighting illegal

travel-to-Cuba campaigns.

Its comparatively brief span of

life was attributed to mounting anti-Castro American public

opinion, the 1962 Congressional hearings which disclosed

FPCC financing by Castro's United Nations Delegation, and

ultimately, the bad publicity which the FPCC received from

disclosure of activities on its behalf by suspected

presidential assassin Lee H. Oswald.

On February 6, 1964, the previously mentioned

second source advised that V. T. Lee had recently remarked

19 %., T.

that the FPCC was dead and that there were no plans to

organize another similar organization.

On April 13, 1964, a third source advised that

there had not been any FPCC activity in many months and

that the FPCC had been dissolved.
