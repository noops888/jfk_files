REi

morning of 11/14/67 at subject's home, 3908 Clifford Drive,

Metairie, La., and business office, Town & Country Motel,

1225 Airline Highway, New Orleans, failed to locate subject.

NO 1457-C-TE telephonically advised on the afternoon

of 11/14/67 that JOHN LaBRUZZO and CARLOS MARCELLO left New

of 11/16/67.

NO 1457-C-TE advised that before he left on this

trip, MARCELLO indicated that CAMILLE GRAVEL, General Counsel,

Labor Rackets Committee of Louisiana, has resigned; however,

this information will not be made public for several weeks.

Informant had the feeling that MARCELLO may have had something

to do with forcing GRAVEL to resign. Informant stated that

of all the probes on organized crime currently being conducted

in Louisiana, GRAVEL's committee was the only one that worried

MARCELLO.
