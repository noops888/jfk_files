have been checked for material relevant to the subject of this

cations of which has the aeror white assigned ed of communi-

in the period July 1970 to July 1973. Nothing pertinent was found.

2. I have attempted to recollect any other details which

1 The only points which I recall but

on which I have no documentation are these:

by American residents of/

about the reported presence

at no time did Hunt contact me, and I have never ingwn of his

having tried to contact any Station personnel int

the period 1970-73. I made no effort personally to ascertain

whether or not Hunt was in Spain, and I had no effort made by

any Station member.

b. A Station,officer, possiblyL

was given some information by an

now

assignant in 1972 cordern, giveported activittis in Spain

by Robert Vesco. I suggested that the information be given

informally to the Embassy's Economic Section chief, John

0liver.

That officer was charged with keeping abreast of

developments related to Vesco.

The Station did not pursue

that subject, as I recall, because it was not a topic of

reportable interest, according to requirements of the period.
