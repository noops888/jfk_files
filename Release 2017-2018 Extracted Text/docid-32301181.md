JFK Act 6 (4)

PG 92-236

New Kensington, Pa., Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK and the

majority of his City Councilmen have been

"owned" by

the MANNARINOs since their election approximately eight

years ago.. At one time, L

at the instructions

of KELLY MANNARINO, "wired" the New Kensington City

Council chambers so that tape recordings of the proceedings

could be made.

Chier JOHN BORDONARQ,, New Kensington,

Pa., Police Depart-

ment, is the personal selection for the job of KELLY

MANNARINO.

It is noted that Mayor RAYMOND GARDLOCK of New Kensington

was defeated in the primary elections of May, 1961, and

will not be a candidate for re-election in the general

elections of November, 1961.

The

August 29, 1961, edition of the "Daily Dispatch,"

editorial is as follows:

"That the Mannarino mob owns the administration

I Mayor raymond t. Gardlock Lock, stock ano

barrel and has absolute control of Chief John

Bordonaro's police department as conclusively

demonstrated to the satisfaction of even the most

skeptical last Thursday during the raid on the

notorious gambling casino.

"For three hours not a policeman showed up to

regulate traffic in the vicinity or to control a

crowd upwards of 500 which formed while the

federal

agents were at work.

ITo offer the excuses

was happening is ridiculous and no one in his

right mind will believe it. You can be sure that

police officials knew all along exactly what was

happening

and that the failure to send officers

to the scene was deliberate. And they also knew

right along of the existence of the casino and yet

never raised a linger against it.

To ask why

they failed to act is needless - everyone knows.
