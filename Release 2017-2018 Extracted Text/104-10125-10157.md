racial violence potential in the

United States.

Its contents were derived from public

CONRUENTAL

OVERVIEW

Continuing Racial Tension

After three consecutive summers of racial

turbulence in the United states, there were hopes that

che social, economic, and political gains achieved by

the Negro in recent

years might be alleviating racial

unrest and strife.

Civil rights legislation, antipoverty

programs, and better police-community relations have

brought a

treatment measure of improvement in the status and

of Negroes, but discontent and frustration

persist.

'Race relations have deteriorated in a number

of cities throughout the country during the past year.

Seasonal Phenomenon

We are now in the midst of a

an era of protracted

racial conflict that has produced

a crisis in law enforce-

ment.

Along with the

annual seasonal rise in summertime

crime, it is painfully evident that racial turmoil has

similarly become a summer phenomenon.

The racial violence

potential is especially high in hot weather in the Nation's

urban areas because large numbers of Negroes, living

under crowded, depressed conditions in ghettos, take to

the streets to escape the heat and seek relaxation and

recreation.

The situation is compounded by the restiveness

and alienation of large numbers of icle junior and senior

high school students

and other Negro youths.

Because of

the combustible temper of the times, an inconsequential

Incident can ignite a riotous situation in any city or town

in the country.

Another Riotous Summer

The Spring of 1967 has already witnessed almost

daily outbreaks of racial disorder somewhere in the country.

All signs point toward recurrent racial convulsions through-

out the country this summer--more than likely on an even

wider scale than in previous years--marked by plundering,

arson, destruction, and attacks on law enforcement officers.

There is the added danger this year that the scenes of

racial strife in large cities might spread from Negro

11

cosmunities into white neighborhoods and that increased

numbers of white people might resort to violence in an

effort to counter Negro demonstrators or rioters. The

threat of racial violence hangs heavy over every urban

cormunsty in the land. In an atnosphere of ever-present

tension, violence can strike anywhere at any time with

all the unpredictability, rapidity, and destructiveness

of a tornado.

Civil Rights Linked with Vietnam

Host of the riots and disturbances of the past

three years have been spontaneous eruptions of mob

violence, triggered by sone trivial incident and fueled

by teen-age-Negro youths and various. lawless and

Irresponsible ghetto elenents. But incessant agitation

and propaganda on the part of cormunists and other

aunists and otrouted

subversives and extrenists have definitely contributed

to Negro unrest and fomented Violence: In particular,

demagogues like Hartin Luther Kang, Stokely Carmichael,

Floyd Hellssick, Cassius, Clay, and. Dick Gregory have

fanned the fires of racial discord and animosity.

King

has nor Joined Caraichael,, Mckissics, and other

civil

rights extrenists in embracing the consunist tactic of

linking the civil rights novement with the anti-Vietnan-

war protest movement, claiming that United States

*

Involvesent in Vietnan 1s diverting attention from civil

rights.

King's exhortation to boycott

the draft and refuse

to fight could lead eventually to dangerous displays of

civil disobedience and near-seditious activities by Negroes

and whites alike.

Thus, the antivar campaign endorsed.

by King helps to promote comunist aims and progrars in

the United States and abroad.

MORE RACIAL TROUBLE PREDICTED

Ominous Warnings

Each spring of the past few years has evoked

prognostications from Negro spokesmen and public officials

in cities with substantial Negro populations to the effect

that the ensuing summer months would see outbursts of

racial violence. This spring the prophecies have been more

numerous and more ominous than ever, particularly those

voiced by Negro leaders.

"The war in Vietnam has

strengthened the forces

of bigotry and reaction," declared Martin Luther King,

President of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCLC).: "It has caused many young people to become

disenchanted with our society. The failure to solve

problems of our cities will only exacerbate the situation,

and give the extremists on both sides a much more receptive

• audience.

Polarization of the race question in the

United States won't merely mean outbreaks of violence.

It

will mean outright race

wars in

"some of our cities."

At least ten cities actoss the country were

described by King as "powder kegs" which could explode

into racial violence this summer. Among those cities he

listed were New York City, Newark, Washington, Cleveland,

Chicago, Los Angeles, and

'the Bay area of California,

including Onkland.

Sporadic youth-led riots throughout the country

must be expected this summer and every summer for the

next decade, Bruce Coles, Program Director for the Chicago

Young Men's

Christian

Association, told the House

Education Subcommittee.

The continuing tumult, according

can be traced to a conflict between the promises

of an eatient society and society's limited ability to

spread that affluence around.. Unable to get jobs and rise

out of the slums, the youngsters mostly teen-age Negro

boys--simply "blame whitey and raise hell," he said.

lead to unprecedented explosions

In 1967," garned

Edward Rutledge and Jack E. Hood, Executive Director and

Associate Executive Director of the National Conittee

Against Discriaination in Housing, in an annual report.

Rutledge and Wood, who forecast racial disorders in 1965

and 1966, drew their conclusions from & study conducted

1n 41 cities and 25 states during 1986.

" Rutledge and Hood claimed they found a conviction

among Hegro youth that progress in civil rights will be

achieved through social turnoil, and they repeatedly

heard such consents in ghettos

as "Je need two and a half

more riots to got out of here."

declared

Floyd lickissick, National Director of

the Congress of

Racial Equality (CORE).' McKissick placed Cleveland at

the top of his list of trouble spots, along with most

New Jersey cities.

Other cities he enumerated were

New York City; Washington; Detroit; Chicago; Gary, Indiana;

St. Louis; East St. Louis, Illinois; Los Angeles;

San Francisco; and Oakland..

'A Negro sociologist at Howard University,

Dr. Nathan Hare, soes a "very real" possibility of

civil war between whites and Negroes in the United States.

"It's going to be quite a while off yet though not so

far off as to be outside of our life span," he said.

Dr. Fare, who describes himself as a "theorist" in the

"black power" novement, is actively spreading its

philosophy to Negro colleges across the country.

"Violence is the only way left to the black

man to achieve his nanhood in America," Ernest Chambers,

& leader of young militants in Omaha, told delegates to

the National Conference on Conmunity

Values and Conflict

In New York City. He said that "violence purges the

soul of the black man and returns to hin his self-respect."

Chambers maintained that prevention of racial violence

was up to the white people.

They must realize, he said,

that tojustice is practiced daily against the Negro and

that Negro youths will no longer put up with it.

The key to racial peace this summer, observed

Roy Wilkins, Executive Director of the National Association

for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), is jobs for

the thousands of young Negroes who will be turned loose

from school "with muscles in their arms and mischief in

their minds."

With "one out of three Negro teen-agers

wandering around," he said, "you are going to have trouble."

Wilkins expressed the hope

that there would be no riot in

any city, and added: "But I can't say there won't because

all the ingredients

are there."

Public officials in a nunber of large cities

have exprèssed considerable apprehension about the

possibility of racial violence this year. Mayor John V.

Lindsay, of New York City, asserted that "we have no way

of knowing what this summer will bring but we do know

that if violence breaks out,. the young people oi the

ghettos will be in its vanguard."

He has called upon the

administration to restore cuts'in antipoverty funds for

summer youth activities or face the threat of rioting in

Negro ghettos this summer.

Disturbances' áre likely in the Nation's capital

this summer, according

to Walter N. Tobriner, a District

of Columbia

Commissioner, unless funds for recreational

programs for school children are approved. If youthful

energy is not channeled constructively, he cautioned,

"I am sure

that increased vandalism, destruction, and

other antisocial hehavior would tend to result.."

added: "Of course, we can never assume summer peace,

since incidents fanning neighborhood reaction are neitber

foreseeable nor controllable. But we can, by providing

these funds, make the occurrence of summer incidents less

likely

and their enlargement to other areas less apt to

OCcur. "

Mayor Ivan Allen, Jr., of Atlanta, observed

• that "in any big city with

major slum problems, incidents

amounting almost to riots can occur at any time during

the hot summer months

whenever there is

Leadership that finds an incident that can be exploited.

There is

always some incident that provocative leaders

can use if they want."

Familiar Pattern

The forebodings of recent years have been amply

justified in view of the extensive riotous conditions

that have developed in the United States during the past

three summers.

Events have unmistakably shown that any

municipality in the country with a Negro population is

susceptible to a racial outbreak.

A partial listing of

citles and towngwhere

racial disorders have occurred since

1964 indicates that racial disorders can happen anywhere

and

everywhere at any time: New York City; Rochester,

New York; Philadelphia; Jersey City; Cleveland; Dayton,

Ob10; Lansing, Michigan; Chicago; Haukegan, Iilinois;

Omaha; San Francisco; Los Angeles; Atlanta; Fort Lauderdale,

Florida; and Bogalusa, Louisiana.

It is obviously

impossible to pinpoint when and where racial violence will

erupt.

But there is

the pattern it will

In virtually every instance where major riots

have broken out in Negro' communities in recent years, the

pattern and sequence of events bawe been identical:

escalation of an initial minor episode involving police

action; a

rapidly growing. crowd and mounting excitement

and hysteria fomented by troublemakers, extremists, and

subversives; overt hostility toward the police, accompanted

by wild charges of "police brutality"; the explosion of

blind, irrational nob fury and action; street fighting

between Negroes and police; hurling of rocks, bricks,

bottles, fire bombs, and other objecte; looting, vandalism,

and arson; and, finally, summoning of police reserves and

frequently the National

Guard to restore law and order.

The survey on the following pages endeavors to

highlight the violence potential which exists in the

United States

as the Summer of 1967 draws near.

An organization known as BUILD (Build,

Unity,

Independence, Liberty, and Dignity, was formed in

January, 1967,

under

contract with the Industrial Areas

Foundation (IAF), a community organizing agency with

headquarters in Chiçago.

IAF, which is headed by

Saul Alinsky as Exeçutive Director, has been active

organizing the poor- mostly Negroes-in Chicago, Burialo,

and Rochester, New. York:

BUILD has publicly announced that it will organize

the entire Negro community in Buffalo on a "grass roots"

level for the purpose of building a coalition to apply

pressure on the existing "white pover structure" of the

city.

The major issue for organizing the community will

be school integration.

If racial tensions increase this summer, it

can well be because BUILD has heated up an issue rightly

or wrongly-in order to find a magnetic argument.

BUILD'S

President, Reverend Frank Emanuel, is regarded by

responsible clergy and others as not only uninformed about

the

true conditions in Buffalo but also intellectually

dishonest. It is the present intent of the responsible

Authorities are looking rather apprehensively

toward the recurrence of two racial incidents of the past

year.

Both of these involved attempts by demonstrators

to force admittance of Negroes to privately ouned amuse

ment areas; the Rock Lake Swimming Pool in South Charleston

and the Skateland Skating Rink in Charleston..

On both

occasions, the demonstrators were refused entry. Negro

denonstrators at the pool were few, and their attempts to

gain admission did not result in violence.

However, a

second demonstration at the skating rink in January, 1967,

involved 60 Negroes and whites from West Virginia State

College and was led by a militant white gtudent named

William Weimer.

The incident, resulted in 34 arrests for

trespassing and disorderly conduct.

with destruction of property and assaulting a police

again when and if violence erupts.

This source states that if he were asked to

pinpoint an area where violence night break out, he rould

designate the East New York section of Brooklyn, into

which Negroes are noving fron the Bedford-Stuyvesant

section.

These Negroes,

he says, are encountering ant-

mosity Iron the longtime residents of East New York.

Therefore, the seeds of trouble are being sown.

Another informed source feels that violence

potential exists in Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant.

Recent statements, this source says, made by Negro

leaders such as Martin Luther King and Stokely Carmichael

have not had a calming effect gh the Negro people.

Rather,

they have served to fodts attention on

i the

possibility that violenoe

is inevitable.

Furthermore,

this source believes, the

treatment accorded Adam Clayton

Powell in Congress and Cassius Clay in his attenpt to

avoid the draft-regardless of nether or not they deserved

It-has served to intensify Negro resentnent and bitterness.

All these factors contribute to racial tension, according

to this source, and when the ingredients of hot weather,

unemployment, and restless youths are added, there is

definitely an increase in the possibility of racial

violence "this sumer, in New York City.

Much Negro resentnent was engendered when the

House of Representatives voted, early in March, 1967, to

•exclude Adan Clayton Powell from membership in Congress

for misuse of funds and unbecoming conduct.

Many Negroes

In New York City and elsewhere in the country regard this

punishment as unusually harsh and an expression of white

racisn®

They charge that he was singled out for punish

ment because of his race, rather than because his

behavior

differed from that of other Congressmen. Moreover, in

view of the softer punishuent that Negroes believe

be meted out to Senator Dodd by his colleagues in the

Senate, many Negroes are angered by what they feel is the

application of a double standard of conduct by Congress

One

clergyman regards the racial situation in

Rochester as tense.. There are, he points out, several

small groups of Negro young men who are militant and

restless and who want FIGHT (Freedon, Integration, God,

Honor - Today), a local militant civil rights organizs-

tion, to speak out and take more positive action in

demanding an improvement in Negro conditions.

According to a city official, the general

apprehension about the likelihood of racial violence

is based on the follozing factors: (1) a prediction of

a "long, hot sunner" by the Director of FIGHT; (2) failure

by local, state, and Federal agencies to improve housing,

recreational facilities, and sanitation procedures in

Negro areas, and (3) congregation of Negro youths on city

streets.

FIGIT, which was formed in Rochester In 1965

under contract with Saul Alinsky's Industrial Areas

Foundation, is presently under the leadership of the

Reverend Franklin Delano, Roosevelt Florence, a Negro

minister.

The purpose of, FIGHT is to eradicate slum

ghetto areas and school segregation and to provide jobs

for unemployed Negroes. In September, 1966, FIGHT

approached the largest employer in Rochester-the Eastnan

Kodak Company-and demanded that company to hire and

train 600 hard core unemployed Negroes.

An Assistant

Vice President designated to hold talks with FIGHT signed

& document pertaining to these demands in Decenber, 1966,

but Kodak later repudiated the agreement as unauthorized.

The conpany explained that it could not deal on an issue

with one racial group to the exclusion of any other and

it would not commit itself to a specific number of persons

it would employ at any fiven time.

The struggle between

FIGHT and Kodak continues, with the issues still unresolved.

Saul Alinsky, Executive Director of IAF and the

which have plagued the United States since 1964 have had

their genesis primarily in the long-smoldering discontent

and resentment of Negroes over unequal job, school, and

housing opportunities and their deep-seated antipathy

toward the police. However, constant agitation and

propaganda on the part.of communists and other subversive and

extremist elements' have done much to aggravate tension in the

ghettos of the Nation's big cities.

In'the nearly 48 years of its existence, the

Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), has subjected Negroes to

unending agitation and propaganda. it has portrayed

itself to this minority group as the champion of racial

equality, civil rights, civil liberties, and social

protest.

To the

credit of the Negroes rand to the great

disappointment of the communists, the Communist Party

has not been able to recruit and

retain significant

numbers of Negroes as members.

Most Negroes realize

that the commuhists are interested in them primarily to

exploit racial issues and to create the chaos upon which

communism nourishes.

Nevertheless, the cumulative

effect of this ceaseless

agitation and propaganda and

the familiar communist charge of "police brutality"

cannot be ignored or minimized.

Creating Opposition to Vietnam War

During a period which has now extended beyond

three years, the CPUSA and other subversive organizations

have been engaged in campaigns to influence the United States

Government to withdraw its troops from Vietnam or to

participate in negotiations to end the war. .

of

to and the war mather hope in

course, that either action would result ultimately in

advancing

the cause of international communism through

a victory in Vietnam.

The activities of the CPUSA in recent months

have, almost without exception, been directed in one way

or anothei toward the creation of opposition to the war

in Vietnam.

This opposition, the communists reason,

serves to lend encouragement to the North Vietnamese and

the Viet Cong to continue the fighting despite military

adversities and could lead to domestic discontent in the

United States similar to that which contributed to the

French military disengagement from events in Indochina.

In view of the historic designs of the CPUSA

, on the

Negro people and the

racial ferment that has been

evidenced by the disturbances of recent summers, it was

inevitable that the communists and other subversives and

extremists would attempt to link civil rights protests

with antiwar protests so as to increase the magnitude

and

impetus of each.

As early as April, 1965, General Secretary

Gus hall told the CPUSA Secretariat that the "peace

struggle" is a major and top priority project of the

CPUSA •

At the same time, Hall claimed that the protest

movements in this country were

leaders becoming civil rights leadeks and

converging, with peace

By and large,

the 1964 presidential

election, against conditions in Alabama, and against

events in

vietnam

The struggle for social progress

and the struggle against policies of imperialist aggres-

sions were, in Hall's words, now joined.

Union of Civil Rights and Peace Movements

In antiwar propaganda attuned to Hall's

assertion, the CPUSA claims that the war in Vietzan has

racial overtones not only because it involves nonwhites

in Asia but also because it consumes funds that might

otherwise be expended for the war on poverty in the

depressed areas of large citles inhabited by Negroes.

The CPUSA has also praised the Student Nonviolent

Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the militant civil rights

youth group, for being the first to make the tie between

civil rights and peace.

A recent illustration of the fusion of the

civil rights and antiwar movements was the so-called

"Vietnam Week," which culminated in nass demonstrations

in New York City and San Francisco on April 15, 1967.

This protest activity was

sponsored by the Student

Mobilization Committee and the Spring Mobilization

Committee to End the War in Vietnam.

Among the partici

pants in the activities of these committees are members

of SNCC; the CPUSA; the W. E. B. DuBois Clubs of America

(DCA), & communist inspired Marxist oriented youth group;

the pro-Red-Chinese Progressive Labor Party (PLP); the:

Trotskyite Socialist Horkers Party (SHP); and the Young

Socialist Alliance (YSA), the SWP's youth and training

section.

An example or two will demonstrate the involve-

ment of the CPUSA in this "Vietnam Week."

Initial plans

for this activity were made by the Spring Mobilization

Committee at & conference held in Cleveland in late

November, 1966. The CPUSA was represented at this

conference cy Arnold ¿ohnson, Chairman of its National

Poace Commission, and National Executive Board members

James West and Thomas Dennis.

this time, Johnson was

stating that the CPUSA should try,to get one million

people to demonstrate at the same

time against United States

involvoment in Vietnan.

A key figure in the plans for

"Vietnam Week" made by the Student Mobilization Comnittee

at & conference. held in Chicago in late December, 1966,

was CPUSA National Committée member Bettina Aptheker, who

is a student at the University of California at Berkeley.

The activities in one CPUSA district, selected

at random, show the extent of communist involvement in

the Now York City demonstration on April 15.

In early

March, membors of the Michigan District were told that

they must concentrate on laboring people, Negro communities,

and nationalities groups to organize people to participate

in the April 15 demonstration in New York City.

Nichigan District Committee appointed a four-man conmittee

in mid-March to handle arrangements for the mobilization

in New York City. Activities in connection with the

mobilization were described as the most important of all

endeavors by members of the Michigan District.

Participants

in the parade in New York City

on April 15 Included Gus Hall and at-least 200 CPUSA

members.

Over

• one half of the total SWP membership in

the United States also marched in the parade.

Other's

participating in the parade and rally in New

York City

were several members of the DCA, PLP, and YSA.

The Reverend

James Bevel is the National

Director of the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the

War in Vietnam. He was released by Martin Luther King

from a key position in King's Southern Christian

Leadership Conference to permit him to take this assign-

ment.

Significantly,

among the principal speakers

at the antivar rally in

New York City on April 15 were

Martin Luther King; Stokely Carmichael, a top figure in

SNCC; Floyd McKissick, National Director of CORE; and

Bevel.

Bevel

stated that the next objective of the

"peace forces" will be to organize a massive march on

Washington, D. C., to confront President Johnson.

Ahother speaker at this rally was Linda

Dannenberg, Executive Secretary of the Spring Mobilization

Committee, who is known to: consult with leaders of the

New York District of the CPUSA. Dannenberg announced

that thousands are going to be, galled upon for a "radical

action summer" in which they will go into every

town in

the United States to organize a massive protest against

this country's involvement in the war in Vietnam.

She

requested that every interested student attend an antiwar

meeting in Chicago on May 13 and 14, 1967.

As a follow-up to these peace demonstrations

King and other leaders of the Spring Mobilization Committee

launched a' nationwide "Vietnam Summer" organizing effort.

They called for 10,000 volunteers, including 2,000 full-

time workers, to sperd the summer

in 500 connurities

escalating opposition to the Vietnam war, encouraging

Negroes to refuse to be drafted, and attempting to create

a political bloc powerful enough to end the war.

antiwar campaign is patterned after the 1964 summer civil

rights drive in Mississippi.

Now that the civil rights and the antivar

protest movements

have been joined, with the distinct

possibility of ominous displays of

civil disobedience

and near seditious activities on the part of Negroes

and whites alike, the outlook for this summer is grim

indeed.

The injection of antivar activities into civil

rights activities is bound to intensify racial discord

and heighten the violence potential throughout the

country.

In the long run, this consolidated civil rights

peace movement will be detrimental to the national security

and best interests of the Nation, for it will not only tend

to encourage the enemy and prolong the Vietnam war but will

also have an adverse effect on the cause of civil rights.
