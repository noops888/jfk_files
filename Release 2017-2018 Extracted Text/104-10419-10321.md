3. During raview of CAIN's Security file, I noted a message

regarding him from Mexico City, on 25 April 1962, which mentioned

a "Willard ANDREWS, reputable American businessman in Mexico,."

who obvicusly had had contact of some kind with CAIN, as well as with.

a CIA representative in Mesico to whom ANDREWS bad commented that

CAIN clairas to have been with OSS during W. W. Il (Acopy of this mero-

randam is attached). In answer to this message which requested traces

os CAIN, Headjuarters, in furnishing limited information obtained regard-

ing him, advised that neither his claimed employment by OSS,. 20r a claim

he made to have worked with Task Force W, could be aubstantiated. The

Station was advised that be did have (or. had had) a legitimate detective

laboratory in Chicago.
