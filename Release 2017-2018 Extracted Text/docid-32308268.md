told CABRERA

he could supply weapons and CABRERA expressed interest in

making a sizeable purchase, indicating that he wanted to

furnish them to some political followers of former

Venezuelan President PEREZ JIMENEZ, who is now in prison

in Venezuela.

Informant said that during this meeting,

DIAZ expressed the opinion that if "LBJ" became President,

the United States would go communist and he remarked that

there existed some secret organizations, such as the

"Minutemen," who would fight to the end and that in his

opinion,

there could be a military coup.

DIAZ mentioned

some place, not in Florida, where the "Minutemen" are

reportedly organized.

At no time, however, äid DIAZ state

that he is a member

'of the "Minutemen" or that he had sold

arms to them.

Also, DIAZ did not say that the "Minutemen'

plan

an armed

insurrection against the United States Govern-

ment. He claimed, however, that his brother, PEDRO, had

some

connections with groups of this sort but did not

specifically mention the "Minutemen."

Also, he did not

claim the existence of any "Minutemen" military camps in

Florida.(ul
