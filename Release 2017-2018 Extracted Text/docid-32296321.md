on May 15, 1962, BS T-3 furnished the following

information, stating that he could prove none of it, but

what he said was based on his years of association with

JOSEPH LOMBARDI, HENRY NOYES and the rest of the Boston

Italian element.

BS T-3 stated that there was definitely an organi-

zation among the Italians and although they used him on

occasions, he never was accepted. as a member because of his

drinking habits and the fact that he was continually getting

into trouble. He stated the old group was under PHIL BUCCOLA

and consisted of JOSEPH LOMBARDI: JOSEPH BRUNO (deceased):

FRANK CUCCHIARA; MICHAEL ROCCO; HENRY SELVITELLA, also knowi

as HENRY NOYES; BIG BOZO CORTESE. (deceased); ANTHONY

SANTANIELLO (deceased); and an old individual named PEPINO

who was connected with the American Finance Company located

on Hanover Street, Boston, Massachusetts.
