CHAIRMAN STOKES APPEARS TO HAVE ACCEPTED IN PRINCIPLE

PROPOSAL FOR OBTAINING ANSWERS FROM MEXICO AGENT TO WRITTEN

WAS

QUESTIONS. ANOTHER MEXICO AGENT ABOUT WHOM HEADQUARTERS/NOT

AWARE

IS TO BE ADDED TO THE ACTIVITY.

CONSIDERATION NOW FOCUSSING ON HOW TO DO IT. TWO ALTER-

NATIVE PROPOSALS NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION. ONE WOULD INVOLVE

RECENT MILITARY ADDITION TO IG STAFF. OTHER INVOLVES USE OF

IOB STAFFER BURT WIDES (IF IOB WOULD AGREE) •

NOTHING FIRM YET, BUT DIRECTION SEEMS TO ACCEPT OUR

OBJECTIONS TO DIRECT ACCESS BY HSCA PEOPLE TO OUR AGENT. IOB

COURSE WOULD INVOLVE ACCESS BY NON- AGENCY PERSON TO OUR AGENT,

ALTHOUGH HE COULD BE PRESENTED TO AGENT AS AGENCY PERSON.

OBVIOUSLY PROBLEMS REMAIN, BUT PROGRESS SEEMS RIGHT

DIRECTION.
