Bring the above to the attention of responsible

investigative and supervisory personnel who should be scored

Rerep contains very little in the way of actual

investigation to "dig in" toward the meat of the allegations

in this

case but rather is mostly filled with background

information.

The instructions in Buairtel ordering this

investigation set out suggested

avenues and goals in this

matter but these are not to be considered all-inclusive.

You are reminded that investigation in this matter

must be complete, thorough in every respect, and through

imagination and

probative investigation it may be possible

to develop violations of Title 29,

USC,

Section 186 (LMRA)

on the part of Scheib, Doria,

Hatfield, and possibly Hoffa

if

it can be established he shared in any payoff made by

Scheib to a union official.
