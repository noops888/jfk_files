ABSTRACT

MICROFILM

ACCOM-

PLISHED

We would like to take time out in our Investigation of the President's

assassination to appraise the role of the Mexico City Station in the whole affair.

Since the early afternoon of 22 November 1963, Mexico City has been the only

major overseas reporter in the case. While this 1s partly dictated by the

facts of Lee OStArd's life, we have not overlooked the really outstanding per-

formance of Mexico City's najor assets and the speed, precision, and perception

with which the date was forwarded. Here it was relayed within minutes to the

White House, ODACID, and ODENYY.

Your bIllOY data, the statements of Silvia DURAN, and your analyses

were major factors in the quick clarification of the case, blanking out the really

ominous spectre of foreign backing:

We regret that we have been able to send you so l1ttle Information 1n

return, but we bave not been given much yet. We do know that Lee OSWALD denied

le had ever been to Mexico except for a jump to Tla Juana. We have quickl

creened the FBI report on the whole case but we do not yet have a copy fo:

retention.

It does not compromise your sources. Basically, what the New York

Times has printed about the report is all true.

3.

We have meanwhile been flooded with fabrications, of which the ALVARADO

story was the most troublesone. They are still coming In.

You have had good support from your liaison, but as usual the really

outstanding features were Mexico Station's Lamous generalshiy and the sk111 and

devotion of its personnel. Please convey our admiration to all who participated,

down to the last technician, translator, and monitor. We know that the work

your Station did during the President's 1962 vislt made you feel this tragedy

with particular keenness, as did we.
