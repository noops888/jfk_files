Acting

Deputy Chief,

Personnel Security Division

SUBJECT: HIDALCO,

GOVERNMENT

DATB: 6 August 1956

1.

On 20 October 1955 the Deputy Director of Security disapproved

Subject for staff employment.

He approved, however, his continued use

on a contract basis.

The basis for this was Subject's past service as

an informant for the FBI.

2..

On 1 August 1956 Mr. Newton, WH Division, stated that

the

was requesting approval to employ Mrs Hidalgo as a contract em-

ployee.

Mr. Newton Inquired as to whether the decision in the case of

Subject would affect the decision in the case of Mrs. Hidalgo.

Subject is

not in a covert status at this time.

At the most he is under light cover

serving as a contract employee. Mr. Newton inforns me that his duties

16- are performed in thel

itself and that they are the type of duties

which are normally perforned by a staff. employee and would have been

performed by a staff employee in this case if it were not for I/o

limitations®

16-7

3.

rs. Hidalgo's relationship with the

would be no more:

open and no more covert than Subjects.

Lo It is therefore recommended that Mr. Newton be informed that the

decision previously made in the Subject case does

not automatically

disqualify Mrs. Hidalgo from contract employment.
