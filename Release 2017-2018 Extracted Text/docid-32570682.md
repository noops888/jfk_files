NY 100-42479

ADMINISTRATIVE CONT'D

of $199.50 had been made at another branch office in NYC but

had not been credited to the subject's account.

As a result,

the check made out in May, 1961, for rent for the apartment at

110 Christopher Street,

NYC, was not honored inasmuch as there

were insufficient funds to cover this rent.

Mr. STRINING said

that he called a telephone number in NYC, the exact number he

1s unable to recall at the present time, in connection with this

matter.

Mr. STRINING said he spoke to an unknown female who

answered his phone call, and this unknown female advised him

that "RICHARD FRANK and his wife are in Red China,

don't you

know that?".

Mr. STRINING was unable to recall this number

but will endeavor to locate the original deposit of $199.50 to

determine if there is any clue there as to the phone number he

called.

An FD-122 noting the subject's residence and employment

status is being prepared and will be forwarded separately.
