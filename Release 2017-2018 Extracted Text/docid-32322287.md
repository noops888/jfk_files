Act of 1992 (the Act)

Synopsis: Miami is requested to check its files and indices for

the document listed below and, if it can be located, forward it

to the JFK Task Force as soon

as possible due to an

extremely

short deadline.

Enclosure: Copy of Serial One from File No. 65-3346.

Details: On 4/28/98, the JFK Task Force (JFKTF) sent an EC to

Miami requesting that the original of Miami file 65-3346, serial

2, be forwarded to Headquarters.

In a phone call on 4/30/98,

Miami informed JFKTF that closed 65 files in the Miami office

• ended

at 3343.

JFKTF is in possession of Miami file 65-3346, serial 1.

A copy of this serial is forwarded with this communication as it

may assist Miami in the search for Serial 2. JFKTF records

indicate that Serial 2 may be dated December 1976.

Pursuant to the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records

Collection Act of 1992 (JFKARCA) any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form. The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may now postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained until the year 2017 when they are to be opened

full. Therefore, the serial will not be returned to Miami.

Since the original will be sent to the NARA, a Copy of

the serial should be made for record purposes prior to shipment

to FBIHQ.

The serial should be received at FBIHQ no later than

c.O.B. 05/18/98.

If 65-3346-Serial 2 can be located, ship tö FBIHQ, JFK .

Task Force, Attention Catherine L. Lamey, Room 11144.
