= C

IS - SWP

Attached hereto for the Bureau are 13 copies of

a memorandum dated and captioned as above.

NY I-1 is NY 3229-S.

A likely possibility exists that the FPCC may

receive Cuban funds in order to publish the contemplated

advertisement concerning OAS action against Cuba.

funds could be channelized into the FPCC through ROBERT

TABER, RICHARD GIBSON OF WILLIAM WORTHY.

Supporting this contention is the fact that the

FPCC has only $87.00 in its treasury at present.
