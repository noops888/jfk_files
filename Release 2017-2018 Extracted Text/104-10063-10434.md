aRe your request for la couple sentences of factual

data es to why this

1. -Exipost facto, since I was not associated

with Operation MHCHAOS during its existence,

I can only

offer the following reasonable surmise. As we now know;

tenure MiCHAOS was one of the most

sensitive

operattons

conducted under

Dip aegis, repeatedly sanctioned

(in

writing) by the DCI.

The activity was deemed so sensi-

tive:

that it was controlled by/through extremely restricted

nandling x

Channels:

think it follows logically,

at least

in my y

ow, thatyany

a produced by MHCHAOS, whether

a formal or informal one, would have been classified at et

least SECRET:

2. Does the information in this document warrant

classification today®

AT think it does, and I believe the i

current classification of CONFIDENTIAL is proper. Reading
