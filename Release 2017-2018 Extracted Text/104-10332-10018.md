December 3, 1993

Memorandum for the Director,

Center for Studies in Intelligence,

Central Intelligence Agency

Attn: Mr. John Pereira

FAX: 703-243-8343

Subject: CIA Files on Lee Harvey Oswald

This is to acknowledge my telecon yesterday with Dave Gries and with John

Pereira re issue of whether Oswald was ever debriefed by the Agency, and to

respond to John's request for documents which may having bearing on this

issue.

First, a point of order. It is my belief and the belief of the Agency personnel

with whom I have discussed this matter, that your files should not contain the

infamous "debrief." It strains credibility that the Agency would purposely

persist in saying there was no debrief when in fact it had a copy of it

somewhere in its extensive - if sometimes sloppy - records system. It

would have been found by 1993. The issue is not whether you have it now;

rather it is whether it occurred in the past and was destroyed.

We can all talk, theorize and argue over what it might mean later. For now

the task at hand is simply to take all necessary steps to find out. I urge

extreme caution in stating flatly that there was no debrief until such steps

have been thoroughly exhausted. I was surprised to find out after the

FRONTLINE documentary aired, for example, that there will be some rew

pieces on this subject in the not too distant future.

I attach a copy of CIA document number 435-173A, attachment, memo

dated 25 November 1963, by a "T.B.C.", whom I believe might be one Mr.

Tom Comier, possibly a former head of SR6 Branch, Soviet Russia Division,

at the time Lee Harvey Oswald returned to the US in the Summer of 1962.

T.B.C. stated he discussed the laying on of interviews with Oswald, either

while he was en route or after his arrival. Because T.B.C. made a

typographical error when he typed "1960" instead of "1962", the LISCA

foolishly dismissed the veracity of this entire document.

Tatfach a copy of CIA document number 287-690, memo for record, dated

3 December 1963, by Mr. Birch D. O'Neal, Chief, CI/SIG, Subject: Lee

Harvey Oswald. O'Neal's memo is about polygraphing Alvarado, but it is the

reverse handwriting in the upper right hand corner that is pertinent to the

issue at hand. That handwriting appears to be: "Andy Anderson 00 on

Oswald."

I refer you to Mr. Donald Deneselya, a CIA employee in the Contacts

Division in 1962, who told the HSCA in 1978 that he read Anderson's debriof

and described its contents to his HSCA interlocutors. He will tell you today

what he has been saying for 30 years. Don Deneselya does not have a book

and shuns any publicity - it took FRONTLINE almost a year to get him to

agree to an interview on the record. He says what he says not for any

personal gain because there is none, there is only disrepute. He says it

because he remembers reading the debrief.

If I were you, I would first have a long talk with Don. Then I would find all

surviving members of CD/0O/Support Branch. It did not take us long to

figure out that this branch interfaced with the fiold offices of the Contacts

Division. While this will not turn up a piece of paper, I think you will find

some answers there.

As an aside: a Mr. Roe F. Anderson was listed in the CIRA obit this summer,

and his son Richard called me after the FRONTLINE documentary aired, and

confirmed his father, a Navy officer, had worked for the CIA. I doubt if this

is our Anderson, but you might check all the same. I would appreciate a note

stating what you find out.

Sincerely,

Dr. John M. Newinan

1. It makes little difference now, but REDWOOD had at one time an

OI interest in Oswald. As soon as I had heard Oswall's name, I recalled

that as Chief of the 6 Branch I had discussed - sometime in Summer 1960 -

with the then Chief and Deputy Chief of the 6 Research Section the laying

in the of oswald might provide on the Misers

factory in which he had been employed, on certain sections of the city

itself, and of course we sought the usual BI that might help develop

target personality dossiers.

3.

cover assignment, and out of KUDOVE, at

the time.

Thus, I would have left our country shortly after Oswald's arfival.

I do not know what action developed thereafter.

Thomas B. CASASIN

Addendum

4. As an afterthought, I recall also that at the time I was becoming

increasingly interested in watching develop a pattern that we had discovered

in the course of our bio and research work in 6: the number of Soviet

women marrying foreigners, being permitted to leave the USSR, then eventually

divorcing their spouses and settling down abroad without returning "home"

The AEOCEAN 3 case was among the first of these, and we eventually turned

up something like two dozen similar cases.

We established links between

some of these women and the KGB.

KUDESK became interested in the developing

trend we had come across.

It was partly out of curiosity to learn if

Oswald's wife would actually accompany him to our country, partly out of

interest in Oswald's own experienced in the U SSR, that we showed operational

intelligence interest in the flarvey

story.
