Sp8.mAC/IS2

On October

79, MM I-1, a Cuban exile sino 1s

familiar with SNFE activities and individuals in the Miami

area, advised that ANTONIO VECIANA BLANCH, Treasurer

of the SNFE, would be leaving Miami for Puerto Rico in a very

short time.

On October 29, 1964,

MM T=1 advised that he had

obtained the following information on that date from

RUBEN VARELA, a close friend of ANTONIO VECIANA:

Two fairly good-sized boats, which belonged to JURE

(Junta Revolucionaria Cubans), were delivered by JURE leader

MANUEL RAY RIVERO to the SNFE-Alpha 66.

These boats were delivered in Puerto Rico and

ANTONIO VECIANA was present at the time of delivery. It

was not known whether the boats were purchased by or loaned

to the SNFE.

On November 6, 1964, MM I-2, a Cuban exile who has

been active in Cuban revolutionary activities both in the

United States and Cuba and who is acquainted with certain

SNFE leaders, advised that on November 4, 1964, he was

informed by one (First Name Unknown) FUENTES,

SNE member,

that ELOY GUTIERREZ MENOYO, military chief of SNFE, moved

from his previous location and is now in either the Dominican

Republic or the eastern portion of Haiti.
