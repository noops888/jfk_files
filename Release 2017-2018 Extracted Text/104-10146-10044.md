Dear Mr. Blakey:

Following our conversation on 17 December, about

CIA's reporting to the Warren Commission on Oswald's

movements at a certain

location outside the United States,

it occurred to me that it might assist your researchers

if I were to specify the reporting in question. (U)

I have already described our role in obtaining the of

information from a

and assume this needs no further specification. Additionally,

it should be pointed out that on 31 January 1964 the Agency

submitted a fourteen page report to J. Lee Rankin of the

Warren Commission recording the basic information available

from Agency sources.

Your investigators should be able to

identify this

as being processed for folA as document

number 509-803, although it was not released under FOlA

nerause sensitive sources

thought as on

and methods were involved; it

continues to be classified Secret to this date.

That

document has been reviewed at the Agency by your investi-

gators. (S)

That the information was provided the Warren Commission

early in its inquiry, in the two forms noted above, Is

clear.

Why one of the investigators for the commission

did not take it into consideration until some 3-4 months

later cannot be reconstructed at this late date. (U)
