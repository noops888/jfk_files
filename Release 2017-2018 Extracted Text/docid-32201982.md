14. Supply Drops - Cuba

Gen. Cabell explained that the Pinar de Rio supply mission had

not taken place because of the absence of specified communication

from the DZ, and the Escambray operation had been canceled because

of weather. He said that these missions are still planned, and assumed

_ that the Group had no objections.

The members so signified.

V5. U-2, Cuba

Gen. Cabell said that the photographic coverage on the first

flight had been only about 50%, because of cloud cover. He continued

that we are analyzing the exact results on a priority basis and that

some time after the middle of next week we should be in a position to

make recommendations for the missions required to extend the coverage.

Mr. Gray commented somewhat wryly that this was all right with

him since be "would certainly not be available to discuss anything of

this kind before the middle of next week. " The other members appeared

to have the same reaction.

V6. Policy Consideration Re Cuban Exiles

Mr. Gray said that Assistant Attorney General Yeagley had spoken

10 him after his meeting with Col. King and Messrs. Esterline and

CHolman.) He had said that the information given to him by the CLA

representatives, and the arrangements for future coordination if

necessary, were entirely satisfactory to him. He had stated, however,

that a problem remains with respect to action the FBI should take;

that is, the FBI needs guidance in its handling of Cuban exile groups

other than those under the direction-of CLA.

The Group agreed that the best way to attack this problem would

be to have Mr. Yeagley attend next week's Special Group mecting and

discuss the matter at first hand. Mr. Parrott was asked to make

arrangements for this.
