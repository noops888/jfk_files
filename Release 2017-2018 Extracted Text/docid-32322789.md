ZARRAGA said although he had no boats or equipment, he

contacted LOMBERTO DIAZ RODRIGUEZ to obtain a boat for

this group, but DiA refused to make a boat available.

ZARRAGA said that it is his understanding that the

leader of the group, MANUEL QUIZA DOCAL, is presently

somewhere in New York City, but ZARRAGA does not know

his address.

that he was formerly a senator and Minister Of Interior

in Cuba prior to the present Cuban Government. DIAZ

advised he owns a twenty-eight foot cabin cruiser type

of boat named "Jackson,

which is located at a fishing

camp at key Largo, Florida.

He also owns a sixty-two foot

fishing-type boat,

which is very strong

seagoing, and has

a Diesel engine; it is completely outfitted with moderi

radio equipment, and

can serve as a broadcasting station.

This boat's name is "Cacique," It is located in the Miami

River, and has participated in the past in clandestine

missions to Cuba by Cuban refugees in Miami. The "Cacique"

also participated in the April 17, 1961, invasion of Cuba,

gallons of gasoline.

DIAZ explained that many Cuban refugees have

visited him in an attempt to obtain use of these two boats

for clandestine missions to Cuba,

but he has always denied

use of these boats by independent anti-FIDEL CASTRO organ-

izations

in Miami. DIAZ said he has been visited by the

group of six representatives who were trying to raise money

and borrow boats and other equipment for another raid on

Cuba, but he also denied them use of the boats, or any other

aid.

DIAZ said he felt certain the group of six woul

not try to launch another military expedition in the neai

future because they lack arms, equipment, and the necessary

transportation facilities. DIAZ stated although there are

many groups who would like to launch a military attack against

Cuba, the limiting factor is that there is a limited supply
