the operation and keep peace among the workers. Source stated

the gambling syndicate.

by PETE CORRADO, brother-in-law of JOSEPH ZERILLI, who died in

1957, in a numbers house known as the Murphy House. Source

1948 and source belleves that ZERILLI and BILL TOCCO were

partners with CORRADO although neither of them ever took part

or appeared in the operations of the Murphy House. 'Source

- Italian

gambling syndicate and he believes that ZIRILLI re-

ceives some profits from gambling operations.

After World War I, ZERILLI with his brother-in-law,

and ZERILLI and TOCCO both worked very hard at the bakery

making it a success..
