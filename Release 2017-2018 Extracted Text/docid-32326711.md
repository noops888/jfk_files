Released under the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (44 USC 2107 Hote).

DATE: 11-14-2017

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

Subsequent to the prior authority granted by

the Department of Justice, a consensual microphone was

installed in the confidential source's apartment. Pertinent

conversations have been recorded wherein the confidential

source was party to these conversations.

The conversations

revealed that Fratianno, Amarena, and others are engaged

in various criminal activities at the present time.

San Francisco Strike Force Attorney John Emerson

has stated that he feels that the consensual microphone

coverage should be continued in the confidential source's

apartment and

he feels no entrapment is involved.

Your authority is requested to utilize a microphone

on a consensual basis in the confidential source's apartment

at San Francisco, California, for an additional 30-day period

to record conversations by the confidential source and

individuals involved in this investigation.
