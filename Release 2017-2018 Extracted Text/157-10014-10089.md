TESTIMONY OF BRONSON TWEEDY

Mr. Baron. He discused this cable in your previous

appearance, did we not?

Mx. Tweedy, August 26th.

May I correct the date? It la August 26th.

Mo. Baron. Cartainly.

Mr. Tweedy, It is rather important.

Mr. Baron. It is August 26th.

MI. Tweady. Yes, we did indeed discuss it the last time.

Mr. Baron. After you took another look at this cable

this morning bafore we went on the record, you mado a ramart to

the effect that this cable was a source of authority as far

you wart concorned at the time.

Is that your impression now?

Mr. Twaady, Yes.

Let mo just add to that a bit. The cable per se I did

n:o*

ramenber, but it is parfectly obvious the cable la the authorit..

Whon I first talked to MI. Bissell about this, he certainly

impliod the only roason the subjact was being raised is because

it had bean of rational policy laval concern.

I do not thin':

it could be more clear-cut than that, This was basically, this

was the formal axprassion of that bu the Diractor himsell.

I cannot remember which came first, did l see this cable

.:, first, or did I talk to Nr. 3199811 first. I guspect that i

This maroly confirmed what I think I probably heard from

iMr. Blasall firet.

Mr. Baron. In this discussion with Mi. Bissell, you are

Il reforsing to the subject of gettina access to Lumumba for the

6

purpose of assassination.

7

Mr. Tweady, I think it probably came up in the sanse that

: the thruat of the Amarican position was that thare was no

solution in the Congo without the fall from power of Mr. Lumumha,

1.1

and no measure should be overlooked to achiave this --constitu-

:: tional. ravolutionary and indeed, executive action, if you want

:: to call it that.

MI. Baror. Meaning assassination?

Mr. Tweedy. Yes.

But none of these possible measures were excluded, and the

::main point was that averybody agreed that rumumba had to go or

i: we wait in for very serious trouble in the Condo.

MI. Baron. It would have taken place shortly hefore this

MI. Tweody. Either shortly before, or shortly aftar,

Mr. Baron. Having refreshed your recollection by reviewirr

these cablas, can you add any graataI apecificity to the record

about the substance of your conversations with Richard Biasell

1:

on the possibility of assasainating tumumba?

Mr. Twasdy. I think what we usad

7

¿It was perfoctly cloar that ho remained sctivaly interested in

1t. I am sure that he was the one that had the idea of Justin

It 1s perfactly obvious that the Agency felt that it had

Thia 1s my assumption. I think in this aarly stage, that

Mr. Tweady. His testimony does not basically refrenh my

that ho had an instruction from me to tell the chief of statlor.

MI. Tweady, I think that is accurate.

He had come to the and of the road, at least tamporarily

on the

position to approve anything but: what was discusned in the

cable. Nonathalass, as long as the threat to the congo

from Lumumba axlated, there remalned a high priority to search

for means to take care of the

planning aspects.

Mr, Baron. When the cable rafara to the pacific purposa

you diacusaed with colleague -

Mr, Tweody, This ia ansassination with

MI. Daron. It then says: thia purpose remains highest

1: priority. Hould that not indicate to the Chiaf of Station

14

that he should proceed to find a way that Lumumba could bu

Mr. Tready, What this would mean to the Chiat of Station

assassinating Lumumba as highest priority, He should continuo

Mr. Tweedy, It rould have baen restrictad, but not as

restricted as the other.

Mr. Baron. Would somebody at the Embassy conceivably

have been cut in on cable traftic in the channel that dealt with

operations?

MI. Tweedy, Could be, cartainly.

MI.. Baron. In other vorda; the purpose of aending a

second cable on the same day which dealt with action against

Lunumba was what?

Mr. Tweedy. The simple reason I think -- I say I think.

bacause I cannot tell you so - as I said a few minutes ago,

obviously you'd come temporarily to the and of the line on

Moasures takon to shore un

2fO, position in the

congo, Blabutu, would have served to suppors the general objective.

of containing Lumumba by whataver means. It is all part of tha

same purpose.

Onces again refarring to the ordainal cable from Mr. Dullas

which said all means, in affect, and I think the reason I'm

putting this ir the open channel, the open channel 1s still --

MI. Baror. Simply the ordinary channal unod between

yoursalf --

Mr. Tweedy, Still a restricted channel. RIBAT is a

rostricted thing, 1r any evant. Thia could have bean discusser!

with the Ambagaador or the embassy, if any aspect of it seemed!

Mr. Baron. The Chief of Station then makes a suggestion

Mr. Tweedy. Yes. Not necessarlly to he fired by the
