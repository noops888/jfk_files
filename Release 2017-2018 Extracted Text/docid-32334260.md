In relation to the above, it is noted that

TONI is the name of BRODKIN's wife.

The reference to BERKO

is apparently a reference to LEO BERKOWICZ, an associate of

STERNMAN in gambling in Montreal.

HARRY GROSSMAN is believed

to be a NewlYork attorney who resides on Long Island. It is

noted that BRODKIN has visited him and stayed

on his

estate

in the past.

The remark by BRODKIN, "Are the inspectors still

with you?" apparently refers to the fact that, as the Bureau

is aware,. STERNMAN is under active surveillance by the Royal

Canadian

Mounted Police.

the

Apparently STERNMAN has learned of

investigation and surveillance of him by the RCMP.

Although the Chicago Office has considered

paraphrasing the above conversation and placing it in a

letterhead memorandum for possible dissemination to the RCMP,

it is not felt that this can be done with adequate security

to this source.

EXTREME CAUTION SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN THE USE

OF THIS INFORMATION.

IT SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE BODY

OF A REPORT EVEN THOUGH PARAPHRASED. IT SHOULD NOT BE

USED IN LEAD COVERAGE OR AS THE BASIS FOR AN INTERVIEW

UNLESS SPECIFIC CLEARANCE IS OBTAINED FROM THE BUREAU AND

FROM CHICAGO. THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DELICATE AND SENSITIVE

SOURCE WHICH THE CHICAGO OFFICE IS MAKING EVERY EFFORT TO

FULLY PROTECT
