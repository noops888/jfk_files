Boris Deaner i cet, volunted that Lee

Harvey OSWALD was in fact a Ukrainian KGB intel source (code

name Velktor) who had additionally been a controlled agent

of the UKGB.

ZHURAVLEV stated that OSWALD had actively

conspired with two former US presidents to assassinate

ZHURAVLEV when pressed could not

provide any additional information.

This information was

transmitted to Headquarters in a staff channel message with

nO LIMIT Or RYBAT control. We have taken immediate steps to

have this message removed from the message system to prevent

further access to it.

2.

As background. I ZHURAVLEV is an unvetted volunteer

who walked-in to

on 30 December claiming to

be a former KGB orricer with access to leads concerning

Western agents of the KGB. The above information was

obtained during the second meeting with him when the Station

was attempting to obtain details on the alleged leads to

which he claimed access. When pressed to provide

information, he had only one vague agent identification in

Canada and para one above information.

He was not able to

provide any other leads despite claiming some twenty years

of service in the KGB.

3. Based upon information received to date, we

consider ZHURAVLEV to be a highly questionable source.

describes him as being stressed out, shaking and in

fairly rough physical state; he was considered to be of no

operational interest and to not have further intelligence

value.

He departed the Embassy without incident and no

further contact is anticipated.

4.

As regards para one (allegations, we have

substantive information from JDECANTER (attached) which

outlines Oswald and wife's KGB connections and emphatically

denies any KGB involvement in dispatching Oswald to

assassinate President Kennedy.

We have no information from

any Soviet intel source indicating that the KGB had contact

with Oswald after he returned to the US or that he conspired

with any other element in the assassination.
