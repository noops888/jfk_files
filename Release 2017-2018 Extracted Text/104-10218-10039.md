The LIHUFF Project has been

thoughtfully by IH Division, including a revier by Oliver

G. GALBOND.

It has also been discussed with the KUHOLE

Staff officers who revier such projeots for approval.

After thorough consideration, it is the consensus in

Headquarters that this project will not be approved.

The LIHUFF organization has sources of funds

other than KUBARK and would conduct its activities

A project to fund the

DISPATCH STMIDOL AIXO NUMBCA

1N/N-11518

Many of the activities contemplated in LIHUFT

are already fully covered by other operations of the

Station.

LIlUrE would not contribute enough beyond the

overlap to be justified.

d. The Project would tend to put too much rellance

on conservative clemente, around whom we have already

vuilt a sizeable proportion of our program in Mexico.

endquarters does not wish to expand further our involve

butions from their income taxes.

As a matter of principle,

we are moved to ask why ODYOKE funds should be spent in

any program--whose prinary objective, after all, is to

preserve the capitalistic system under which these

Mexican industrtalists hold and increase their alfluence.

if those who will benefit most materially and most

directly fron

it are unwilling to cortribute without

some recompense.

Should the PBPRIME taxpayer assumo

the burden of helping those who are unwilling to share

that burden?

We feel he should not when he bears such

& heavy burden all around the world.

3.

Tho lack of a formal project relationship would not

prevent the Station from usiag the LINUE organiztion from

time to time on a targots-of-opportunity basis, as has been

done in the past.

In such cases the Station could use its

D & TO funds.

the outlay

of funds should be minimized as much as possible.

The contribution of Station funds for the publication

of Identity A may continue to the end of FY 63. Beginning

I July 1963 we would like the Station to phase out this

expense at whatever rate seems most suitable, but the phase

out should be completed by 31 December 1963.

Further contri-

buttons cannot be authorized beyond that date.

5.

Please inforn us of the Station's intentions regarding

LIHUFE-1. He can be kept as a cutout to LIHUrE, but with the

curtailment of KUBARK's connection with Likuff, his services

*ill not be used enough to justify the salary that has been

proposed.

The Station may either reduce his salary or use

him more fully on other.

operations

in order to justify it.

The latter, of course,

is continent on his suitability

In terms of security considerations, his aptitude for certain

time available, and

'cannot make

profitable use of LIHUFF-1 in other operations, it may termin-

ate him at its discretion.

If the Station plans to keep

LIKUFF-1, he should be placed undor a project as soon as his

operational use 1s determined.

If it is not feasible to put

him under the project that he will be working on, then a

separate project should be written to cover him.
