MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT :

HSCA Access to Mexico City History

HSCA requested access to some 200 pages of the

three-volume history of Mexico City - about a third of

the material. The substantive content runs the gamut tron

the history of Mexico University through detailed operation-

al support capabilities and high level political connect-

ions and activities.

It is an impressive accumulation of

operational activity - classical sources and methods, as

well as detailed revelations about past events.

2. We pointed out that the agreement between Chairman

and DDCI Carlucci directly faced the issue of the

irrelevancy of the vast majority of the history,

The HSCA position had been that it had

to verify this, and the access given to senior levels was

to satisfy this. Now it was being requested in connection

with depositions, which would serve to get this material

into a Committee transcript. Since some two-thirds of the

station's history (the work covers 1947 through 1969) pre-

ceded the visit of Oswald to Mexico in 1963 and assassination

of the President, that clearly had nothing to do with the

Committee's charter.

I added that Mr. Carlucci is out of

At 1745 hours on 23 August 1978, Mr. Scott Breckinridge,

Mr. Norbert Shepanek and the undersigned

met with Mr. G. Robert

Blakey, Chief Counsel of the House Select Conmittee or

Assassinations (HSCA).

The meeting took place in Mr. Breckinridge's

office.

The purpose of the meeting, inter alia, was

to make

available to Mr.

Blakey certain sanitized portions of CS HP 329

(SECRET),

a three volume history of the Mexico,City Station

covering

the period 1947 - 1969.

The portions selected for

sanitization were previously designated by Mr. Gary Cornwell as

heing of interest to the HSCA.

MI. Edwin Lopez, of the HSCA

it, was also present, but did not have access to the Mexic

City Station material.

Mr. Blakey was furnished the following sanitized portions

of the

Station history which

he read in my presence:

Volume I, Chapter II (C) - Station Expansion and

Joint Operations (1959-1969), consisting of pages 34 through 57.

Volume

II, Chapter III (A-3) - The Cuban Embassy,

consisting of pages

221 through 256.

Volume II, Chapter III (A-4) - Operational Supyort and

Technical Collection Activities, consisting of pages 257 through 298.

Volume II, Chapter III (B) - Covert Action Operations

(portion relating to student operations only), consisting of pages

327 through 336.

I assured Mr. Blakey that I would be happy to discuss

with him

any

of the deleted items

and explain

the nature

the content and the

reason for its deletion.

I told Mr.

could be

very candid in describing the deleted

portions.

Mr. Blakey

thanked me, but did not at any time raise

any

questions about

deletions.

After he had finished his reivew I repeated

my

offer to

discuss

any portion of the material. He again thanked

me and said he had no questions.

Mr. Blakey did not indicate (nor did I ask) whether

he would continue to seek access to the entire three volume

history in its unsanitized form.

Historian's Note

This paper covers activities of the CIA sta-

tion in Mexico City and bases in Monterrey, Nogales,

and Merida from 1947 to 30 June 1969. While re-

search on this paper was being done from late 1969

to mid-1970, some projects of long duration were

terminated for security or economic reasons. In

those instances, the descriptions of these activi-

ties extend beyond 30 June 1969.

Because the paper is not indexed, the table

of contents contains a detailed synopsis of each

chapter. The reader will note some repetition of

operational events in the text. There is a reason

for this. Chapters I and II were an effort on the

part of the writer to reduce to a reading minimum

a chronological summary of the origins of CIA oper-

ations in Mexico from 1947 to 1969 for persons who

do not have the time or the need to read several

hundred pages of station history. Subsequent chapters

treat the projects in more detail.

For the convenience of the reader, the writer

has grouped together those projects which pertain to

the same target.

Each of these target categories

begins with

an

introduction which is nothing more

than a brief history of the target for the benefit

of persons not familiar with the Mexico operations.

The Mexico City Station had one of the most

extensive and expensive unilateral technical col-

lection programs conducted by the Agency. For that

reason, those projects are presented together,

although they are also mentioned in station coverage

of specific targets. These unilateral projects had

two characteristics which should be remembered:

the majority of those still current in 1969 were

sources turned over to the station in 1947 by the

FBI or were recruited from contacts of these sources;

the agent networks in the unilateral operations were

a series of family relationships.

Readers may be confused by a Mexico Station

practice of

changing cryptonyms of sources when

they were switched from one project to another.

Some sources used by Mexico were

identified by as

many as four project cryptonyms. Insofar

as possible,

the convenience of readers who may wish to review

the inactive projects in which the sources were

used.

Inactive project, chronological, and subject

files were provided by Lucille Long and Dorothy

Kishter of the Records Integration Division (RID),

both of whom devoted considerable time to search-

ing indexes for records which were not included in

the Clandestine Service records system. A presenta-

tion of the current projects (1969) could not have

been written without the cooperation and generous

assistance of all personnel of the Mexico Branch

of the WH Division in making available their oper-

ational files which were excellently maintained in

comparison with other records.

Mexico City as a "civil attache" to investigate

the activities of German residents.

Jones opened the FBI office in Mexico City

in June 1942 on the second floor of an office build-

ing at Londres 85, across the street from the US

Embassy chancery and residence which was located

in a compound at Londres 101. He had a staff of

two men, the assistant civil attache, Marion Stokes

Davis, and the chief clerk, Charles Turnbull. In

the fall of 1942 Clarence Moore replaced Jones,

They visited 16

countries in Latin America to examine relationships

between station officers and those in other Embassy

components, station morale, and operational and

administrative matters. A memorandum prepared by

these inspectors after their return to Headquarters

noted that Ambassador Walter C. Thurston was com-

pletely satisfied with the manner in which

was handling his operations. The same memorandum

reported that the administration and operations

were in excellent condition, and that the Mexico

City Station gave every indication uf being the

outstanding station on the circuit.

In the early years the station acquired some

surveillance assets for sporadic use on the CP and

leftist groups, but they had no organized team that

could cover the activities of Soviet Embassy offi-

cials. The FBI refused to turn over the background

• data from their files on the Soviets. Furthermore,

it soon became apparent that the Mexican Government

could not be relied upon to provide detailed cover-

age of the activities of such a large number of the

Soviet Bloc officials who had complete freedom of

movement all over Mexico and clandestinely into the

United States. The Mexican security agents had

neither the training

nor the motivation for this

sort of effort. Accordingly, the station embarked

on a program to develop unilateral support operations.

This was not to the detriment of the other

targets which, according to SOI 23, took priority

over the Soviets. LIFTER, LIBETHENITE, and

LIONHEART (turned over by the FBI) were covering

Communist and leftist activities. LIBELER (turned

over by the FBI) was a high-ranking Mexican Govern-

ment official who kept the station fairly well in-

formed on events that were happening inside govern-

ment circles. He also provided some personality

information on the Soviet officials with whom he

came in contact.

B. Development of Unilateral Operations (1951-1958)

The first significant, productive unilateral

support operation was developed by Charles W. Ander-

son, III, in October 1950. This was LIFEAT, which

in 1969 passed its 19th anniversary. Initially a

small telephone tap operation with a yearly budget

under $5,000, it developed into a large, sophisti-

cated, audio operation covering telephones, TELEX*

systems, and microphone plants with capabilities

limited only by the availability of persons to man

the recorders and transcribe the take.

In 1969

the LIFEAT budget wae $102,000

In the process of getting the telephone tap

operations under way, other support agent prospects

were developed. LIMESTONE (201-150706), a Mexican

employee of the Hoof and Mouth Control Unit, US

Department of Agriculture; and LIMEWATER (201-

183704), a telephone company supervisor, were the

original LIFEAT agents. They suggested

their sons,

daughters, parents, in-laws, and friends for recruit-

ment. From this assortment, the first 12 agents

were recruited for an

umbrella-type project (LIPSTICK)

to provide mobile and fixed

surveillance teams to

parallel LIFEAT and to man three photo observation

posts around the Soviet Embassy. These agents were

all untrained in clandestine activities; they were

mechanics, clerks, salesmen, a housewife,

and the

of Mexico.

Their one common bond was that they

were related in some way to LIMESTONE and LIMEWATER.

This

project was developed by Charles Anderson and

Harry T. Mahoney.

These original LIPSTICK agents

formed the nucleus for the extensive operational

support projects in Mexico, and in 1969 many of

them were still on the job.

E. Howard Hunt opened the first Office of

Policy Coordination (OPC) station in Mexico in

Decender 1950. This office was combined with the

Office of Special Operations (OSO) in 1952. The

base in Monterrey, Mexico, with a staff of two,

was opened in the US Consulate in June 1951 by

While the station was developing unilateral

support operations, contact was continued with the

head of the Mexican Security Service (Direccion

In early 1954, while Harry T. Mahoney and

his wife were occupying temporary quarters after

their arrival in Mexico City, a young Mexican-

American student tapped on the door one day. He

introduced himself to Mahoney's wife as a student

at Mexico City College. He explained that his

mother was an American schoolteacher, and that he

was working his way through college by selling

eggs, chickens, and cheese to people in the apart-

ment building where the Mahoneys lived. That even-

ing Mahoney learned

about the egg salesman and

stayed home the next day to meet him. After that

Embassy and gathered enough background information

for a request for an operational clearance. The

salesman was Raymond H. GERENDE (201-119523) who

became the principal agent for the photographic

bases, acted as a transcriber for LIFEAT, alternated

as a handler for the unilateral surveillance teams,

and performed various other operational tasks from

1955 until 1970.* His family and friends provided

a recruitment field for several other agents within

the operational support agent network of the station.

From January 1953 to March 1954, the station for-

By 1955 the-Mexico City Station had tapped

every teléphone line in the Soviet, Czechoslovakian

and Polish embassies, as well as the Communist Party

headquarters. In addition, Projects LIFEAT and

LIPSTICK had the capability for a quick swing off

to cover targets of opportunity as they arose.

There

was contact with

FBI. The latter then had a large staff of 20 to 30

included two indigenous surveillance teams, four obser-

vation posts, @ photosurveillance truck, a 20-line tele-

phone tapping capability, and several independent in-

vestigators.

All of these operations were handled on

unilateral basis.

son in 1956. LIKAYAK-2 developed the unilateral

mail intercept and Mexican Government file search

project (LIBIGHT). Indirectly, LIKAYAK-2 laid the

groundwork for the joint telephone tap operation

(LIENVOY) by introducing his Mexican mentor

relationship between the station chief and

high-level telephone taps, photo-

station in the Western Hemisphere Division. There

were more than 9,00 personality files, a large

number of subject files, and a vast accumulation

The FBI and the I&NS reparded Mexico as the

most important &e base abroad from the point of

view of US internal security. CIA-thinking in

early 1950 in regard to an intensification of CE CI

effort within the Deputy Director for Plans (DDP)

complex led to the concentration of effort on the

more important operating centers instead of dis-

persing assets thinly throughout a given geographic

area. The plan was to establish a "model" SE pro- cI

gram in Mexico which would be beneficial in the

general improvement of Ch work and standards through-ci,

out WH as well as the DDP. This was the principal

reason for the increase in the staff from 18 Ameri-

cans in 1954 to

in 1961 (with a corresponding

87/

budget increase from $463,692 to $1,697,500).

To accomplish the CE and FI mission, the FI

operations officers were assigned to four admini-

strative sections, named for their targets or type

of operations: CP and International Communism;

The telephone taps, surveillance, and technical

operations were run by the two Operational Support

volume of transcripts, reports, and photographs was

handled by the section concerned. Each section was

responsible for the operational handling and station

In addition to the Soviet Union, Czechoslo-

the Czech commercial office actively worked to re-

capture its prevar market for textile machinery,

machine tools, and consumer goods in the face of

strong competition from Germany and Japan. A

develop within the LIMOTOR complex. In other pro-

fessional areas, the Mexico City Station already

had

a half dozen time-consuming double agent opera-

tions against the Soviets. In the LIMOTOR Project,

the Soviets were not so interested in obtaining

information as they were in guiding the young stu-

dents into a US Government career. This raised

the policy question of how far CIA could go in en-

couraging these students to maintain contact with

the Soviets, knowing that this contact would sur-

face (perhaps against them) if they should seek

employment in some sensitive US Government job at

some later date. In one test case the Mexico City

Station was advised by Headquarters that LIMOTOR-21,

who had passed the Foreign Service examination,

should not be considered for recruitment as a double

agent. It was also stated that while Headquarters

could attempt to clear him with the State Department

security that "at best LIMOTOR-21 would never be

3. The Cuban Embassy

Fidel Castro Ruz assumed power in Cuba fol-

lowing the collapse of Fulgencio Batista's govern-

133/

ment on 1 January 1959.

Castro had launched

his drive for the liberation of his homeland

from

the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico in

1957, and many

Cuban leftist exiles were still in Mexico as

of

1959. One of them, Teresa Casuso Morin

(201-

169119), a former Cuban commercial attache in

Mexico (1949-1953), assumed charge of the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 1 January 1959.

Salvador Massip y Valdez (201-218391) was

the first Ambassador to Mexico under the Castro

government. Massip's tour in Mexico (February

1959 to March 1960) was characterized by a series

of unpleasant incidents. Soon after his arrival,

he alienated the Mexican Foreign Ministry by re-

fusing to pay the normal courtesy calls upon many

of his colleagues in the diplomatic corps because

they represented "dictatorship countries." He

also ignored many Western ambassadors at formal

receptions, and

associated principally, if not ex-

clusively, with

Soviet Bloc representatives.

October 1959 Massip appealed to the Mexican public

for support of Cuba in

a "moment of imminent dan-

ger" from aerial bombardment by planes operating

from "foreign bases."

In January 1960 Massip

publicly aligned himself with the Mexican Commu-

nist painter, David Alfaro Siqueiros, during the

latter's attacks against Mexican President Lopez

Mateos. * The Mexican press charged Massip with

interfering in Mexican affairs. He was subse-

quently recalled to Cuba and assigned to Ghana.

Jose Antonio Portuondo Valdor (201-40662)

replaced Massip in June 1960 as Ambassador to Mexico.

After experiencing difficulties in using the Mexican

press as a propaganda outlet, he turned to direct

agitation among students and labor.

Portuondo, a

former university professor, invited Mexican pro-

fessors to teach in Cuba and reportedly paid $8,000

to 12 students of the National Polytechnic Insti-

tute in

Mexico City to organize and pay for agita-

tion in support of Cuba. The Mexican Government

retaliated by confiscating all incoming propaganda

In 1959 Lopez Mateos ordered raids on Communist

Party headquarters,

arrested Siqueiros and a numbel

ofpariy leaders, and expelled two Soviet diplomats

for plotting in a nationwide rail strike.

materials from Havana. The searches at the Mexican

airport of baggage of incoming travelers from Cuba

were so intensive that Portondo went to the Mexi-

can Foreign Ministry to ask that Cubans be permitted

to travel through Mexico to other countries without

having their baggage searched. The Mexicans, of

course, went right on searching baggage of those

who had a stopover in

Mexico. Furthermore, the

Mexican ringleaders in the pro-Cuba demonstrations

were arrested and thrown in jail, and kept there

for as long as six months before they were sentenced.

They

were charged with "social disruptior" which,

under Mexican law, resulted in sentences of from

five to ten years. .

Carlos Lechuga Hevia (201-262106)

replaced

Portuondo in May 1962 as Cuban Ambassador to Mexico.

Lechuga was not particularly active in Mexico

and

soon went on to become Cuban Ambassador to the

United Nations in New York. This appointment led

some to believe that Cuba no longer considered

Mexico as its key springboard for Latin America.

Joaquin Hernandez Armas (201-301755) arrived

in Mexico in May 1963 as a replacement for Lechuga.

Hernandez did not participate in the Castro revo-

lution to any extent, but his CP membership dated

to his student days in law school at the University

of Havana. In 1946 he was head of the CP in Pinar

del Rio Province where he was said to be active in

party espionage activities.

He served in the Cuban

Foreign Ministry under Castro and then was Ambassador

to Brazil (1961-1963).

Mexico was the only country in Latin America

which had continuous diplomatic relations with Cuba

from the time Castro assumed power. The Cuban Em-

bassy in Mexico City was staffed with four officers

in 1959 and expanded to 28 Cuban officers by 1968.

Half of those were known or suspect Cuban intelli-

gence officers.

There were three Cuban consulates

in Mexico in the port cities of Merida, Veracruz,

and Tampico. They were staffed in Veracruz and

Tampico by a consul in each and by two vice consuls

at Merida. All were known or suspect intelligence

officers. They handled Cuban fishing boats and

served as collection and shipping points for send-

ing needed materials to Cuba which could not be

There were five branches of the Mexican-

Cuban friendship associations run by Mexicans but

supported by Cubans. They were located in Veracruz,

Monterrey, Tampico, Morelia, and Mexico City. They

distributed pro-Castro propaganda and maintained a

steady program of free cultural events attractive

to students. From 10 to 20 such students were

given free trips to Cuba each month beginning in

1968 as "scholarships." Travel from Mexico City

to Havana was provided by Cubana, the Cuban Govern-

135/

ment airline.

The Cuban consul in Mexico City was the co-

ordinating point for arranging travel of a steady

stream of pro-Castro revolutionaries to Cuba from

throughout the Western Hemisphere. Some went for

sightseeing trips, and otherswent for guerrilla

training. A large percentage of these travelers

were dissident

students from the United States.

During 1968 there was a sharp increase in

the number and type of Cuban travelers. These in-

cluded visits to Mexico of a Cuban ballet group, a

theater group, lecturers, artists with exhibits,

delegations to international conferences, and

Prensa Latina was the Cuban Government press

organization which operated worldwide.

In Mexico

City, it had a staff of 13 employees in 1968 and

138/

had direct teletype service with Havana.

CIA operations against the Cuban target were

developed by Thomas J Hazlett who was assigned to

Mexico City under official cover in February 1957

as the

officer responsible for CP exile operations.

Hazlett was

an unusually energetic and imagi-

native officer with fluent Spanish, who had the

personality

and

background that appealed to exile

intellectuals.

He assembled information from in-

formants among exiles, such as LINLUCK, and targeted

the unilateral telephone tap, LIFEAT, against leaders

of the groups as they were identified. He used

agents

(LIVESTOCK)

to supply information from their files on the activi-

ties of various exiles. Thus, he located their hang-

outs and meeting places which were usually restau-

rants and coffee shops, then circulated in these

places developing friendships. In 1958, Hazlett

chanced a meeting with Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, a

leader of the pro-Castro 26th of July Movement

in Mexico. An avid reader, Hazlett visited every

leftist bookstore in Mexico City collecting paper-

backs published by leftist exiles. By the time he

met the

authors, he had read most of their books

and had mutual topics to engage their interest and

gain their confidence.

In August 1959 two officers of the Cuban Em-

bassy in Mexico (LITAG-1, 201-267743, naval attache,

and LITAINT-1, 201-98818, air attache) walked into

formants was supplemented by that obtained from

surveillance teams, telephone taps, audio opera-

tions, and

The telephone taps (LIFEAT and LIENVOY) and

audio operations (LISANPAN) revealed Cuban involve

ment in subversive activities in Latin America.

One example of this activity was a naturalized

Mexican of Spanish origin, Victor Rico Galan (201-

336474). He was one of the founders of the pro-

Castro National Liberation Movement

in Mexico.

He visited Cuba

for two months

each in 1962 and

1963. In late 1963, at Cuban direction, he visited

several Central American countries, Venezuela, and

Brazil, contacting key Communists.

He again

visited

Cuba in

1964 and 1965.

In Mexico his

contacts with

members

of the Cuban

intelligence service at the

Cuban Embassy increased sharply. In 1964 and 1965

he took trips to Guatemala and

the Dominican Repub-

lic. The Mexico City Station had followed his

(LIFEAT) and passed some information on him to the

criticism of the Mexican President Diaz Ordaz and

that Rico Galan was trying to form a new leftist

political party in opposition to the PRI. The re-

sult was that the Mexican Security Service picked

him up in 1966. He was

subsequently

charged and

convicted of being a part of a conspiracy against

the Mexican Government.

The Mexican Security Service (through LITEMPO)

cooperated closely with the station on Cuban opera-

tions. This included security protection and

ex-

change of information. For example, in September

1966 a wooden box fell off a delivery truck in

Mexico City and broke open. The box contained guns.

The security service investigator called to the

scene was a station agent, LITEMPO-12. He and'

another agent went to the address on the box, a

two people there. Two agents remained in the empty

house and a short while later, after a tap on the

door, the cultural attache from the Cuban Embassy,

Julian Lopez Diaz, walked in. He flashed his dip-

lomatic identification but the Mexican agents (after

checking with their headquarters) tore it up,

searched the man and discovered $6,000 in $20 bills

in his wallet. They took Lopez to the security

service detention room and held him incommunicado

for 72 hours while he was being questioned. By

almost sheer accident, the Mexican service had

stumbled onto a shipment of arms intended for the

Guatemalan CP guerrilla group. The police seized

an additional $4,000 and a large quantity of car-

bines, submachine guns, and ammunition at the resi-

dence which was the home of a Guatemalan revolution-

ary. Lopez was released to the Cuban Ambassador

and declared persona non grata. The Guatemalans.

and Mexicans were sentenced to prison terms.

The Cuban diplomats in Mexico resorted to

terrorist tactics when it suited them. In September

LIRAVINE

This project was submitted in late 1964 by

Robert T. Shaw for the purpose of consolidating

into one administrative group a number

of active

Cuban informants, some of whom had been working

for CIA since 1959. The objective was to develop

positive intelligence and counterespionage

informa-

tion on the activities and personnel of the Cuban

Embassy complex in Mexico, with a view toward re-

cruiting intelligence officers

and placing techni-

cal devices inside the official installations.

Both of these objectives were realized.

The agents

inside the Embassy provided CIA with sufficient

casing data to permit the installation of the only

unilateral audio network (LISAMPAN)

The project was approved in 1965 at a cost of

$20,000. Through some expansion and turnover of

agents who left the area and were replaced by new

recruitments, the cost edged up to about $30,000

for 1967 but dropped again to $20,000 in 1969 when

member of the 26th of July Movement and had contribu-

ted $50,000 to this group. The leader of this group,

•Gustavo Arcos Bergnes, was also a close friend of

LITAMIL 1.

Hazlett, in the course of developing informa-

tion on Communist

exile activities during 1957 and

1958, had met Arcos and held several conversations

with him. LITAMIL-1 knew of this acquaintanceship

because he

had taken

telephone messages from Hazlett

when Arcos was not at home.

He had also telephoned

Hazlett on one or two occasions when Arcos could not

keep an appointment.

tivities and learned that Arcos' old friend,

LITAMIL-1, was becoming disillusioned with Commu-

nist influence in the Castro government.

In October 1959, Hazlett contacted LITAMIL-1

as a friend of Arcos and arranged a meeting.

LITAMIL-] agreed to cooperate with Hazlett and pro-

vide information on persons in the pro-Castro Cuban

colony who still considered him as a part of the

revolution. This cooperation led to the recruit-

ment of practically all of the early sources on

Cuban activities in Mexico and lasted until 1963

when Hazlett left Mexico. LITAMIL-1 received no

CIA salary but was given a loan of $800 in 1959 for

which a request for repayment was not made because

of his valuable service to the station.

the Castro forces with information and propaganda.

Following the Castro victory, LITAMIL-2 went to

Cuba but,

to his dismay, was snubbed by Castro who,

according to rumor, thought LITAMIL-2 had leaked

to Mexico somewhat disappointed by this treatment.

He also was distressed by Castro's turn to Commu-

nism. At this point, Hazlett met him and made the

recruitment.

LITAMIL-2 agreed to play a middle-of-the-road

role as a CIA agent and continue apparent friendship

for pro-Castroites and anti-Castroites alike.

He was a source of information on all types

person might be of use to CIA and susceptible to a

18 July 1962. The scene of the meeting was the

hospital room of LITAMIL-3 who lay near death await-

ing the kidney stone operation the following day.

He had summoned LITAMIL-9, an old friend, to the

hospital and then introduced Hazlett. This meeting,

in the presence of LITAMIL-3, lasted three hours.

LITAMIL-9 talked freely of Cuban personalities and

activities but expressed reluctance at becoming ine

volved

in clandestine activities with a US official.

At a subsequent meeting, however, he agreed to pro-

vide information. His position as cultural officer

in the Embassy provided no access to classified

information, but his observations gave the station

an additional source on personality data and rela-

tionships inside the Embassy.

He also traveled to Cuba but would not com-

municate with

the station

from there. In the

spring of 1965 he was transferred to Cuba and re-

mained there until December 1966 when he left his

position with the Cuban Government and obtained

permission to reside in Mexico. When he contacted

the station in December 1966, he was paid $5,000

which represented accumulated salary while he was

in Cuba, although he had not been productive during

that time. He had no access of particular interest

to the station after his return from Cuba, but he

could be contacted if desired.

LITAINT-2_ (201-275934)

This agent was recruited on 28 April 1960 by

Hazlett who met him when he was trying to contact

LITAINT-1 who, without prior station knowledge,

had crossed the border at Laredo, Texas.*

LITAINT-2 was born in Cuba in 1930 of a Mexican

was a salesman for a television firm when he was

contacted by Hazlett. LITAINT-I and LITAINT-2 had

been close friends

for many years. As a result of

this friendship, LITAINT-2 knew all of the Cuban

diplomats and

many of

them

patronized the store

where he worked. Hazlett developed LITAINT-2 for

access to Cuban

intelligence officers.*

In 1962 LITAINT-2 was also used to direct a

harassment team of lower-level agents (LITAINT-8,

9, 10, 11, and 12). This harassment team created

confusion at the Cuban Embassy by

November 1960 for clandestine training by the AMOT

group.

LITAINT-2 was also in charge of the Cuban trash

operation. A "rag-picker" sat in the truck that

picked up the garbage and trash from the Cuban

Embassy and sorted out the waste paper that had

writing or photographs. This little garbage-spattered

bundle was turned over three times a week to LITAINT-2

who passed it to the

station where the bits were pieced

together and, to the surprise of the station, contained

some worthwhile information. One item was a draft of

a report that concerned contact of an access agent with

a US official. The operation also identified persons

seeking employment with the Embassy or trying to get

visas to go to Cuba.

LITAINT-2 was paid $256 per month salary in

July 1962, and was raised to $304 per month in 1968.

went to the Mexican Minister of Interior and asked

for permission to remain in Mexico after resigning

their positions. LITAINT-Y's greatest contribution

was a dramatic defection speech which received wide-

spread covert action coverage. He was retained by

the station as

a source until 1965 when he and his

wife emigrated to the United States. He received

no salary.

LISICLE-1 (201-350663)

This agent was a Mexican medical specialist

who first came to the attention of the station in

1964 when he walked into the US Embassy to report

that he had been invited to Cuba to participate in

a medical congress.

He was interviewed by a sta-

tion officer and was given some operational train-

ing and guidance for his travel to Cuba. This.

initial assignment rattled him and he returned to

Mexico full of cooperative spirit but psychologi-

cally incapable of performing any task which he

considered risky. He subsequently dabbled at the

LICOMET-1 (201-285165) was the titular head

of the unit and principal agent for the project

from

1964 until 1968 when

he obtained full-time

employment with a private firm and was replaced in

the LICOMET operation by LICOMET-2: (201-327270).

The project expanded in size from a staff of

five in 1964 to twelve in 1969. The group consisted

of a principal agent, four interviewers, two secre-

taries, a visa processer, a guard, a janitor, a

receptionist, and an informant in an airline office.

The project cost $30,000 in 1965, $56,000 in 1966,

$50,000 in 1967, and less than $30,000 each year

for 1968 and 1969. The production in 1965 was 52

positive disseminations. During 1966 the figure

increased to 165 disseminations.

In 1967, despite a 75 percent drop in the

number of Cuban refugees arriving in Mexico, intel-

ligence production showed an improvement in both

quality and quantity. During this year, 175 dis-

seminations were made. Of special importance was

information obtained on live practice firings of

SA-2 missiles in Cuba. The project also provided

In 1968 the pro-

duction dropped to 46 disseminations, primarily be-

cause of the continued decrease in the number of

Cuban refugees, as well as in their knowledgeability

of information which was of interest to CIA.

One of the problems of the project, over which

the station in Mexico çould exercise little control,

was a constant change of LICONET personnel. The

project staff consisted of refugees rather than per-

manent residents. These refugees were, for the most

part, in Mexico waiting to go to the United States.

No one could predict the processing time for US

visas. As a result, it was impossible to plan. for

personnel changes. Once thevisas were issued, the

refugees, with very little notice, left for the

United States. It was then necessary to train others

to fill the vacancies.

Operational Support and Technical Collection

Activities

The Mexico City Station had an extensive net-

work of investigative operations which, for want of

a better term, was called operational support. These

included a unilateral telephone tap capability of

18 lines (LIFEAT); a joint telephone tap capability

of 30 lines (LIENVOY); a unilateral surveillance

team (LIEMBRACE); a travel

operation (LIFIRE);

(LI TEMPO) ;

a mobile surveillance phototruck (LIENTRAP); six

photographic surveillance basehouses (LIMITED, LI-

CALLA, LILYRIC, LIHABIT, LIONION, LITABBY); a

(LIKAYAK-2); audio operations (LIPALLET,

LIROMANCE, and LISAMPAN); and highly sensitive tech-

nical operations (LINIMENT, LIMESA, LICASA).

From 1961 through 1969, the station spent ap-

proximately a

dollars annually for these

operations. Most of this money was used for payment

of salaries of the large networks of agents required

to maintain the operational bases for these projects.

These operations were the primary sources of

operational information on Soviet Bloc and Cuban

LIFEAT

The basis for unilateral telephone tap opera-

tions was laid in the fall of 1950 when two employees

of the telephone company were recruited by Charles W.

Anderson, III. One was a supervisor for repairs and

maintenance (LIMEWATER-1), and the other was one of

his subordinates (LIMEWATER-2), a lineman who did

repair and maintenance work.

These two telephone

company employees were handled by an outside prin-

cipal agent, LIMESTONE.*

The principal agent (as of 1969) was David M.

WILSTED (201-9195) who was

hired in November 1951

as a transcriber of Polish in one of the LIFEAT

basehouses.*

During

1951, taps were placed on the telephone

lines of the

Soviet, Czech, and Polish official in-

stallations.

The cost for the first year was about

$5,000. By the middle of 1955, the operations

coverage had been extended to leaders of the local

CP and Communist-front organizations, and the cost

had increased to $78,000 a year. In 1955, LIFEAT

produced 19 positive and six counterintelligence

disseminations. The Soviet Bloc country desks

judged the operational information of this tap op-

eration to be the best CIA had anywhere. In 1956,

LIFEAT produced 36 positive and 74 counterintelli-

gence disseminations. The cost of the project for

this year shot up to $132,519 which included the

During 1957, LIFEAT had 23 target lines and

produced 141 positive intelligence disseminations.

It also covered the lines of several US Communist

expatriates (at the request of the FBI). There

were seven listening posts located near the various

intercept points. The station had plans to add

four or five more lines, but expansion came in the

form of a new operation (LIENVOY).* This was an

te pione tap operatior.

on all Soviet and Satellite official installations.

LIFEAT taps were taken off and placed on other

targets of interest to the station.

LIFEAT maintained an average of six listen-

ing posts (as of 1969) and

could operate about

three lines from each (in instances where there

were three targets close enough together to run

wires without security problems). One of the

problems with LIFEAT was its cost, which hovered

around $100,000 a year. Salaries and fixed allow-

ances for this network of

Americans and

Mexicans were $73,241 in 1969.

Rent for listening

posts amounted to $16,600 for the same period.

Positive intelligence declined to zero in

1969. The reason for this was elimination of the

disseminations of marginal information. Also,

LIFEAT was used to concentrate on residences of

Soviet Bloc and CP personalities considered sus-

ceptible to recruitment.

There was no indication that the Mexican Gov-

ernment was aware of this project.

The LIFEAT Project also gave the station a

capability for mounting other unilateral operations.

LI EMBRACE

This project consisted of a network of nine

agents (a six-man surveillance team, a radio repair-

man, and a two-man phototruck team). This was an

outgrowth of the LIPSTICK Project which was handled

unilaterally from 1952. The surveillance team used

four radio-equipped vehicles in addition to the

panel truck which had a camera with telephoto lens

mounted in a concealment device. As of 1969 the

agents were LIEMBRACE-1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, and 14.

LIEMPTY-10 and ll manned the phototruck.

LIEMBRACE-1, 2, 4, and 5 were recruited in

handled by Joseph G. Sancho, an outside case offi-

During 1958, the project cost an estimated

$24,000 of which $16,200 was for salaries of six

team

members. By 1966 the cost had increased to

$50,663.

Team members received a monthly salary

of $250 each for the two leaders and $200 each

for their subordinates in 1958. These salaries

had doubled by 1966, increasing the cost of the

project. However, the team members were recruited

when they were young men, some just out of college,

and in order to prevent their leaving for better-

paying positions in private industry, the station

had to periodically increase their wages.

The team was handled by a case officer under

official cover who held clandestine meetings in

various downtown areas with LIEMBRACE-1 to pass

assigninents and receive reports. During demonstra-

tions or when the team was used during visits of

US Presidents to provide current information on

LIRICE

The LIRICE Project provided for a surveil-

lance team handled unilaterally for investigations

against the CP of Mexico. This project was the

outgrowth of the LIJERSEY surveillance group, re-

cruited in 1957 to parallel the LIPSTICK (LI EMBRACE

group). After the arrest of team members in 1958

by the Mexican Secret Service, one surveillance

team was given the cryptonym LIEMBRACE. The other

team (LIJERSEY) was included in the LIEMPTY Project.

In 1960 the LIJERSEY agents were taken out of the

LIEMPTY Project and included in the LITEMPO Project.

Their cryptonyms were changed to LITED.

This change

was made because their outside case officer, Simon D.

CLACKETT, resigned and returned to his home in

Arizona.

In 1961, CLACKETT asked for his job back.

Since the team had not been effective under the

LITEMPO Project the agents were again put under'

after efforts to use them effectively

in other areas had failed.

However, at no one time

were there more than

persons in the group.

These men lacked the education, interest, and moti-

vation to ever develop into good surveillance assets.

The LIRICE Project was approved in May 1961 for

$29,815, of which $13,115 was used for CLACKETT'S

salary and allowances. Salaries for

agents

were $10,200. Approximately $6,500 was earmarked

for operational expenses, including the purchase of

a $4,000 automobile.

On 29 Maich 1955, Jeromÿ K. BENADUM, career

agent for the LITEMPO Project, called his station

case officer and advised that LITEMPO-4 agents had

arrested two men

on the previous Saturday morning,

27 March. The men were

conducting a surveillance of

a Panamanian, HYSAGE-1, who met another Panamanian

under LITEMPO surveillance.

As the two surveillance

teams came together, the LITEMPO team arrested LIRICE

agents. The LITEMPO surveillance was being conducted

at station request. Clearly, there was a lack of

proper station coorlination of surveillances.

direct handling of the team with LIRICE-5 as his

routine channel of communication to other team

By November 1967, it was apparent that LIRICE

would not become an effective investigative unit.

Team members were constantly being replaced for

various reasons. They had annoying personal problems

that had been tolerated, such as constant requests

for loans and histories of family illnesses for

which they needed money.

Their salaries were com-

paratively small for their large families. LIRICE-1

received less than $300 per month.

The other agents

received from $80 to $175 per month. By January

1968

there were only two

members of the team left

(LIRICE-1 and LIRICE-Y) reporting on the CP target

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

City from

1954.

The original agents were recruited

by Charles W. Anderson, III, and Harry T. Mahoney.

One two-story house (LIMITED) and two apartments

(LILYRIC and LICALLA) were used as observation posts

overlooking the front and back of the Soviet Embassy

chancery in Mexico City.

The LIMITED base was used until 1955 as a

LIFEAT basehouse and was occupied by LIPSTICK-7*,.

the sister-in-law of LIMESTONE, the first principal

agent of LIFEAT. In June 1955, the house was for

sale.

It was located diagonally across a four-street

intersection from the front gate of the Soviet Embassy

compound, the only exit and entrance to the compound.

The station; using a US real estate dealer in Mexico,

LIMOUSINE, purchased the two-story colonial house in

1955 for $12,000. Another $3, 500 was spent for reno-

vation, including a concealment area

house after renovation, how to operate the camera

and how to prepare daily operational logs of events at

the gate of the Soviet Embassy. This base operated

without

a major security problem until September 1964

when

it

was closed. The station received word from

Headquarters of a decision to publish (in the Warren

Commission Report) an operational photograph taken

from this base in September 1963 during the

time

Lee

Harvey Oswald was in Mexico City. Furthermore, the

publication carried the statement that the photograph

was made by CIA in Mexico City and showed

an unidenti-

fied person leaving the Soviet Embassy. The photo-

graph (of an unidentified man who appeared to be a

Caucasian) was passed by the station to Eldon Rudd,

FBI agent in Mexico City, on 22 November 1963. Rudd

carried the photograph to Dallas, Texas, where it was

shown to the mother of Lee Harvey Oswald to see if

she could identify the person. Subsequently at a

press conference, Oswald's

mother accused the FBI

of showing her a photograph of Jack Ruby, taken by

the CIA in Mexico City. To prove that the photo-

graph was not Ruby, the FBI insisted that it be

published in the Warren Commission Report.

To protect the LIMITED agents, the station

had no choice but to remove the photographic equip-

ment and relocate the agents. The LIMITED house

had suffered from a long rainy season in 1964 dur-

ing which time the concealment area caved in,

leaving a gaping hole in one corner of the front

of the building. LIEMPTY-6 and family were moved

to another location in late 1964 (in the same

apartment building which housed the LILYRIC base).

The LIMITED property was sold to LIMOUSINE for

$12,000.*

The

LILYRIC base was first opened in 1957

and was maintained by LIEMPTY-14 (formerly

LIJERSEY- 12).

She was recruited by Raymond H.,

GERENDE. She became the best source among the

building.

LIEMPTY-6 was terminated in 1968 because

photographic assets. Her daily logs and reports

were detailed and complete. The photographs were

shasp and clear. When the time came to select

agents to move into LIMOUSINE's new building, there

was no question that LIEMPTY-14 was the best ob-

server in the group.

The LILYRIC base was moved

into the apartment with no security problems. As

of 1969, she had completed her 12th year with CIA.

The LICALLA photobase was located in

row

house, also owned by CIA (through LIMOUSINE) along-

side the Soviet Embassy property overlooking the

garden and back of the chancery. The agent in this

base was LIEMPTY-9 (formerly LIPSTICK-39). He was

recruited in 1956 by LIEMBRACE-1 as a member of the

LIPSTICK surveillance team. LIEMPTY-9 was the

brother of LIPSTICK-47 who was arrested by the Mexi-

can Secret Service in 1958 and resigned when released.

The LICALLA base provided photographs of Soviet activi-

ties in

the garden areas. From the LICALIA reports,

the station determined which Soviets worked in the

same offices, identifying intelligence personnel by

association.

three photobases, Oliver G. SCANTLING, Raymond H.

GERENDE, the LIENTRAP truck and personnel, and a

-man (recruited but untrained) surveillance

team with LIJERSEY cryptonyms who were directed by

an outside case officer, Simon D. CLACKETT. In

1960, the costs declined

to $53,000 when CLACKETT

resigned and returned to the United States and the

LIJERSEY agents were transferred to the LITEMPO

project. The costs for 1966 were $45,300 (as a

result o SCANILING's transfer to Project LIRAZOR).

With the transfer of the LIENTRAP truck to the

LIEMBRACE Project, the cost for 1969 was $43, 500.

Approximately $32,000 was spent on salaries for

agents in this group (1969); the remainder was

spent on vehicle

maintenance, rents, utilities, and

equipment.

first project was approved in 1965 for

an

estimated

$11,000, of which $6,000 was for salaries and bo-

nuses.

The remainder was used for rent, utilities,

and miscellaneous expenses.

Two types of photographic equipment were used.

One was a 35-millimeter Exacta, equipped with a bal-

scope telephoto lens. • The other was a high-speed

"impulse" 35-millimeter camera devised by the TSD

at Headquarters. The lens of this camera was acti-

vated

as persons appeared near the entrance of the

target. It photographed continuous shots until the

person moved out of the line of sight

of the lens.

Two rolls of 100 foot 35-millimeter film were pro-

duced each week.

This film was developed at the

station but sent to Headquarters for exploitation

because of its sheer volume.

The average

yearly cost of

the project from 1966

The value of the project was the identifica-

LISAMPAN was a

unilateral audio penetration

of the Cuban Embassy and

consulate in Mexico City

from September 1967 until May 1969 when silence

came to the last of six audio devices. It was the

world. The operation lasted 20 months and cost

CIA about $60,000 for rent and salaries for the sup-

port mechanism.

This did not include salaries of

the principal technical specialists, David M.

and some very valuable operational leads. Initially,

it also produced a volume of noise, which, if noth-

ing else, added texture to the lives of the six

monitors and transcribers.

LISAMPAN was first proposed in October 1966

when the Mexico City Station learned one of its

agents, LIFEUD-2 (LIFEAT Project), a lineman for

the Mexico City telephone company, would have access

to the Cuban compound in connection with a moderni-

Two separate listening posts were established

to monitor the devices, LISARI, located behind the

Cuban compound, and LISASH, located

directly in

another listening post was established, as a part

of the LIONION Project, directly across from the

door to the Cuban consulate on the corner.

of this fact, the transcripts indicated with a

reasonable degree of certainty that the device

was discovered by the sweepers, by the comments:

"Hey ... there is something here. It is inside."

These remarks were accompanied by whistling, sing-

ing, "yoo hoo-ing," high frequency tones, scratching,

and knocking. Furthermore, FOXTROT was either live-

monitored or taped until 12 May. The conversations

of the Embassy employees indicated very clearly

that they suspected that the Embassy telephone sys-

tem had been

tampered with and that, in the future,

telephone company employees would not be allowed to

enter to

make repairs and adjustments.

On 12 May, the station disconnected the loops

to the LISARI and LISASH listening posts and re-

moved all incriminating equipment. (The LIONION

carrier current

circuit had already been discon-

nected on 30 April.) LISARI was still able to

live-monitor FOXTROT.

About a week later, still in May 1969, the

DOG and FOXTROT loop connections were remade to

LISARI. The devices were negative, although the

telephones functioned normally. As of 1230 hours,

In addition to the LISAMPAN devices, there

This was not continually manned

but could be monitored from a nearby listening post

(LIHACK-4).

Sometime between 22 and 23 May while

the Ambassador was out of the country the device

was removed, apparently by the Cubans. Although

the station

had instructed LIHACK-4 to continually

monitor the

device or watch the residence, he ad-

mitted that the surveillance was limited to spot

checking by his wife. The station was, therefore,

unable to determine when the Cubans entered the

residence to take action resulting in the loss of

the device.

It was

not resolved whether all the devices

were discovered as a result of a special or routine

sweep. (It appeared

obvious enough that DOG, and

subsequently FOXTROT, and the device in the resi-

dence were discovered as a result of the search.)

that in February 1969, Armando Lopez Orta, Cuban

Intelligence chief in Paris, briefed his subordi-

nate officers on a device found in the Embassy in

Mexico. It was not clear whether this discovery

was that of BAKER, or whether Lopez referred to a

much older installation (LIROMANCE) which had long

since been abandoned.

There was also a question whether the arrival

and departure in Mexico of possible Cuban sweep

specialists was connected with the losses. The

sweep on 6 May, which resulted in the loss of DOG,

was probably conducted by regular Embassy employees.

LINESA

The

operations of this project centered around

a basehouse (Unit 11) equipped with an electrical

apparatus which conducted a technical surveillance

of the Soviet Embassy. The basehouse was a part of

a four-unit complex, collectively known as LIMUST

and owned by CIA. It was

purchased by Harry T.

Mahoney (through

LIMOUSINE) in September 1957. The

six LIMESA personnel were husband and wife teams

who acted

as basehouse operators for three of the

four units in the complex. The fourth unit

(LICALLA) was a photographic surveillance base

administered under the LIEMPTY Project.

The property cost $50,000 in 1957. Another

$50,000 was spent during the next two years for

rebuilding and furnishing the properties. From

1966 through 1969, the project cost approximately

$12,000 per year, of which about half was spent

for salaries and bonuses. The remainder was spent

for equipment and operational expenses.

Oliver G. SCANTLING was inserted into the

operation as a cutout for Scott from 1962 until 1969

when the station case officer began meeting LICASA-1.

In addition to Soviet Bloc traffic, the proj-

ect expanded to include traffic of most other coun

tries throughout the world and was considered useful

to the NSA. In June 1968, NSA advised that when the

LICASA production was compared with that from simi-

lar collection resources, it was rated "among the

most valuable." Two-thirds of the production for

1967 concerned Cuba, some 40 percent of which was

unique. NSA published 140 reports on Cuba during

1967 as a result of LICASA production. The critical

element in dissemination of this information by NSA

was the delay in receiving the material as the

agent was met only once a month. To speed up this

process, the station began weekly meetings to re-

ceive information on priority targets.

The project cost was approximately $13,000

per year which included $12,000 for the agent,

gifts, and entertainment.

Student Operations

The University of Mexico was founded in 1553

(some 80 years before Harvard). It was a faithful

copy of the medieval University of Salamanca until

about 1929 when President Emilio Portes Gil, in a

wave of enthusiasm for democratic processes, rein-

corporated the National University as the National

Autonomous University, entrusting its government to

a mixed directorate, half of the members of which

were elected by the faculty and half by the student

body, with the power of hiring and firing all-per-

sonnel. The result, which should have been antici-

pated, was that the university became a training

school for politicians. The professor who failed

among the student leaders. University politics

took on all the excitement of national politics:

the same cleavages appeared, and rival student

used the same methods

as their

elders.

In 1944, for example, the rector (who stood with

the right wing) appointed a director of the National

Preparatory School. The left wing was

annoyed, and

on 26 July a battle was fought between

those

who

were in favor of the rector and those who were not.

Students climbed to the roofs of the buildings and

dropped bricks on the heads of their enemies, two

of whom were killed. That was all it cost to pro

cure the resignations of the rector and the newly

181/

appointed director.

A new rector, approved by the left wing, was

elected; he was Alfonso Caso, a distinguished

archaeologist. By this time the right wing was un-

happy and raised a row. A self-styled "Committee

for the Defense of the University" staged a noisy

demonstration against Caso, accusing him of being

a Communist because he was the brother-in-law of

the Marxist Vicente Lombardo Toledano.

A right-winger, he refused to yield,

street. Called "hoodlums" by the Mexico City press,

4,000 students marched in protest against the insult

of being called "hoodlums." President Miguel Aleman

wearily intervened and managed to quiet the storm.

In 1950, the student body of 27,000 was moved

to the new University City where it was hoped that

the gymnasium, athletic fields, space, and fresh

air would siphon off student surplus energy. If

anything, the students became wilder. In 1952, the

faculty members to submit theirresignations in

writing, which were accepted. The strike began

when two law students were dismissed for distribu-

ting Communist literature. The left-wing law stu-

dents touched off the strike with demands that the

law school dean be dismissed and the students rein-

stated. Chavez refused and was forcibly ousted.

The internal struggle at the university closed

classes to the entire 70,000 student body for two

and one-half months before a new rector could be

agreed upon. Meanwhile, the Mexican Government

proclaimed that university autonomy was a status

related only to academic matters and one not to be

exploited by subversive elements for their ulterior

purposes.

To put some muscle into the proclama-

tion, the office of the Attorney General announced

the arrest of eight Trotskyites, including three

The branches of the Mexican Government of

Federal executive authority in Mexico was

vested in one single person who was elected as

President of the United Mexican States or, more

commonly, President of the Republic.

Despite the

fact that the Mexican constitutional system shared

some of the characteristics of the parliamentary

system, it was frankly, presidential. In fact,

the President was head of state and head of govern-

ment, contrasting with the parliamentary character-

istic of collective responsibility for government.

The internal structure of the Federal executive

authority possessed a certain degree of flexibility

because the number of ministries and departments

was not fixed by the Constitution, but by lesser

laws which could be modified (as in the United

States) according to the circumstances and the

personality of the President.

The Ministry of Interior (called Secretary

of Government - Secretaria de Gobernacion) was

responsible for the conduct of relations with the

other Federal authorities, with the governments

of the Mexican states, and with the

municipalities.

It also provided the Federal judiciary

with the

aid it required for the proper exercise of

its

functions. This

Ministry was

responsible for the

appointments of high officials of the administra-

tion, magistrates, and judges after their designa-

tion by the judiciary. A function of this Ministry

of great importance in the political life of the

country was that of controlling, administering,

and monitoring elections.

It was responsible for

the supervision of all printed matter together with

all radio and television broadcasts. Furthermore,

it directed the internal demographic policy of the

country, with the exception of the colonization of

unoccupied land and, finally, it exercised control

over all affairs related to internal politics.

This Ministry was often a springboard to the

Presidency (all but one of the nine Presidents

of Mexico between

1928 and 1969 served as Minister

192/

of Interior prior to election as President).

Upon recommendation of the PRI, President

Miguel Aleman Valdez created the DFS by presidential

decree in January 1947. The DFS was placed under

the Ministry of Interior. General Marcelino

Inurreta was the first DFS chief and a most ardent

pronoter. It quickly became influential as a per-

sonal intolligence service of the Presidert. No

provision was made for the DFS in the national bud-

get. Funds were, siphoned from the appropriation

of the Ministry of Interior Police (an agency ex-

clusively for law

enforcement). At its inception,

the DFS's primary responsibility was the investi-

gation of national security matters; in façt, its

principal attention was given to domestic political

affairs. These functions had been the responsi

bility of the Attorney General of the Republic,

the Attorney General of the Federal District, and

the Political and Social Section of the Ministry

of Interior. During the Aleman administration,

the DFS had representatives in each state of the

Mexican Republic and attempted, through its sources,

to penetrate the political parties and movements

opposed to the government.

The DFS also engaged in

placing informants with civilian governmental agen-

cies and

military installations to report on dis-

loyal employees. The DES had no power of arrest

and

was obliged to depend upon other

police organi-

zations for this function. Sometimes

the DES in-

vestigators merely borrowed

and

used

credentials

belonging to other policemen for this purpose.

early days of the DFS were marked by illegal ar-

The

rests, killings, detentions, extortion, blackmail,

and

outright thievery. The Ministry of Interior,

to which the DFS was nominally subordinate, was

precluded from exerting any control over the DFS

organization and operations. General Inurreta was

responsible only to the President, who was con-

vinced of his personal loyality. When the general

left the DFS at the expiration of the Aleman admini-

stration in 1952, he took large quantities of modern

police equipment, which had belonged to the DES,

and established a private investigation and strong-

arn group.

Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Aleman's successor to

the Presidency, continued the existence and powers

of the DES by verbal decree and, at the same time,

personally ordered the illegal

activities of the

DFS investigators to cease. Without the driving

influence of Inurreta, the DFS relaxed its activi-

ties and became relatively innocuous in comparison

to its first five years of life. Colonel Leandro

Castillo Venegas replaced Inurreta as head of the

DFS until 31 December 1953. His deputy was Luis

Suarez Torres. They were replaced in 1954 by

Lieutenant Colonel Manuel Rangel Escamilla as

director and Captain Fernando Gutierrez Barrios

as deputy director.

When Adolfo Lopez Mateos came to power in

December 1958, he retained Rangel Escamilla and

Gutierrez Barrios in their positions

in the DES.

Although there were frequent rumors that Lopez

Mateos intended to fire Rangel Escamilla, the

latter remained director of the DFS until 1963.

The real power in the DFS was Fernando Gutierrez

Barrios, who as deputy director revitalized the

service and, under more than normal handicaps,

attempted to give it the semblance of a genuine

nonpartisan investigative agency. Most of the

strong-arm men were dismissed and were replaced

with young lawyers and graduates from the schools

of higher education and from the military academy.

Gustavo Diaz Ordaz was Minister of Interior in the

Lopez Mateos administration and succeeded in bring-

ing the DFS under control of his Ministry.

He was

able to do this because he and Lopez Mateos were

195/

close personal friends with mutual interests.

In 1964 Diaz Ordaz became President of Mexico,

and in May 1965 he named Gutierrez Barrios as direc-

tor of the DFS.

The DFS was responsible for investigating

activity which endangered

the political security

of the country, including espionage, sabotage, and

other subversion. It investigated frauds involving

membership lists of political parties and other

political irregularities. It was charged with

monitoring the activities of foreign embassies;

most of this effort was directed at the Cuban

Embassy from 1960 to 1969. With regard to the

other foreign missions in Mexico City, the DFS

generally restricted its activity to periodic

interviews with responsible embassy officials

concerning events of interest to their respec-

tive establishments. The DES monitored Cuban

travel, overtly and clandestinely, at the inter-

national airport in Mexico City and collected

intelligence on all political parties, labor unions,

governmental ministries, and other organizations

196/

of political interest.

There were 150 agents assigned to the DFS

as of 1966. The service was organized into three

groups: the Operations Group which was respon-

sible for political investigations, special in-

vestigations, and regional representatives;, the

Support Group which operated a telephone moni-

toring unit, archives, photo laboratory, and a

criminal laboratory; and the Administrative Group

Nexican Government officials was in essence, a

political one. It became an unofficial channel

for the exchange of selected, sensitive political

information which each government wanted the other

to receive but not through public protocol exchanges.

Ambassador Hill and his successor, Thomas C. Mann,

gave their blessing to this relationship but Fulton

Freeman, who replaced Mann in 1964, felt that he

should be the one to confer with

on sensitive political matters.*

The telephone tapping operation (LIENVOY) was

successful as a producer of positive intelligence

and was considered by Headquarters as a "model" for

imitation by other stations, particularly in the

area of efficient processing and exploitation of

raw take. The reason for this success was the

presence of staff agent Arnold F. AREHARI, inside

the listening post. This assignment was vital to

the preservation of CIA's equity in this operation

which cost $150,000 for the installation. Even with

AREHART's presence, there was petty theft of equip-

ment and periodic laxity in processing the tapes.

However, obtaining travel manifests consumed most

of their time because of the sheer volume of inter-

national flights. Mexico had one of the busiest

airports in the world, which had an average of 75

international flights arriving and departing each

203/

day.

These manifests were of great value in

checking travel for the Mexico City Station and

other stations throughout the world.

The Mexico

City Station was constantly called on by the local

FBI office for confirmation of travel of persons

interest to that office. These manifests were

delivered to the station case officer in clan-

destine meetings in an automobile at various loca-

tions in the city three times per week and were

packed in suitcases. The two agents also used a

necktie photographic concealment device for spot

clandestine photography.

Headquarters rated this project as perhaps

the most prolific and reliable source in CIA of

timely information about travel to Cuba. Frequently,

it was the only source of information about Cuban

travel of Latin Americans no showed only Mexico

as their destination and concealed their true desti-

nations from their governments. During the period

1 June 1963 through 30 April 1964, the LIFIRE Project

was the source of 615 reports on Cuban travel and

air shipments. The volume of reporting from this

project was consistently high, and much of the travel

data was reported by cable on Headquarters instructions.

In addition to air travel and spot surveillance,

this couple operated a mobile phototruck equipped

with a concealed camera and telephoto lens that oper-

ated through

The truck was sold as

an economy measure in April 1967 since it dupli-

cated a phototruck operated by the LIENTRAP team.

The LIFIRE Project cost approximately

$30,000

for its first year (June 1960 through May 1961)

because of the large investment of equipment, in-

cluding the purchase of two automobiles with radio

communications. However, costs averaged about

$12,000 from 1966 to 1969, of which approximately

$10,000 was paid for salaries and bonuses to the

tro agents.

LIKAYAK-2 was an employee in the Mexican

Ministry of Interior in the early

1950's and be-

came disillusioned with his job.

With another

former Mexican Government official, LIKAYAK-2

formed a private investigation agency. He was

recommended to the Mexico City Station by LIME-

STONE, the principal agent for LIFEAT, as a cover

mechanism for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team.

LIKAYAK-2 was recruited in March 1956 by Charles

W. Anderson III, who decided not to use the business

uf the technical laboratory in the Ministry of

Interior), Anderson developed the agent into a

postal intercept operation. With the permission

of

LIKAYAK-2 organized a network of 22

agents between 1957 and 1969. The group was capable

of intercepting any item

Mexican telephone company and Mexico's richest

scribers and monitors. Other employees of the

listening post were friends of the Army officers

tho became the Mexican responsible for the listening

post. The station placed a staff agent, Arnold F.

APEHART, in the listening post as an outside case

officer responsible for supervision and mainten-

ance of the equipment. As of 1969, AREHART cOm-

pleted his tenth year in this position.

The initial project provided for a listening

post and a separate unit to investigate leads from

the taps. The separate unit (LITABLE) folded quickly.

The agents consisted of semi-illiterate bodyguard

types who could not respond to training. The train-

ing officer, Bernard

E. ELAKMAN, was returned to

Headquarters in 1959 (shortly after his arrival in

Mexico) for health reasons. He was not replaced.

The LITABLE agents were terminated soon thereafter.

Another early personnel problem evolved around

thu senior outside case officer. He did not have a

Spanish language capability, and he was also re-

surned to Headquarters when he could not adjust

lo the outside role of a staff agent. He was not

replaced.

By the end of 1959, the project was covering

30 lines;

The installation costs

were around $150,000.

The first targets selected

by the station were CP personalities not covered

by LIFEAT, but in June 1960 LIELEGANT indicated

that

wanted to cover the Soviet Bloc

installations. LIFEAT

taps were removed to prevent

LIENVOY from accidentally finding them and tracing

the wire to a listening post. From 1960 through

1969,

target lines of the station were Soviet

Bloc installations.

The LIENVOY Project cost about $60,000 per

year

after its first year. This figure did not

include salary

and allowances for the outside staff

agent, AREHART, who worked exclusively on LIENVOY

but was paid from

"support" funds. There were ten

Acxican employees working in the listening post who

prepared the daily transcripts and a summary of

information from the lines which were not fully

transcribed. This summary was delivered each morn-

Ing about 0800 hours to the station case officer by

AREHART. Any items of unusual significance were

brought to the attention of the chief of station

before 0900 hours.

Russian, Czech, Yugoslav, and

Polish language tapes were transcribed by other

contract agents not tied in with the LIENVOY Project.

These

persons usually had one room in their resi-

dences sealed

off as a work area for handling tapes.

The Headquarters FI Staff considered the

LIESTOS Project as a model for imitation by othe

processing

and exploitation of raw take.

From

1959 through 1968, the project produced an average

of 100 positive intelligence reports a year although

some of this information was of marginal value. The

operational information from the project on Soviet

Bloc officials and their contacts was considered

outstanding and essential to developing operations

against those targets.

The project had many frustrating situations

in dealing with LIENVOY-2, who was basically dis-

honest and conniving. Neither he nor his father,

LIELEGANT, were subject to any control by CIA

except through the tightening of purse strings.

Scott de-

cided to i

continue making the payments rather than

confront LIENVOY-2 with this fraud and offend him

or his father, LIELEGANT.

LIENVOY-2 also claimed to Scott that two of

the LITABLE agents were retained as investigators.

Scott agreed to subsidize their salaries as a part

of a monthly stipend paid to LIENVOY-2 for oper-

ational expenses. According to AREHART, he paid

all the operational expenses at the listening post

from his station revolving fund. Therefore, the

payments to LIENVOY-2 represented a flat subsidy

of $500 per month in addition to a salary of $480

per month.

This payment of $980 per month to LI-

INVOY-2 was recognized by Scott as an ante for main-

sining the relationship with LIELEGANT who received

no salary

from the station.

The project would have functioned better and

The project suf-

fered constantly from lack of effective management.

The surveillance team reports were of little or no

value because the agents did not receive proper

direction. They were removed from the LITEMPO

Project and placed under LIRICE in 1962. BENADUM

and LITEMPO-1 were so occupied with station requests

for operational support and security backstopping in

connection with the JMNET operation that all other

sitivities were neglected. They arranged through

for

such things as the purchase

and storage of 200,000 liters of aviation gas and

11,000 liters of oil on the Mexican airfields at

Chedumal and Cozumel for use during the Bay of Pigs

operation, the evacuation of an unmarked C-54 Agency

plane with a Cuban exile crew which made a forced

landing in Chiapas, the location and arrest of

Cuban nationals who had deserted their training

posts in Guatemala and were "at large" in Mexico,

and the legal entry into Mexico of Cubans whose

presence was necessary in connection with operations

against Cuba directed from Miami and other stations.

In the handling of these sporadic security and sup-

fort operations, day-to-day management of the LI-

TESIPO Project personnel was neglected by BENADUM

and LITEMPO-1.

Once the project got off on the wrong foot in

ine way of effective management, it was difficult

to repair the damage. None of the original agents

had the slightest concept of positive intelligence

reporting. As a result, the project produced noth-

suk during its first few years.

supervision of the project in an effort to increase

sion review, $10,000 was cut from the project by

sorainating marginal agents and cutting operational

capenses.

The project did not produce positive intel-

ligence until LITEMPO-12 was recruited. He was a

subordinate of LITEMPO-4

station. From early 1966, LITEMPO-12 heid meetings

cach morning with BENADUM and passed copies of re-

ports received

from LITEMPO-12 agents (about 20)

assigned to subversive targets. This produced

(for the next three years) about 20 percent of the

positive intelligence production from the station.

The reports covered activities of the CP, Cuban

exlles, the Trotskyites, and Soviet Bloc cultural

kroups. The results from police raids against

ibrersive groups were passed to the station via

LITEUPO-12. During 1967 and 1968, his group also

Clandestine Collection, Concept and Assessment

In examining the collection product, two

types of information must be distinguished. The

first, positive intelligence, was a clearly defined

item, collected for customer agencies, disseminated

according to their needs and interest, and was sub-

ject to evaluation. The usefulness and importance

of each report was manifest when the report was

weighed against other information on the same sub-

ject, considering the source's access and reporting

record.

Security intelligence, on the other hand, de-

fied precise definition.

It was largely self-

generated in response to Agency internal require-

ments or in pursuit of obvious, but not necessarily

formalized, security objectives. It received limited

distribution to a few other agencies with security

responsibilities (11 it was disseminated at all).

On receipt it was sometimes impossible to evaluate

with any degree of accuracy. In fact, its importance

did not become apparent for months or even years un-

til it was matched against other information received

from a different source, or until a sudden, specific

and often urgent need arose (in connection with a

Presidential visit, for example). Security intel-

ligence included all information concerning the

identities, activities, contacts, and movements of

US and foreign subversive personalities, foreign

intelligence personnel, and other persons known or

suspected of being engaged in activities inimical

to the United States. It was used to improve US

security or to assist in the implementation of US

national policy.

The station produced a large volume of security

intelligence concerning: US citizens initiating or

maintaining contact with the Cuban and Soviet diplo-

matic installations; travel to Cuba by US citizens

and residents; activities

of Cuban and Soviet intel-

ligence

personnel; travel of Mexican and other Latin

American

key subversive

personalities; and methods

used to support

subversive groups outside of Mexico.

In FY 1966, 82 formal disseminations of security

intelligence were made

to the FBI, the INS, the

military services, and similar customers. More than

half of these related to the activities of US na-

tionals. The bulk of the security intelligence,

however, was retained by operational elements of

CIA for

analysis and

internal use.

The Mexico

City

Station referred daily to indexes

based on this

material in tracing applicants for US visas, and in

support of

its own and other stations' operational

programs. The same indexes were also regularly

consulted

in tracing applicants for US Civil Ser-

vice positions, employees of private industry whose

access to classified information required a US secu-

rity clearance, and Mexicans visiting the United

States as members of official delegations scheduled

to receive classified briefings. The station ser-

viced approximately 35,000 name traces annually

(including visa checks) from 1957 through 1958 and

uncovered substantive information in about 12 per-

209/

cent of the cases.

In 1962 FI/INT/RE,* conducted a review of

210/

Clandestine Service (CS) reporting from Mexico.

This included a thorough study of 415 CS reports

disseminated during the six-month period ending

31 March 1962. The appraisal was based on a general

review and comparison of information from overt

sources during the same period and interviews with

customer analysts to determine the adequacy of past

CS reporting and needs for future CS reporting.

Collection guidance on Mexico was also examined to

determine its adequacy and relevance to the report-

ing•

The study reflected that the Related Missions

Directive largely, but not completely, provided for

the intelligence

community's

needs for CS reporting.

In general appraisal, CS reporting on Commu-

nist and leftist activities in Mexico was found

necessary to complement and confirm a volume of

similar information produced by the FBI and the

Office

of Operations (00). There was need for more

information

on Communist influence among individuals

such as

prominent Mexicans who supported Communism

on individual issues, particularly leftist influence

in the Mexican Government.

The overall Soviet plans

for the numerous

leftist assets in Mexico were not

sufficiently covered in the CS reporting.

Informa-

tion was also needed on the extent of Soviet influ

ence and subversion in all its forms throughout

Mexico. Reporting on students' domestic activities

was considered insufficient in relation to the im-

portance of the subject.

One-third of the reporting related to the

Communist Party, the National Liberation Movement

(MLN) and the Popular Socialist Party (PPS). Over

one-third

concerned trips by Mexicans to the Soviet

Bloc or Cuba for international Communist activities,

and visits of Bloc and Cuban nationals to Mexico.

Many of the reports were too general in nature to

meet community requirements for detailed data.

All reporting

was consonant with objectives

of the RMD. There were no significant areas of

marginal reporting where the CS should not be sup-

plying information.

An assessment prepared by FI/INT/RE of CS

reporting on Mexico for the period 1 February

through 31 July 1966 covered 359 reports dissemi-

nated from Mexico City and Monterrey during that

period.

211/

The findings revealed that the collec-

tion objectives of the RMD for Mexico, approved 22

July 1965, well represented the community's needs

and judgments as to priority. Among the customer

reactions, two were outstanding. There was urgent

need for more and higher level CS reporting on the

and

the leftist influence in the Government. The volu-

minous reporting on low-level affairs of the PCM

greatly exceeded customers' needs or their ability

to absorb it.

Other noteworthy findings were: Only 10.3

percent of the total product reviewed could be

related to RMD Priority A objectives, which con-

cerned Cuban and Soviet activities in Mexico, and

the Mexican Government. The reporting relevant io

RMD Objective B-1, which concerned the CP and re-

lated subjects, accounted for 78 percent of the pro-

duction reviewed. Low-level domestic activities

of the PCM,

and front groups were over-

reported.

Lacking was more information on active

militant groups.

Customers had nothing but praise for the

coverage of the Government's security precautions

surrounding President Johnson's visit. The 24 re-

ports on this subject, relevant to RMD Objective B-3,

were hailed as complete, timely, and very well

handled.

Another review of reporting against the Opera-

ting Directive Objectives was completed in early

212/

1968.

This covered 337 disseminations to cus-

tomer agencies during the period July through

December 1967. The study revealed that while there

was some excellent reporting from the Mexico City

Station, on an overall basis the same gaps, needs,

and overreporting characteristic of the 1966 review

continued in 1968. The station had the same low-

access agents and continued to disseminate their

reports even though customer agencies did not want

to receive this information.

To correct

this

situation, Headquarters

recommended that the station attempt to obtain

higher

access agents among Communist groups. Also,

some of the political information was passed to

the Embassy Political Section for background and

Situation reports.

The

elimination of this low

level information cut sharply the overall volume

of formal dissemim tions from the station but it

resulted in a better quality product. To meet

VI. Relations with the US Embassy

During the period covered by this history

(April 1947 to June 1969), there were six US Am-

bassadors

assigned to Mexico:

Walter

C. Thurston,

May

1946 to November 1950; William O'Dwyer, December

1950 to November 1952; Francis White, March 1953 to

April 1957; Robert C. Hill, May 1957 to November

1960; Thomas C. Mann, April 1961 to January 1964;

and Fulton Freeman, March 1964 to November 1968.

Relations between the first COS,

and Ambassador Thurston, a Foreign Service

Career officer, were cordial and friendly. To

Captain w. C. Ford and

who in-

spected the Mexico City Station in February 1949,

Thurston volunteered that he had no problems what-

soever regarding CIA operations in his area. He

stated that he was completely satisfied with the

manner in which

conducted his operations,

although he did not know what these operations con-

sisted of, but added that

in his own quiet,

efficient manner appeared to be well informed and

to have good coverage concerning subversive activi-

ties in Mexico.

Counselor of Embassy, were excellent.

Headquarters and conducted a review of the Embassy

files as a part of their reorganization of the sta-

tion files.

There was a marked increase in services per-

formed by the station for all Embassy components

after 1956. This included traces of names of visa

applicants, persons on the Ambassador's guest lists,

and employee applicants. Station photographic

facilities were made available to the Embassy.

The COS took an active part in the Ambassador's

staff meetings, and he briefed visiting US Con-

gressmen and newspapermen. Headquarters permitted

Ambassador Hill to detail Thomas J. Hazlett as the

Ambassador's secretary during Lopez Mateos inaugu-

ration ceremonies. The increased dependence on the

station for Embassy service led Headquarters in-

spectors in 1961 to suggest that the COS might need

command guidance on the extent of station services

for the Embassy to insure that CIA activities would

215/

not be neglected.*

Through Ambassador Hill, Scott met a wide

range of Mexican political figures. Hill promoted

Scott as his "expert on Communism," and was instru-

mental in placing Scott in contact with President

Lopez Mateos. Because of this friendly relation-

ship, Hill endorsed Scott's request for additional

personnel with nominal cover rather than

cover. He assigned to the station office space

twice the size assigned under previous ambassadors.

Ambassador Thomas C. Mann was briefed at

Headquarters on station operations and Scott's

Mann had grown up in Laredo, Texas, and was aware

of the sensitivity of the Mexican President to

close and open association with an American Ambas-

sador for fear that he might be subject to criti-

cism by opposition nationalist elements. Mann was

perfectly satisfied to use Scott as a channel to

for certain sensitive

political matters.

Mann also considered the

the best intelligence bpera-

Mann's successor, Ambassador Fulton Freeman,

did not share Mann's viewpoint and felt that he,

Freeman, should deal with the President of Mexico

on all matters. In November 1964, Mann (then

met with Freeman and Mann at this time.

Freeman exhibited some distrust of CIh. For

Instance, in November 1965 he advised the COS that

beginning 22 November he wanted to see all cable

available by the station but sensitive sources

were not identified in these communications.

Freeman made the same request of the local FBI

offices were cooperative in permitting use of

their offices by station officers for interviews

of "walk-in" cases or persons of operational inter-

est who called at the Embassy for pretext interviews.

One example of cooperation by the Embassy occurred

in 1962 when Roger Abraham, the Embassy administra-

tive counsellor, gave the station

In 1967 the Mexico City Station provided the

Embassy with file traces of 32,197 names. Memoranda

these names.

Relations with the Federal Bureau of Investigation

(FBI)

The FBI used the cover of legal attache, and

the size of its staff inside the Embassy compared

roughly with that of the station's integrated

personnel.

Relations between the station and the FBI

were generally cooperative. Every COS from 1947

until 1969 had been a former FBI agent. John N.

Speakes, Jr., was the senior FBI representative

in Mexico when Doyle opened the station. Speakes

remained in that position until his retirement in

1958. He was replaced by John Desmond, who served

in Mexico until 1963 when he retired and was re-

placed by Clark Anderson, who remained in Mexico

until he was transferred to Santo Domingo in April

1965. Nathan Ferris, who had served in the Wash-

ington FBI office as the senior representative for

the Westem Hemisphere, replaced Anderson and was

still in Mexico as of 1969.

Headquarters recognized that Mexico was in a

unique position as a consequence of its proximity

to the United States and its obvious utility as a

base for third country operations directed against

the United States. In view of the fact that the

FBI was charged with responsibility for the internal

security of the United States, the necessity for

219/

FBI activity could not be denied.

The Mexico FBI office received copies of all

disseminations from the station. It also received

counterespionage or security intelligence on all

non-US citizens of interest to that office. In-

formation on US citizens, except those in contact

with the Cuban or Soviet Embassy, was passed at

Headquarters. Copies of legal attache reports

were passed in Mexico to the station.

From 1947 until 1959 legal attache officers

concerned

themselves with criminal cases (fugitives

from justice, stolen cars, and fraud), espionage

investigations involving US citizens who fled to

Mexico, and US Communist Party leaders in temporary

exile in Mexico.

From 1960 on, the legal attache targets were

identical with those of the station, plus criminal

cases with which CIA was not concerned.

This led

to some unavoidable duplicate reporting by the FBI

and CIA.

sometimes be-

came delicate because many persons

of interest to

them were US citizens on whom CIA had acquired

information as a byproduct of technical operations

against the Soviet Bloc and Cuban official instal-

lations. The station was prohibited from passing

this information locally to the FBI without first

sending it to Headquarters and receiving clearance

to pass it locally. By this time,

the value of the

infornation had perished. For instance, US citizens

telephoned the Cuban Embassy to pick up visas to

221/

travel to Cuba.

They usually gave their name

over the telephone. By the time the station re-

ceived permission from Headquarters to give these

names to the local FBI office, the visitors had

gone to Cuba. When

this was pointed out to Head-

quarters, an exception

was made to existing regu-

lations, permitting the station to pass locally

information on Americans who contacted the Cuban

or Soviet Embassy.

The station began placing telephone taps for

the FBI in the 1950's. These were on the US CP

leaders and persons who were wanted in the United

States for questioning on espionage activities.

The targets were named by the FBI and consisted of

at least two simultaneous lines and sometimes as

many as four.

Their chief clerk transcribed 'the

reels and returned them with copies of the tran-

scripts.

The station occasionally checked

the

reels against the transcripts to make sure that

they were complete. The same group of FBI targets

Between 1947 and 1969 there were a number of

FBI double agents who met with their Soviet case of-

ficers in Mexico. The station provided support to

these operations in the form of surveillance and

photographic coverage of the agent meetings and the

agent activities while in Mexico.

The FBI did not always protect CIA sources.

An example of this was the handling of a CIA clan-

destine photograph in the Oswald case when the FBI

told Oswald's mother that the photograph was made

by CIA in front of the Soviet Embassy in Mexico

had provided them information in response to specific

requests, but

the military office wanted to receive

copies of

all local CIA disseminations. From

Septem-

ber 1947, all local disseminations were

sent to the

military and naval

attaches.

In 1956 Lt. Colonel Oscar M. Doerflinger was

assigned to the military attache office in Mexico

City in response to a specific request from CIA.

Doerflinger had served at Headquarters as the branch

chicf for Mexico just prior to his assignment to

Mexico. During his tour in Mexico City, cooperation

223/

with the station was excellent.

At the station's request in 1956, the air

attache flew at low altitude over the Soviet Bloc

official installation and made aerial photographs

with a 70-millimeter aerial camera. The photo-

graphs were so clear and sharp that they showed a

powerful radio antenna concealed in a well of the

roof of the Soviet Embassy. The air and naval

attaches also made their aircraft available to CIA

on special flights for cargo from the United States.

On these occasions, CIA paid the operating costs.

In an economy move in 1967 the US Government with-

drew the aircraft which had formerly been assigned

to the Ambassador.

Military officers worked closely with the sta-

tion in the investigation of servicemen who were in

Mexico without leave from their bases.

Periodically,

these persons were in contact with the Soviet Bloc

and Cuban official installations attempting to

travel to Cuba or the Soviet Union. In several

instances, information provided by the station

assisted in locating the men and returning them

to

their US military bases.

The LIOYSTER operation was an example of sta-

tion cooperation with the military officers and

the FBI when an enlisted man in the US Army came

to Mexico, under military guidance, and met with

his Soviet intelligence case officer.

Military and naval attaches were members of

the attache association and provided the station

with personality information on the Soviet Bloc

attache. In one instance, based on derogatory in-

formation from a CIA technical operation, the US

military attache made a recruitment approach to

the Soviet attache which was turned down.

Operational Directives

From April 1947 until 1 March 1948 general

operational priorities were outlined in National

Security Council Intelligence Directive Number 5

(NSCID/5). Grouped in order of importance, these

priorities were; espionage and counterespionage

operations against the Soviet Union; Soviet activi-

ties outside the USSR; scientific research and

technical developments relating to atomic, biologi-

cal and chemical warfare, suided missiles, and

electronics; and collection of information on

political, economic, and military developments

likely to affect the security of the United States.

Correspondence between Headquarters and

Mexico City Station indicates that Special Opera-

tional Instruction No. 23 (S0I/23) dated 1. March

1948, established the following more specific

targets:

a. Communist Party of Mexico.

b. Activities of the leading Marxist

organization and leftist Popular Party

(Partido Popular - PP).*

c. Soviet and Soviet Satellite

officials.

d. Spanish Communist Party.

e.

Political and financial plans

of

This directive was valid for three months.

Progress of the Mexico City Station in covering

these targets was reported monthly to Headquarters.

In July 1948 S0I/23 was extended for six months and

reporting requirements were changed to quarterly

intervals. Headquarters continued extensions until

the SOI was replaced by the first RMD dated 27 July

1954 which defined the CIA mission in Mexico.

The

chief of station was assigned responsibility for:

a. All US Government foreign intel-

ligence (FI) operations in Mexico, except

for agreed intelligence activities con-

ducted by other US Government agencies.

b. All US Government political and

psychological (PP) operations in Mexico,

subject to coordination at Headquarters

with the International Organizations

(IO) Division on pertinent international

programs and with the United States In-

formation Agency

(USIA) concerning gray

propaganda.

c. Any paramilitary (PM) operations

that might be necessary for Mexico.

This directive outlined the station's position

on relations with other US Government and foreign

agencies. Relations with the State Department were

to be in accordance with the provisions of State

Department-Office of Special Operations (STOSO)

agreement. Coordination with the FBI, I&NS, Depart-

ment of Defense (DOD), and USIA was authorized by

Headquarters in cases of mutual interest. No formal

liaison was authorized with foreign intelligence

services, but the station was permitted to continue

contact with the Federal Security Service and the

British intelligence representative.

The basic FI mission in Mexico was to promote

the security of the United States by the development

and use of clandestine FI assets to collect informa-

tion on the intentions, capabilities and courses of

action of Mexico, the Soviet Bloc, and of other

countries likely to affect the security of the

United States.

The basic PP mission in Mexico was to promote

the security of the United States by covert opera-

tions, planned

in such a way that the US Government's

role would not be evident but if uncovered could

plausibly be denied. The purpose of these opera-

tions were to:

a. Contribute to the worldwide

objective of reducing the political and

economic power and potential of the Soviet

Bloc and its capability to wage hot war.

b. Discredit the ideology of inter-

national Communism and exploit its prob-

lems.

.c.

Combat the activities of Communist-

oriented parties and other radical groups

in Mexico.

d. Combat the activities of elements

hostile to the United States.

objective "K" deleted because the 1956 Operational

Program for Mexico contained no provision to cover

it. It also provided for an area-wide anti-Communist

front organization with chapters in all Latin Ameri-

can countries and yearly congresses to coordinate

anti-Communist activities.

In 1956 the RMD had only 10 objectives ("K"

and "M" were deleted and "J" was included with the

Soviet Bloc requirement). The need for CE and CI

operations against Soviet officials and the Soviet

intelligence services was emphasized.

lites and their services dropped to "Priority II."

and report on the activities of US Communists in

contact with Soviet officials in Mexico.

The 1957 RID represented a complete change in

format but very little change in content or opera-

tional emphasis. The long-range purposes

of US

policy remained that of counteracting

international

Communism and

encouraging democratic governments

friendly to the United States.

In 1958 one additional task was added. This

was recruitment of third country national diplomats

who might be assigned to Soviet Bloc countries.

about the oniy change in the 1959 RMD was the

recognition of the Chinese Communists as a Priority

III objective. This was a worldwide activity and

not of special significance to Mexico since there

were no Communist Chinese officials in the country.

Another objective included in this RMD was the plot-

ting of Latin American revolutionary exile groups.

An effort was made in 1960 to revise the RMD

to more accurately reflect operational conditions

and capabilities. Coverage of Cuban

revolutionary

groups in Mexico was made a specific requirement

under Priority I because of the threat presented

by Communist Cuba to US interests in Latin America.

Covert action operations were authorized against

the Cuban targets in Mexico. The same instruction

remained in effect until October 1963 when the opera-

tional priorities were reduced to three major targets:

the Cubans, the Soviets, and

These remained the primary reporting targets in 1964,

1965, and 1966 though the Mexico City Station pressed

for higher priorities for the CP of Mexico and Soviet

Satellite activities.

In 1967 the RMD's were replaced by Operating

Directives which were included as a part of the

operational programs.

The Operating Directive dated January 1967 re-

peated the unchanged long-range United States policy

toward Mexico. Operational targets in order of

priority were:

A. •Cuba

B. Soviet Union

C. Communist Party of Mexico

E.

In 1968 the Operating Directive format was

changed back to the Priority I and II categories

used from 1956 through 1966. This directive was

effective through FY 1969, the cutoff date for this

paper. In general terms, the Priority I targets

were:

A. Soviet Union

B.

Cuba

c.

D. Communist Party in Mexico

The Priority II targets were travelers to the

Soviet Bloc, Satellite intelligence services, and

anti-US extremists.

Generally, the Soviet Embassy in Mexico was

the main target of the station. From 1947 to 1954,

S0I/23 gave higher priority to the CP and the Popular

Socialist Party coverage but by 1954 when the first

RMD was written, it was recognized that the Soviet

Embassy was the number one target.

During the

period 1960 through 1967, Cuba was placed ahead of

the Soviets as an operational target because of the

threat posed in the Western Hemisphere by exporta-

tion of Castro-type revolutionary and guerrilla

activities. In 1968 the Soviets again became the

priority target when Cuban revolutionary activities

in Latin American countries were disrupted by the

assassination of "Che" Guevara, the Latin American

revolutionary, and it appeared that the Soviets

were pressuring Castro to discontinue these opera-

tions.

The

and CP activities

were of continuing interest but of a

lower priority.

Soviet Satellite intelligence services

were of lesser

interest. They, like the Latin American

exiles

and

targets of opportunity, followed behind the Soviets,

Cuba,

and the CP of Mexico.

The Soviets used Mexico as an important base

for their operations against the United States, and

two-thirds of their officials in Mexico were experi-

enced intelligence officers. They also enjoyed a

permissive attitude as far as the Mexican Security

Service was concerned. For these reasons, the

Soviet Embassy was the primary target of the station

during most of the first 22 years of its history.
