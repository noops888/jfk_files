1. BACKGROUND.

The LIMPTY Project is designed to collect operational information on the

LIMERICK installation and personnel, as well as targets of opportunity, through

stationary and mobile photographic coverage. In addition, the project provides the

means for investigating leads from the above noted coverages as well as other Stati.

sources. LIEMPTY supports other Station operations through the renting of safehous:

providing and servicing post office box letter drops, conducting countersurveillanc:

and investigations and performing related tasks.

2. OPERATIONS.

53320

No change is foreseen

this phase of the operation. The product supplied by the project is considered an

essential tool in following the daily activities of the personnel of the target

installation and visitors to that installation. Statistically LIEMPTY take for the

reporting period consisted of approximately 290 rolls of operational still photogre

This total includes both mobile and fixed photo surveillance take. The daily logs

Kept by the basehouses on the movements of the LIMERICK staff members and visitors

greatly aid the Station CE efforts against that target, especially in times of cric

In the area of specific support to Station operations (in addition to the

coverage provided against the LIMERICK target) the following is a list of selected

LIEMPTY contributions.

a. The LILMPTY contribution to the sensitive AMROD operation, in the form of

support provided by the cutoits Raymond H. GRENDE (ps) and Oliver G.

SCANTLING (ps), can be described as unique and essential to the success ‹

that operation. Although this operation is necessarily a Headquarters

directed effort, the operational work of GURENDE and SCANTLING is the

essentirl ingredient in making the operation viable.

Raymond H. GERINDE (ps) continued in his assignment as cutout to the

LILYRIC and LICALLA basehouses

and the LIANTRAP truck.

conducted an extensive investigation in Station's attempt to provide

positive identification of a group of PBPRIME students who visited the

LIMERICK installation.

GRENDE and LIEMPTY-10 continue to provide and

service. P. O. box drops for use in Station operations.

During the recent

visit of AMSTRUT-2 to. Mexico one of the drops was,

for a time,

sole active

conmunications link with AMSTRUI-2. GRINDE provided twice daily servicing

of the drop during this period.

c.

Oliver G. SCANTLING. (ps) continued as cutout to the LIMITED basehouse during

the reporting period.

In addition, he made his regular contribution as

alternate contact of LICASA-1 in a sensitive operation of LAURICLE interest.

Based on LIEMPTY and LIENVOY leads, SCANTLING conducted an investiration

to determine the possibility of using the manager of a construction company

which was engaged in repair work at the LIMERICK installation to provide

access to that installation.

SCANTLING located this individual and manored

to elicit much information

from him.

Although SCAITLING was prepared to

continue the contact with this manager with a view toward his recruitment,

Headquarters and Station, using SCANTLING's information as a guide,

determined that the access provided in

this instance was not suitable for

mounting an operation.

In another case, SCANTLING provided special servicin

of a P. O. box drop intended for backup communications with AEIMPULSE.

was discontinued I June when other arrangements were established for this

operation.

d.

During the reporting period operational employment of LIENTRAP continued at

a high level of activity.

LIENTRAP provided 71 rolls of operational film

from coverage of selected targets.

Most of this take related to the

Station's efforts against the PCM and Commist exiles residing in Mexico.

Since June the Station has been host to a TDY task force for the division

concerned with LIMERICK activity.

This group has for its primary purpose

the collation of all available infornation from Station files on LIMERICK

personalities. It is believed worthy of mention that probably the bulk of

infornation made available to the task force is of LIEMPTY origin.

I.

In reference to paragraph 2 of reference b concerning information of

LAURICLE interest provided by LICALLA, Station vas referring to the LICALLA

photographs and

of IDENTITY A installations at LIMERICK.

the LIMESA agents, LICALLA has been given the requirement to provide periodir

reporting to the Station of this type material.

 SECURITY.

As was noted in reference, new recontact plans have been formulated lo? use with:

all basehouse keepers.

These are being established with the agents in question and

will be on file in the individual agent files at the Station.

There were no adverse security incidents

effecting the project during the

reporting period.

H. EQUIPMENT.

On 23 July the LILYNIC camera jammed due to a faulty take-up sprocket wheel.

GERINDE had this equipment repaired and it was back in operation on 29 July 1904.

• 5. PERSONNEL.

Following plans previously set forth in reference A, LIEMPTY-O (201-121109) and

LIEMPTY-12 (201-076385) were terminated as of 1 July 1904. Agent Service Record for

LIIMPTY-8 was forwarded by HMA-25890 and for IIEMPTY-12 by HMMA-23891.

No decrease

in the efficiency or security of the operation should result from these terminations.

LILMPTY-19 will revert to an hourly pay rate of $US2.25 as of 1 September 1964

in place of the #US120.00 she had previously received. This,

in addition to the

terminations noted above, should provide economies for the LIEPlY Project in keepinG

with Station's efforts to cut back costs of support projects.

TRAINING.

No agent training other than regular review of tradecraft principles is planned.

instructed as necessary to improve or correct their technique in both taking and

processing the prouuct.

7: PLANS.

It is planned to have Raymond. H. GURENDE (ps) replace Oliver G. SCANTLING. (ps)

This will enable GERENDE to undertake more

responsibility and give the Station opportunity to employ SCANTLING more fully

pretext investigations, a field for which he is particularly suited.
