DATE: 4/18/79

TIVOR: SA CLIFFORD H. ANDERSON

SUBJECT: GARY RICHARD GOCHNOUR,

MISCELLANEOUS INFO CONCERNING

TO: SAC, NEW ORLEANS (47-

See 62-4512 and 190-2 for previous information

regarding captioned

subject.

This information

characterizes him as a chronic complainer, and a source

of possibly spurious information regarding the KENNEDY

assassination,

On 4/5/79, former symbol source CSNO 1318 - R

telephonically advised that he had received a complaint

from 2 individuals who are

visiting professors in New

Orleans to attend a conference at Tulane University regarding

World War

II and the Holocaust. As the attached

indicates, these two individuals encountered GOCHNOUR

who was apparently the owner or the manager of the columns

Hotel on St. Charles Avenue where GOCHNOUR arrogantly

insisted

that the deaths of the

6 million Jews during

World War II were not attributable to HITLER or Nazi

Germany, but were the victims of typhoid.

What is

not noted on the attached sheet is the

fact that GOCHNOUR introduced himself as an ex-FBI Agent,

in order to gain credence to add weight to his argument,

for GOCHNOUR.

The source furnishing this information indicaied that,

though

his own worse enemy in not making hinself

believable, nevertheless people hearing GOCHNOUR state

such information, might very well have obtained an unfavorable

impression

of the

FBI from GOCHNOUR's comments.

This information is being furnished for reference

sake, and

any action deemed appropriate.

If GOCHNOUR is

confronted by this information, it is recommended that the

source be concealed, but the information in the attached

complaint is not privileged.
