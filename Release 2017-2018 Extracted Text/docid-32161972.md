this final official report and the letter of 5/6/64 prepared

by Acting Secretary of Gobernacion LUIS ECHEVERRIA, the

translation of which letter was furnished with rebuairtel of

As

and 5/26/64, neither the final official report of the Mexican

Government nor the ECHEVERRIA letter appeared to contain

information which had not been previously reported to the

Bureau.

No apparent purpose would be served in furnishing the

President's Commission with a translation of the ECHEVIRAIA

letter for use in making a comparison of it with the final

official report.of the Mexican Government which was forwarded

to the Commission through the State Department by the Embassy
