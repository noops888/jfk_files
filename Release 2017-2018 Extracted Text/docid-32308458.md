in Miami, received a telephone call the previous

night

from the owner of the 48 foot schooner "Mariner," which

the crew was with-

out food, and they needed money C

chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary Council.

dvised that he was also in touch with LUISKrABEL OF

the Cuban Revolutionary Council, which organization is

interested in setting up a military training camp in

the New Orleans area.

TH

On July 2, 1962, MM T-1 advised that LA BORDE

had contacted the owner of the schooner 'Elsie Reichart,"

which boat is about 65 feet long; previously belonged to

the Smithsonian Institute, and is presently located in

New Orleans. This boat is owned by three young Americans:

JACK (last name unknown) and the two other Americans, names

unknown, live on the boat and work on it. The boat was

purchased for about $9,000.00 and is presently in a boat-

yard being caulked. (8)

*) U)

MM T-1 explained that LA BORDE said the boat can

operate at a speed of about twelve knots and is supposed

to come to Miami and then operate between the United States

and Cuba as a mother ship for small boats which will par-

ticipate in clandestine military operations against Cuba.

LA BORDE is trying to find a Cuban to act as captain of

the ship because such a person would be necessary if the

ship was operated in Cuban waters.

MM I-l explained that the plan for this operation

was devised by LA BORDE, who, with sufficient money and

backing, could probably be successful in such an operation

MM I-I explained that the "Mariner'' as of then,

July 2, 1962, was located at Fort Myers, Florida, with

the three young Americans on board. These three

young

Americans are in their early twenties and one is accom-

panied by his wife. In a telephone call to Miami, they

stated that the motor had been damaged. The running

lights are inoperative and they lost the ship's anchor.

They stated they needed money to continue on to Miami.

It was expected that LARRY LA BORDE would accompany

GERALD PATRICKAHEMMING to Fort Myers, Florida, to confer

with these three Americans.

MM I-1 explained that HEMMING is an American

soldier of fortune who has been

engaged in Cuban revolu-

tionary activities, both in the United States and in Cuba,

and who is not accepted by the leading Cuban revolutionary

organizations, although he is well known to them. gB(4)

MM T-1 explained that LA BORDE is quite angry

; and disappointed with the crew of the "Mariner" for not

having arrived in Miami and requesting money. MM T-1

advised that LA BORDE, on July 2, 1962, was staying with

MM T-1 said that LA BORDE apparently has insufficient

funds to carry on an operation between the United States

and Cuba and

is not

in posseusion of the necessary arms

and equipment.
