The fact that ROTHAN and the Sans Souci were in bad sbape

econonically was borne out by PCIL

] FBI No. 2198122, American

floor man at the Tropicana night club, who in September, 1953, advised

that he was trying to work out a deal to take over the Sans Souci. It is

to be noted that the Tropicana is strictly a Cuban operation, being owned

by two Cuban brothers named MARTIN and PEDREynX, a Cuban named OSCAR

XIGHEMENDIA and a Cuban named ARDURA, and there has always been a strong

rivalry between it and the Sans Souci, both of which have gambling casinos,

To date, ROTHAN continues to operate the Sans Souci; however,

it appears that there still exists the possibility that the Sans Souci

will be taken over by the Tropicana. The 1-24-54 issue of the Havana

daily, "Prensa libro," in a section called "OIGA" ("LISTEN"), which is &

Winchell like column on the theatrical and cabaret world in Havana, con-

tained the following paragraph:

"It results that there are almost permanent conversa-

tions between NORMAN ROTHAN of the Sans Souct and

MARTIN FOX, ARDURA Or ECHEMENDIA of the Tropicana.

There is never lacking a suspicion that they might be

speaking of unification, of interchanges, of manage-

ment, etc." &

Efforts will be made to ascertain through

and ROTHAN

whether the Tropicana is taking over the operation

the sans Soucid

As an indication of the financial situation of ROTHMAN,

on 1-25-54,

Lto HERIBERTO HERNANDEZ of the Cuban Bureau of Investigations exhibited

a letter dated 1-1l-54 written by the firm of Nathan, Nathan & Nathan,

6 laiden Lane, NYC, to the Chief of Police,
