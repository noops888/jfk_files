PURPOSE: To furnish status of the issue involving release

by the HSCA of an FBI document to an outside party,

as addressed in correspondence to HSCA Chairman, Louis V.

Stokes, on 12/6/78 and responded to by HSCA Chief Counsel

and Director, G. Robert Blakey, on 12/13/78, and to recommend

attached letter be sent to Mr. Blakey requesting he identify

any other FBI documents furnished by this Bureau to the HSCA

which may have been similarly released.

DETAILS: By letter dated 12/6/78 (copy attached with enclosures),

HSCA Chairman Louis V. Stokes was furnished a copy

of an FBI document dated 5/26/71, an informant report from

the

St. Louis Field Office file of former informant Oliver Patterson.

This informant report, along with three related items of

correspondence, was furnished to the FBI via the Department of

Justice (DOJ) by Harold Weisberg, a private citizen, author

and self-styled assassination prober. Mr. Weisberg

received

the document from Patterson.

The informant report in question was furnished the

HSCA in response to the Committee

s request dated 1/26/78 for

all retrievable information concerning Patterson.

Our letter

to Mr. Stokes expressed

concern that a document of this nature

entered the public domain in such a manner and requested that

the HSCA, in compliance with the Memorandum of Understanding,

afford proper and necessary security to our documents during

course of future public hearings and the HSCA final report.

Memorandum from D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett

Re:

House Slect Committee on Assassinations (HSCA

62-117290

In his letter of 1413//o

behalf of Chairman Stokes

explained that since the int omant

report in question

stemmed from Patterson, it was his Blakey's)

understanding that our release of materials would include

no objection to Patterson having what he had originally given

Mr. Blakey expressed regret that this instance

caused any concern and assured the Director that the HSCA

would continue to afford FBI material all measures of

confidentiality in compliance with the Memorandum of Under-

standing.

Upon receipt of Mr. Blakey's letter, the Director

attached a routing

slip, noting "Are you satisfied with

this response? Anything further required?"

Mr. Blakey is correct that the informant report

in question was prepared by Patterson and given the Bureau

in 1971. However, the FD-306 cover sheet was attached by

the FBI upon filing and, therefore, did not originate with

Patterson.

Further, at

the time of our release of material

concerning Patterson, the HSCA was not given authorization to

release any document

from FBI files to Patterson.

Mr. Blakey

should be advised to this effect to correct his understanding

that we have no objection to Patterson (or any other outside

party) having

what he originally furnished to the FBI.

Patterson desires FBI information concerning himself, he

should request same under the Freedom of Information Act

(FOIA) and not from the HSCA.

to SA John Howard, FOLA Scanch, Records Stagement Division,

the FD-306 and attached report would have been provided

Patterson under the FOIA.

Although Mr. Blakey's letter assures that our docu-

ments will be afforded full

security in the future, it is

believed

a letter should be directed to him correcting his

be invited to all the gala doings and meet all the right people at the

meeting. DR. FIELDS also mentioned that once a month DR. FIELDS drives

to Atlanta, Georgia to get the Thunderbolt printed as otherwise the

editor fills in the vacant spaces with recipes and jokes.

(Earlier in the week s.B. STONER had inferred to the PATTERSONS that

the headquarters would eventually be built from the building fund in

Select Committee

on Assassinations

U.S. House of Nepresentatives

3369 House Office Buflding, Annex 2

Hashington, o.c. 20515

Dear Mr. Blakey:

If you taught law students the war you wote your letter of October 24, 1 can

understand the Chief Justice's comment on the incompetence of lawyers better

than I could before receiving your letter.

If a nonlawyer can presume to give advice to one who insists on being referred

to as professor, then I think the beginning of your convoluted first sentence is

an unmise description of pursuing a Congressional Investigation under the pre-

text of a legitisaate legislative purpose.

The final words in this long sentence are more suitable for use before a jury.

you want to prejudice.

While I an required to work when I am too tired and at

a pace I would prefer to be not as raold, I doubt that I ever sald, in my letter

of October 7 or anywhere alse, that I found anything you or the committee have

done to be "ot usa to the puhlte." It by any renote chance I so misspoke myself,

then this is my correction of it.

There can be values in some of what yuu saw no value in. This parhaps explalns

your refusal to provide coples of the public record when I was specific in telling

you I want it for use in court.

Some of what you refuse to provide me you nave to the press. As I told you, 1

heard some of It broadcast, which is a pretty public use.

Those of your staff who run the xerax nachines are hardly those wino are "curfently

working long hours" on "the final report" and "to prepare for the upcomina public

hearings on the assassination of is. Martin Luther King, Jr." (You have saparate

subcommittees, separate staffs, and I asked for JFK public decords, not those on

the King case.

Your JFK hearings are not antil Duceaber.)

If either the House or the coumittee rules prevent your providinn me with xerox

copies of the public record, you fall to say this while contorting yourself to

Imply 18. Without the most radical channe in the policy of the Congress since 1

had the responsibility for making the public record avallable, you do not reflect

It faithfully and Invoke the Conmittee and House rules in what amounts to false

pretense.

What you are really afaald of is any use that could expose what you are doing

ptlor to your dumping of an indigestible mass of preconceptions on what will

arount to a captive press becausa of time pressuras.

I has no such thing in mind

but maybe I will think about it and find some means of doing something about it

prior to your coming news-managanent stunt of withholding copies of everything

until you can present a report that nobody can check against its alleged sources.

Which are carefully enough selected in advance in any event.

It what you put into the public record does not lamediately then go into the

puble domain, please correct me promptly because if there is a conventent

opportunity i say convey this to a reporter and l do not want to err.

If I an not incorrect, then all your who-struck-John is no better than a law

professor's Rube Goldberg contrantion for refusing to providr me dith xerox

copies of the public record for which I offered to pay in advance. All I

asked for neouires no more than givina a clert public records to xerox and

ma11. You know that it 18 not possible because of my conditóon for me to go

to your offices. and serely read records there, as 1t also is not possible for

se to file with any court what l can do no more than read.

If you really must write self-serving letters, why don't you turn the task

that clearly is too much for you over to one of the bright kids you have

hired with the largest investigatlve appropriacion in Congressional history?

A kid on your staff sight have had nore concern for your reputation than your

own letter rat\ects.,
