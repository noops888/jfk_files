ZONE OF AUSTRIA AND THE NEW ORGANIZATION WAS GIVEN

RADIOS SO THEY COULD KEEP IN TOUCH WITH

EACH OTHER.

PEOPLE PUT CACHES OF WEAPONS, AMMUNITION,

FOOD, AND UNIFORMS INTO THE GROUND IN OVER 70 PLACES IN THE U.S.

ZONE AND ELSEWHERE. OLAH'S GROUP WAS TO BE GIVEN THE LOCATION OF

THE CACHES WHEN THE RED ARMY MOVED.

RECENTLY THE US GOVERNMENT REVEALED TO THE AUSTRIAN GOVERNMENT

THE EXISTENCE OF THESE CACHES AND THE EMBASSY GAVE AUSTRIAN

OFFICIALS THE LOCATIONS OF THESE CACHES. AUSTRIAN PRESS, RADIO, AND

TV COVERAGE OF ALL THIS. HAS BEEN GENERALLY FAVORABLE AND EVEN

GRATEFUL. OLAH'S INVOLVEMENT IS KNOWN FROM HIS MEMOIRS AND FROM

STATEMENTS HE MADE DURING HIS TRIAL IN THE 1960'S (HE WAS TRIED,

CONVICTED,

AND SERVED ONE YEAR FOR USING A LABOR UNION SAVINGS

ACCOUNT AS SECURITY FOR A LOAN TO BUY THE KRONEN ZEITUNG, A TABLOID

WHICH NOW HAS THE LARGEST CIRCULATION IN AUSTRIA.

THE TWO MEN,

( (DICHAND)) AND ( (FALK)), HE CHOSE TO RUN THE PAPER, THEN TOOK IT

OVER AS THEIR PERSONAL PROPERTY, BECOMING ALMOST THE RICHEST MEN IN

AUSTRIA. DICHAND LATER SOLD OUT TO FALK AND FOUNDED ANOTHER TABLOID.

MEETINGS WITH OLAH, HE WAS ACCOMPANIED

BY HIS. TWO "SECRETARIES," JOSEF ((LAS)) AND HEINRICH ( (DAURER) ) •

LAS WENT TO JAIL FOR THE SAME OFFENSE AS OLAH AND DAURER MAY HAVE,

• TOO.

FROM A TV SHOW THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 26, 1996, I LEARNED THERE

ARE AT LEAST TWO EAGER YOUNG AUSTRIAN HISTORIANS WORKING TO LEARN

ALL THE FACTS ABOUT THIS CASE.

ONE HAD SHEAVES OF TOP SECRET

DOCUMENTS FROM THE STATE AND DEFENSE DEPTS. BEARING ON U.S. SCHEMES

TO RE-ARM AUSTRIA.

IF MY NAME IS REVEALED, IT WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL

AUSTRIAN OFFICERS I HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS.

SHOW SEVERAL LENGTHY INTERVIEWS WITH ME ON THE 1993 OCCASION OF THE

150TH JUBILEE OF THE VIENNA MEN'S SINGING SOCIETY, WHICH I HAVE

BELONGED TO SINCE 1972. OLAH, LAS, AND DAURER CAN ALI RECOGNIZE ME.
