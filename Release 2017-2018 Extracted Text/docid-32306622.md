011 Company Leases Property in Which Giancana May have Interest

Recent investigation has indicated that Giancana has an

interest in the Villa Moderne Motel, Northbrook, Illinois. Mark

Friedman, vice president of the Jupiter - Midwest Oil Company, advised

March 14, 1961, that the company in January, 1961, leased the property

occupied by the Villa Moderne Motel, Northbrook, Illinois. Friedman

was questioned concerning the possible interest

of Glancana in the

Villa Moderne and he denied any such connection. When questioned

further concerning the history of the leasing transaction in connection

with Villa Moderne, Friedman terminated the interview and asked

interviewing Agents to meet him in the office of his lawyer if any

further information was desired. U

to develop fully the identities of enterprises in which Giancana has

a financial interest.

develop fully the picture as to the various gambling enterprises

he operates particularly as to the size of these operations and the

identities of associates who are conducting them.

All offices having leads in this matter have been

instructed to afford inquiries top priority in an effort to develop

a prosecutable violation on Giancana at the earliest possible time. U
