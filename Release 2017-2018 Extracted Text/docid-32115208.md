SA EDWIN D. KUYKENDALL

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

CS-DL 108-R

Source on 5/25/64, furnished an oral report to

SA EDWIN D. KUYKENDALL which

was dictated on 5/26/64,

to

Steno EVALYN MIDDLETON; typed 6/1/64.

It was authenticated

by source on 6/3/64, in the presence of SA KUYKENDALI.

It

is filed as 170-1A-5.

Source in this report advised that the BILLY

JANES BARGIS grOUp, including CARLOS BRINGUIER Dade an

appearance at 7:30

PM, 5/25/64,

at the Community Hall, also

known as City Hall, 4100 block Clarendon, Cockrell Hill, Texas.

About 60 persons were present:

BILLY JAMES HARGIS opened the meeting and after a

short speech and taking of a collection for Christian Anti-

Communist Crusade activities, turned the meeting over to

CARLOS BRINGUIER Of the Cuban Student Directorate with head-

quarters in Miami, Florida.

BRINGUIER was selling yellow

leaflets in connection with telling his story to the group.

He was selling the leaflets at .25 cents per copy and said

was trying to accunulate money to help in the coming invasion

of Cuba by Cuban exiles by August 1, 1964, as has been planned.

He told substantially the same story that he gave at Plano,

Texas, on the night of 5/23/64.

He stated in connection with

that story that there are about 4,000 Cuban exiles in New

Orleans who are his followers and associates:

In talking at

Plano on 5/23/64, about the Marine book that LEE OSWALD had

given to him in the middle of 1963, at New Orleans, he said

the name shown inside the cover of

that book was HIDELL (phonetic).

At the meeting, however, in Cockrell Hill he did not state the

sane thing; but said literature OSWALD was passing out in

New Orleans bore

the nane of A. J. HIDELL.

BRINGUIER claims

to hold a doctor's degree and claims he receives a salary from
