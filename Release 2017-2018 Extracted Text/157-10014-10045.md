TESTIMONY OF GORDON GRAY

2

Mr: Gray. I have always considered

it a privilege to appear

befora a Senate Committoe. la perhaps you know, I had a session

on July 5 with four members of the Committee staff. I should

5 1lke to say, Mr. Chairman, that I found them courteous, intelligent,

6

ablo and well informed. I hope that our meeting was a construc-

7

tive ono.

8

I trust that I need not assure you that I wish to be as

9 helpful as I can, but I must remind you that ve shall probably

Ju be talking about situations which existed something like 15 to

1: 117 years ago and I fear that my recollections are not as sharp

::as I would like them to be. The staff members did give me

1? "some refreshment by showing me memoranda which I believe will

Is for the badle for your questions.

I might say that these were

15

memoranda which I had not seen before, and I believe that the

16

reason

that they were not distributed to principals of what is

17

now called the Forty Committee was that President Eisenhower

i wanted only one copy of notes of these meetings in existence

and that was to be kept in the files of the Director of the

¿ Central Intelligence Agency.

An exception was made in the case

of Cuba.

2I My own experience with the National Security Council and

2: Intelligence matters in general was

follows:

As Secretary of the Army from 1949 to 1950, I at one time

was a statutory member of the NSC. However, as you will recall

In and in that capacity served as back up for the Secretary of

Мг. Gray. Yes, sir.

Mr. Schwarz. Hould you look at the third page, please?

The document says that "Mr. Merchant asked whether any

MI. Merchant was a Stato Department ropresentative on the

Mr. Gray. lle was. Yes, indeed.

Mr. Schwarz. Now would you agree that the words "direct

i planning in connection with assassinating those

people?

Mr. Gray. I think the phrase "positive action" could

1 Include assassination, but I should say it is all the intent

?: sure what was in Mr. Merchant's mind. I agree that assassination

:: could be included in that phrase, but I think, having had my

i: recollection refreshed by seeing this paper, which I had not

i ; seen before, Mr. Merchant

includes, or General Cabell pointed

out that this was not a practical option and he said it would

have to be concluded that Mr. Merchant's suggostion was beyond

our capabilities.

On the top of the next page the statament is made that

saying we need a Cuban leader around whom anti-Castro elements

Mr. Gray. Yes, it was a problem. I think

it was recognized

"and I remember very well, MI. Schwarz, toward the, I guess the

end of the Eisenhower Administration that he used to press

¡among themselves. The Central Intelligence Agency had not,

I think, by the time President Eisenhower went out of office,

Mr. Schwarz. Would the assassination of Mr. Castro prior

'assassination wasn't approved, but I'm asking you a hypothetical

MI. Gray. Well, I can't answer that yes or no because

I think that the other part of the question is that

In Cuba was being worked on. Admiral Burke suggestod that any

a plan for the ramoval of cubar loadore should be a package daal,

i "since many of the leaders around Castro were even worde than

: Castro."

Now does the plan

for the removal of Cuban leaders contem-

o iplato the assassination of Cuban leaders?

7

Mr. Gray. The plan that MI. Dulles reported on that

* was being worked on on March 14 was a four-point program, and

• I am not sure, Mr. Schwarz, whether this meeting took place

before the President approved of the four-point program or

:: immediately afterwards, but Mr. Dulles was certainly referring

:: to what I. call the four-point program which was approved

by the President and which formed the

basis of various

:; activities which ultimately resulted in what we know as the

:: Bay of Pigs.

I have not had a chance to see that four-point paper,

i: I guess since

I went out of office in the Eisenhower Admini-

:: stration. As I recall it, however, it included sabotage,

:: increased or enhanced economic sanctions, propoganda activities,

and the training of Cuban exiles.

Now this program was approved by the President. Subsequently,

in about March -- I don't know the date of it -- there were

many meetings with the President about Cuba and this four-point

Mr. Schwarz. Now some related language is used in

¡Paragraph 6 on page 2, which says:

"There was. a general discussion as to what would be the

i effect on the Cuban scene if Fidel and Raul Castro and Che

- Guevera should disappear simultaneously. Admiral Burke said

E :that the only organized group in Cuba today were the Communists

"and there was therefore the danger that they might move into

*. control. Mr. Dulles falt that this might not be disadvantageous

because it would facilitate a multilateral action by oAs.

i" "Colonel king" -- and he's with the CIA -- "said there were

¿: few leaders capable of taking over so lar identifled."

Now the November 3 memo, which we marked as Exhibit 1,

which suggested no

such authority to assassinate the three

i men was ever granted, and indeed, that the CIA said it was

:: not a practical solution.

But do you not agree, Mr. Gray, that the language used in

here suggests that the subject of assassination was being

discussed?

MI. Gray. At the level of the Forty Committee or the

: National Security Council?

Mr. Schwarz. Yes. Thege words should disappear simul-

Mr. Gray. I think this ia possible. However, the people

who might have given it that interpretation in the Cantral

Intelligence Agency had no authority to carry out much a plan.

Mr. Schwarz. Your testimony is that it would be beyond

MI. Schwart. Actually, I'm going to start at the bottom

of page 4 and start with the comments made on Trujillo and

then go to comments made on Castro and call your attention to

; the different language that is used.

With respect to Trujillo the following is stated:

6 :

"Mr. Dillon said there was one favorable aspact to the

? jaltuation In the Caribbean. Il trujillo could be removed from

power in the Dominican Republic while pro-Castro elements were

prevented from seizing power in that country, out anti-Castro'

1i campaign throughout Latin America would receive a great boost.

1: The Vice President agreed that getting Ild of Trufillo would

1: be a favorable development for us."

Do you understand the words "getting rid of Irujillo"

1;

to mean assassinating Trujillo?

1:.'

MI. Gray. I did

not understand that to mean that. I

did not understand then and understand now it to mean assassina-

MI. Schwarz. All right. Would you look at the next

paragraph where

it demonstrates that if people wish to talk

¿ about assassination, they were quite willing to use the precise

:: word assassination, and what I would like to ask you after you

2i have read that, well, I may read it into the record:

"Turning to Cuba Mr. Dulles reported that a Sonor Betancourt

outcomes of the Cuban situation: (l) the assassination of

2

Castro, which would make him a martyr (2) Castro's sulcide,

which 1s a possibility in the event of failure and (3) a

continuation of the present trend, resulting ultimately in

'a socialist dictatorship and a Batista-type terror in Cuba."

I guess the only question I had coming out of that is

was the point that the assassination of Castro would make him

ja martyr one which you heard discussed on more than one occasion,

I for was that the only time you heard about it?.

I Mr. Gray. I think that this is the only time I hoard it,

::"Mr. Schwarz. Here, of course, MI. Dulles la quoting a Senor

'Betancourt, who is talking about the assassination of Castro.

Actually, I would now have to say that It's not unlikely that

:; it would have made him a martyr had he been

asgassinated.

MI. Schwarz. Now has your recollection been refreshed

showing you a

your service the special

Mr. Gray. Yes, I think they were referred to as small

arms. That was in late December of '60 or early January of '61.

the fact that he had previously arrested a large number of

Assume that to be a fact, as the record indicates. It la

fact. low, as a person with experience in the field of

national security matters, can you explain that fact in light

of your testimony?

Mr. Gray. I find it very difficult to explain, Mr.

6 Schwarz. May I just speak about procedures for a moment, which

> will help me answer your question, I think?

In the case of covert action, at least

at that pariod of ,

time, although it may have been approved by the Agency itself -

1:"'I am now speaking about the Central Intelligence Agency - the

.: normal procedure then would have boen for it to be staffed in

the State Department. I have already, I think, testifled that

I complained that I was not given a chance to staff out some

:;of these matters, but that is perhapa aside from the point

at which time both the State Department and the Agency. had

agreed it would have gone to the forty Committee and if the

' Forty Committee approved it,

it would be approved, considered

approved by the government, unless, as in some cases, the

President's representative to the Forty Committee had a

:. question about the action and he wished to have a Presidential

decision, and that happened on a few occasions.

i..

So now getting back to your specific question, how could

this thing have happened, one way it could have happened would

have been that it was well known in the Agency that there was

:; a program directed against Castro and that the people in the

Agency assumed that that meant anything goas against Castro.

This could have been a possibillty.

I rather guess that that is the probable answer to tho

: Iquestion. A possibility of course is that the responsible

i people in the Agency simply felt they had the power to act on

o their own, which I would have denled had it come to my attention.

" I am unablo to, really to explain it. But if 1t happened, it

1s my judgment that it shouldn't have happoned without the

appropriato procedures baing followed.

MI. Schwarz. And your testimony is that those procedures

1:

were not followod..

MI. Gray. I belleve this to be the case. If I ever

heard of this Mafia thing before it recontly appeared in the

:: press, I certainly have completely forgotten about it.

Mr.. Schwarz. It is the kind of thing you would renember

.iIf you had ever heard it.

MI. Gray. I would think so. I would think so, yes.

MI. Schwarz.

So just to pin down what you said, well,

.. you are obviously not sure.. Your opinion is that the most

: Likely explanation is that the Agency personnel assumed

erroneously and mistakenly that the program with respect to

:: Cuba included the assassination of Castro, even though the

:: program in fact did not include the assassination of Castro.

MI. Gray, I have to make that kind of assumption.

As a further observation about this we were referring to

Mr: Schwarz. The record indicates the contract with the

Mr. Gray. Now here is General Cabell on the 3rd of

a find it difficult because he's the Deputy Director of the

Mr. Gray. I was saying to Mr. Schwarz that I am reasonably

• 6 him, but I am not talking aboutr.the Bay of Pigs. I am reasonably

How can I refer to it-

It is my strong recollection he never attended any of

So that if he had an active role in what led to the Bay

In fact, General Eisenhower objected very strongly to

- the fact that there was any military planning whatsoever when

opinion this morning that this was a bad three-months period

: In Amorican history when, after President Konnedy was alected,

::he apparently felt he was not in a position to trust many of

the people around him. And my own judgment is had this thing

come a year later, either the Bay of pigs operation would not

have been started or it would have been a successful operation.

And I think it is unfortunate for him and it was unfortunate

for him and for the country that this thing sort of came to

a head so quickly in his Administration.

That is gratuitous, I know.

And as a regult of that direction Allon Dulles came back

• to the President in my presonce and in the presence of others,

¿ I have forgotten who now, with a four-point program which

responded to the Prosident's request to come up with something

more than just sabotaging sugar refineries.

I hava not seen that four-point program since I left

government.

It is in the library at Abilone and those four

:: points were sabotago, enhance the economic sanctions, propoganda,

:: which resulted, among other things, in the establishment.of

that Swann's Island radio, and the training of Cuban exiles.

Now, Senator Tower, I would have to know the date of that

I remember very well that Mr. Dulles read from

deviation whatsoever

to make

So that is sort of a convoluted answer to your question.

I don't know at this time whether the program was in preparation

"Admiral Burke suggested" -- now this was in response

"was "the suggestion that any plan for the removal of Cuban

I would assume that that refers to Raul and Che Guevera.

MI. Gray.

Yes.

Senator Tower. So it would appear to me from that that

it was

understood by Admiral Burke that the kind of plan being worked

"There

Mr. Gray. Well, in the flist reference, which is the

i National Security Council mecting, he actually said that there

was a plan being developed and lamiral Burke apparently said

¿ well any plan should be a package deal. Later on Admiral

• Burke again is expressing his opinion that the removal of

means might result in a Communist takeover.

" But let me romind

you, please, Senator, that these meetings

were either the same day or one day apart, and I have already

said that I don't know whether that four-point program was

in existence under preparation or had been adopted. I just

would have to see the date of it. But I don't think you'll

find it.

Excuse me, sir.

Senator Tower. Sure, go ahead.

MI. Gray. I don't think that Admiral Burke knew what

was in any four-point program at that time and I think he

was just expressing his own observation.

well, if you're

making plans these are the considerations that I have in mind.

Senator Tower. Well, a four-point plan, as i remember

you reconstructed it, included economic sanctions, propoganda

broadcasts, the training of Cuban exiles as guerrillas, I

suppose, and what was the fourth?

Mr. Gray. I think it was sabotage.

is that the only point you can say about Nasser?

2

Mr. Gray. Well, nobody seriously after the first discussion,

nobody was putting forth that as an altarnative.

I am not gure that answers your question.

5

MI. Schwarz. Well, It's better, I think, than saying it

didn't got into print.

7

Mr. Gray. All right, it was not pressed.

8

Mr. Schwarz. Did you hear of any other discussions of

9

lassassinations?

16:

MI. Gray. Yes, there's one other I mentioned to the staff

1:

jand I have forgotten. Can you refresh my recollection?

1:.

MI. Schwarz.

Yes. Was it a discussion when you were

14

with the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?

Mr. Gray. Oh, yes. A former member of that Board, whom

I would just as soon not identify because I don't think it's

important to this Committee, when the DCI would appear before

the Board and we would be brief on Vietnan, on various occasions

this member of the Board would say, have you given any

consideration to trying to bump off the leadership in Hanoi?

And I was never sure whether he was being facetious or not.

2

But in any event this was his question and the DCI would

2n dust shrug.

So we'd come back to another meeting a couple of months

2:

later and he'd say, have you yet given any consideration to

25

bumping off the leadership in Hanoi? And the DCI would just shrug.

And I think the fact of the matter was the DCI didn't

affirmatively to this question.

And I believe those are the two times that I really have

heard somebody seriously advocate at some point assassination,

and when I say, how serious it was, I'don't know b= nothing,

I'm

sure there was never any! planning to it.

Mr. Schwarz. Did you ever hear of the term Executive

Action?

Mr. Gray. Well, I had not heard of the term Executive

Action that I recall until one of the counsel of the Rockefeller

Commission asked me this. No, I am sorry. I can't be more

accurate.

Mr. Belin, in my pre-appearance conference, asked me

if I knew the phrase Executive Action. I told him, I said

I never heard of it and I asked him what it was, and he said,

"well, it was some sort of, not a program but a procedure or

MI. Kelly. Well, : I i told. them to give me the fizst

Senator

Schweiker. I was wondering whether General

Johnson kept the minutes of that meeting.

Mr. Schwarz. General Johnson was the one we had with

General. Taylor, and this: is Mr.. Johnson.

1:

The Chairman. It is very difficult to read that sentence,

the one that Senator Schweiker has pointed out:

"Mobutu

1:

appeared to be the effective power in the Congo for the moment,

but Lumumba was not yet disposed of and remained a grave

:.

danger as long as he was not disposed of."

16

It is hard to read that sentence without at least construing

17

it to mean that Lumumba was still alive and until he was no

1::

longer alive, he was a danger.

Senator Schweiker. What was the time seguence, if I

2

might ask the counsel, of the meeting that Bissell had about

disposing of Lumumba? When did that occur?

MI. Grayl. I have already testified

we were

after Lumumba,

and as I say I remembered the name Mobutu. I have also testified

that the situation was fluid and chaotic. And as it turned

out, I think, finally we didn't do anything.. The United Nations

was

put in charge of it.

2: 1

Mr. Schwarz. How do you construe the words "disposed of"?

2:1 Mr. Gray. I put it in the same category as "get rid of,"

¿: "eliminate." You see, it says eaflier that "a recent attempt

to assassinate Mobutu had failed." That's up at the top of

Mr. Douglas icierred to the exicasive program oi the militia, Mr. Gray

on the increasing eifcotiveness of Castro's measures to controi tie

population in ways witch tne Conmunists have developed so well. The

lauer said dia: be and others in the Stic Department had originally

this could be augmenied by the comparatively small-scale clioris oi

of which was that such action on our part would not be desirable, but

that should Castro be foolish chough actually lo atlack Guantanamo

Mr. Gray said that he had had

the subject of Cuba inscribed.on ihe NSC agenda for next Monday in

order io be able to arrive at a top-lovel decision on this very point.

- He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should be compicioly

undersiood by responsible oficials,

so tia: any overt Cuban act would

be met with a previously-agreed-on response.

Mr. Merchant stated thai, apart from any attack on Guantanamo,

he thought ibat some of the previous argumentation in today's mecting

was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways. By this he meant

that it is not logical to conclude that an indigenous uprising is impossible

and yet that it is feasible ior ie U.S, to go in overuly and "clean up

He pointed out that il Castro's support were such that an

uprising was out of the quesiion lion an opes invasion by the U.S. would

likc Algeria.

•Turning to the immodiaic problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell

outlined the general proposal to establish bases in lie U.S., with the

reasons for coming :0 this conclusion. He cited specifically the

possibility oi U.N. investigazion in Guatemala and the increased scope

of the program, ihich has beck brough: about by the incacased strengih

of the Castro regime.

Allancibors of the Group expressod serious

doubts as to whether

such activity could be lopi at all sccure.

that this is where in should end up, but assered tat he is not prepared

intervention. This led to an involved discussion, the gencral conclusion

of which was that such action on our part would not be decirable, but

that should Castro be foolish

enough actually to attack Guantanamo

Lis would almost certainly mean war.

Mr. Gray said that he had had

the subject of Cuba inseribed on the NSC agenda for next Monday in

order to be able to arrive al a top-lovel decision on this very point.

• He thought it essential that the policy of the U.S. should he coinplerely

unders:ood by responsible officials, so liai any overt Cuban act would

be met with a previously agreed-on resporse.

Mr. Merchant stated inau,

apart from any attack on Guantanamo,

he thought ibat some of the previous argumentation in today's mecting

was faulty, in that we could not have it both ways.

By this he meant

that it is not logical to conclude that an indigonous uprising is impossible

and yet that it is feasible for the U.S, to go in overtly and "elean up

the mess. " He pointed out that if Castro's support Were such that an.

uprising was out of the question then an open invasion by the U.S. would

Le met by a hostile population and we would be plunged into a situation

like Algeria.

Turning to the immodiaie problem before the Group, Gen. Cabell

outlined the general proposal to establish bases in the U.S., with the

reasons for coming io this conclusion.

He cited spccifically, ihe

possibility oi U.N. investigation in Guaremala ind the increasedi

of the program, which has bock brough: about by the incrcased strengil

of the Castio regime.

All members of the Group expressed serious

doubts as to whether such activity could be lopi at all

Merchant said at one point,

that although this does no: represent a

final conclusion on his part, he is inclined to think that the proposal

embodies the worst aspect of both worlds; that is, the choice should

rest between continuing our operations entirely on foreign soil or

preparing to malic the best possible case ior overt intervention.

Mr. Gray suggested that the decision could be put up io his

associates at the samo lime Tiber is discussed.

Mr. Merchant agrced

that this is where it should esc up, but asserted that he is not prepared

1o move in that direction until a survey has been made oi tie possibilities

of liceping opcrations in the U.S. unrevealed.

In this connection Gon. Caboll mentioned the possibility of using

a rofugec organication - cither an exising ond or a contrived onc - 10

Mr. Douglas said that in any case he would be prepared to have

:he Department of Defense investigate the availability of specific

locationg that would be suitable.

Finally, Mr. Merchan: asked whother any real planning has been

done for taking direct positive action against Fidel, Raul and Che Guevara.

Tie said that without those three the Cuban Government would be

Icaderless and probably brairless.

He conceded that it would be

necessary to act againsi all three simultar.cously.

Gen. Cabell pointed

out that action of this kind is uncertain of results and highly dangerous

in conception and execution, because the instruments must be Cubans.

Fe felt that, particularly because óf the necessity of simultancous .

action, it would have to be concluded that Mr. Merchant's suggestion

Mr. Gray then briefed the Council on the Plunning Board dis-

cussion of U.S. Policy toward Cuba.

(A copy of It. Gruy's Briefing

In the DominicarRepnblle.Although

theoe arrests had broken up

the plotting against trujillo, they

had nt the

sume time, beatened the dietntor'e position. Mr. Dulles

thought that further attempts could

be made to kill or oust

Trujillo.

Aclationg

between the government and the church were

pidly deterlorating.

Ah. Dulles pointed out incidentally that

the altitude of

the church in the Dominican Republic was quite

different fron

the ettitude of the church in Cubr. Mie economic

International finuncial

sources are drying up. The

goverment has

resorted to verious subterfuges in an attenpt to

improve its precarious financial

position.

Secretary Gates

asked

whether it was true that Trujillo wag one of the richest men in

the world, with more money than the Dominican governnent. Mr. Dilles

said this

slatement

was true; Trujillo was reforted to have milked

the Doninican Femblie of 5:00 million, an estimate which was

probanly exaggerated and should be scaled down by one-half or tro-

thirds.

Secratary inderson said lic

understood that til nillion

Doninican Republic and had been pleced in the Fant. ot Move Scotle.

stion of the terinican Republic, all the detaile of which he would

not roud. lonever, it appeared that the Datinican kupblic now

neld $15 million in gold and that it had incurred a vriety of

chligntions; for example, a $10.5 million loan from the Bank of

Hova Scotia secured by the sugar crop.

The Dominican Republic'

hed also drawn $7 million out of a $1l.5 million credit with the

International lionelary Fund.

Secretary Anderson said the Inter-

national lonetery Mind's dealings with the Doninican Republic

aight present a proolen

to the U.s.

The Doninicen Republic now

had drawn so much from the Flind that it could only draw in the

future f2. million every 90 isys without consulting the Directors

of the Fund.

If the Dominicans should want to draw more than

$2 million every 90 days, the question would arise as to how the

U.S. Director should vote when the Dominican Republic undertakes

the necessury consultation with the fund.

Mr. Dulles, continuing his riefing, reported that 'Prujillo,

Dulles said the difricult question vas that of leuderchip of

noierate elements in the Dominican Republic. The vice president

or the Republic might be able to assume power or the principal

milliury officers right covern through a nilitary juntu..

Hominent antl-trujialo Dominicuns were in exile. Mr. Dillon

said this government was following the situation in the Doninican

Republic closely and Intended to try to prevent seizure of power

by any pro-Castro troup.

This would irvolve working closely with

the dis.

The Vice President believed

that we could not let Castro

or a pro-castro group take over the Dominican Rejublic even if

we had to intervere in cider to prevent such a takeover. Mr.

Dillon felt thut in order to intervene we would need on invitation.

Te Vice Fresident feared thut the old

story was icing repeated

in the Dominican Repuülic; that 16, thie

pro-Castro clement wus

the caly minority group with atrong leaderchip and definite ob-

jectives.

Hir. Dulles said there vas a ercup in Venezuela

which

would like to move into the Dominican Repuulic und take over the

coverincat.

Mr. Dilion believed the Castro elcuent in the Dominican

Republic was not strong enough to assure control of the government

without support fron Cuba.

It was, accordingly, very important

that the U.S. be prepared for rapid action.

The Vice President

agreed that it was very important that the U.S., If necessary,

take rapid action to prevent any move by Castro to seize power

in the Dominican Republic.

Dulles said the situations in laiti and Venezuela were

being artected by the situations in Cuba and the Doninican Republic.

Bitancouri, it 15 reported, has made a deal with the erry whereby

The Senute had recently pasoed

It would take at leuct nine montha

and

possibly up to twenty months to put this projuct into oper-

ation.

A second project was the proposal to fly un aircraft over:

Cuba, probably on Channel 8.

This project could be put into

operation in noout cight wecks if the Mavy would provide USIA.

lowever,

thie project wus fraught with certain

Mr. Allen pointed

our citics from an

vircrari, we would te furious.

A similar reaction migit be ex-

¡stud from Castro.

Morcover,

if it becane known thut we were

broadcasting on a furticular

channel, Castro could

chift his

television stutions to this channel and jum our programs.

In

¿aci, Juiming is so caby that Castro might retaliate by jomning

other U.S.

stations.

So much for the technical difficultles of

this problem.

There were

other difficulties also.

Bcaming tele-

vision progrums

to Cuta fron an aircraft would give Castro a plat-

fom from which to denounce the U.S. for television augression.

He could pose as a martyr, saying he was a victim of

the power-

ful U.3., and ask other latin American countries to rally to hie

dcfense.

In

the light or all these difficulties, USin was

seerching for

elterrace means of

getting factual Iniormation to

the Cuvan people.

Cur short-wave broadcasts to Cute have been

cugenied. The difticulty with short-wuve

broadcasts

is that

there are only about 150,000

thought that further attenpts would be made to kill or oust

The

Secretry Gates asked

whether it was true that Trujillo was

one of the richest men in

the world, with more money than the Dominican goverment. Mr. Dilles

said this slatement was

true; Trujillo was resorted to have milked

the Dominican Gerablie of $100 million, an estimate which was

probanly exnegareted and should be

Secretary Anderson said lie understood that $4 nillion

Dominican Republic and had been

pleced

in the Bank of Nove Scotic.

iro iulles said he had

a detailed

report on the finuncial situ-

ation of the forinican

Republic, all the detailo of which he would

not roud.

However,

it appeared that the Doninican luablic now

neld fle million in gold and that it had incurred a varicty of

chligations;

for example, a $16.5 million Joan fron the Bank of

the suger crop.

The Domintcan Republic

hed also drawn 37 million out of a $1l.5 million credit with the

International Monetary Fund.

Secretary Anderson said the Inter-

national lionetery Fund's coalings with the Doninican Republic

might present a problen to the U.s.

The Doninicen Republic now

had drawn

so much from the fund that it could only draw in the

future $2 million every 90 isys without consulting the Directors

of the Fund.

If the Dominicans

should want to draw more than

$2 million every 90 days,

the question would arise ed to how the

U.S. Director should vote when the Dominican Republic undertakes

the necessury consultation with the fund.

Thie Senate had recently passed a resolution allo-

cating $100,000 to be used by USIA to buy time on Florida radio

However, a conderence com-

mitiod had refused

that broadcasting from an

vas a Stanich-language station in kiami.

thought the power of the lor-powered stations might u: increased.

He

Conventions contained the principle that nations wishing to broad-

The Group agreed that the action contemplated is very much

in order.

Mr. Gray commented, however, that his associates had

expressed extremely strong feelings on the necessily for very

straightforward action in this situation; and he wondered wacther

the plans as outlined were sufficient to accomplish this. Mr. Dulles

replied that he had taken the comments referred to seriously and'had

every intention of proceeding as vigorously as the situation permita

position of inerpreting instructions of this kind within the bounds of

In an altempt to clarify the situation with respect to the first

all aspects of the Cuban project. He said that he was at a loss to

and had devoloped at considerable length - the thesis that our vicw

was one of limited optimism, and that he had explained in detail just

why this is so; this explanation had included specific comments on the

point had been made forcibly to Macy that it would be out of the question V

1o: ClA lo nitempt to mount an invasion of Cuba by itself, without the

On the second point, Mr. Dulles said that we do know a good

cited as an exampie the position that had been taken as to the inclusion

of cortain ultra-conservative groups.. He said that the Frente had

as being to preserve the principles of the cvolution. He said that as

to specific stands on restoration of U.S. property rights, elc., this

was thought to be unwise because it would give the Frente the appearance

of being a tool of the Amcricans.

He added that he expects to lunch with Mr. Stans in the near future
