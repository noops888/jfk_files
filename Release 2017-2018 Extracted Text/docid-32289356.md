Hoodlums, was interviewed on several occasions. During

these interviews GLICKMAN has furnished information concerning

the forthcoming PATTERSON-LISTON heavyweight championship fight

and has further furnished some information concerning activities

of hoodlums in the Chicago area.

Further interviews with

Interviews of several other hoodlums were attempted

during the month; however, these interviews either met with

no response from

the hoodlums encountered or the agents were

advised that the hoodlums would contact their attorneys and

would thereafter recontact the FBI.

In these instances

attorneys representing these persons who stated that they did

not feel it would be in the best interests of their clients

• to be interviewed.

This program is being followed closely and continued

emphasis is being placed on interviews of persons with a

knowledge of hoodlum activities in the Chicago Division.
