MEMORANDUM FOR: Deputy Director for Operations

FROM:

John F. Pereira

Chief,

Historical Review Group

SUBJECT:

Release of JFK Assassination

Records--Perception Problem

DD/093-1419

1.

This is to advise you of a potential credibility

problem facing the Agency with regard to release of the

President Kennedy assassination records.

Paragraph 5

contains a request that you make a determination as soon as

possible to solve this problem.

2.

As we near the completion of the first review of

the hard copy documents related to the Kennedy assassi-

nation, it has become apparent that a potentially serious

credibility problem looms.

This concerns the negative

press, congressional, and public reaction that may well be

caused by the extensive deletions in the documents that CIA

will release to the National Archives and the public.

3.

The problem arises from the fact that we are still

trying to resolve differences with the Directorate of

Operations reviewers as to what information can be released

categories wherever they appear may well give the impression

that CIA is not forthcoming and is withholding a lot of

relevant information.

Examples of the categories are:

- cable, dispatch, intelligence report

and file numbers

- cryptonymns no longer in use

- methods that are well known, e.g.,

telephone taps, surveillance

(fact of)

- pseudonyms of former employees

We have been negotiating these points with the Do
