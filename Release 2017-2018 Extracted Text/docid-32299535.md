Re report of SA STUART E. SCHEER at New Orleans dated

5/5/61.

NO 1082 - C advised on July 24, 1961, that SAM SAIA,

a well known New Orleans handbook operator now

operating in

Jefferson Parish, habitually places runners or agents in vari-

ous barrooms throughout the city to collect bets.

Source

advised that SAIA has a runner at the Old Gem Bar, 127 Royal

Street, and Don's Bar, 141 Royal Street.

Source advised that

the management accepts a payment for permitting these agents to

use facilities of the barroom but has no control over the actual

booking arrangements.

Source advised that the usual payment for

using these facilities is approximately $75.00 a month, plus

the business which would develop by virtue of the individuals

Source advised that he did

not know the location through which the individuals taking the

bets place them with SAIA; however, he stated that no records

are kept by the individual faking the bet.

They are immediately

telephoned to a central location in an effort to prevent the

New Orleans Police Department from effecting an arrest with

sufficient evidence to charge the individual booking at these

locations.

Source advised that it is not necessarily the same

individual operating at the barroom on consecutive days. The

source also advised that the individual taking the bet would

normally appear to be a customer occupying one of the stools

in the vicinity of the telephone.
