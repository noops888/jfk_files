On 10/27/60, the files of the Philadelphia Credit

Bureau were checked by IC JOHN F. GUNDERMANN, JR., and a

derogatory credit report, dated 9/12/51, was

located for

FRANK A KEEGAN, 1410 Dorset Lane, Overbrook H1115 Pa.

The file reflected that KEEGAN,

a white male, married,

was 58 years of age in 1957 and was then employed by the

Pennsylvania Department of Hignways as an engineer at

Haverford, Pa.

He was formerly employed by the Amco Custom

Brokerage, 50 South Third Street, Philadelphia, Pa. KEEGAN

resided at Dorset Lane since 1955 and prior to this resided

at 504 South Narberth Avenue, Merion, Pa.

The credit file

reflected KEEGAN was actually retired although steadily

employed. A notation on the file indicated he was a senior

partner in the A. Murphy Company, Customs House Brokers, for

many years.

on 11/14/60, Mr. PETER SUFFRENDINI, source of

information of the Philadelphia Office, advised that FRANK

A. KEEGAN resided on Dorset Lane in overbrook Hills, Pa.,.

and was presently employed by the Pennsylvania Department

of Highways, which position he held through political

connections.

SUFFRENDINI added that he has known KEEGAN

in view of KEEGAN's position as water boy of the Philadelphia

Eagles football team. SUFFRENDINI advised that KEEGAN 1s a

quiet, mild-mannered individual whose only interest appeared

to be

professional football.

The following confidential informants and sources

familiar with Cuban activities in Philadelphia were contacted

on the following dates concerning KEEGAN and ESSIGY with

negative results:
