During my recent visit to Moscow,

I had a talk with a young

man in the Ukraine Hotel which I think should be reported.

The young man, about 28-30 years old, and I were having

coffee at the

same table about 11:30

He introduced

himself as Louis Jones,

a former psychology student at

Columbia University, University of Chicago, and the Univer-

sity of Michigan.

He told me that his current address

Was"

Mr. Jones seemed

to be accompanied on his trip to Moscow

by several

Spanish speaking individuals who, from time to

time, passed by our table and exchanged friendly greetings

with Jones.

Jones told me that he and his wife had gone to Cuba about

two years ago "on

a vacation" and that they had been so

"impressed by the revolution" that they had

decided to

stay in Cuba to help in this "great cause." In response

to my question "Are you a member of the Communist Party?"

he said that he was not but that he was fully sympathetic

to the aims and goals of the Communist movement.

student - in Cuba he seems to be riding high - has three
