Re marginally quoted

subject, your reference 92-162.

ENgLANd

From sources kaomn to this Department, it has been gleaned that

Joseph Francisco Mario LANDINO arrived at Heathrow Airport,

via New York on FFiday, 12th December, 1975 on an Air India Flight.

He then went to the Cotteridge Hotel, Woking, Surrey where he booked

in a single room until Sunday, 14th December, 1975. It is not know

who LANDINO met during this three day stay but it is known that he 1

then flew out from Heathrow Airport at 1900 hours on a Swiss Air

flight bound for Zurich.

He returned to the United Kingdom the

following day and apparently returned to the Cotteridge Hotel.

According to sources within the hotel, LANDINO was booked to return

to the United States on Wednesday, 17th December, 1975 and that at

about noon LANDINO checked out of

the hotel, apparently in something

of a hurry, stating to the hotel employees that he was leaving for

Heathrow Airport.

Nothing further can be traced at this stage as to

LANDINO's movements in this country.

Extensive enquiries have been

made in an effort to trace and identify the nature, of the business

that LANDINO has been sent over to settle.

It must be emphasised that the following information is

supposition only and cannot be proved in any way.

FLA

of Jewish background and a qualified solicitor. BINSTOCK has been

involved in several business enterprises in France where he lives,

at 49 Avenue Fochi, Paris: 16. It is understood by this Department

that he has also been to Miami on several occasions where he has many

associates, some possibly involved with the Miami Crime Syndicate.

Further, it is understood that BINSTOCK is a member of the Miami Turf

Club.

No loc

There are no criminal convictions recorded against BINSTOCK

but he is well known to this Department because of his suspected

association with members of organised crime syndicates, one of whom

is known to be the notorious DinaftalLINI, who is undoubtedly already

well known to your Organised Crime Department in Washington.

is no trace of BINSTOCK recently visiting the U.K. and efforts are

continuing to establish, if it is indeed BINSTOCK who is the man

involved, as to what buginess it was that caused LANDINO to be sent

to this country.
