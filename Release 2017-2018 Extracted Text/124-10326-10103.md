SUBJECT:

BUREAU INFORMANT 100

In 1954, a procedure was approved whereby we could attri-

bute certain information received

from James Angleton, CIA, under

the symbol "Bureau Informant 100."

This information,

for the most

paxt, emanated from a liaison ar

rangement which CIA maintained with

and from other sources under the

control of Angleton. Much of the information developed by Angleton

was not disseminated within CIA but he felt that the data should be

passed on to the Bureau.

Allen Dulles gave him authorization to

handle dissemination in

this matter.

We continue to receive

tion of value on a regular basis.

informa-

At le

By SAC Letter 54-27 dated

5/25/54, we informed the field

regarding Bureau Informant 100 and issued instructions that informa-

tion from this source be described under an appropriate T symbol and

characterization.

Because of the passage of time and since some

offices, have had rare occasion to receive Bureau Informant 100 infor

mation,

it is believed desirable to reiterate instructions to the

field. This should be done since the Informant has been developing

information in rerent months regarding the travel of U, S. citizens

Such travelers come from various parts of the

ACTION:
