On May 21, 1963, RAYMOND MARTORANO told PH T-T

that BRUNO had scolded him for talking too much and that

MARTORANO should never have told anyone that BRUNO is collecting

commissions on the service contract.

MARTORANO told PH T-7

that he had only told BRUNO's best friend, SKINNY JOHN

(FELIX JOHN DE TULLIO):

BRUNO's answer was that if he

wanted JOHN to know about it, he would tell him himself.

On April 12, 1963, PH I-9 learned that RAYMOND

MARTORANO was having trouble getting the money to make the

payments for Penn Jersey Vending because HARRY RICCOBENE

controls the money

and the number of visits which can be made

to him is limited.

According to RAYMOND MARTORANO,

HARRY has sent out vast sums of money In the last seven

years, a great deal of which he has lost

Despite the

problems of RAYMOND MARTORANO'S,

PETER MAGGIO insisted that

RAYMOND must have $8,000 on Tuesday, April 16, 1963.

PH T-8 said on April 16, 1963, that in order for

RAYMOND MARTORANO to get money, HARRY had to send word to some

unknown person who owed it to HARRY, and this unknown person

would then give It to RAYMOND.

Jersey Vending vehicles was handled through BRUNO's nephew

MICHAEL GRASSO, JR.

On May 6, 1963, PH I-? learned that BRUNO was unhappy

at the amount of talk to the effect that BRUNO and RAYMOND

MARTORANO are in business together.

BRUNO prefers that there

be no knowledge of the connection between the two of them.

deal and a $200,000 lease had been agreed upon.

The American

Stores have made no deposit but

BRUNO considered their signature

as good as a deposit. He

expected that the settlement would be

made between January 23 and 25, 1963s

following a zoning hearing

BRUNO considered this hearing merely

a formality because a street

shown on the city plans as running through the

property has been

closed and the hearing will merely

be to see if anybody objects

to the closing.

BRUNO was not concerned about the piece of land

on which the $20,000 deposit had been made because he did not

feel the man would want, to lose his deposit.

BRUNO remarked on

the amount of trouble this deal has given him.

On January 15, 1963, Confidential Informant PH T-4

advised that BRUNO was preparing to complete the sale of the

Ranchland property and was scheduled to attend a zoning hearing

on January 21, 1963.

On January 18, 1963, BRUNO took the books of what PH T-1

described as the Ranchland Builders to some unknown person.

According to both PH T-4 and Confidential Informant

PH T-8, BRUNO's efforts to sell the Ranchland property have been

continually bogged by the actions of his nephew, MICHAEL GRASSO,

who is a real estate agent and who has been handling the

details of the

sale under BRUNO's direction.

On January 15, 1963, according to PH T-5, BRUNO

GRASSO no to ask him for moner not to write shecke, and nottee tell

anyone that he has no money.

The same day BRUNO learned from one

ANGELO VENUTO that VENUTO had loaned $4,000 to MICHAEL GRASSO, Of

which only $1,000 had been repala, and VENITO desperately needed

the money to repay a loan he had obtained.

GRASSO is in debt up to his neck and, through BRUNO ' s

influence,

had obtained a loan for $32,000 and a friend of BRUNO's had

purchased GRASSO's home in order to keep him from losing 1t. BRUNO

said

that he and ANGELO RUSSO had purchased land from GRASSO to

get him out of a jam and that GRASSO does not own the ten acre

plot, nor does he have anything coming to him from 1t. BRUNO said

he,

himself,

will profit from the total sale of Ranchland but

does not want to show a profit and will probably give his profit

to MICHAEL GRASSO, out of which GRASSO must repay the $32,000

loaned by BRUNO's

friend, who was believed by the source to be

CHARLES COSTELLO, of Trenton, N.J. BRUNO further explained that

he had purchased

American Stores property for $27,000 and it was

being sold for $50,000. The ten acre plot will be sold for

$200,000 and the profit on both these

sales will be given to

GRASSO

SAM D'AMBROSIO alsO expressed displeasure to the

source

about the manner in which GRASS has handled this complicated

land deal.

On January 22, 1963, SAM D'AMBROSIO told PH T-1 that

In his opinion only Congressman WILLIAM GREEN could help BRUNO

and him straighten out the

zoning problem on their land and that

BRUNO had said he would make a contact, to see what he could do.

On January 29, 1963, BRUNO told PH T-2 that he wanted

to go away on a trip and that

there were four matters that had

to be settled

first, one of which was the completion of the Ranch-

land sale.

On January 30, 1963, BRUNO told PH T-6 that MICHAEL

GRASSO had drawn an agreement regarding Ranchland in

which he had

mistakenly shown SUE BRUNO as being single, and after consulting

Hail learned

the Law Department at City Hall learned that it would have to be

corrected.

GRASSO would have to turn the papers in before Fri-

day, February 1, 1963. There would be a meeting on February 4,

1963, and a decision would be made on February 5, 1963, regarding

the date for settlement.

This agreement concerned the American

Stores Company and would have to be signed by SUE and ANGELO

BRUNO and SAM D'AMBROSIO.

BRUNO also discussed with PH T-6 an agreement which

Involved the International Improvement Company

It was not clear

to T-o whether this referred to the Ranchland property, because

ment regarding the International Improvement Company named the

trustees in 1926 as E. L. BRUIN and J. P. STANTON. There was

mention of the right to construct canals and dikes together with

the right of spollage provided in the possession of a strip of

land 130 feet on either side of the center line of the canal or

dike. This right was apparently given to STANTON on March 31,

1926, and also gave CHARIES D. COY the right to construct canals

and dikes.

There was a mention of a $500 completion bond, which

GRASSO said was being issued by D'AMBROSIO and his wife and would

be exeeuted by a bonding company.

Miami Land Purchase

On February 4, 1963, according to Confidential Informant

concerning

land in Florida.

BRUNO arranged the papers to be mailed in a

business envelope of the Maggio Cheese Company.

On March 15, 1963, Confidential Informant PH T-9 was

with BRUNO and his brother-in-law, PETER MAGGIO,

while they were

discussing a matter which was not

entirely clear to the source

but involved the question of whether PETER should be president

and BRUNO pointed out to PETER that the two of them had made

that decision with CARI (LNU), belleved to be CARLO GAMBINO,

because PETER mentioned forwarding to GAMBINO a minute book

which the law required should remain within the State of Florida.

On April 10, 1963, Confidential Informant PH I-19

said that the account

of the G & M Realty Corporation 1s carried

Beach, Fla.,

and that

as of that date the only activity in the account had been the

issuance of a check dated January 31, 1963, payable to S. JAMES

This

check was deposited in the Merchantile National Bank and bore

the Impression of the G & M Realty Corporation.

On March 7, 1963, the contract between the Dominican

Republic and the operators of Coney Island, an amusement park

and gambling casino in Cludad Trujillo, expired.

It has previously

been reported that GOLOB, BERNARD ALLEN, and NORMAN FROMKIN have

operated Coney Island and that BRUNO has an interest in 1t.

According to GOLOB, however, ALIEN bought out GOLOB's Interest,

which may have included that of BRUNO and JOSEPH MANGONE. At

8:00 on the morning of March 7, 1963, eight Dominican Government

representatives appeared at Coney Island and announced they were

taking over the casino. An injunction was secured restraining

the Government for a perlod of ninety days on the basis that the

contract

allowed a ninety-day period to re-negotiate the contract.

The local papers on March 8, 1963, carried a front-page story

describing FROMKIN as a North American who was exploiting the

people.

In addition to problems with the Government, the casino

was having labor troubles caused by the demands of the dealers

for high increases in pay.

On February 25, 1963, Confidential Informant PH T-4*

learned that BRUNO and possibly GOLOB own land adjoining Coney

Island on which there is a drive-in theater. It was possible

that GOLOB was considering going there to operate 1t

casinos and bingo games be opened in the Dominican Republie.

sidering an offer to take over a beer franchise from Philadelphia

and the adjoining counties.
