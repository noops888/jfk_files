construct a hotel with gambling casino and public housing

project.

Also relative to the above, Miami airtel to Bureau

dated 9/14/62 set out the information obtained by the Miami

Office from MM 768-C, and Miami noted that only a few individuals

know such information, and due to the closeness of informant

to the situation, Miami recommends the matter be reported only

in the administrative section of the report at this time.

The Miami Office's attention is directed to referenced

Bureau communication requesting that investigative efforts

be expended to resolve this matter so that Bureau can be provided

with appropriate communication suitable for dissemination.

Miami notified the Bureau by airtel dated 9/14/62 as

follows:

MM 768-C advised on 8/31/62 that during the past year

he has been acquainted with LARRY DE JOSEPH,

He said DE JOSEPH

claims to have been an employee of SANTO TRAFFICANTE in the

Sans Souci Hotel in Havana prior to the Castro Revolution.

DE JOSEPH has on a number of occasions stated he is a good friend

of TRAFFICANTE and is in touch with him occasionally.

+.

The informant, who had been previously advised of the

Bureau's interest in TRAFFICANTE, advised that, in order to

effect a meeting with TRAFFICANTE, he proposed

to DE JOSEPH

that TRAFFICANTE provide the financial backing for a gambling

ship to be operated.off the Florida Keys.

The informant would

make all the necessary arrangements and would ask for a percentage

commission for his planning and arranging for a boat.

As a result of this proposal, DE JOSEPH arranged a

meeting between the informant and TRAFFICANTE.

They were met at Sonny's Restaurant by TRAFFICANTE, LOU BRADY,

and JUDITH SALVAT, who appeared to be the girl friend of

TRAFFICANTE.

At this meeting the proposed setting up of the gambling

ship to be operated off the Florida Keys was discussed

informant, TRAFFICANTE, and BRADY. TRAFFICANTE agreed to

RAFFICANTE, and BRAD

by the

consider arranging financing for the gambling ship and instructed

the informant to give him more specific details, particularly as

to arrangements that could be made for securing

a suitable ship.

They also discussed the possibility of constructing a hotel in

Martinique, and Escott entered into this discussion. TRAFFICANTE,

however, was not agreeable to this suggestion.

According to the informant BRADY did the majority of the

talking for TRAFFICANTE and gave the impression that he was trying

to impress TRAFFICANTE in the way he talked and discussed the

matter with the infornant.

The informant expects future meetings between himself and

TRAFFICANTE, or one of his representatives, regarding this matter.

On 9/4/62, the informant advised that he has negotiated

with LEWIS FRAZIER, owner of the motor vessel "Fleures" to buy *

this vessel and have it converted into a gambling ship. The

ship is 180' in length and would be capable of handling about

100 gambling passengers..

It now flies the Panamanian flag.

The

price of the ship would

be $35,000 and would cost $65,000 to

convert into a plush gambling ship.

Informant said this had been

discussed with DE JOSEPH and DE JOSEPH told him he would relay

this on to his "associates."

The Philadelphia Office has advised that extensive

physical coverage of the wedding of JEAN BRUNO on 8/26/62

and continual contact with PH 623-C* and PH 591-C* failed to

develop any information to establish that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, JR.

attended either the wedding or the subsequent reception and

dinner. A complete list of persons in attendance at the dinner.

however, subject has not been observed at the above property

from regular checks.

their coverage determined that subject did not visit the club on +

either evening, and there had been no indication of his presence

in Orlando during recent months.

SA ELLISON further determined through Deputy ROBERT

TANNER; Orange County Sheriff's Office, that the original

source of information was still in custody and had not been out

of jail since his arrest on August 6, 1962, and could furnish no

further information about any proposed visit of the subject to

Orlando.

Information has been previously reported from a source

which indicated that a JERRY GREITZER had been in Tampa, Florida:

in the past years and had been in contact with JAMES C. LONGO,

WILLIE PEP, and SANTO TRAFFICANE. Further, that GREITZER had

made a trip to Key West, Florida, for LONGO and obtained a

night club where he obtained the package was a large night club,

largely attended by sailors, and recalled that the marquee on the

fact that the owner of this night club is a "wise guy" (hoodlum).
