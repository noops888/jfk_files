A. The Campus. Radicils - The Decline of SOS As A Significant Force

The second faction to emerge, Maoist and rigidly Marxist -

the Progressive Lahorizes - contemptuous of campus guerrillas as

"elitist" but committoù to a sometime in the future revolution, held

that the time was not row, and that revolution could only be brought

about with support from blue collar workers.

Movement, the third force, quickly disintegrated:

read the other out of SDS. Disunity, the fatal disease of extremist

movements, is for SDS now in its terminal stage.

December 27, 1970 some 500 delegate members of the

PLP faction arrived in Chicago for what may'be SDS's last convention,

The four-day get-together, marked by more

Onetime SDSers and those who might have become involved with the

prototype SDS, now opt for mendership. in 10-15 member collectives or

potential as a catalyst for student violence.

B. A Change In The Weather?

or picking up the gun as revolutionary, with the glorification of

the heavier the better, we've called the military error."

Dohrn ob-

served that outlaws living underground do not have a sense of what

is going on and cannot develop strategies to build the movement

numerically. Obviously after earnest organizational soul searching,

she outlined proposed future activities to: "Change and share the

culiural revolution."

"Planning for and organizing rallies and

demonstrations, mass actions against, among other things, the war;

and in suppor. of prison revolts" she wrote, "constitute the new

agenda."

Removed from scenes of action are schools, and the army

"they cannot do that which is necessary to radicalize people."

While the proposed change in Weatherman action may be more

tactical than philosophical, it is a fact that many students, pro-

fessing dedication to the necessity of revolution now, have been

shocked by the results of some bombings.

Violence has not brought

about the predicted repression which in turn, it was said, would

bring Weathermen mass sympathy and support.

In all probability there

will be a change in the revolutionary weather, for how long we do not

know.

C. Campus Demonstrations - Winter Hibernation?

Spring, the traditional season for campus disturbances,

is somc

months off.

Accordingly despite a marked lull in protests

since

September it may be premature to dogmatically state that a major

polarizing student offensive against U.S. Indo China policy or some

form of "Establishment" authority is not in the cards. Student domin

ated groups - at odds with each other - the National Peace,

Coalition' and the National Coalition Against Mar, Racism, dnd 20°

pression, are planning massive anti-war rallies on April

24th and

May Sth in Washington and otner large cities.

Both endorse a G.I.

protest against the war scheduled for Armed Forces Day (May 16th).

than*

The National Student Association, now considerably more leftist

•previously, is. formulating plans for yet another anti-war rall:

to publicize the

signing of a "peace treaty" by U.S., Saigon, NLF

and DRV students.

Yet there are discernibie signs that a national student protest

of such magnitude and intensity capable of polarizing the nation to

the extent

that did the May 1970 dimonstrations is only a slight

possibility, barring an event with the emotional charge of a major

military adventure in Indo China.

The Kert State killings had a

sobering effect on siudents, particuiarly the realization that it

could happen on their campus.

The senscless killing at Wisconsin

and other random bombias hive uncriably diminished the romance of

violence as a condition precedent to a revolution which, incidentally

now no longer seems inevitable or necessary.

THE PANTHER LICKS HIS WOUNDS

As criminal trials in New York City and New Haven, Connecticut ar

proceeding against leading Panther functionaries and some rank and fil

police are conducting what in military parlance is called "mopping up

operations" against local headquarters

in various parts of the country

(Since the beginning of Panther-police confrontations, some 500 Panthe

rank and file have been aprested. Leader Huey Newton, at liberty on

bail, co-founder Bobby'Seale, incarcerated, and party theoretician

from justice presiding over the Party's

international headquarters in Algiers, all have become uncharacteristi

cally mute.

And whatever excitement their pronouncements once were

able to generate for the benefit of the Panthers has abated. The blaci

community has failed to rally around.

Financial

support from white liberals and the

"radical chic," un-

der devastating attack from many quarters, has all but ceased.

of the diversion of money collected for the once appealing free break-

fast program for ghetto youth to other purposes has also hurt.

A withering attack by Eldridge Cleaver on the Communist Party USA

for "active collusion" with "U.S. fascists" in using the Angela Davis

case. as a "smokescreen to conceal the trial of Bobby Seale" will fur-

ther disrupt what was at best a marriage of political convenience.

Potentially more painful, however, than any other recent develop-

ment is the precipitous loss of Panther prestige attributable to the

recent debacle heralded as a National Convention to Rewrite the Con-

stitution of the United States.

spread publicity was given the November 1970 offer by the Black

Panthers to the Vietcong's Liberation Armed Forces to send fighting

troops to

aid in. the struggle against U.S. imperialism.

Clearly, the Panthers had preempted the American field as a

swashbuckling, gun toting, "committed to the revolution" force,

idolized hy the majority of America's white radicals and extremists.

less than 99 and 99/100% pure, it was of no import.

severe set back for the Panthers, affecting the nature and extent of

making future commitments.

coffers.

THE TEMPLES OF ISLAM - A DURABLE INSTITUTION

With all the fanfare over the Black Power movement, the curiosity

created by Black Nationalisn, the publicity bestowed on

ephemeral al-

beit electrifying figures such ás

Stokely Carmichael and Rap Brown

and the excitement gererated by the Black Panthers, the Black Muslims

have been all but ignored.

Long a potent force in the black conmunity, the Temples of Islan,

better known as the Black Muslims, are one of the most stable, cohesive

black movements in the ünited States and its leader Elijah Muhammad one

of the most powerful black men in America.

Background

The Chicago based Nations of Islam, churacterized by J. Edgar,

Hoover as the

"largest black extremist group in this country,"

teaches and preaches violent hatred of whites under the tutelage

and dictatorial controi of the wizened, sickly 74 year old Elijah

Muhammad, accepted completely by his followers as the authentic

contemporary voice of the Prophet Nohammad.

Assiduously tithing

fron his followers (no reliable information is available as to Black

Muslim membership, wich estimates varying from 10,000 to 100,000). he

has forged a powerful enterprise consisting of farm lands, equipment,

manufacturing establishments, retail shops and real estate believed

have a net worth in excess of $50 million.

Within the past few

years there has been a gradual but perceptible enlargement of Black

Muslim concerns. Initially an ingrown, self-centered movement it is

now if not overly active on the world

scene "it is at least passingly

concerned with geopolitics.

A pro-Hanoi posture is now manifest in

Muhammad Speaks, the official Muslim newspaper. Of late there has

some cautious preliminary contact with white radical groups,

Muslim delegates having participated in an Arab Teach-in at the

University of Pennsylvania in May 1969 under the sponsorship of tho

Young Socialist Alliance and the Committee to

Support Middle East

Liberation.

Representatives of the Muslims joined with white radi-

cals in attending the Labor Day 1970 weekend Revolutionary Peoples

Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia under Black Panther

auspices (relationships with the Black Panthers are ill-defined;

while they speak no evil of the Panthers, neither do they praise

them.) Further evidence of a gradual breakout from their traditional

isolationism and self-containment was the appearance by a Black Mus-

lim minister from Harlem at the Congress of African People meeting in

Atlanta, Georgia on September oth, the Latest in

meetings on black power first heid in 1966. Newspapers cos note

that the participating Muslim leader Louis Farrakhan drew an enthusi-

astic response "far greater than that accorded other black figures

B. Minutemen Minutiae

With the surfacing in Washington, D.C. last December of 46 year

old George Van Ness, self-described East Coast leader of the Minute-

men, It became apparent that a split in the once monolithic Minute

man

organization was in the making.

Never more than 5000 strong

nationally (present total membership ig believed to number 200) the

organization was run by founder Robert DePugh with an iron hand, and

card carrying members throughout the country were loyal to him.

For

the past few years Delugh has had troubles with Federal authorities,

und for 17 months was a fugitive from justice.

Taken into custody

by Federal agents in July 1969, DePugh was ultimately tried, convicted

and on October 9, 1970 sentenced to nine concurrent Federal prison

terms of 10 years

each on nine counts of violating Federal firearms

regulations.

Van

Ness, in a Hyattsville, Maryland news conference, declared

that the Minutemen would henceforth

he would be the liaison between. the

remain underground, and the general public.

Van. Ness declared that

the organization still was preparing to thwart a Communist takeover;

that paramilitary maneuvers

"in the mountains" were still an integral

part of their training regimen; and secreted away for future use was

ammunition, two mobile field hospitals, four

communications vehicles,

and machinery for an "intelligence network."

The new Minutemen credo

will avow their belief in white supremacy, with blacks and Jews

put.

on notice that they would have to earn the right to equality.

Van Ness! Minutemen organization is in opposition to the apparatus

left behind by DePugh to carry on until his ultimate release from

prison.

De Pugh, while a fugitive, was groping for a "philosophy" for the

had "somehow escaped the

of progressive education, and the sophistry of modern Christianity."

His quest ended with the discovery of "Imperium," the Francis Parker

Yockey anti-Senitic tome embraced by most' of today's more erudite neo

Nazis.

The contending factions of the remains of the DePugh organizatio

seem destined to go their own route: Both seem to endorse hostility

toward Jews.

CAMPUS JUGEND

Tooling up for a counter attack against an'anticipated spring,

leftist inspired campus offensive, the now patently anti-Semitic

National Student Alliance has moved into larger national headquarters

at 1656

Wisconsin Avenue in Washington's historic Georgetown section.

Founded in the spring of 1969 by then 37 year old Louis Byers,

among other things a former John Birch Society organizer; catalyst

of the 1968.

"Youth for Wallace" movement; and a featured speaker at

the gutter-bigot National States Rights Party annual convention this

past summer, the NYA is closely allied with Liberty Lobby, one of the

largest and

most effective ultra-rightist pressure groups. Liberty

Lobby officials admit assistance to NYA in its formative stages.

NYA's five man Adult Advisory Board, Revilo P. OViver, professor of

classical languages at the University of Illinois; Richard B.

Cotten,

(Ret.) John G. Crommelin, perennial candidate for public office ir

four man

student "Advisory Council,

," whose precise role is as yet un-

announced, but presumably, together with the Advisory Board, deter-

mines NYA policy.

Byers' plan for a campus based organization was originally con-

ceived as

a vehicle to mobilize caires of rightist students on campus

to "crush" radical leftists..

YA evolved into a movement with a four

point program: (1) To oppose the use of dangerous drugs and narcotics

and to run those who push them off the campus; (2). To neutralize and

overcome Black Power; (j) To restore law and order to the campuses

and to America by stamping out anarchist groups and movements and

(4)

To bring peace to America by resisting any attempt to involve us in &

foreign war.

(Emphasis has been on the Middle East rather than

Indo China).

Organizational meetings have taken place on college campuses in

asseratedly perhapsria, Ilinois and California. Byers claims, ex-

nationwide membership of more than 8,000 from

62 campus chapters.

NYA publishes a monthly tabloid type newspaper

Attack ("to serve as an agitational and iccruiting tool among young

Americans, mainly university students") with a claimed circulation

of 25,000

and a monthly newsletter Action with a claimed circulation

of 4,000.

In addition to membership recruitment, current emphasis is on the

welding together of "hard hitting action units" which will participate

in rallies and demonstrations and if need be physical confrontation

with campus left-wing radicals, and undertake the mass distribution of

racist,

anti-Semitic propaganda. A "Western Destiny" bookstore just

in Washington, D.C. stocks for mailorder, and over the counter

sales, books, tracts, and pamphlets. Inventory consists of anti-

Lionist, pro-Nazi and racist material, a portion of which was taken

over from the now closed bookstore maintained by the late Lincoln

Rockwell's National Socialist White Peoples

Party

Recent issues of Action have become stridently anti-Semitic. The.

Fall 1970 lead article was headlined "Mideast War Next Vietnam for

of the Washington Post (January 6, 1971) stated that: "The NYA oppose's

Zionism in America because Zionists, in their self-centered pursuit of

their own, extra-American goals, have not only shown a callous disre-

gard of American interests in favor of Zionist interests, but they have

habitually been willing to adopt anti-American policies whenever this

suited their aims."

Of late NYA has been beset by internal difficulties, with some

defectors seeking to create a competing organization.

Byers, now as-

sisted by former American

Nazi Party Iieutenant Robert A. Lloyd, remains

as the dominant influence.

The significance of an NYA lies in the fact that-for the first time

in recent history, a campus based, neo-Nazi movement is in existence.

It remains to be seen if this ultra-rightist group organized to combat

left-wing excesses can survive in its new form as a neo-Nazi, anti-

Semitic force on the college campus.
