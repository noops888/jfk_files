KIDNAPING

On the afternoon of 4/6/60, Assistant AG Wilkey of the

Criminal Division called re this case.

He said that on 2/11 or 12/60,

Judge Choate in Miami conferred with USA Madsen and an FBI agent,

and subsequently reduced the bond of the two subjects in this case

from $30,000 to $5,000. Mr. Wilkey noted that, by memorandum of

1/27/60 we advised the Department that there was a possibility that

if the two subjects were not kept in jail, they would depart for

Cuba.

Wilkey noted that the two subjects are now in Cuba, inasmuch

as they met the lower bail.

Mr. Wilkey wanted to know whether, at the time the bail

was reduced, the FBI, had rendered an opinion that it would be

desirable to reduce'

the bail in order that the subjects could get

out of jail, bearingfin mind that one of the subjects is an FBI

informant, and from an intelligence standpoint he could produce after

he left jail.

I told Mr. Wilkey that we would not ordinarily express

opinions in matters of bail or prosecution, but that I would like to

check and find out just what happened here.

I checked with SAC Teague in Miami. He said that, in

accordance with Bureau instructions, SA George Davis advised USA

Madsen on 1/29/60 (2 days after the

subjects were apprehended) that

one of the subjects had been an FBI informant, and the USA was being

so informed, as the matter could well come out during the trial.

The

USA said he

would like to think this matter over,

and might request

an agent to accompany him later

to see the Judge, as

Judge should

know of the informant status of

Mr. Parsons

FBI informant, and that Agent Davis could furnish the details.

Davis told the Judge that the informant, MM 635-S, had been coopera-

ting with the Bureau for a considerable period of time prior to his

arrest,

and had been an effective paid informant.

The Judge asked

if the

informant could be used again in view of his arrest.

Davis

told him that we would try to continue to use him if the opportunity

presented itself.

(21)

According to Teague, neither Agent Davis, nor the USA,

nade any recommendation to the Judge regarding possible leniency,

or reduction in the bond, either directly or by inference. The

Judge said that he had recently had a case brought before him

regarding Rolando Masferrer and his brother, wherein Immigration and

Naturalization Service wanted to exclude these individuals.

The

Judge said he wanted to fair and objective; that if he decided the

Masferrers should be excluded, this could be constructed as favorable

to the Castro government.

On

the other hand, if he took action against

the two Cuban defendants in this

with granting an exclusion order

order against the

case, this would be inconsistent

against the Masferrers.

The Judge

said he wanted to consider the case involving the exclusion order

first, and would wait to act on the kidnaping case.

The Judge said

he would consider reducing bail for the two defendants, if the defense

attorney so requested. USA Madsen said he would work this out with

the Defense Attorney.

I called Mr. Wilkey back and advised him of the above.

I pointed out that, as I had previously indicated, it was not in the

province of the Bureau to make recommendations as

to bonds, or

whether a man should stay in jail, and that no such opinion was

expressed by the Bureau in this casè.

I asked Wilkey what he had in mind. He said that he knew

I this was the Bureau policy and he was trying to satisfy himself as

opinion on this from an intelligence standpoint.

I told him we did not; that while we would receive any

information that this informant sent to us, we would make no request

that the trial be held up, or that the Department hold up on any

attempts to get the defendants out of Cuba.

Mr. Parsons

I told Mr. Wilkey that, as far as we were concerned, he

could disregard any intelligence aspects in connection with prosecu-

tion of this case. I told him, however, that he would probably want

the case carefully reviewed, from the standpoint of its strength,

bearing in mind that one of

the principal witnesses was Catherine.

Taafe, whose reliability was questionable, and one of the defendants

had been an informant of the Bureau. #ful

It would appear that Wilkey is

examining this case from the

| standpoint of action at this time.

He understands clearly that the

Bureau has made no requests and will make no requests to delay action

in the case, either from an intelligence standpoint or from the stand-

point that one of the defendants was a Bureau informant. KU)
