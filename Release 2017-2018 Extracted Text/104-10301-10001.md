CIA maintained a station in Havana throughout

1960 but faced increasing operational difficulties--

some of CIA's own making. Probably the outstanding

flap was the capture of three TSD technicians, caught

in the act of planting a microphone in the New China

News Agency office. An analysis of this operation,

made when the technicians were released 18 months later,

showed that they had ignored many of the basic rules

tradecraft. On the other hand, the Cubans had given

them only perfunctory interrogations.

In 1960 the Havana Station consisted of

chief of station; Arthur Avignon, deputy;

about six

case officers and as many secretaries. Life

was unpleasant; Castro agents shadowed American Em-

bassy personnel, monitored their telephone conversa-

tions, and tried to pump their children about what

daddy was doing. As relations between the United

States and Cuba deteriorated the station concentrated

on support for the Cuban invasion then being planned,

and on developing stay-behind assets. Frank Belsito

and later Ralph Seehafer were designated as "stay-

behind officers" and regularly reported on a dozen

ox so agents and nets, a few of which survived the

station's closing.*

The break in diplomatic relations with Cuba

was predictable, and during the fall of 1960 Embassy

dependents were moving themselves and their house-

hold effects back to the United States. Avignon

made a special trip on the Havana-Key West ferry

to take out his personal car, silverware, and a

$1,500 violin. Station files not absolutely essen-

tial were crated and shipped back to Headquarters.

Case officers were working 15-hour days, seven-day

weeks.

When the break came, the Embassy had three

days' notice that it would close on 4 January 1961.

The CIA station had just installed a

and managed to burn what files it could not ship to

Key West on the attache

aircraft. When they were

not burning papers or smashing technical equipment,

case officers were caching radios or making advance

payments to agents left behind.

On 4 January station personnel met at the

Embassy, rode in convoy to the ferry, and

sailed to

the States. A few, like William J. Murray, had main-

tained houses until the end and lost everything in

them. *

* Two years later Congress authorized the Department

of State to reimburse its employees the depreciated

value of furnishings left in Cuba. Payments fell

far short of replacement

costs.

were for all practical purposes conducted indepen-

dently of WH Division and therefore are not covered

in this history. There was an

informal but under-

stood shortcut in the chain of command; basic deci-

sions were made at the DDP, DCI, or Presidential

level. Although some of the key personnel were de-

tailed from WH Division, the Cuban Headquarters unit

was in another building and no one pretended that

J. C. King was running the show.

Jacob D. Esterline, a veteran WH Division

officer who later became deputy chief of the divi-

sion, was chief of the Cuban unit during the buildup

and invasion attempt, and took his orders from the

DDP. When the Cuban unit was made officially autono-

mous as TFW and later as the Special Affairs Staff

(SAS), it was headed first by William K. Harvey and

then by Desmond FitzGerald, Bruce B. Cheever and

John L. Hart, none of whom had previous service in

WH Division. It was not until 1965 that the Cuban

unit really lost its autonomy and again came firmly

under WH Division.

Actual expenditures in FY 1961 illustrate

Latin America. Except for Cuba 1961 was a repre-

sentative year, and these were the obligations for

reoular stations throughout the hemisphere:

Until the nearly 1,200 prisoners taken at the

Bay of Pigs could be ransomed with shipments of phar-

maceuticals, CIA regularly supported their dependents

in the United States. In the opinion of the General

Counsel, if a dependent had sued, courts would probably

have found that Cuban Brigade members were entitled to

the benefits of the Federal Employees' Compensation

Act. Thus by mid-1962 CIA was disbursing $311,500

per month to the dependents, plus bonuses and medical

care for invaders who managed to return. These ex-

penses, however, were paid from special funds outside

For across-the-board coverage of Cuba in

the early 1960's the Mexico City Station was tops.

Reporting on the Cuban Embassy, the COS said in Feb-

ruary 1963:

We intercept their mall, photograp

Embassy, cover their telephones completely,

and within a few hours of the conversa-

usefulness was the

discovery of a man who

was doublecrossing us, who we thought was

a good penetration of the Embassy.

CIA had seven different microphones in the

Cuban Embassy, one hidden in a leg of the coffee

table in the Ambassador's office. Like most audio

operations, this one produced a lot of chaff, but

it also yielded bits of operational information

showing connections between the Embassy and local

Communists and students. At the airport the station

was getting photographs of all travellers to Cuba,

writing. Meanwhile it was

servicing 17 accommoda-

tion addresses for Headquarters and Miami.

In spite of all this, there was little exploi-

table evidence that Cuba was using Mexico as

a base

for subversion in the rest of Latin America.

Mexico

was the only Latin American nation to maintain diplo-

matic relations with Cuba in the face of an OAS reso-

lution intended to isolate the island. Anxious to

retain this bridge to the Western Hemisphere, Castro

had ordered his Embassy to do nothing which might be

Dean Rusk, Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara,

General Maxwell Taylor of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

Presidential Advisor McGeorge Bundy, DCI John A.

McCone, DDP Richard Helms and FitzGerald. There was

no question about charging CIA with the following

types of activity:

1. Collection of intelligence.

2. Covert propaganda to encourage

low-risk forms of active and passive

resistance.

3. Cooperation with other agencies

in economic denial.

4. Attempts to identify and estab

lish contact with potential dissident

elements inside Cuba.

5. Indirect economic sabotage.

There

was sharp disagreement, however, over

whether CIA should continue infiltrating sabotage

agents into Cuba. McNamara, Taylor and McCone favored

more sabotage raids, but Rusk and Bundy feared that

CIA raids might undermine the US "clean hands" pos-

ture in the OAS or give the Soviets an excuse for

delaying turnover of their surface-to-air missile

(SAM) sites to the Cubans.

Finally Rusk recommended that CIA's raiding

assets be kept in being but not actually used--at

least until the OAS and SAM sites problems could be

clarified. The President accepted this recommenda-

tion. Although CIA did try to keep its sabotage

agents ready, the White House decision spelled the

end of the Agency's sabotage (though not support and

306/

intelligence-collecting) infiltrations of Cuba.

Agency-sponsored radio propaganda aimed at

Cuba reached its peak in early 1965 with an actual

expenditure of about $1,500,000 and expansion still

planned. The semi-notional Cuban Freedom Committee

served as cover for Radio Free Cuba, which broad-

cast a total of 77 hours weekly from transmitters

in Miami, Key West, and New. Orleans.

Started in 1961, the Cuban Freedom Committee

retained a public relations firm and spent $7,000

annually to establish its cover by soliciting bona

fide public contributions. In its first year these

totalled $5,000, but by 1965 public support had dwin-

died to $200. One of the difficulties was that any

widespread US appeal for funds for Radio Free Cuba

would perforce have to attack Castro, and might there-

fore be considered domestic propaganda exceeding CIA's

charter.

Outside the committee, CIA operated a trans-

mitter calling itself Radio Americas and broad-

casting from Swan Island, and bought time for anti-

Cuban broadcasts from three commercial stations.

Programming on these four stations totalled 119

hours weekly in addition to the 77 on Radio Free

307/

Cuba.

Swan Island, roughly a mile and a half long

and three-quarters of a mile wide, lies in the Carib-

bean 125 miles north of the Honduran coast. Both the

United States and Honduras claimed sovereignty over the

island in the 1960's. The US Weather Bureau had manned

a weather station there since 1949, and CIA first set

up a covert transmitter in 1954 to support its propa-

ganda against the Arbenz regime in Guatemala.*

Apart from the question of its real impact in

Cuba and the psychological problems of a staff living

to sovereignty but retained the right to operate a

weather station.

in almost total isolation, the Swan Island transmitter

raised a nightmare of cover complications. Operating

as Radio Americas, it was supposedly under cover of

the Vanguard Service Corporation, an Agency proprie-

tary which offered no services, and the Gibraltar

Steamship Corporation, another proprietary which

operated no steamships. A Boston millionaire who

claimed to own the island collected rent from the

Vanguard Corporation, which could not afford to argue,

but not from the Weather Bureau, which disputed his

claim. Vanguard contracted with Coastal Air of

Miami for one light-aircraft supply flight a week

and with the Logistics Service Corporation of Phila-

delphia, a Philco subsidiary, to maintain the island

facilities and transmitting equipment. All of this

enabled CIA to play tapes and broadcast the commen-

taries of the three Cuban announcers stationed on

the island, but it did not prevent Radio Habana

from pinpointing the transmitter and calling it a

308/

CIA propaganda mechanism.

facilities provided the Kennedy administration with

positive information on the buildup of Soviet mis-

sile capability on the island. This episode is docu-

mented elsewhere and is outside the scope of this

present paper.

One of FitzGerald's major successes against

Cuba was in the field of economic warfare--called

the MHVIPER program in CIA. After a hurricane

ripped through the island in 1964, Castro's econo-

mists and publicists began a campaign to persuade

free-world sugar brokers that the Cuban sugar crop

had been badly damaged and exports would be low.

The object, of course, was to drive up sugar prices

on the world market, on which Castro depended for

hard currency.

to finance imports.

At first the campaign worked and sugar prices

did skyrocket.

But FitzGerald was not convinced,

and sent

to London to study economic

reports from the British Embassy in Havana. Partly

on the basis of her research, the US. Government's

sugar-crop forecasters concluded that despite the

hurricane Cuba would harvest more sugar than ever.

FitzGerald arranged to have a Department of

285 -

## Page 19

State official leak this general conclusion to the

New York Times. Sugar prices dipped, but rallied

when Castro indignantly denied the Times story.

The Department then officially announced the US Govern-

ment estimate that there would be no shortage of

Cuban sugar. As it turned out, the US estimate was

right.

After the official announcement world sugar

prices dropped several cents per pound, and this

time they stayed down. At a time when fluctuations

of one cent a pound meant millions of dollars to

the Cuban economy, publication of the essentially

correct estimate upset Castro's attempts to manipu-

311/

late the market.

Late in the summer of 1964 the DDI told Fitz-

Gerald that the Department of State was inquiring

informally about the possibility of setting up a

CIA channel for plausibly deniable clandestine con-

tacts with Cuba. FitzGerald replied:

It seems to me that the establishment

of a continuous two-way conversation with

Fidel Castro at a time when we have noth-

ing to convey to him would be a serious

mistake....

It may be that Secretary Rusk

feels that the present establishment of

conversations with Fidel Castro should

be considered in order to make sure that

we will have the ability to speak to him

when or if the time

comes. On this score

I do not feel there is any reason for worry.

There are a number of ways in which we can

communicate to Fidel Castro virtually at a

moment's notice. 312/

In the wake of the ill-fated Bay of Pigs in-

vasion of 1961 and the active years of 1962-1964,

anti-Castro operations began to diminish in 1965.

Operations continued but at a slower pace. John L.

Hart had the title of Deputy Chief, WH Division, for

Cuba (DCWHD/C), and operated a large base in Miami

with virtual autonomy. A chain of safehouses,

training sites and boat-moorages stretched through

the Florida keys to Key West.

From these CIA

launched maritime operations which regularly placed

and retrieved agents from the Cuban coast, but whose

intelligence product often did not justify the

315/

effort.

Meanwhile CIA ran a dwindling number of

on-island intelligence agents, including some

handled in cooperation with the US Navy base at

Guantanamo, where hundreds of Cubans still worked -

by day and returned to Castroland at night. As

the Cuban General Directorate of Intelligence (DGI)

improved and expanded under Soviet tutelage, CIA

agent networks were rolled up and even singleton

agents dropped out of contact. Typical was Radio

Habana's 12 May 1965 announcement that "31 counter-

revolutionaries, members of a CIA espionage network"

had been arrested. Of the 14 actually named in the

broadcast, WH Division identified six who had worked

with Juan Bautista Perez Luis (AMTAUP-10), chief

gardener at the naval base and principal agent for

CIA. Although he had been debriefed in Miami in Jan-.

uary, Perez' location and

status were not known in

The Mexico City Station devoted a major part

Of its time to running or supporting operations

against Cuba; 47 percent of its cable traffic con-

cerned Cuban operations. Mexico was the only Latin

American country maintaining diplomatic relations

with Castro and had the only direct air link to Ha-

vana. WH Division assigned top priority to recruit-

ing agents in place in Cuba, and Mexico City Station

not only ran its own operations but supported the

tentative plans of other stations.

The variety and volume of technical operations

created a heavy workload managing safehouses, listen-

ing posts, and vehicles. - For photography alone the

station had six base houses commanding the entrances

to target embassies, two mobile photosurveillance

trucks, and three agents trained in photosurveillance

on foot.. It was such projects that provided informa-

tion on the visits of Lee Harvey Oswald, President

Kennedy's assassin, to the Cuban and Soviet Embassies

CIA's clandestine information on Oswald, in-

cluding a photograph showing him in front of the

Soviet Embassy, was turned over to the FBI, which

promised to safeguard Agency sources and methods.

Instead, the Bureau showed the photograph to Oswald's

mother in Dallas and told her it was a CIA photo.

The mother gave the press a garbled story about the

photo, the FBI gave the press the correct story,

and eventually CIA's clandestine information became

part of the voluminous Warren Commission report on

the Kennedy assassination. In the process Mexico

City Station had to abandon its photosurveillance
