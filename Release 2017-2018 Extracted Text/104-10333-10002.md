John -

Thank you for agreeing to participate in briefing the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to be held on Monday,

17 March, at 2:00 p.m., In 2C06 IP Bldg.)

I regret the short

notice.

As we discussed, the ARRB has asked for information

relating to the creation, transmission, and dissemination of

cables and your name instantly came to mind.

Their specific

questions are:

1- Can you describe the cable process in place in the Agency

during the

1960-1964 time period?

Med U-2

Prior to 1962 messages were delivered to the DPD Ka

(Development Products Division) at 1717 I Street or to the

Communications Center at "I" Ballet. In addition there

also was a @ building that received special traffic.

After 1962 messages came Into the CIA Headquarters and

were processed in different areas depending on the

types of traffic.

Imagery traffic would be sent to to a specific floor

for the imagery personnel. (Intercept and Special Programsy

would either be passed to a Special Sections Area of the

Communications Center or to the Cable Secretariat®

2- How did cables come in?

Messages came in from the field via the

3- How were they decrypted?

Messages were deciphered using a OTT (One Time Tape)

OT

High Frequency Radio. The message received from

The analyst of the Cable Secretariat would then read the

message and match what they read against customer

requirements. They then would have a typist type the

picked up fro the message center by the various staffs

and or divisions.

Types of Questions for DA Records Briefing

March 17, 1997

Budget and Finance

1. In Cold Warrior, (p. 52) Mangold refers to a CI secret slush fund which was tightly.

controlled by Angleton and never audited by the usual procedures. According to

Mangold, it was this fund which allowed Angleton to run his own operations without

supervision. Did the fund exist? Was this fund ever audited? Are there any records of

CI operational expenses for the period 1959-63?

2. Mangold also refers (p. 53) to an unnamed CI/B&F officer who says he worked for

Angleton from 1958-1964 and never dealt with him directly on a single matter. Is there

a list of B&F officers assigned to the CI Staff from 1959-63. Do their records still exist?

3. We have seen Directorate of Operations monthly operational reports which contain

information on the allocation/ distribution of operational funds. Are there other DO or

DA records which reflect how a certain project utilized its funding? Can this type of

information from the early 1960's still be retrieved?

4. What records are kept on disbursements to sources in the field? If, hypothetically,

LHO had received money from the Agency, what records would exist?

Personnel

1. What records are maintained on contract personnel? OP

Security

→ UMS

payrall filo

1. For the period betweën 1955-65, what was the universe of files that OS had on

individuals of groups?

2. How are Office of Security records indexed? card to beypurel

(SAG)

3. Hy we was the function a che in this compone/Security Research Stat (09/55)?

'CI functin"

4. In the OS/SRS memo of Oct. 31, 1960, written by Marguerite D. Stevens, the file

numbers of several defectors are listed: "Robert Edward Webster, El-18854; Lee

Harvey Oswald, MS-11163; Libero Ricciardelli, MS-8295; Vladimir Sloboda, MS-10565;

and Joseph Dutkanicz, MS-10724." What do the "MS" and "EE" file prefixes designate?

How are these designations assigned?

---

## Page 25

13-00000

5: Does OS process security clearances for non-employees (e.g. sources) to receive

access to classified information? What kinds of files are created by this process? How

long are these files maintained. For example, Clay Shaw was given a security clearance

and had access to classified information based on his "responsibilities" as a source for

the Domestic Contacts Division (DCD).

6. Where are records that would describe liaison (etc.) cooperation or operations

between OS and CI located? How are these records organized?

7. Where are records regarding operations that OS participated in or ran located. For

example, where are the OS records on the Castro assassination attempts?

8. How many files did OS have on Oswald? Which OS components maintained files on

Oswald? Why did OS have any files on Oswald?
