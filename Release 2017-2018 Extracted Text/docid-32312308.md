SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES (SSC)

RL: DEPOSITION OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR W. RAYMOND WANNALL

In response to questioning, Mr. Wannall stated

that he could

not recall any instances wherein names

regarding the Cuban Watch List were submitted orally to

NSA, but it was possible that this may have been done in

some cases.

He

was not able to comment on the volume of

material received from NSA in connection with the Cuban

Watch List since the product went directly to the desks

of the supervisors handling Cuban matters within his

Section. He did recall that the quality of information

was in some instances very good since it related to

known or suspected Cuban Intelligence Agents operating

in thè United States and Puerto Rico.)(T3)

The memorandum of May 18, 1962, referred to

the fact that it would be helpful to the FBI to receive

a periodic listing of firms in the U.S, which were doing

business with individuals in Cuba and with the Cuban

Government.

In explaining

this comment, it was pointed

out that the U.S. Government had established a list of

restricted items

which could not be sent to Cuba without

an export license and material of this nature would have

been of value to the FBI to establish identities of firms

which might be contravening the provisions of regulations

so adopted and administered by the Department of Commerce.

It was pointed out that to Mr. Wannall's knowledge no

such U.S. firms were subsequently included on the Watch

List.

The memorandum of January 16, 1963, referred

to the possibility of furnishing to NSA a listing of

approximately 1,100 Cuban invasion prisoners and 900

relatives of these prisoners who had recently been

admitted to the U.S.

It was explained that this referred

to the prisoners

taken by the Cubans during the Bay of

Pigs invasion in April, 1961, who, to the best of Mr. Wannall's

recollection, had been

released by the Cuban Government and

had returned

to the United States around Christmastime of

1962.

It was pointed out that to the best of Mr. Wannall's

recollection, representatives of NSA conducted a general

briefing of certain personnel of the Domestic Intelligence

Division sometime around the Fall of 1969 in order that the
