MIE YORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Interview by Senate Cormittee Investigators

1. On Thursday, 18 September 1975, I was interviewed for the second

time by investigators from the Senate Committee.

The intcrview lasted fron

approximately 11:20 a.m. until 1:15 p.ul. My testimony was recoried and will

bo transcribed. When the transcription is ready I will be required to rcad

it and swear to the truthfulness of the stacients I made. Under ordinary

circunstances, a Senator would have been present to swear ne in at this in-

terview. forever, because of the televised public hearings, no Senators were

available. An unidentified wonan operated the equipment which consisted of a

Sony casette recorder ali dictanhone casette recorder.

The primary questioning

was by Mr. Postal and Mir. Gorion Rhea, the same investigators with whom I spoke

on the earlier occassion. At one point or another during the proseedings three

other men joined us for various perious of time.

NT. Rhott Dawson appearei

shortly after the interview began and renained for about an hour. Mr. Fred

Behren (I can't vouch for the spelling) arrived after about half an hour and

remained for ayproximately twenty minutes, having received a phone call which

took him away.

Mr. bob Kelly arrived shortly atter Mr. Behren and stayed for

about 10 minutes longer than Mr. Behren.

The interview was conducted in a roo

Building.

and that I could refuse to answer any question which might tend to incriminate

I was asked to describe in general terms my work with CIA. I told them

that I joined in 1949; that I was and an now a member of the Office of Training;

that in 1960 or thereabouts I had a short tour of duty with the Economic Action

Group in the DDP, and that I went directly fron that assignent to M1/4 in

Septerber of 1961.

I was asked to recall my major activities while with the Cuban operation

and I did so. I reported that my first assigment was the handling of a Cuban

agent, one wo were using to build a nucleus of an organization for evontual

oporations into Cuba. I identified this man as Mir. Rojas (hI. Fhea, having

heard ay description of this activity at our earlier session, did not pursue

this matter any further).

4. The investigators were interested in when I was assigned the code

name Fiscalini; tho circumstances, under which the name was assignod, and who

had assigned it. d toldthem d had seon a xerox copy of the memorandum (1

saw this during a neeting with bill Sturbits last Friday in Bill's office)

which roquested that identification In the naze of riscalini be assigned to me.

I explained the circunstances, which ir. Postal and Mr. Knea had heard at our

earlier meeting, and said that I thought the date was the end of larch, 1962.

The ciramstances involved a contact by a New York lawyer, thru the Lepartment

• of Justice, concerning a client who had accoss to Cuba and wanted to visit

Castro to put in a special pica on behalf of the Bay of Pigs prisonors.

identified the individual concerned (I still can't remember his nane) as the

manager of the Torosa Hotel in Now York.

I did not identify the lawyer and

was not asked for his name. I identified a man I met at a second mecting in

New York as "Bubbles" Abdallah. I explained that the latter individual pro-

coderly gentian with some difficulty en sa to a, explained to the investi-

elderly gentlanan with some difficulty in walking.

gators that I had no further contacts with these people after I discovered that

Abdallah was wanted, or under indictment - I forget which - by Texas authorities

for smuggling drugs

fron Mexico. Mr. Robert Kolly was clearly interosted in

pursuing the natter of who assigned my "Code Nane." I indicated that the docu-

mentation that I received came from the Office of Security but that I did not

know whether that Office selected the nano or not.

5. He went over again the story of uy contact with a Canadian named "Joe"

(I know this man's last nane but have not been asked for it and have not volun-

toered it). I described one meeting and a telephone call involving Joe.

meeting he claimed that he could travel back and forth from Canada to Cuba; revealed

to me that he was interested in starting a smuggling activity involving goods

on the proscribed list; that he wanted United States citizenship and & great

deal of money in exchange for allowing us to send materials or tamper with some

of the shipments if we could get the proscribed goods to Canada.

I explained to

the investigators that my interest lay in the fact that Joe clained he could

speak with Che Guevara and that I had attempted to get Joe to serve as a neans

of commication between us and Che, which Joe refused to do. As for the tele-

phone call, I told them that when Joe returned frow his trip to Cuba he called

to say that big things were going on in Cuba and we should meet right avay.

Being aware that at that point we in the Agency were deep into what would later

be called the Cuban Missile Crisis, I told Joe I could not see him and that we

probably already knew what he had to tell me. That was the last I heard of Joe.

6. He spent a great deal of time going over my meetings with the Attorney

General and his interest in a snall group of Cubans who claimed to have supporters

in Cuba ready to create an uprising in Sanziago Province. Tus is the case de-

scribed in paragraph 3 of my earlier nerorand. The investigators were quite

out being able to recall who this man was. I was asked if I could describe the

man an! I said that I recalled him as a fairly tall man of average build with

black hair, black eyebrows and ilasses. Of considerable interest is the fact

that perlays 15 to 20 minutes later I was shown on 3 X 10 glossy photograph of

several people walking in front of what appeared to be a public building ani

Hot asked whother I could idently any of the people in the picture. I could

ir. Postal pointed to tho central figure and asked if I could identify him.

I snid I could not.

(The picture was of a man probably in his mid-sixties with

floving white hair - sonwhat on the order of Senator Keating - a large down-

curviny nose, white, straight eye brows beiind dark glasses, a sonewhat lined,

puffy face, and a slightly receding forchead accentuated by the fact that his

hair was combed straight fron front to back. The man was wearing a dark blue

or black suit, and one man appeared to be accompanying hin to his lett and

slightly ahead, and another man slightly to his right and rear. Without hv

ing any reforence points by which to juugc, my best guess would be that the

subject was about 5'10" tall. lie appearod to be rather heavy, perhaps in the

range of 220 pounds.

There scened to be a caption of some sort at the bottom

of the picture but this was hidden from my view.) Mr. Postal asled whether

the main figure in the photo,raph could have been the man the Attorney General

directed me to sec. I replied that, even allowing for the difference in years,

the man in the photograph in no waj-rescabled the man I saw on behalf of the

Attorney General.

Nessrs. Postal and Rhea again brought up the subject of assassination

and asked whether I lad engaged in of had heard mention of, in Task Force W

or sas, discussions on the subject of assassination cither in gencral or

specifically with respect to Castro.

I told the investigators that the subject

came up repeatedly when we were speaking with Cubans, many of whom, having been

forced to flee Cuba, sincerely wished for Castro's imediato denise. I said

that I had never heard of or engaged in conversations with Agency officers about

any plan the direct and only aspect of which was the assassination of Fidel

Castro.

I pointed out that on a rumber of occasions I dealt with Cubans who

wantod to kill Castro, but that y job was simply to attempt to extract fron

these contacts the names of people in Cuba who might be of potential use to us

in intelligence operations.

I said that I had never engaged in plotting with

Cubans regarling assassination but that I had many conversations with Cubans

regarding their desiro co contuct paranilitary ac tivities rich, as a by-projuct,

night well result in Castro's death. I pointed out emphatically that the Agency's

policy prohibits political assassinstion.

8. I was asked if I kne

and Nestor Sanchez. I told then

that I knew them both and that Nestor and I shared an office for a short period

near the end of my attachnent with SAS. I was asked if "A-LASH"' meant anything

to me and I replied in the nogative.

This was folloved by whether Bill/ and

Nestor had discussed with me or mentioned an operation of theirs involving a

high level officer of the Cuban soverent, a nilitary man who made frequent

trips out of cuba. Again 1 could only roply in the negative. I added the

juxtaposition of Bill and Nestor in the context of a single oporation surprised

ne inasmuch as I holioved Nestor to have been involved only in psychological

operations andildworking at collecting foreign intelligence:

I was then

asked if the word "NOTS" acant anything to me and I said it did but that all

I could say was that it had to do with counterintelligence activities. Mr.

Rhea asked me wither I could say that the "NOIS" activity was concerned with

contacting Cuban exiles in the Niuai area and I indicated that this was my

wuerstanding. The subject was not pursued further.

9.

I was astied about my visit to New Orleans (which I had nentloned during

the previous session) and I explained that these two trips were for the purpose

of attcapting to find ways of establishing chanels of corrumication between the

exilal Cubans in Now Orleans and their friends in Cuba.. I indicated that I hau

been able to come up with a very fine prospect, a Cuban, and that I had turned

him over to one of our FI Case Officers.

I also saiu that I had several dis-

cussiorswith an merican whom I doclined to identity under the general ground

rule relating to sources of information. Nessis.

Postal and Rhoa asked 1f I

would respond affimatively if they were to suggest sone initials which night

correspond to the name of my Anerican contact. I agreed to do this but the

initials which they nentioned meant nothing.

(Unfortunately, I cannot recall

thou:)

I volunteered the initials of my contact, "FJ", and this produced a blank

exprossion on the part of both investigators and a shrug of Mir. Khea's shoulders.

The final question

I was asked was whether I had any knowledge of the "Ponchar-

train Operation'.

I told them that I knew where lake F'onchartrain was, and

that's as far as it went.

10.

We spont a little time on the subject of General Landsdale. I ad-

mitied I had attended one mecting in Gencral Landsdale's office in the Pentagon.

I was asked whether anyone else was there and said that I could recall only one

name, cornelius Noosevelt, but that there were two other people at the meeting.

In response to a series of questions about what was discussed at that meeting,

I said that General Landsuale was interested in various paramilitary possibilities

and that my role was linited to giving a quick assessment of whether we had the

agent assets to assist in carrying out tho various possible operations that

General Linisdalo suggested.

11. I was asted whether the term "Nongoose" meant anything to me and I

indicatal that it was a general tern used to refer to & composite of planned

operational activitics.

I said that I had no inowledye of any specific activity

boing planned under this nine and further explained that it sas possible that

some of my Cuban contacts might have been taken over by other Case Officers for

use under "Mongoosa" but that I had no direct knowledge of such having been done.

12. Mr. Robert Kelly exprossed considerable interest in the organization of

Task force l. At one point he asked how miny echolons there were betwcen me and

Me. Heli35.

I told them that I reported to Bill Harvey; that my title was Special

Assistant; that vir. Harvey reported to Nr. lielns; that I froquently received

assignment and reported to San lalpom; and that occasionally I undertook

tasts for truce Cheever, Harvey's deputy, although these tasks were concerned

with the workings of lask Force l and did not involve contact with the Cubans.

I was asked if there were any Special Assistant other than me ia. Task Force W

and I replicd that it. Logby, Challa prior to lir. Harvey's arrival on the scene,

had been retained as a menber of Task Force Win an SA status. I said that

there way well have been others bocause people would show up fron time to tino for

short tours of duty for several conths or so and then depart to carry on

their work elsewhere, but that I could not recall anyone by name at the present

time.

13. I was asked whether I used the nare Fiscalini in circustances other

than those described.

I said that I frequently carried identification in

that nuse and used it on several occasions. I lescribel one occasion which was

an amusing one-time contact with no bearing on any iten of interest to the commit-

The investigator asked whether I had ever contacted Cubans in Miani and I

replied in the negative.

14.

I was asked if I had ever made contacts with people in New York City

other than those described.

though the nan in question lived in lies York, the meting took place in Newark,

New Jersey.

I declined to identify the man involved on the grounds of the sensitivity

ot his position at that tine and the tact that i do not know at present where he

is or what he is doing. (This was the beginning of the unsuccessful ECio opcra-

tion which should be recorded sanewhere in the Task Force W or Miami Station

files.)

15. I was asked whether I had any Inowledge of a neeting of the Attorney

I said that such a

meeting would not have been unusual, in my opinion, but that f lad no knowleige

of. such a ncoting. I pointed out that it was common practice among nany cuban

leaders to try to acquire the support, or at least the appearance of sumport, of

V.S, agencies and prominent U.S. political figures. I further stated that

numerous attempts vero made to get the U.S. to support a Cuban government-in-

exile and that I had had one necting in Washington with a Cuban leader who was

constantly attempting to get us to support him as head of such an arrangenent.

I identified this ran as Mario Garcia-Kohly and aleil that he was sentenced to

prison some ycars later for counterfeiting Cuban pesos.

The name "Kohly" ob-

viously rang a bell with Mr. Postal as he repeated it aloud in a surprised tore

of voice, ilowever, sir. Postal did not pursue the matter.

16. Some of the other topics which were surfaced in connection with the

above major itons: I was asked whether I know the following people or recognized

the nares.

I was asked whether "No Name Key"meant anything to me and

I gave a negative response.

I was asked if I had visited Chicago in the course of my work

and I told them I had not.

17. This is probably the appropriate point to underline my conviction that the

main, if not the only, point of concern to the investigators is whether i was

directed to sally forth and initiate contact with members of the underworld in

the U.S. and who directed me to do so. Their interest is even more pointedly

focussed on whether I had anything to do with the Rosselli, Giancana, et al,

"operations".

Once again, I explained that my job was broader thancthis by a

long shot, and that I was never directed to take the initiative in establishing

contacts with the underworld. I said that several, probably no more than five

or six, of the people with whom I dealt were somewhat "shady" characters, in

some cases with recorded run-ins with law enforcement agencies.
