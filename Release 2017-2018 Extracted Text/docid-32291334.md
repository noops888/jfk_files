In my memorandum of August 22, 1963, information was set

forth that Benjamin Bertram Sigelbaum, who is

involvedgin the

transfer and concealment of skimmed funds from the Las-Vegas gambling

casinos, attempted to explain how lucrative the Swiss banking

(business is:

Sigelbaum stated that the banks lend money to African

countries at 12 per cent and 15 per cent interest and that they

receive government bonds of these countries, which, if defaulted,

are apparently underwritten by the U. S. Government.

The Director

Just how does this work?"

¿ This information was furnished by highly? confidential

without further comment or elaboration.

Sigelbaum and his

associates have previously expressed a desire to invest funds in

the owiership of a Swiss bank, but this is the first information we

have received to indicate any knowledge on their part of Swiss banking

investment practices.

John Grosvenor, Chief Counsel, Bureau of Public Debts U.S.

Treasury Department, advised that there

is no blanket underwriting of

foreign government bonds as such by the U.S. Government. The U.s.

Governnent does agree to underwrite particular projects in foreign

countries for their economic development.

This may be done through

the State Department, Defense Department or some other agency.

particular foreign country, with sucha project, issues bonds

through

Its own agencies to finance the cost of the project., sugh bond issues

frequently offer better interest rates than our own banks?

There is

variation among these interest rates.

It is necessary to

consider specific countries and projects to determine exactly what

the particular rate of return on a bond issue would be.

S Mr. Grosvenor also mentioned that in international

financing, independently operated agencles - such as the International

Monetary Fynd, to which the U.lS, Government subscribes heavily,

often accurately described as u.S
