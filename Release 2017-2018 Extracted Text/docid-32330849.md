vending machines and not regular slot machines

and he claimed that he had purchased some of the

machines over a year previous from one PETER

ANTHONY HAND and that he paid for the machines

in cash.

NO T-10 claimed at that time that HAND

had no interest in the machines and during this

time he claimed that his only partner in his

vending machine company was NOFIO PECORA, not

further identified by the informant.

During the course of inquiry concerning

one JAMES HARRIGAN during November and December of

1950 concerning HARRIGAN's interstate transportation

of a stolen 1950 Pontiac from New Orleans to

Bellevue, Ohio, it was ascertained that theft of

the vehicle was effected by use of worthless checks

tendered to Crescent Auto Sales Company then at

125 South Broad Street, New Orleans, Louisiana,

and that as of this time Crescent Auto Sales was

identified as a partnership by a NOFIO PECORA

and JOHN BLANCHARD.

With respect to HARRIGAN,

whose true name was later ascertained to be

HAROLD LEE HENRY, JR., the U. S. Attorney at

Toledo declined prosecution of him since his

probation for a previous forgery conviction

in Huron County, Ohio and this subject was com

mitted to Ohio

State Reformatory under a one to

twenty year sentence.

During 1954 NO I-ll developed information

that NOFIO PECORA, who then operated Crescent

Used Car: Lot at Canal and North Dorgenois Street

allegedly had been writing Federal and Orleans

Parish Bail Bonds giving address of 337 and 339
