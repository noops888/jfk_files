Two symbol numbers have been used to further conceal

the identity of NO 1283-C-TE, whose identity is known to the

Bureau.

the assets of the late

Senator A. D. SMITH because of FRANCES

PECORA's relationship with SMITH

and because of her position

of influence in the State of Louisiana, with the State Insurance

Board.
