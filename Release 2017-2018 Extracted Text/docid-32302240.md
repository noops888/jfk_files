On December 4, 1959, BROWDER appeared before

U. S. District Judge EMETT C. CHOATE, at which time he

pleaded not guilty on this new indictment and trial date

was set for January 18, 1960. BROWDER's attorney, RICHARD

BOOTH, requested the Judge to clarity the condition of

BROWDER's bond, which stipulated that BROWDER was to get

permission from the Judge to leave the jurisdiction of "

the court.

BOOTH desired to know whether the Judge meant

BROWDER had to stay within the limits of the Southern

District of Florida or the continental limits of the United

States. Judge CHOATE stated his intention was that BROWDER

had to stay within the continental limits of the United .

States and If BROWDER wanted to leave the country at any

time, written permission should be obtained from Judge

CHOATE.

At the hearing on December 4, 1959, BROWDER

explained that he had a license from the U. S. Treasury

Department to deal In surplus planes and plane parts, and

in order to utilize this license it would be necessary for

him to travel to varlous points in the United States where

surplus materials were being exhibited and auctions held.

On December 10, 1959, a confidential source abroad

advised the Miami Office

that BROWDER's close associate, PAUl.

BERT HICKMAN, was In custody at Bern, Switzerland in

connection with Illegal arms traffic and gold smuggling.

This source added that BROWDER might go to Bern, Switzerland

to assist HICKMAN. (C)

On December 10, 1959, Assistant U. S. Attorney

He stated that in the event BROWDER did

make the trip to Switzerland without getting permission from

stated he was not sure what the Judge might do, if anything,

in the event BROWDER made the trip to Bern without getting

On November 28, 1959, a confidential source

abroad advised the Miami Office that efforts to locate HICKMAN

in Switzerland have been unavailing. This source stated that

HICKMAN had registered at the Grand Hotel Dolder in Zurich,

on May 28, 1959, that he visited Basel, Switzerland on that same

date, that he visited Zurich on July 20, 1959, and that he

was believed to have been in Lugano, Switzerland on July 23,

1959. (c)

her husband is still in Switzerland, and can be contacted

She added HICKMAN travels considerably.

Mrs. HICKMAN asserted

that her husband's return date to the United States is uncer-

tain, but estimated it would be at least two months hence.

On December 8, 1959, Mrs. PAUL BERT HICKMAN was

reinterviewed at her residence. She stated her husband is

associates, probably BROWDER included, will buy gold bars,

in Mexico and fly the gold from Mexico to Switzerland, where

they have a ready market for it. Mrs. HICKMAN added that her

husband seems to be quite enthused about this matter, tells

her it is a legitimate enterprise and that it will be very

lucrative.

She related that HICKMAN never does confide in her

about the details of any deal he is working on, and adds

that she knows very few of his associates.

She claims she

was in Zurich with HICKMAN from May to August, 1959.

Mrs. HICKMAN added during that time HICKMAN never mentioned

any Canadian bonds to her and never indicated he was anxious

to contact any American authorities for any reason at all.

She stated while HICKMAN was in Europe on this trip, he was

constantly travelling and for that reason she did not have a

lot of personal contact with him. She pointed out she

spent part of her time with her son, daughter-in-law and

grandson in an Army base in Bordeau, France.

She pointed out

at the present time she is somewhat worried about HICKMAN,

because she has not heard from him for a week or two, pointing.

out the last time she heard from him he was in bed with a

bad case of the flu in Switzerland and she was concerned that

he might be seriously i1l.

As Indicated above, on December 10, 1959, a

confidential source abroad advised the Miami

FBI Office that

PAUL, BERT HICKMAN was in custody at Bern, Switzerland in

connection with illegal arms traffic and gold smuggling.

This source stated HICKMAN was In touch with EDWARD BROWDER,

The file also reflects that after several hear-

ings on the matter the Judge still upheld his stand that

BROWDER should be granted a new trial.

On November 24, 1959, PICHARDO appeared at the

FBI Office in Miami accompanied by Attorney RICHARD BOOTH.

BOOTH is the attorney for BROWDER. BOOTH explained to

SA JOHN P. LENIHAN that he is the attorney for PICHARDO,

stated that PICHARDO is now residing in Miami, and stated

PICHARDO did not want to discuss any phase of

the BROWDER

case with Agents of the FBI:

SA LENIHAN determined after meeting PICHARDO,

that he is identical with FBI #641798B.

On November 24, 1959, Immigration & Naturalization

Service (INS) Investigator JOSEPH THURMAN, advised that INS

had a case on PICHARDO. He related that PICHARDO came in-

through Customs at Key West, Florida on November 22, 1959,

claimed to be an American citizen and was readmitted on that !

basis.

A search of his luggage, however, disclosed a Cuban

Air Force uniform. For that reason, the INS had an investiga-.-

tion underway to determine if PICHARDO had actually served in

the Cuban Air Force, in which case PICHARDO would have lost his

citizenship. THURMAN stated PICHARDO apparently was going to

deny having served in the Cuban Air Force, and had engaged

Attorney RICHARD BOOTH in order to hold his status as a

naturalized American citizen. Mr. THURMAN stated that a hear-

ing was set in the PICHARDO matter for December 4, 1959, but
