In this article BUCHANAN discusses the people

Without their concurrence, according to BUCHANAN,

OSWALD would never have been able to have obtained employment

in Dallas.

BUCHANAN describes the members of the Dallas

Council as being

the wealthy and influential people behind

the scenes in that community and states that seven members

of the Council represent the

"cream" of the influential

In the latter group he mention.

SECRET

XQn 3-24-64 /JAMES LESTER of the local office of

CIA advised that his office had received information that

BUCHANAN reportedly is presently employed on an installation

of Bull office machines being used by the Prefecture of

Police in Paris.

This information has been furnished to the

prefecture of Police, and while their inquiry is continuing,

preliminary results would indicate that the report is untrue.

In this connection, a copy of the memorandum captioned

THOMAS GITTINGS BUCHANAN, JR., which sets forth background

information concerning him appearing in Bufiles, and which

was transmitted to the Paris Office by Bulet to Baltimore

3-19-64, was made available to the prefecture of Police.

It appears that the information contained in the memorandum

would be of interest to the Ambassador, RALPH SMITH of the

local office of U.S. I.S, the Direction de la Surveillance

du Territoire (DST), French gomestic counterespionage service,

and the local office of ClAy We are therefore furnishing

copies of that memorandum to them.

As mentioned previously,

we

will

continue to

follow this matter closely and promptly

• transmit to the

Bureau any pertinent information of interest.
