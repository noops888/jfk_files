Memorandum for: Chief, Special Security Division

Room 2605, Eye Building

Subject

: Nadelman, John D. (P)

#4,0696

1. Pursuant to conversation this date, it is requested that

subject be granted permission to take two training courses, namely,

Operational Security Course (15 - 26 November) and Clandestine

Political Warfare Course (29 November - 17 December). These

courses are held in Building I-30.

2. As described in the memorandum from DD/P dated Il July

134, every effort is being made to provide this individual with

a broad picture of the activities of this staff. It is believed

that these two courses will substantially assist in this educa-

tion. I permission is granted by your office, it will be neces-

sary to change subject's Limited Badge to provide access to

Building I-30, in addition to Buildings I, J, K and I as presently

authorized.

3. As registration for the two courses is required very

soon, we urge immediate consideration of this request.
