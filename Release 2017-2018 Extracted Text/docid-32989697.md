The essential question for determinationas to whether

this

individual represent a potential danger to the national security of

the United States in time of a

established in 1955, reviewed and concurred

In by the Department as falling within the basic terms of the Presidential

Proclamation that would trigger the Emergency Detention Program calling

for the arrest of Security Index subjects, are utilized as guidelines

in arriving at an answer to the essential

question quoted above.

We have found that the Security Index criteria afford

practicable and workable assistance in arriving at a conclusion and

are sufficiently elastic so that when applied with the necessazy judg

ment the complex questions which arise can be resolved.

These criteria

are

well devised for this purpose. They were not intended to be nor

can they or any other criteria be rigid rules since the ultimate point

to be determined is not whether a case fits a particular rule but fr

whether the subject of the case represents a danger.

The breadth of

these criteria is demonstrated by Criterion (D) which reads:

"Although

investigation has failed to establish overt acts or statements.on the

part

of a subject within the time limits set out above, facts have been

developed which clearly and unmistakably depict the subject as a

dangerous individual who could be expected to commit acts inimical to

the national defense and public safety of the U. S. in time of emergency."

What we really need is a broadening of the factors which

must be considered in evaluating an Individual's dangerousness.

subject thereof falls within the Security Index criteria, Section 87D

of the Manual of Instructions contains 17 specific factors that must

as "constant support of the Soviet Union in acts and utterances" and

Violations of penal laws arising out of activities as a subversive."

The Manual specifically points out that the above factors are not

all inclusive and will vary with each case in some degree. We propose

to enlarge upon the specific factors that must be taken into

consideration by the addition of 6 other factors relating primarily

to Soviet-satellite internal security matters and including a factor

dealing with individuals who have defected, revoked or sought

revocation of their United States citizenship in favor of the

Sino-Soviet-bloc countries who have returned to the United States and

new factors as

result in individuals engaging in such activity being included on

the Security Index. but our listing of them in the Manual will nake

it mandatory that anyone engaging in such activity be considered for

the Security Index and that activities in these categories will be

evaluated in connection with the individual's over-all sympathies

and actions in deciding whether he should be included in the Security

Index.

The Manual will still point out that the factors enumerated

are still not all inclusive; however, as has been indicated, the

proposed additions will afford field

personnel

at the Seat of Government a more detailed guideline for

consideration in arriving at a determination as to whether subject,

BY SPECIAL

RESADIGE

ISTENTION OF COMAUNISIS IN THE

• EVENT OF SUDDEN DIFZICULTY WITH RUSSIA

August 5, 1946

Reference is made to your memorandum of July 18, 1946, which forwarded

a memorandum to you dated July 11, 1946, from Mr. Theron I. Caudle, Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division.

Ar. Caudle's memorandum mas areply to my memorandum to you of larch's,

1946, in mich it ras pointed out that very nearly all of the members of the

communist Party in this country are citizens of the United States, either

naturalized or native-born, and that most, if not all, of those individual:

would undoubtedly adhere to the Soviet Union in the event of a serious crisis

involving the United States and that country.

It was suggested that you might desire to initiate a study to determine

what legislation 1s available or should be sought to authorize effective action

of & general and precautionary nature in the event of a serious emergency.

With regard to the adoquacy of logislation, with which ir. Caudle's

memorandum is primarily concerned, it is noted that except for the possibility

of a declaration of martial law which might have to extend over the entire

United States, there is no existing legislation which could be invoked with

the exception

of a possible application of 18 U.S. Code, Section 97a or the

suspension of the mrit. of habeas corpus.

It would, of course, be dangerous to the security of this country

should me have to rait until paratroop divisions were landing in our industrial

areas or until armed rebellion of Communist elements occurred before te conld

take action under any suspension of the trit. Acts of sabotage by Commnists

must be prevented by prompt measures against them in an emergency. We cannot

afford to wait until their acts of sabotage are carried out before proceeding

against them.

With regard to the application of Section 97a in its present sort o

it would be necessary in order to take action against Commnist Party members.

to

declare the greater part of the United states a military area-and to set

15 kr. Caudle pointed out in his nenorandum, nothing could be done

at the time of its writing looking toward new legislation until 1947 although

he points out that if sudden trouble develops during the adjoumment of

Congress, Section 97a could be utilized until a special session of Congress

could be convened.

I agree with lix. Caudle that the next war will dwarf all previous

conflicts and bring into utilization new weapons and bombing techniques.

The lack of effective legislation under mhich Federal authorities

and particularly the lederal Bireau of Investigation could swing into action

against acherants of the soviet Union in all parts of the United states at a

moment's notice night seriously jeopardize this country's recovery from the

first offensive blow launched by the soviet Union which logically and

militarily might be directed at the Seat of Government in Washington.

The confusion and disruption caused by bomb or rocket attack upon

Mashington with the possible attendant casualties among the aministrative

heads.of the Covemment seens to point to the necessity for a definite pre-

arranged progran of procedure throughout the United States.

I strongly reconmend, first, that you consider the issuance of definite

and specific instructions as to procedure which shall be followed in the event

of an emergency involving the United States and the Soviet Union and that those

individuals responsible for the carrying out of such procedure be appropriately

instructed without delay.

Secondly, I strongly recommend that appropriate

legislation to correct the present lack of statutory backing for detention of

persons dangerous to the security of the United States be immediately prepared

for submission either to a special session of Congress which might be called

in the event of such an emergency or to the next regular session which will

convene in January, 1947.

leference is made to your personal and confidential commu-

the benefit of the Attorney Goneral as to the standards upon which in

dividuals are included in the security index.

The basic qualification required for inclusion of an indi

vidual in the security index is that such an individual is potentially

dangerous or would be dangerous in the event of an enersency to the

internal security of this country.

The elements going into neasuring

an individual's potential dangerousness or dangerousness in the event

of an energency consist of two broad elements: (1) nembership, affilia-

tion or activity indicating sympathy with the principal tenets of the

Conmunist Party or similar ideological groups and the Nitionalist Party

of Puerto Rico; and, (2) a showing of one of more of the following:

2.

activity in the organization, pronoting its

training in the organization, indicating a

knowledge of its ultimate aims and parposes:

and welfare;

No individual is included in the security index until such an

individual has been investigated by this Bureau.

For your infornation, copies of resorts of investigations of

all individuals included in the security index have been furnished to

Department.

Deletions from the list are, of course, nade when an individual

no longer fits the standards for inclusion, as set forth above.

representatives and those of the Bureau, the Department feels it

is advisable that, insofar as possibler the provisions of the

detention program should parallel the provisions of the Emergency

Detention Act of 1950. Accordingly, it has revised the Security

Index standards so as to confor more closely to t

o those of the Act

and in so doing has to good extent utilized the language of the

statute.:

• Enclosed are copies

of the standards as so revised. Tou

will note that in result the scope of the Bureau's standards is

not appreciably altered.

Inasmuch as the Department is now prepared to go forward

with the revier of the Security Index, It will appreciate receiving

your views with respect

to the revised standards. at Your eardlest

In accordance with your request, you will be advised

of particular cases as to which you request special notification,

as illustrated by your memorandum of May 24, 1951, you are advised

that the Department presently contemplates first reviering the files

on Federal Government employees, including Atomic inersy personnel,

who are included on the

Under date of May 22, 1951, a memorandun was addressed to

you in original response to your memorandum of May I1, 1951. It

has been pointed out that the language there employed is susceptible

to far broader interpretation than was intended. Accordingly, you

SUBJECT: PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND DETENTION

OF PERSONS CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SAFETY

OF THE UNITED STATES" (DETPRO)

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

SYNOPSIS: This is to recommend obtaining Departmental approval

for amended criteria for individuals on Security Index (SI) and

to set up

Priority

Apprehension Program based on dangerousness of

individuals on SI. Present criteria for SI include individuals

in basic revolutionary groups, front groups, anarchists, and those

with anarchistic tendencies.

Department has recently amended

definition of a dangerous person in new Presidential Emergency

Action Document 6, broadening it to include terrorists or person;

who would interfere with Government operation and defense effort.

With Director's approval, conference was held with

Departmental representatives and in view of amended definition

of

a dangerous person referred to above, a corresponding amend-

ment to Item D of SI criteria was agreed upon. (Set out in

details, page 7, and page l of memorandum to Mr. Yeagley) In

addition, our study of the entire Emergency Detention Program sug

gests desirability of alterations to set up priorities for

apprehension based on dangerousness of individual. Priorities

would include:

1) Priority I. Top national and state leadership of basic

subversive organizations, leaders of anarchistic groups, individ-

als who have shown greatest propensity for violence, as well as

those who have special training in sabotage, espionage, guerrilla

warfare, etc.

Subversives in key defense facilities to be in-

cluded.

Present individuals designated Key Figures would, if

appropriate, be in this category.

Key Figure Program discontinued.

Residences and employments will be verified each 3 months

reports submitted semiannually. ‹UI

REC 6

2) Priority II.

Second level leadership and individuals

who present significant threat

but are in less

influentialMAY 6 1968

positions than Priority I.

Verification of residences and

employments each 6 months

with submission of annual reports

as noty

required on majority of

subjects.

3) Priority III. All other individuals on sI.

Made up

mainly of rank and file members.

Verification of residences and

employments to remain at 6 months with submission of reports

each 2 years.

4) Each priority will be broken down into nationalistic

tendencies and organizational affiliations so that apprehensions

can be made in each category on a selected basis.

5) Changes will not alter total number of individuals on

sI and not materially affect sI.

OBSERVATIONS:

Implementation of program will continue to require

authorization of Attorney General for any apprehensions.

priority

lists will streamline effectiveness of Program to allow us to

"zero in" on most dangerous and influential individuals and will

permit us to "lop oîf" top level inmediately if Program implemented.

This should result in paralyzing organizations, and subjects with

lesser priorities would lose top leadership and could be appre-

hended at later time, if necessary. Since SI made up principally

of rank and file, we

will save approximately. 3,500 reports per

year while at same time

we will intensify coverage of those con-

sidered most dangerous,

This presents logical and workable program

while cutting back substantially on desirable but unnecessary

paper work and is in line with our continuing analysis to stream-

line by cutting out unnecessary requirements. and retaining only

that which is absolutely essential.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached letter to Department setting forth above

proposals be forwarded.

Upon Department's approval,

appropriate

instructions and manual changes will be sent to the

field.

Memo for Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

DETAILS:

The responsibilities of the FBI with respect to

investigations in the internal security field have been

established by Presidential Directives.

The primary purpose of the investigation of sub-

versive individuals is to determine their identities and

activities and/or whether they present a serious threat to the

internal security of the country. If investigation develops

positive evidence indicating that an individual presents a

threat or potential threat to the internal security, his name

is included in the Security Index.

The Security Index contains names of individuals who

should be considered for immediate apprehension and detention

in the event of a national emergency in order to safeguard the

internal security of the United States by preventing sabotage,

espionage, and insurrection.

The list now consists of over

10,000 names.

Additions and deletions are made when it is

determined that the individual either represents a threat or

no longer represents a threat.

A plan of action has been prepared to implement the

apprehension and detention of individuals listed in the Securi ty

Index and for the seizure of specified contraband. This plan is

formally known as the

"Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National Defense

and Public Safety of the United States." Details concerning

this plan are contained in

the Attorney General's Portfolio,

copies of which were originally furnished to this Bureau on

August 3, 1948.

The proposed actions have been subject to con-

tinuous study, and revisions have been made as needed. The

proposed actions under this plan will be implemented by Presi-

dential Proclamation through Presidential Emergency Action

Documents (PEAD). The PEADs provide for the arrest and detention

of all persons, citizens as well as aliens, who are considered

dangerous to the national defense and public safety and for the

seizure of property which there is a reason to believe may be

used to the detriment of national defense and public safety.

The results of our investigations are provided to

the Department of Justice on a continuing basis for its con-

currence and approval of the persons listed for apprehension.

Memo for Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

Detailed instructions are in the hands of all of our

field offices for the handling of this matter in the event we

are called upon to effect apprehensions of SI subjects.

Plans

are also in existence in seven field offices for the handling

of detainees on a temporary basis by the Army, and close

coordination is maintained between our offices and the military.

Departmental instructions from the Attorney General to United

States Attorneys, who will be the administrators of the program

following implementation, and to U. S. Marshals have been fur-

nished our offices at the Department's request for delivery to these

officials: The Immigration and Naturalization Service is respon-

sible for the detention of alien enemies, and on a quarterly basis,

through the Department, the number of all aliens included on the

SI is furnished to them. This list is broken down by field office

and by sex.

The criteria for placing and retaining individuals was

approved by the Department on April 11, 1955. They are as

follows:

A.

B.

C.

Membership or participation in the activities of a

basic revolutionary organization within the last 5

years as shown by overt acts or statements established

through reliable sources, informants or individuals.

Membership or participation in the affairs of one or

more front organizations, which adhere to the policies

and doctrines of a revolutionary group, in a leader-

ship capacity or by active substantial

participation

in the furtherance of the aims or purposes of the

front organizations within the last 3 years as shown

by overt acts or statements established through

reliable sources, informants, or individuals.

Investigation has developed information that an individual,

though not a member or a participant in the activities

of a subversive organization, has anarchist or revolu-

tionary beliefs and is likely to seize upon the opportunity

presented by a national emergency to endanger the public

safety as shown by overt acts or statements within the

last 3 years established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals.

desirability of modifying or deleting certain standby orders.

The Attorney General served as the chairman of the committee

reviewing the documents. After extensive review,

in which the

FBI participated, a proposal was submitted to the

President that

certain documents be revised. It was proposed that the Emergency

Detention Program be revised

to agree with the provisions of the

Emergency Detention ACt.

The Internal Security Division (ISD) of the Department

has raised questions as to the ability to discharge the respon-

sibilities of the Attorney General under the Emergency Detention

Act of 1950.

By letter dated 2/26/68 the Department requested

a conference with the FBI for the purpose of reviewing the

implementation of the Emergency Detention Program.

3/1/68, captioned "presidential Emergency Action Documents,"

designating Section Chief C. D. Brennan and SA Philip E. Enlow,

attend discussions with ISD.

One of the changes in PEAD pertains to the definition

of a "dangerous individual."

The document, which has been

approved by the President, now states "The

Attorney General,

acting through such officers and agents as he may designate

the provisions of the Emergency Detention Act, each person as

to whom there is reasonable ground to believe that such person

to engage in, acts of espionage and sabotage, including acts of

terrorism or assassination and any interference with or threat

to the survival and effective operation of the national, state,

and local governments anda the

national defense effort.

RE: DETPRO

The above is an all encompassing definition of a

"dangerous person." This will extend the criteria for the

Security Index.

During the conference of 4/22/68 with ISD, the definition

of a dangerous individual was discussed, and it was decided

that Item D of the SI criteria should be expanded to include the

definition as stated in the new PEAD 6, It was also determined

that prior to implementing the EDP under the EDA additional

planning and prepositioning of necessary jorms and documents

must be completed by the Department.

Ne are continually examining our procedures and policies

to eliminate everything except absolute essentials.

We have

made a study of the Priority Apprehension Program procedures to

Insure that they are both current and meaningful. We also are

taking a hard look at the individuals on the sI to justily their

retention.

With the emergence of the New Left and the intensification

of activities by the racial militants and black nationelists, Wac

are not affiliated vith basic revolutionary orcanizations bui

because of their anarchist tendencies do present a threat to the

internal security of the United states, it has become apparent

that these individuals warrant inclusion on the SI.

Many individuals on the SI, because of their violent

tendencies and their representation of the top leadersnip of sub-

versive organizations, are scheduled for priority apprehension.

The administrative procedures developed to make these apprehen-

sions are referred to as the Detcom Program. In an all-out

emergency, all subjects whose names

sidered for immediate apprehension.

Our study indicates the necessity for establishing new

priority apprehension procedures which will continue to be based

on potential dangerousness of the individual. Accordingly, the

following suggestions are being nade:

1. That the Priority Apprehension Program be continued under

the code name Detcom; that the progran be divided into

3 priority levels and be named separately.

2. That the first priority apprehension list be entitled

Priority I.

This list should consist of hard core

national and state basic revolutionary organization

leaders and those leaders of other subversive organi-

zations and unorganized groups and individuals who haye

RE: DETPRO

indicated a propensity for violence and/or have

received special training in sabotage, espionage,

and/or guerrilla warfare. If appropriate, individuals

employed in or having access to key and/or defense

facilities will be included on this list. It is believed

that if these individuals are apprehended as scheduled

this will completely disrupt the subversive orgaizations

and should diminish possible actions by the remaining

membership.

These individuals will be apprehended only

when the Attorney General announces that their inmobili-

zation is in the best interests of the national defense

the United States.

3.

That a secondary priority list be entitled Priority II.

This group should consist of the second level leadership

of basic revolutionary organizations and other subversive

organizations or other individuals who present a signifi-

cant threat but are in less influential positions than

those in Priority I. These individuals will be apprehended

only when the

Attorney General announces that their immo

bilization is in the best interests of the national defense

of the United States.

That a third priority list be entitled priority III.

This list will consist of all other individuals who are

on the sI.

It will be nade up mainly of rank and file

members of basic revolutionary organizations and other

subversive organizations,

as well as other individuals

whose activities warrant

inclusion on the SI. These

individuals will be apprehended only when the Attorney

General announces that their immobilization is in the

best interests of the national defense of the United States.

5. That Item D under the SI criteria be expanded to read:

"Although' investigation has failed to establish overt

acts or statements on the part of a subject within the

time limits set out above, facts have been developed

which clearly and unmistakably depict the subject as a

dangerous individual who could be expected to commit

acts inimical to the national defense and public safety

that reports be submitted every 2 years.

10. That the category "Key Figure" be deleted, since it will

fit into Priority I; that the category "Top Functionary"

be continued.

Each individual case will continue to stand on its own,

sion will be based on his subversive activities and revolutionary

tendencies.

serve agent time without damaging the caliber of security

investigations of individuals.

These changes will not alter

We will be in a better

position to "zero in" on the most dangerous individuals, and

this will permit intensification of investigations on them, should

for immediate apprehension

in a practical working vein.

This

will enable us to "lop off" leadership of the subversive and

dangerous groups immediately.

RE:

DETPRO

The more strict procedure of verification of residences

and employments of every 3 months instead of 6 months for

Priority I list vill greatly assist in maintaining knowledge of

the whereabouts of these individuals, which is as it should be.

The size of each Priority list cannot be determined

until a review of the SI has been completed.

It is estimated

that priority I will be approximately 750-1000, Priority II

2,500, and Priority III, 7,000.

The SI is made up principally of rank and file members;

therefore, the greatest effect on

our work will result from the

proposal for Priority III.

The adoption of the proposals will result in the saving

of agent and clerical time both at sOG and in the field in

preparation and handling of approsimately 3,500 reports a year.

The field will promptly report any unusual or important

changes concerning a subject.

This will also release agent investigative time to

concentrate on those individuals deemed more dangerous and at

the same time not lose control over lesser subjects.

The field will continue to be required to know the

current whereabouts of all subjects.

It is believed that this program is logical and workable

and is in line with our continuing analysis to streamline our

work. We are substantially cutting back on desirable but

unnecessary paper work by cutting out unnecessary requirements.

It is believed these proposals will greatly improve the

efficiency of our work.

SYNOPSIS:

"Deloom

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

that the Department be consulted regarding the removal of

Priority III subjects from the Security. Index (SI)..

would in no way mean a lessening of investigative attention

regarding individuals carried as Priority III SI subjects

but would

mean concentrating our attention in areas most

essential to the internal security of the country.

These Priorities were established during the latter

part of April, 1968,

as it was the Department's feeling that

all individuals on the SI would not be apprehended in the

event of a national emergency. Only those who are top leaders

of the various groups

(Priority I) would currently be considered

for apprehension in the event of a national emergency with

follow-up consideration being given to individuals in a

secondary leadership capacity (Priority II). Apprehension of

rank and file SI subjects (Priority III) is extremely remote.

Ut the 10,too individuals on the sa, 8,125 are in Priority 111

These security subjects could be maintained on a subversive

index by the Bureau and in the event of an extreme national

emergency, this list would be available for whatever action

is deemed

necessary by the President and the Attorney General.

The criteria for this subversive index would remain exactly the

same as for existing, Priority III SI subjects.

After the initial

investigation in this category,

necessary. information could be

submitted by letterhead memorandum making the preparation of

investigative reports unnecessary.

This could result in consider-

able savings to the Bureau since routine investigation would not

be required after the initial investigation.

In addition,

the

list is, in effect, already in existence and would require

work to set up and

much less to maintain than the sI.

Priority III subjects from the SI will alleviate this

situation considerably.

The total number of individuals

on the SI has increased 49 per ce

and is expected to increase by an additional

before March, 1970, since very few names are

e being removed

due to lack of periodic review.

If Priority III subjects

were removed from

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

DETAILS:

We constantly review our operations in the internal

security field in an effort to effect streamlining measures,

where possible, in order that the most effective use

can be

made of the available manpower.

Under the existing moratorium

pertaining to routine Security Matter - Communist cases,

as

well as investigations of Priority II and Priority III SI

subjects, we are not at this time conducting our normal periodic

investigation of Priority III SI subjects.

In an effort to further streamline security investi-

gations and to effectively utilize the manpower available, it

is believed that we should at this time consult the Department

regarding the necessity to continue Priority III designations

on the

SI. Priorities vere established during the latter

part

ot april 1968, as a result oi conterences with the department.

The establishment of these Priorities was confirmed by letter

to Assistant Attorney General J. Walter Yeagley dated May 1, 1968.

The establishment of Priority listings for SI subjects was

brought about by the fact that there were at that time over

10,000 individuals on the SI, and it was the feeling of the

Department that all individuals on the SI should not be appre

• hended

for detention in the event of a national emergency

requiring the implementation of the Emergency Detention Program.

The Priorities were established on the basis of leadership

capacity within the various organizations and groups.

Priority I was made up of all hard core national and state

basic revolutionary organization leaders and leaders of other

who indicated a propensity for violence and/or had received

specialized training in sabotage, espionage, and/or guerrilla

warfare. Priority II vas based on second level leadership and

Priority III was made up of all others on the SI, mainly rank

and file members of the various organizations and groups.

It has been the feeling of the Department that in

the event of a national emergency the Bureau will be authorized

to apprehend and detain only certain individuals in Priority I.

There are currently 712 individuals in Priority I of the sI.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

!

We could conceivably apprehend as little as 10 individuals

in this group or as many as the entire list of 712.

The

Department has indicated that individuals included in

Priority II of the SI may possibly be considered for appre-

hension and detention, but this would be secondary and

would follow by at least a short period of time any.

apprehension of individuals in Priority I. it is doubtful

that instructions would be issued for the Bureau to apprehend

anyone in Priority III of the SI.

This is based on the theory,

which appears to be sound, that the immediate removal of leaders

would effectively paralyze the various organizations and thereby

remove considerable potential for

acts inimical

to the best

interests of the nation.

It is, therefore, believed that we can delete Priority

III from the actual SI without in any way seriously affecting

the Emergency Detention Program: This, by no means, indicates

a lessening of our vigilance pertaining to security

matters

and the responsibility of this Bureau to take necessary steps

to safeguard the internal security of this country. Although

these individuals would no longer be carried on the actual

SI, we would maintain their names on a subversive index which

vould contain the same information as does the SI. Investigations

would be initiated on individuals concerning whom we receive

information of a subversive nature and an initial report would

be submitted much as we now do recommending that this individual

be included on this subversive index or that no further investi-

gation be conducted based on the results of the investigation.

If the individual meets the criteria for being included on this

subversive index, subsequent information could be submitted to

the Bureau by letterhead memorandum rather than an investigative

report which is the current practice regarding Priority III

SI

subjects.

This would result in considerable savings to the

Bureau in investigative, Agent and stenographie time if and when

the current moratorium regarding certain phases of security

investigations

is lifted.

is you are aware, the moratorium which was placec

into effect during March,

1969, affected investigations anc

subnission of reports regarding Priority II and Priority III

SI subjects and in addition, suspended routine Security Matter -

Communist investigations.

We are, therefore, in effect not

currently investigating these Priority III SI

subjects nor

are reports being submitted concerning them based on the

moratorium. The removal of the Priority III subjects from

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

the sI will cause little or no effect on the current workload

at the Seat of Government or the field. It will greatly

assist the field once the moratorium is removed since the

field will be able to immediately initiate investigations in

the security field without having to bring up to date the

8,077 Priority III cases.

This step is also deemed necessary since the moratorium

on security investigations has actually resulted in an increase

in the total SI of over 500 cases. The total listing on the SI

as ot March 1, 1969, was 10,208, approximately 7,026 of Whom

were included

in Priority 111.

The total SI as of October 15,

1969, was 10,786, approximately 8,125 of whom were Priority III.

A portion of

this increase is directly attributable to the

moratorium since existing cases are not being periodically

reviewed for removal from the SI. A study has been made and

the increase in the over-all SI during the first six months of

the moratorium was 4.9 per cent. Since the moratorium has been

continued we can anticipate that the over-all SI will increase

by approximately an additional 5 per cent before March, 1970.

The rate of increase in the SI for a similar period

prior to the moratorium was at a rate of 0.72 per cent. This

level was maintained since we were constantly reviewing existing

SI cases for deletion.

The deletion of Priority III subjects from the SI

will result in an efficiently organized SI that will be

completely workable, especially under emergency conditions.

It is noted that as of October 15, 1969, there were

8,125 individuals included in Priority III of the SI.

If these

8,125 individuals were, in effect, removed from the sI, we

would have a remaining

SI totaling 2,661.s

We will continue to maintain Priority designation

on the SI and the standards for the Priority designation will

not be lessened to permit any widespread redesignation of

Priorities.

With the maintenance of the individuals currently

listed as Priority III SI subjects on the subversive index

a complete list would be available in the event the national

emergency deteriorated to such an extent as to warrant the

apprehension and detention of all individuals considered to

be subversive.

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

The criteria for this subversive index would remain

exactly the same as for existing Priority III SI subjects.

This subversive index is, in effect, already set up and would

require little or no work to establish and would require much

less work to maintain.

It is. belleved that this proposal to remove all

Priority III subjects from the SI should be presented to the

Department for its views, comments and approval. We will

indicate to the Department in submitting this proposal that

this does not mean a lessening in our investigations in the

security field but merely means that rank and tile members wil

not be included on the actual sI.

There is attached an appropriate letter to

Assistant Attorney General J. Walter Yeagley proposing

The Department by letter dated November 19, 1969

approved our proposal that Priority IlI Security Index (SI)

subjects be removed from the sI.

The Department also agreed

that-a listing of these Priority III subjects should be

maintained by the Bureau for possible action in the event of

a national emergency.

The Department issued

no instructions

how this listing would be maintained.

It will, therefore,

be maintained for administrative purposes as

a part of the

regular. si but these Priority III subjects will be handled

strictly within the Bureau.

The Department will continue to

make 'all decisions regarding Priorities I and II of the SI.

This method of handling Priority III subjects was

brought about by the Department's feeling that Priority Ill

i-subjects would not be apprehended in the event of a national

energency.

The Department feels that only those individuals

in Priority I and possibly Priority II of the SI would be

apprehended for detention in the event of a national emergency.

"Individuals in Priority I and Priority II total 2,679. There

are 8,170 individuals in Priority III. The total SI numbers

10,849.

REC A1 / 13-357-469-2933

A letter to all Special Agents in Charge has been

prepared advising that henceforth Priority III subjects will

be handled completely within the Bureau.

The criteria for

including individuals in Priority III remains

3 the sane,

basically, that such individuals must be rank and file members

an organization considered subversive.

All Special Agents

in Charge are being advised that this should not mean a

lessening of our investigative attention regarding individuals

in this category but is actually a concentration ofourefforts

in areas most essential to the internal security of the country.

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE: PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND DETENTION

OF PERSONS CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SAFETY

OF THE UNITED STATES

Cases on Priority III subjects will be reviewed

on an annual basis and verification of residence and

employment will be made at that time as is the current

practice.

The Bureau need be advised only in the event

changes are necessary. Such information may be submitted

by letterhead memoranda with regular submission of reports

being discontinued.

With the establishment of this means of handling

Priority

III subjects,

the maintenance of Reserve Index A

(RI-A) will be discontinued at the Bureau. The RI-A will be

maintained strictly by each field division.

RI-A is made

up of individuals

who do not meet the criteria for the SI

but have had previous connections with subversive groups

and are in a position to influence others.,

Since the Department has not specifically

instructed the Bureau on the method of maintaining

• this

listing of priority lll subjects, it is not necessary

to advise the Department.

The administrative handling

of Priority III subjects

is up to the Bureau and can most

logically be maintained administratively as a portion of

the SI with an inactive status.

This method of handling Priority III subjects

is in line with Mr. Tolson's desire to retain such individuals

on the SI but in an inactive status.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter to all Special Agents in

Charge be approved.

The report and verification requirements regarding sI

an SAC Letter has been prepared in order to advise each field

division.

"..

The SI consists of three priorities. Reports pertaining

to individuals designated as Priority I of the SI will henceforth

be submitted on an annual basis. Such reports were previously sub

mitted on a semiannual basis.

Verification of

their residence and

employment will continue to be conducted every three months.

verification of residence and employment of individuals designated

as Priority II and Priority III of the SI will henceforth be verified

on an annual basis.

Such verification was previously handled on

a semiannual basis.

No other

changes are being made regarding SI.

Verification of residence and employment regarding subjects on

Agitator Index is also being changed to a yearly basis.

This was

previously done on a semiannual basis.

The field is being instructed that the reduction in the

frequency of reports for Priority I subjects and

verification of

residence and employment of Priority II and Priority III subjects

should not be interpreted as meaning that security investigations

should be curtailed in any fashion.

In addition, the field is being

reminded of its responsibility, as well as the Bureau's responsibility

to be aware of the location of SI subjects so that in the event a

national emergency arises requiring the implementation of the Emer-

gency Detention Program (EDP), SI subjects can be located for

apprehension and detention.

Each division is being instructed that

appropriate sources should be established to alert the Bureau in

the event an SI subject changes his residence and/or employment.

The establishment of such sources is vital in order that the Bureau's

responsibilities under the EDP can be fulfilled in the manner

expected.

ACTION:

That the attached letter to all Special Agents in Charge

be approved.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

SECURITY INDEX

The Security Index is designed for

the purpose of

maintaining a list of individuals who should be apprehended

and incarcerated in the event of a national emergency, such

as an attack from abroad or internal revolt.

Such individuals

must be proven to be a definite threat to the national security.

All additions to and deletions from the Security Index are

approved in each field division by the Special Agent in Charge

or his designated representative; are completely reviewed by

Bureau supervisors who approve or reject the field recommendation;

and final approval is given by the Department. The Security

Index is based upon Ittle 2 of the internal Security Act of 1950

and is a part of the over all Emergency Detention Program.

IT Tune y

procedures of individuals on the Security Index by setting up

priorities.

Individuals designated Priority I are hard core natioal

This is in response to your request dated lay 13,

1959, for the views of thâs Bureau on S. 1314, a biut to

reper. the Energency Detention Act of 1950. It 16 Let

that this bill should zot be acopted.

The Fnergency Detention hot of 1950 serves as &

basis for the Progras for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dengerous to the National

Defense and Fublic Salety of the United States and the

Secuzity Index, both of which are operated by this Bureau

under the direction of the Departnent.

The repeal of this

Act would remove the basis for these prograns which could

seriously hanper the internal security of

this nation in

the event of an extrene national energency.

The law, as

it stands, contains necessary safeguards for the rights of

the individual and lindts. action of the U. S. Goveronent

since the detention of euch person under the

lar must be

fully justified, and no mss arrests could he nade nerely

due to au individual's nationality or race.

The protection

of this nation from potential saboteurs and espionage agents

is provided by this law, and it should certainly be co

tinued.

Under the provisions of the inergency DeLenGiON

Act, individuals who bave been trained by foreign povers

to carry out acts of sabotage, espionage and guerrilla

warfare nould be detained prior to the commission of any

act detrimental to the internal

security of the nation,

thus

preventing additional strife.

J. Smith to Mr. E. S. Miller memorandum dated 8/11/72,

captioned "Fiscal Year 1974 Budget Policy Guidance," referred

to the fact that we have been conducting a seven-month's analysis

of the Bureau's Administrative Index (ADEX) and that it appears

that by implementing certain streamlining measures and altering

requirements for reporting and periodic verification of informa-

tion,

some manpower might be available for reassignment to one

of the other critical areas of our work. In this connection the

same memorandum pointed out that the Domestic Intelligence Division

has an urgent need for in excess of 500 Special Agents to handle

several areas of national security work which are not receiving

attention deserved.

BACKGROUND

1.7g

By way of background, the ADEX is an

out growth of the old

Security Index program which in itself was an integral part of

• the Emergency Detention Program. The Emergency Detention Program

in latter years

derived its authority. from Title II of the Internal

•Security Act of 1950 (better known as

the Emergency Detention Act).

In the Fall of 1971 the Emergency Detention Act was repealed by

Congress and we, of course, immediately discontinued the Emergency

Detention Program. Since the Security Index was in actuality i

an extension of an integral part of the Emergency Detention

Program, it was believed that the Security Index as it was

structured should also be ding C-19 100-153012 4116

beloved the an urani should anto do modate centsey

individuals who constitute a threat to the national security,

particularly during time of national emergency.

The Security

Index enabled us to retrieve information pinpointing such

individuals.

legislation permitting apprehension and detention of persons

who threaten

The Department advised. after consultation that the FBI's

authority to. investigate individuals engaged in subversive

activity had not been eroded by repeal of the Emergency Detention

Act, and that further repeal of this Act did not in any way

prohibit the FBI from maintaining an administrative index of

individuals who were under investigation for subversive activity.

Accordingly, we devised the Administrative Index for the

purpose

of being able to quickly identify persons representing a threat

to the national security.

Since we already had the identities

of such persons contained in the Security Index, we used the

Security Index as a basis for setting up the Administrative Index.

The major difference, of course, was that whereas persons

listed

in Security Index had been listed with a view of possible

apprehension and detention, the persons being listed in ADEX

would not be subject to detention, but would be listed for ready

identification purposes.

Since persons listed in ADEX would not be subject to

apprehension and detention, the requirement for Departmental

concurrence in listing no longer existed. Also, since the

detention factor was no longer a major issue, persons could be

listed irrespective of degree of threat they may represent to

the national security.

Criteria for listing in ADEX were broken down into four

categories.

Each category, beginning with Category I, contained

a listing of persons

and Category I listed those considered most

dangerous

to the national security, while Category IV listed

those least dangerous. As of July 15, 1972, there were 15,259

individuals listed in ADEX.

Of this total 1, 334 were

Category I;

3,452 were Category II; 8,560 were Category III; and 1,913 were

Category IV.

Re:

Streamlining Measures

ASSESSMENT OF 'ADEX

ADEX has now been in operation about 8 months and we

have had

a chance to

evaluate its operation and effectiveness.

Based on

discussions with

field

personnel as well as our own

observations, we believe

that several major

changes should be

made at this

time.

(1) While ADEX has not been intended

as an investigative

program, it is somewhat of an extension of Security Index which

.was an integral part of an investigative program, and there

vestiges of the investigative program apparent in our operation

of ADEX. ADEX must be clearly separated from investigative

criteria and policy so that it represents a

mere by-product or

administrative supplement to our investigations and not as a

guideline or controlling factor in the investigation itself.

ADE very nature of the criteria

for inclusion

of individuals

are such to generate investigative activity which may not

be necessary were it not for adEX.

Reporting procedures

for a

great bulk of our security cases

are based

on the category of

ADEX or the fact that the subject is listed in AdEX.

deal of investigative

activity is created because of the requirement

of periodic verification of residence and employment addresses.

, In other words, existence of ADEX creates investigative and

reporting activity which might not be necessary otherwise.

(2) It is believed

that ADEX is needlessly complex,

particularly from the standpoint of criteria for inclusion

an individual in the ADEX, and is administratively cumbersome.

(3)

Most important, it is believed that in light of the

conditions existing today, particularly with respect to emphasis

on invasion of privacy and other First and Fourth Amendment

rights, the current criteria for designating individuals for ADEX

are too broad and all-encompassing.

individuals now included in ADEX even though they do not realis-

Re :

Index

Streamlining Measures

believed that such broad terminology would leave us in a vulner-

able position if our guidelines were to be scrutinized by

interested Congressional committees, which has been threatened.

PROPOSED NEW ADEX CRITERIA

If for no other reason but practicality, it is believed

that ADEX should be

a list of individuals who realistically represent

an immediate threat to the national seucrity, as opposed to

individuals who might theoretically pose a threat in the future

under a

given set of circumstances.

We recognize that anyone

who has

embraced a philosophy that includes an overthrow of the

American form of government is

a potential enemy of the Government.

However, in many such instances,

an individual may believe in some

other form of

government but would be unwilling to engage in

activity more

violent than philosophical discussions.

On the other side of the coin is an individual who not

only embraces the philosophy of overthrow of the Government, but is

actually engaged in some form of activity designed to bring about

that overthrow by force or violence or other unconstitutional means.

It is this latter individual who would seize upon any type of

national emergency to exploit a weakness in Governmental

functions

in an effort to wrest control, or who would commit violent: acts

, such as bombings of public buildings which are symbolic of our

•national institutions; ambush killings of police officers who

are the visible symbol of our democratic system; attack water.

supplies, power systems, or transportation facilities in an

effort to create a chaotic void into which a revolutionary force

might be able to supplant the Government. This is the type of

individual who should be listed in the ADEX.

It is therefore proposed that the existing ADEX with four

categories representing an unrealistic concept of individuals

constituting a threat to the national security be revised so that

it will include only one category. This would be a list of

individuals who represent an actual danger now to the national

security.

It is believed that such a list would embrace most of

the individuals currently listed in Categories I and II of ADEX,

or a total

as of 7/15/72 of 4,786 individuals.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re :

Administrative Index

Streamlining Measures

To do this the criteria would be changed to read as

follows:

"ADEX should be limited to those individuals whose

actions or statements have clearly established that they represent

a

current threat to the national security.

"Included are individuals, whether affiliated with organ-

ized groups of not, who have shown a willingness and capability

for engaging in treason, rebellion or insurrection, seditious

conspiracy, sabotage, espionage,

terrorism, guerrilla warfare,

assassination of Government officials or leaders, or other such

acts which would result in interference with or a threat to the

survival and effective operation of national, state, or local

government.

"The foregoing would include leaders of organizations

whose aims include the overthrow or destruction of the United States

or the government of any State, Territory, district, or possession

thereof, or the government of any political subdivision therein,

by unlawful means.

Individuals affiliated with such organizations

who have demonstrated a willingness and capability of activity

set forth under criteria set forth above would be included, but

'mere membership in such organization is not sufficient to justify

• inclusion in ADEX.

"Individuals

should be considered a 'current threat' to

the national security when reliable information has been

developed that they have engaged in activity falling within

the above-described

criteria during the past two years and

there is no indication that they have given up or ceased to

engage in such ,activity."

Adoption of these new criteria will probably result

in deletion from ADEX of numerous individuals who are connected

with subversive organizations.

For example, there were 4501

Communists in Categories III and IV of ADEX

as of 7/15/72.

Additionally there are members of Socialist Workers Party,

Progressive Labor Party, etc. who will not meet the revised

criteria of being dangerous now. It is believed that the

Bureau should maintain a list of such individuals aside from

ADEX in the event we had to quickly identify known subversives

throughout the country.

We will therefore submit a separate

proposal to establish a "Communist Index" which will require a

modicum of effort on the part of the field and Bureau Headquarters.

MANPOWER SAVINGS

It is difficult if not impossible to estimate a manpower

savings as result of redefining ADEX and streamlining its operation.

However, based

on the premise

that the revised ADEX would contain

primarily what is now Categories I & II, this would mean that about

10,473 individuals would be dropped. If these remained on ADEX,

this many cases would be opened during a twelve-month period due

to necessity to verify employment and residence addresses and to

report any pertinent data developed to date.

These cases would be

,in a closed status in the field

and would be reopened on a

regular staggered basis.

A canvass of ten field offices including New York,

Newark, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, San Francisco, i

Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia resulted in an

estimate

that roughly 89% of the above-described total of 10,473 cases

would be affected.

These offices could not give any realistic

estimate of manpower involved. However, using purely a caseload

average of 40 cases per Agents as a guide; using the 89% estimate

of the offices canvassed,

there would be 9,311

cases opened

a 12-month period or abouti 776 cases per month. When revision of

ADEX has been approved and the new criteria have been furnished

to the field, Domestic Intelligence Division will canvass each

Special Agent in Charge to determine specifically, on the basis

of the revised criteria, the manpower savings which can be

directed to higher priority security work.

The Inspection

DIVISIOn, of course, will be in the best position to evaluate

the impact of the revisions in their field audits of AdeX.

It is important to note that there will be no immediate

To avoid creating a sudden increase in workload in the field,

instructions are being issued to review existing ADEX cases

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

Reference is made to letter from this Bureau dated

February 10, 1972, with same caption.

referenced letter

set forth for your information the instructions issued to our

field offices regarding an administrative index known as Adex,

which was

initiated for control

purposes in connection with

the security investigations of individuals. Your letter of

. Cctober 22, 1971,

entitled "Emergency Detention Program," had

indicated that the repeal of the Emergency Detention

Act did

not prohibit this Bureau's use of an administrative index

compiled and maintained to assist in making readily retrievable

available the results of Bureau investigations into

subversive activities and rolatod natters.

An evaluation has been made of ADEX after more than

eight months of operation.

Revisions have been made in the

ADEX and the following instructions have been furnished

our field offices concerning the criteria io be utilized in

connection with the ADEX.

"ADEX has represented a listing of individuals engaged

in subversive activity who are considered a potential

or actual

threat to the national security.

As now constituted, it is

divided into four categories corresponding to varying degrees

of dangerousness.

The current ADEX

criteria are broadly worded

and allow the inclusion of individuals who, although they

subscribe to subversive or revolutionary doctrines, do not

necessarily represent a danger to the national security at

this time.

"After a caroful assessment of this matter, it is

believed that ADEX criteria should be anended to provide for the

inclusion only of individuals who pose a realistic, direct, and

current danger to the

national security.

In other words, it is

believed ADEX

should list

ReTSORS

who are regarded as

dangerous now.

It is also felt that ADEX should be strictly a by-product of our

"Accordingly, the following revisions with respect

to ADEX are being placed in effect immediately:

"Rovised Criteria

"Only the following individuals should be included

in ADEX :

"Individuals, whether affiliated with organized

groups or not, who have shown a willingnoss and capability of

engaging in treason, rebellion or insurrection, seditious

conspiracy,

sabotage, espionage, terrorism, guerrilla warfare,

assassination of Government officials or leaders, or other

such acts which would result in interference with

aims include the overthrow or destruction of the United States

or the government of any State, Territory, district, or

possession thoroof, or the government of any political sub

division therein, by unlawful means. Mere membership in such

organizations is not sufficient in itself to warrant inclusion

irrespoctive of title, who are in a position to significantly

influence the policies or direct the activities of the group.

"There may be some instances where retention of an

lor example, such

retention would be warranted in the casa

of individuals who have

gono into hiding, left the country, have been imprisoned, or

similar circumstances and there is no reliable information

available indicating that they have renounced activities covered

in the above criteria.

"Dotermination of Eligibility for ADEX Inclusion

"The Bureau recognizes that anyone who has embraced

philosophy that includes advocacy of the overthrow of our form

of government is a potential enemy.

However, in many instances

may believe in some other form

of government or

even in the overthrow of our form of government, but without a

willingness or capability of engaging in activity other than a

philosophical discussion or debato.

an alien philosophy, but their activities have not gone beyond

an ideological

stage.

This would include attendance at meeting,

taking part in theoretical discussions or other activity which

stops short of advocating or engaging in action to overthrow

the United States.

"Examples might be menbers of the Communist Party, USA,

or the Socialist Workers Party, or other old-line revolutionary

groups which

basically advocate an overthrow of our

present form

of government, but where the subject's activity has been

ideological in nature and not oriented towards action.

In this

connection, however, each case must be reviewed on its individual

merits, since the willingness and capability of individuals to

engage

in action dangerous to the national security is the

primary factor in making a deternination for the inclusion in ADEX.

"Under normal circumstances members of such hate

groups

as

the

• Ku Klux Klan would not meot the criteria for

inclusion

in ADEX.

There could be exceptions, however,

and

each

case must be examined individually to détermine if

it meets the new criteria.

These criteria can apply to

persons involved

with extrome right as well as extreme left

organizations,

or to individuals who have no affiliation

R. D. Cotter to Miller memorandum 9/17/71, captioned as above,

reported congressional repeal of Emergency Detention Act (EDA) and

indicated a study would be made as to how our Security Index (SI) Program

could best be maintained and used without EDA.

Director noted "Expedite."

History of Security Index

Essentially, our Security Index is a list of those individuals who

have been identified as subversives who

represent a potential danger to the

national security in time of emergency and who would have been apprehended

and detained under the provisions of EDA. As a matter of fact, our

SI predates passage of Title II of the Internal Security Act of 1950, the

statute containing EDA which hasjust been repealed. Prior to 1950, SI

subjects would have been apprehended and detained under authority derived

from Executive Order supported by joint resolution of House and Senate.

FILET; MY

The Act repealing EDA, however, would apparently preclude any

future use of such executive authority, since it amended Title 18, U.S. Code,

to insert the language …"No citizen shall be imprisoned or otherwise detained

by the United States except pursuant to an Act of Congress."'

Need to Continue SI

Although the Government does not currently appear to have any

authority to apprehend and detain subjects listed in the SI, we feel that

continuance at SI 1s an administrative necessity to the rEl

if not to the

Department also, for the following reasons:

Those listed now or included under existing criteria in the future,

will continue to represent a potential danger to the national defense. Should

this country come under attack from hostile forces, foreign'or domestic,

there is nothing to preclude the President from going before a joint session of

Congress and requesting necessary authority to apprehend and detain those

who would constitute a menace to national defense.

At this point it would be

absolutely essential to have an immediate list, such as the SI, for use in

making such apprehensions. The SI, backed by our investigative files, would

provide documentation of subversive backgrounds during any hearings

which might be required following apprehensions.

The SI constitutes an extremely valuable list of subversives and

malcontents who constantly pose a threat to the safety of the President.

Secret Service is provided a constant flow of data concerning current

wheréabouts and backgrounds of individuals on the SI. In addition, the SI

would immediately pinpoint for our own use the identities of subversives

who:' would require intensified investigative attention to provide evidence of

espionage, sabotage or the like.

Operation of SI

Currently the field makes recommendation for an individual's inclu-

sion in the SI and the Bureau either concurs or disapproves the recommendation.

It is believed this procedure should continue. However, when it has appeared

that some reason exists for removal of an individual from the SI, we have

sought advice in this regard from the Department. Departmental concurrence

in our listing of SI subjects was based on the possibility of such subjects

being apprehended under EDA. Since apprehension is not currently possible,

it is believed that the Bureau should decide whether an individual should be

removed or retained in the SI. We will, of course, continue to disseminate

our security reports to the Department.

We have furnished the Department a monthly list of subjects on

Priority I and Priority II (those subject to probable emergency apprehension)

and this list was the basis for a continuing review by the Department of

subjects to be retained on SI. For the above-named reasons we believe that

the Department should no longer make the decision as to who is retained or

removed from SI. However, the Department may desire to continue to receive

I the monthly list for information purposes.

Quarterly we have furnished Passport Office of State Department a

list of those on Priority I (the most potentially dangerous) so that we can be

advised of travel abroad by these subjects. The list is not identified in any

way as SI and since it is beneficial to us, it is believed we should continue to

send it.

RE: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM

Ettect of Repeal on Future Investigations

Repeal of EDA raises question of what effect such repeal may

have, in a legal sense, for the FBI to conduct investigations of this type.

In other words, do we have statutory authority or mandates such as

Executive Order as bases for our investigative authority?

A quick perusal of Section 87, Manual of Instructions indicates

that EDA, which was Title II of the Inernal Security Act of 1950, was only

a small part of our overall investigative authority. Title I of the Internal

Security Act of 1950, which relates to Subversive Activities Control Board,

strengthened by Executive Order 11605 dated 7/2/71, provides investigative

authority as do Smith Act of 1940, Communist Control Act of 1954, Fraud Against

the Government, Rebellion and Insurrection, Sedition and Seditious Conspiracy,

among others. However, it is believed that Office of Legal Counsel should

examine this more critically from a legal standpoint.

Observations

It is to be noted that the Department has an entire staff set up

to administer emergency apprehension of dangerous subversives. It is

believed that in the interest of national security the Department will make

some ettort or provision to implement an alternative to HDA. It is theretore

felt that the Department would have a collateral interest in the FBI's

maintaining the Security Index without the provisions of emergency

apprehension.

It is believed that in face of the substantial Congressional

sentiment which resulted in repeal of EDA, we must exercise care not to

subject the Bureau and Director to unwarranted public criticism for

unilaterally deciding to maintain the SI, which might appear to be an

attempt to evade the will of Congress. For this reason it is believed that

although we should continue to maintain the SI on a temporary basis, we

Memorandum 9/21/71, of same caption, from Mr. Cotter

to Mr. Miller contained recommendation #3, approved by the Director,

that Office of Legal Counsel examine legal bases for security investigations

of the emergency detention type to determine whether repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act (assuming repeal act will be signed by the

President) will restrict legal basis for FBI investigation of subversives.

Our conclusion is that repeal of the Emergency Detention.

Act will in no way interfere with FBI investigation of subversion in its

many forms. The effect of the repeal is to outlaw only/summary/apprehension

and detention of persons alleged to be subversive and hence dangerous in a

time of national emergency.

The FBI did not obtain its basic investigative

authority from any provision of the Emergency Detention Act and does not

lose that authority by repeal.

Our basic investigative authority for this type of case is in the

Presidential directive of September 6, 1939, which still remains in effect,

with updatings. In addition to that there is a host of criminal statutes

which are particularly applicable to the type of action-oriented subversives

with whom we now deal.

The principal subversives now carry guns, rob

banks to get money, steal arms and ammunition, commit arson, set off

bombs, incite riots, and do many other things which violate one or more

criminal statutes over which this Bureau has investigative jurisdiction.

From a combination of those statutes, plus the original Presidential directive,

on internal security, we have wide investigative authority.

Memorandum to Mr. Tolson

Re: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL

It also is our opinion that elimination of the Emergency

Detention Act does not prevent this Bureau from carrying in its files

an assessment of each principal subversive which would be sufficient

to mark him for Government attention should a need arise in a national

emergency.

Bearing in mind that the Emergency Detention Act could as

easily be put back in force should an emergency convince Congress of its

need

'this Bureau would then be expected to have on hand the necessary

action information pertaining to individuals. Investigations under the

Emergency Detention Act call for persons subject to possible summary

apprehension and detention to be listed under Priority 1 and Priority 2.

In lieu of that standard, we would suggest one called "Estimated Violence

Potential (EVP)" which could be further subdivided by the numbers one,

two and three. The Estimated Violence Potential would be arrived at

from investigation and would be an estimated potential for sabotage;

kidnaping or assassination of public officers; destruction, robbery, or

theft of Government property; riot; etc. Factors entering into the judgmen'

would be such matters as criminal offenses which the person is known

or reasonably believed to have committed or planned; statements of

violence planned, intended or advocated against pibiic officials or other-

wise; membership in, or affiliation with, organizations advocating forcible

overthrow of, or damage to, the Government; travel performed in furtherance

of any violent activity or objective; possession of firearms or other weapons

, of destruction, etc.

In spite of firm belief that the Bureau has adequate investigative

leeway remaining to us, we strongly suggest that upon official repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act, a letter should be written to the Attorney General

in which this Bureau asks for a reassessment of our investigative and

ecora-keeping authority. concerning subversive matters. It wold be

foolish of us to continue investigation without first building a record to

show that we have sought the advice of the Department in every important

particular. This is good management in general and it will also tend to

(protect us against the anticipated challenge from some spokesmen of the extreme

left in which it is claimed that repeal of the Emergency Detention Act does,

in fact, eliminate our investigative authority. Such a claim logically is

to be expected and we should at least be in a position to say that this question

has been raised to the Department of Justice.

•R. D. Cotter to Miller memorandum 9/21/71,* captioned as above,

related facts concerning repeal of Emergency Detention Act (EDA) and

effect of such repeal on Bureau security investigations.

.T;

Memorandum recommended that when Act was signed by President

a letter be directed to Attorney General citing reasons why we should

continue to maintain Security Index without features of emergency

apprehension. Memorandum also requested Legal Counsel to examine

legal bases for our security investigations to see if repeal of EDA has

restricted our legal basis for investigative activity. Memorandum also

recommended continuation of Security Index on a temporary basis pending

advice from the Attorney General. The Director approved all these

recommendations.

Dalbey to Tolson memorandum 9/24/71, same caption, voiced

opinion that repeal of EDA will in no way interfere with FBI investigation,

subversion, but recommended a letter to Attorney General requesting

review of our authority to investigate subversive matters and to compile/

records on allegedly subversive persons:

The Act repealing EDA has been signed by the President and

there is attached a letter to the Attorney General requesting advice concerning

this legislation.

-7,

While there is no question concerning the need to maintain a current

list of potentially dangerous persons, such as we have done in our Security

Index, prudence dictates the necessity to keep any such records in a manner

which would not invite charges by the Bureau's enemies that we are evading

the will of Congress. In this connection, it is believed we must also get

some written authority from the Attorney General, not only to keep records

which, in effect, represent a workable substitute for the Security Index, but

also serves, as a mandate, for our continued investigation of subversive activitie

and related matters.

RE: EMERGENCY DETENTION ACT REPEAL;

SECURITY INDEX PROGRAM

The attached letter requests concurrence of the Attorney General

in our opinion that repeal of EDA does not erode FBI authority to investigate

subversion and that such repeal does not preclude our keeping administrative

records necessary in the conduct of subversive investigations, including a

list of individuals who pose a threat to national security. The letter also

requests advice as to disposition of material maintained in our field offices

relating to EDA.

If the Attorney General concurs in our views concerning the

keeping of an administrative index, steps will be taken to implement such

index, using data wherever: possible which can be salvaged from the

discontinued Security Index.

A detailed study will be made and criteria

established for such index and necessary mechanics will be devised for its

operation.

The Attorney General

On January 8, 1943, the President issued

a Directive

reiterating his previous Directive of September 6, 1939, and

subsequently on July 24, 1950, the President issued a third

Directive, reiterating previous Directives of September 6, 1939,

and January 8, 1943, and broadened the scope of investigative

activity by the FBI

to include "subversive activities and

related matters" as well as the specific matters involving

espionage and sabotage.

On December 15, 1953, the President

issued a statement in which he set forth the language contained

in the combined Presidential Directives dated September 6,

1939, Nanuary 8, 1943, ana July 24, 1950, concerning the

investigative responsibility of the FBI in matters relating to

"espionage, sabotage,

subversive activities and related matters."

The statement then pointed out the FBI is also charged with

investigating all violations of the Atomic Energy Act and

requested cooperation of all enforcement officers, as in the

previous Directives, in reporting all information

relating to

violations of the Atonic Energy Act to the nearest representative

of the FBI.

Based on interpretation of existing statutes and the

language set forth in the various Presidential Directives cited

above, we feel that the repeal of the Emergency Detention Act

of 1950 has not eroded the FBI's authority and responsibility

to conduct investigation of subversive activities and relatea

matters. Ilkewise, we feel that the repeal of this Act does not

limit the FBI's authority and responsibility to keep and maintain

•administrative records, including various indices, which may be

necessary in fulfilling such responsibility and authority.

I strongly feel that irrespective of the repeal of the

Emergency Detention Act, the Federal Government must take

whatever steps are necessary, within the law, to protect itseli

cron all hostile forces bent on its destruction.

We, therefore,

feel that it is absolutely incumbent upon the FBI

to

, continue

investigations of those who pose a threat to the internal security

of the country and to maintain an administrative index of such

individuals as an essential part of our investigative

responsibility.

Such an index not only enables the FBI to pin-

point individuals who have exhibited a propensity to conduct acts

inimical to national security, but also

serves as an extremely

valuable list of individuals who pose a continuing threat to the

safety of the President and thereby enables us to provide current

data to U. S. Secret Service concerning backgrounds and where-

abouts of

such individuals.

1.- Mr. Rushing

The essential question for determinationa to whether

ling

subject's name should be included in the Security Index is "Does

this

Individual represent a potential danger to the national security of

the United States in time of a uational emergency?" The present

Security Index criteria,

established in

11955, reviewed and concurred

falling within the basic terms of the Presidential

Proclamation that would trigger the Emergency Detention Program calling

for the arrest of Security Index subjects, are utilized as guidelines

in arriving at an answer to the essential question quoted above.

We have found that the Security Index criteria afford

practicable and workable assistance in arriving at a conclusion and

are sufficiently elastic so that when applied with the necessary judg-

ment the complex questions which arise can be resolved.

These criteria

well devised for this purpose.

They were not intended to be nor

can they or any other criteria be rigid rules since the ultimate point

to be determined is not whether a case fits a particular rule but

whether the subject of the case represents a danger.

The breadth of

these criteria is demonstrated by Criterion (D) which reads:

"Although

investigation has failed to establish overt acts or statements.on the

part of a subject within the time limits set out above, facts have been

developed which clearly and unmistakably depict the subject as a

dangerous individual who could be expected to commit acts inimical to

the national defense and public safety of the U. S. in time of emergency."

A copy of the security Index criteria is attacked as Exhibit A.

What we really need is a broadening of the factors which

must be considered in

evaluating an individual's dangerousness.

evaluating a security

case for the purpose of determining whether the

subject thereof falls within the Security Index criteria, Section 87D

CRITERIA FOR PLACING AND RETAINING

NAVES IN THE SECURITY INDEX

(A)

Subject has had membership or participation in the

activities of a basic revolutionary organization with-

in the last 5 years as shown by overt acts or state-

ments established through reliable sources, inform-

ants, or individuals.

(B) Subject has had membership or participation in the

adhere to the policies and doctrines of a revolu

tionary group, in a leadership capacity or by active

substantial participation in the furtherance of the

aims or purposes of the front organizations within

the last 3 years as shown by overt acts or state-

ments established through reliable sources, inform

ants, or individuals.

(C)

Investigation has developed information that an

individual, though not a member or a participant

in the activities of a subversive organization, has

anarchist or revolutionary beliefs and is likely to

seize upon the opportunity presented by a national

emergency to endanger the public safety as shown by

overt acts or statements within the last 3 years

established through reliable sources, informants,

or individuals.

(D)

Although investigation has failed to establish

overt acts or statements on the part of a sub-

ject within the time limits set out above, facts

have been developed which clearly and unmistakably

depict the subject as a dangerous individual who

could be expected to commit acts inimical to the

DETENTION OF COILUNISTS IN THE

EVENT OF SUDDEN DIFFICULTY WITH RUSSIA

Reference is made to your menorandun of July 18, 1946, which forarded

& memorandum to you dated July 11, 1946, fron fir. Theron I. Caudle, Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division.

KI. Caudle's menorandun was a reply to my memorandum to you of March 8,

1946, in wich It ras pointed out that very nearly all of the members of the

communist Party in this country are citizens of the united states, either

naturalized or native-born, and that nos, if not all, of those individuals

rould undoubtedly adhere to the Soviet Union in the event of a serious crisis

involving the United States and that country.

It vas suggested that you might desire to initiate a study to determine

what legislation 1s available or should be sought to authorize effective action

of a general and precautionary nature in the event of & serious emergency.

Fith regard to the adequacy of legislation, with which fir. Caudle'g

menorandum is primarily concerned, it is noted that except for the possibility

of a deciaration of nartial law which might have to extend over the entire

United States, thers is no existing legislation which could be invoked with

the exception of a possible application of 18 U.S. Code, Section 97a or the

suspension of the trit of habeas corpus.

It would, of course, be dangerous to the security of this country

As kir. Caudle pointed out in his nenorandum, nothing could be done

at the time of its writing looling toward new legislation until 1947 although

he points out that is sudden trouble develops during the adjoumuent of

Gongress, Section S7a could ba utilized until a special session of Congress

coula be convened.

I agree with r. Caudle that the next war will darf all previous

conflicts and bring into utilization ner weapons and bombing techniques.

The lack of effective legislation under which Federal authorities

and particularly the Federal Bureau of Investigation could swing into action

against adherents of the boviet Union in all parts of the United States at a

moment's notice might seriously jeopardize this country's recovery from the

it'st oriensive blow launched by the soviet union which logically and

miltarily might be directed at the Seat of Goverment in "ashington.

The confusion and disruption caused by bomb or rocket attack upon

Washington with the possible attendant casualties among the administrative

heads of the Covemment seens to point to the necessity for a definite pre

I strongly reconnend, first, that you consider the issuance of definite

and specific instructions as to procedure which shall be followed in the event

of an energency involving the United States and the Soviet Union and that those

Individuals responsible ior the carrying out of such procedure be appropriately

instructed without delay.

Secondly, I strongly recommend that appropriate

legislation to correct the present lack of statatory backing for detention of

persons dangerous to the security of the United States be inmediately prepared

for submission either to a special session of Congress which night be called

in the event of such an emergency or to the next regular session rhich will

convene in January, 1947.

SUBJECT: PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND DETENTION

OF PERSONS CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE

AND PÜBLIC SAFETY

OF THE UNITED STATES (DETPRO) /- GirL

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

SYNOPSIS: This

is to recommend obtaining Departmental approval

for amended criteria for individuals on Security Index (SI) and

to set up

Priority Apprehension Program based on dangerousness of

individuals on SI. Present criteria for SI include individuals

in basic revolutionary groups, front groups, anarchists, and those

with anarchistic tendencies.

Department has recently amended

definition of a dangerous person in new Presidential Emergency

Action Document 6, broadening it to include terrorists or persons

who

would interfere with Government operation and defense effort.

With Director's approval, conference was held with

Departmental representatives and in view of amended definition

of a dangerous person referred to above, a corresponding amend-

ment to Item D of SI criteria was agreed upon. (Set out in

details, page 7, and page 1 of memorandum to Mr. Yeagley) In

addition,

our study of the entire Energency Detention Program sug

gests desirability of alterations to set up priorities for

apprehension based on dangerousness of individual. Priorities

would include:

1) Priority I. Top national and state leadership of basic

subversive organizations,

leaders of

anarchistic groups, individ-

uals who have shown greatest propensity for violence, as well as

those who have special training in sabotage, espionage, guerrilla

warfare, etc.

Subversives in key defense facilities to be in-

cluded.

Present individuals designated Key Figures would, if

appropriate, be in this category.

Residences and employments will be verified each 3 months

reports submitted semiannually. 0I

REC 6/="-3

2) Priority II. Second level leadership and individuals

who present significant threat but are in less influential MAY 6

positions than Priority I.

Verification of residences and

employments each 6 months with submission of annual reports

as now reguired on majority of subjects.

3) Priority III. All other individuals on sI.

Made up

mainly of rank and file members.

Verification of residences and

employments to remain at 6 months with submission of reports

each 2 years.

4) Each priority will be broken down into nationalistic

tendencies and organizational affiliations so that apprehensions

can be made in each category on a selected basis.

5) Changes will not alter total number of individuals on

sI and not materially affect SI.

OBSERVATIONS:

Implementation of program will continue to require

authorization of Attorney General for any apprehensions.

priority

lists will streamline effectiveness of Program to allow us to

"zero in" on most dangerous and influential individuals and will

permit us to "lop off" top level immediately if Program implemen ied.

This should result in paralyzing organizations, and subjects wit

lesser priorities would lose top leadership and could be appre-

hended at later time, if necessary. Since SI made up principally

of rank and file, we will save approximately. 3, 500 reports per

year while at same time we will intensify coverage of those con-

sidered most dangerous.

This presents logical and workable program

while cutting back substantially on desirable but unnecessary

paper work and is in line with our continuing analysis to stream-

line by cutting out unnecessary requirements and retaining only

that which is absolutely essential.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached letter to Department setting forth above

proposals be forwarded.

Upon Department's approval,

appropriate

instructions and manual changes

will be sent to the field.

Memo for Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

DETAILS:

The responsibilities of the FBI with respect to

investigations in the internal security field have been

established by Presidential Directives.

The primary purpose of the investigation of sub-

versive individuals is to determine their identities and

activities and/or whether they present a serious threat to the

internal security of the country. It investigation develops

positive evidence indicating that an individual presents a

threat or potential threat to the internal security, his name

is included in the Security index.

The Security Index contains names of individuals who

should be considered for immediate apprehension and detention

in the event of a national emergency in order to safeguard the

internal security of the United States by preventing sabotage,

espionage, and insurrection.

10,000 names.

Additions and deletions are made when it is

determined that the individual either represents a threat or

no longer represents a threat.

A plan of action has been prepared to implement the

apprehension and detention of individuals listed in the Security

Index and for the seizure of specified contraband. This plan is

formally known as the "Program for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous

to the National Defense

and Public Safety of the United States." Details concerning

this plan are contained in

the Attorney General's Portfolio,

copies of which were originally furnished to this Bureau on

August 3, 1948. The proposed actions have been subject to con-

tinuous

study, and revisions have been made as needed. The

proposed actions under this plan will be implemented by Presi-

dential Proclamation through Presidential Emergency Action

Documents (PEAD). The PEADs provide for the arrest and detention

of all persons, citizens as well as aliens, who are considered

dangerous to the national defense and public safety and for the

seizure of property which there is a reason to believe may be

used to the detriment of national defense and public safety.

The results of our investigations are provided to

the Department of Justice on a continuing basis for its con-

currence and approval of the persons listed for apprehension.

RE: DETPRO

Detailed instructions are in the hands of all of our

field offices for the handling of this matter in the event we

are called upon to effect apprehensions of SI subjects.. Plans

are also in existence in seven field offices for the handling

of detainees on a temporary basis by the Army, and close

coordination is maintained between our offices and the military.

Departmental instructions from the Attorney General to United

States Attorneys, who will be the administrators of the program

following implementation, and to U. S. Marshals have been fur-

nished our offices at the Department's request for delivery to these

officials:

The Immigration and Naturalization Service is respon-

sible for the detention of alien enemies, and on a quarterly basis,

through the Department, the number of all aliens included on the

SI is furnished to them. This list is broken down by field office

and by sex.

The criteria for placing and retaining individuals was

approved by the Department on April 11, 1955. They are as

follows:

• A.

B.

c.

Membership or participation in the activities of a

basic revolutionary organization within the last 5

years as shown by overt acts or statements established

through reliable sources, informants or individuals.

Membership or participation in the affairs of one or

more front organizations, which adhere to the policies

and doctrines of a revolutionary group, in a leader-

ship capacity or by active substantial

participation

in the furtherance of the aims or purposes of the

Iront organizations within the last 3 years as shown

by overt acts or statements established through

reliable sources, informants, or individuals.

Investigation has developed information that an individual,

though not a member or a participant in the activities

of a subversive organization, has anarchist or revolu-

tionary beliefs and is likely to seize upon the opportunity

presented by a national emergancy to endanger the public

safety as shown by overt acts or statements within the

last 3 years established through reliable sources,

informants, or individuals.

Memo to Mr. W. C. Sullivan

RE: DETPRO

The above is an all encompassing definition of a

"dangerous person." This will extend the criteria for the.

Security Index.

During the conference of 4/22/68 with ISD, the definition

of a dangerous individual was discussed, and it was decided

that Item D of the si criteria should be expanded to include the

definition as stated in the new PEAD 6, It was also determined

that prior to implementing the EDP under the EDA additional

planning and prepositioning of necessary forms and documents

must be completed by the Department.

He are continually examining our procedures and policies

to eliminate everything except absolute essentials. We have

'made a study of the Priority Apprehension Program procedures to

insure that they are both current and meaningful. He also are

taking a hard look at the individuals on the si to justily their

retention.

With the emergence of the New Leit and the intensification

because of their anarchist tendencies do present a threat to the

internal security of the United States, it has become apparent

that these individuals warrant inclusion on the SI.

Many individuals on the SI, because of their violent

tendencies and their representation of the top leadership of sub-

versive organizations, are scheduled for priority apprehension.

The administrative procedures developed to make these apprehen-

Sions are referred to as the Detcon Program. In an all-out

emergency, all subjects whose names are in the sI will be con-

sidered for immediate apprehension.

Our study indicates the necessity for establishing new

priority apprehension procedures which will continue to be based

on potential dangerousness of the individual. Accordingly, the

following suggestions are being made:

I. That the Priority Apprehension Program be continued under

the code name Detcom; that the program be divided into

3 priority levels and be named separately.

2.

That the first priority apprehension list be entitled

Priority I.

This list should consist of hard core

national and state basic revolutionary organization

leaders and those leaders of other subversive organi-

zations and unorganized groups and individuals who have

RE: DETPRO

received special training in sabotage, espionage.

and or guerrilla warfare, If appropriate, individuals

employed in or having access to key and/or defense

facilities will be includea on this list. It is believed

that if these individuals are apprehended as scheduled

this will completely disrupt the subversive orgaizations

and should diminish possible actions by the remaining

membership. These individuals will be apprehended only

when the Attorney General announces that their immobili-

zation is in the best interests of the national defense

of

the United States.

3.

That a secondary priority list be entitled Priority II.

This group should consist of the second level leadership

of basic revolutionary organizations and other subversive

organizations or other individuals who present a signifi-

cant threat but are in less influential positions than

those in Priority I.

These individuals will be apprehended

only when the Attorney General announces that their immo-

bilization is in the best interests of the national defense

of the United States.

4.

That a third priority list be entitled Priority III.

This list

will consist of all other individuals who are

on the SI.

It will be made up mainly of rank and file

members of basic revolutionary organizations and other

subversive organizations,

as well as other individuals

whose activities warrant inclusion on the Sl. These

individuals will be apprehended only when the Attorney

General announces that their immobilization is in the

best interests of the national defense of the United States.

5. That Item D under the SI criteria be expanded to read:

"Although' investigation has failed to establish overt

acts or statements on the part of a subject within the

dangerous individual who could be expected to commit

acts inimical to the national defense and public safety

of the U. S. in time of emergency. Such acts could

include acts of terrorist he survival and erfective

or any inter-

6.

That certain individuals in the time of international

or national crisis, because of their nationalistic

tendencies, organizational affiliation, and/or anarchist

tendencies, will be apprehended on a selected basis.

All individuals on the si are tabbed as to theii

nationalistic tendencies or organizational affiliations.

•7.

That the residences and employments.of individuals on

the Priority I list be verified every 3 months instead

of every 6 months; that reports be submitted every 6

months.

8..

That the verification of residences and employments of

individuals on the Priority II list remain at 6 months;

that reports be submitted on an annual basis.

9.

That the verification of

residences and employments of

individuals on the Priority III list remain at 6 months;

that reports be submitted every 2 years.

10. That the category "Key Figure" be deleted, since it will

fit into Priority I; that the category "Top Functionary"

be continued.

Each individual case will continue to stand on its own,

and the decision to consider an individual for Priority apprehen-

sion will be based on his subversive activities and revolutionary

tendencies.

It is believed that the above suggestions will strengthen

our procedures in making priority apprehensions as well as con

serve agent time without damaging the caliber of security

investigations of individuals.

These changes will not alter

total number of individuals on the SI and will not materially

affect

it.

The establishment of priority lists will lend itself to

accomplishing the purpose of the sI.

We will be in a better

position to "zero in" on the nost dangerous individuals, and

this will permit intensification of investigations on them, should

it be necessary.

This will also set then up as prime targets

for immediate apprehension in a practical working vein. This

will enable us to "lop off" leadership of the subversive and

dangerous groups immediately.

Group activity will be paralyzed

by depriving them of leadership.

This will also tend to nullify

the total influence and activity of this type of organization.

RE: DETPRO

The nore strict procedure of verification of residences

and employments of every 3 months instead of 6 months for

Priority I list will greatly assist in maintaining knowledge of

the whereabouts of these individuals, which is as it should be.

The size of each Priority list cannot be determined

until a review of the SI has been completed.

It is estimated

that Priority I will be approximately 750-1000, Priority II

2,500, and Priority III, 7,000.

The SI is made up principally of rank and file members;

therefore, the greatest effect on our work will result from the

proposal jor Priority Ill.

The adoption of the proposals will result in the saving

of agent and clerical time both at SOG and in the field in

preparation and handling of approximately 3,500 reports a year.

The field will promptly report any unusual or important

changes concerning a subject.

This will also release agent investigative time to

concentrate on those individuals deemed more dangerous and at

the same time not lose control over lesser subjecte.

The field will continue to be required to know the

current whereabouts of all subjects.

It is believed that this program is logical and workable

and is in line with our continuing analysis to streamline our

work. We are substantially cutting back on desirable but

unnecessary paper work by cutting out unnecessary requirements.

It is believed these proposals will greatly improve the

efficiency of our work.

#408-10

"Delsom

SYNOPSIS:

Right

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend

that the Department be consulted regarding the removal of

Priority III subjects from the Security Index (SI).

This

would in no way mean a lessening of investigative attention

regarding individuals carried as Priority III SI subjects

but would mean concentrating our attention in areas most

essential to the internal security of the country.

These Priorities were established during the latter

part of April, 1968, as it was the Department's feeling that

all individuals on the SI would not be apprehended in the

event of a national emergency. Only those who are top leaders

of the various groups (Priority I) would currently be considered

for apprehension in the event of a national emergency with li /

follow-up consideration being given to

individuals in a

secondary leadership capacity (Priority II). Apprehension of

rank and file SI subjects (Priority III) is extremely remote.

Of the 10,786 individuals on the SI, 8,125 are in Priority Ill

These security subjects could be maintained on a subversive

index by the Bureau and in the event of an extreme national

emergency, this list would be available for whatever action

is deemed

necessary

by the President and the Attorney General.

The criteria for this subversive index would remain exactly the

same as for existing Priority III SI subjects. After the

initial

investigation in this category,

necessary. information could be

submitted by letterhead memorandum making the preparation of

investigative reports unnecessary.

This could result in consider-

able savings to the Bureau since routine investigation would not

be required after the initial investigation.

In addition, the

list is, in effect, already in existence and would require no

work to

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR

APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS. TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFITY OF THE UNITED STATES

DETAILS:

We constantly review our operations in the internal

security field in an effort to effect streamlining measures,

santay even tho

where possible, in order that the most effective use can be

made of the available manpower.

Under the existing moratorium

pertaining to routine Security Matter - Communist cases,

as

well as investigations of Priority II and Priority III SI

subjects, we are not at this time conducting our normal periodic

investigation of Priority III SI

subjects.

In an effort to further streamline security investi-

gations and to effectively utilize the manpower available, it

is believed that we should at this time consult the Department

regarding the necessity to continue Priority III designations

on the sI.

Priorities were established during the latter part

of April,

1968, as a result of conferences with the Department.

The establishment of these Priorities was confirmed by letter

to Assistant Attorney General J. Walter Yeagley dated May 1, 1968.

The establishment of Priority listings for SI subjects was

brought about by

the fact that there were at that time over

10,000 individuals on the SI, and it was the feeling of the

Department that all individuals on the SI should not be appre-

hended for detention in the event of a national emergency

requiring the implementation of the Emergency Detention Program.

The Priorities were established on the basis of leadership

capacity within the various organizations and groups.

Priority I was made up of all hard core national and state

basic revolutionary organization leaders and leaders of other

subversive organizations and unorganized groups and individuals

who indicated a propensity for violence and/or had received

specialized training in sabotage, espionage, and/or guerrilla

warfare.

Priority II was based on second level leadership and

Priority III was made up of all others on the SI, mainly rank

and file members of the various organizations and groups.

It has been the feeling of the Department that in

the event of a national emergency the Bureau will be authorized

to apprehend and detain only certain individuals in Priority I.

There are currently 712 individuals in Priority I of the SI..

meet

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

We could conceivably apprehend as little as 10 individuals

in this group or as many as the entire list of 712.

The

Department has indicated that individuals included in

Priority II of the SI may possibly be considered for appre-

hension and detention, but this would be secondary and:

would follow by at least a short period of time

any

apprehension of individuals in Priority I. It is doubtful

that instructions would be issued for the Bureau to apprehend

anyone in Priority III of the SI.

This is based on the theory,

which appears to be sound, that the immediate removal of leaders

would effectively paralyze the various organizations and thereby

remove considerable potential for acts inimical to the best

interests of the nation.

It is, therefore, believed that we can delete Priority

Ild from the actual si without in any way seriously affecting

the Emergency Detention Program:

This, by no means, indicates

a lessening of our vigilance

pertaining to security matters

and the responsibility of this Bureau to take necessary steps

to safeguard the internal security of this country. Although

these individuals would no longer be carried on the actual

SI, we would maintain their names on a subversive index which

would contain the same information as

does the SI. Investigations

would be initiated

on individuals concerning whom we receive

information of a subversive nature and an initial report would

be submitted much as we now do recommending that this individual

be included on this. subversive index or that no further investi-

gation be conducted based on the results of the investigation.

If the individual meets the criteria for being included on this

subversive index,

subsequent information could be submitted to

the Bureau by letterhead memorandum rather than an investigative

report which is the current practice regarding Priority III SI

subjects.

This would result in considerable savings to the

Bureau in investigative, Agent and stenographie time if and when

the current moratorium regarding certain phases of security

investigations is lifed.

As you are aware, the moratorium which was placed

into effect during March, 1969, affected investigations and

submission of reports regarding Priority II and Priority III

SI subjects and in addition, suspended routine Security Matter -

Communist investigations.

We are, therefore, in effect not

currently investigating these Priority III SI subjects nor

are reports being submitted concerning them based on the

moratorium. The removal of the Priority III subjects from

Memorandum to Mr. W.C. Sullivan

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND

DETENTION OF PERSONS CONSIDERED

POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS TO THE

NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC

SAFETY OF THE UNITED STATES

the SI will cause little or no effect on the current workload

at the Seat of Government or the field. It will greatly

assist the field once the moratorium is removed since the

field will be able to immediately initiate investigations in

the security field without having to bring up to date the

8,077 Priority III cases.

This step is also deemed necessary since the moratorium

on security investigations has actually resulted in an increase

in the total SI of over 500 cases.

The total listing on the SI

as of March 1, 1969, was 10,208, approximately 7,826 of whom

were Included in Priority 1ll.

The total SI as of October 15,

1969, was 10,786, approximately 8,125 of whom were Priority III.

A portion of this increase is directly attributable to the

moratorium since existing cases are not being periodically

reviewed for removal from the SI. A study has been made and

the increase in the over-all SI during the first six months of

the moratorium was 4.9 per cent. Since the moratorium has been

continued we can anticipate that the over-all Si will increase

by approximately an additional 5 per cent before March, 1970.

The rate of increase in the SI for a similar period

prior to the moratorium was at a rate of 0.72 per cent. This

level was maintained since we were constantly reviewing existing

SI cases

for deletion.

The deletion of Priority III subjects from the SI

will result in an efficiently organized SI that will be

completely workable, especially under emergency conditions.

It is noted that as of October 15, 1969, there were

8,125 individuals included in Priority III of the SI. If these

8,125 individuals were, in effect, removed from the SI, we

would have a remaining

SI totaling 2,661.*

We will continue to maintain Priority designation

on the SI and the standards for the Priority designation will

not be lessened to permit any widespread redesignation of

Priorities.

With the maintenance of the individuals currently

listed as Priority III SI subjects on the subversive index

a complete list would be available in the event the national

emergency deteriorated to such an extent as to warrant the

apprehension and detention of all individuals considered to

be subversive.

The criteria for this subversive index would remain

exactly the same as for existing Priority III SI subjects.

This

subversive index is, in effect, already set up and would

require little or no work to establish and would require much

less

work to maintain.

It is. believed that this proposal to remove all

Priority III subjects from the SI should be presented to the

Department for its views, comments and approval.

We will

indicate to the Department in submitting this proposal that

this does not mean a

lessening in our investigations in the

security field but merely means that rank and file members will

not be included on the actual SI.

There is attached an appropriate letter to

The Department by letter dated November 19, 1969

approved our proposal that Priority III Security Index (SI)

subjects be removed from the sI.

The Department also agreed

that-a listing of these Priority III subjects should be

maintained by the Bureau for possible action in the event of

a national emergency.

The Department issued no instructions

as to how

this listing would be maintained.

It will, therefoe,

be maintained for administrative purposes as a part of the

regular. SI but these Priority III subjects will be handled

strictly within the Bureau. The Department will continue to

make all decisions regarding Priorities I and II of the SI.

.*:

This nethod of handling Priority III subiects was

brought about by the Department's feeling that Priority IlI

.. subjects would not be apprehended in the event of a national

emergency.

The Department feels that only those individuals

in Priority I and possibly Priority II of the SI vould be

apprehended for detention in the event of a national emergency.

RE:

PROGRAM FOR APPREHENSION AND DETENTION

OF PERSONS CONSIDERED POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS

TO THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AND PUBLIC SAFETY

OF THE UNITED STATES

Cases on Priority III subjects will be reviewed

on an annual basis and verification of residence and

employment will be made at that time as is the current

practice.

The Bureau need be advised only in the event

changes are necessary. Such information may be submitted

by letterhead memoranda with regular submission of reports

being discontinued.

With the establishment of this means of handling

Priority

Ill subjects,

the maintenance of Reserve Index A

(RI-A) will be discontinued at the Bureau.

The RI-A will be

maintained strictly by each field division.

RI-A is made

up of individuals who do not meet the criteria

for the SI

but have had previous connections with subversive groups

and are in a position to influence others.,

Since the Department has not specifically

instructed the Bureau on the method of maintaining this

listing of Priority Ill subjects, it is not necessary

to advise the Department.

The administrative handling

of Priority III subjects is up to the Bureau and can most

logically be maintained administratively as a portion of

the SI with an inactive status.

This method of handling Priority III subjects

is in line with Mr. Tolson's desire to retain such individuals

on the sI but in an inactive status.

SECURITY

INDEX (SI)

AGITATOR INDEX

The report and verification requirements regarding SI

subjects have been changed with the approval of the Director and

an SAC Letter has been prepared in order to advise each field

division.

The SI consists of three priorities.

Reports pertaining

to individuals designated as Priority I of the SI will henceforth

be submitted on an annual basis. Such reports were previously sub-

mitted on a semiannual basis.

Verification of their residence and

employment will continue to be conducted every three months. The

verification of residence and employment of individuals designated

as Priority II and Priority III of the SI will henceforth be verified

on an annual basis. Such verification was previously handled o 1

No other changes are being made regarding sI.

Verification of residence and employment regarding subjects on

Agitator Index is also being changed to a yearly basis..

This was

previously done on a semiannual basis.

The field is being instructed that the reduction in the

frequency of reports for Priority I subjects and verification of

residence and employment of Priority II and Priority III subjects

should not be interpreted is meaning that security investigations

should be curtailed in any fashion. In addition, the field is being

reminded of its responsibility,

as well as the Bureau's responsibility

to be aware of the location of

Si subjects so that in the event a

national emergency arises requiring the implementation of the Emer-

gency Detention Program (EDP), SI subjects can be located for

apprehension and detention.

Each division is being instructed that

appropriate sources should be established to alert the Bureau in

the event an SI subject changes his residence and/or employment.

The establishment of such sources is vital in order that the Bureau's

responsibilities under the EDP can be fulfilled in the manner

expected.

ACTION:

That the attached letter to all Special Agents in Charge

be approved.

Appropriate manual changes are being prepared.

SECURITY INDEX

ut aras

The Security Index is designed for the purpose of

maintaining a list of individuals who should be apprehended

and incarcerated in the event of a national emergency, such

as an attack from abroad or internal revolt. Such individuals

must be proven to be a definite threat to the national security.

All additions to and deletions from the Security Index are

approved in each field division by the Special Agent in Charge

or his designated representative; are completely. reviewed by

Bureau supervisors who approve or reject the field recommendation;

and final approval is given by the Department. The Security

Index is based upon Iitle 2 01 the Internal Security Act of 1950

and is a part of the over-all Emergency Detention Program.

1968, we thoroughly revised investigative

procedures of

individuals on the security index by setting up

prioritiés.

and state leaders of basic revolutionary groups or other sub

versive organizations who have indicated propensity for violence.

Verification of their residence and employment is conducted every

three months and a report submitted every Stamantis.

This is in response to your request dated

May 33,

for the views of this Bureau on S. 1872, a bill to

repeal the Inergency Detention Act of 1950. It is felt

that this bill should not be adopted.

The Imergency Detention Act of 1950 serves as z

basis fos the Progzan for Apprehension and Detention of

Persons Considered Potentially Dangerous to the National

Dedense and Public Safety of the United States and che

Security Index, both of which are operated by this Bureau

under the direction of the Departuent.

The repeal of this

hct would renove the basis for these programs which could

seriously hauper the internal security of this nation in

the event of an extrene national energency.

The lav, as

it'stands, conting necessary safeguards for the rights of

the individual and limits. action of the U. S. Government

since the detention of each person under the

law nust be

• fully justified, and no mass arrests could be made merely

due to an individual's nationality or race. The protection

of this nation from potential saboteurs and espionage agents

is provided by this law, and It should certainly be con-

Einued.

Under the provisions of the Inergency Detention

Act, Individuals who have been trained by foreign powers

to carry out acis of sabotage, espionage and guerrilla

varfare would be detained prior to the commission of any

act detrimental to the internal security of the nation,

thus

preventing additional strife.

Individuals have been scheduled for detention who

the overthrow of this Government through force and violence,
