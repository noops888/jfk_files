Status of Operation Mongoose

Report to Policy Group, 11 April 1962

By Brig. Gen. Lansdale

We are in the fourth week of the Special Group's revised plan

for Operation Mongoose.

There are fifteen more weeks of Phase I,

which is essentially intelligence collection with low U.S. visibility.

Intelligence collection is reaching a point where the U.S. is

starting to get a firmer fix in detail on order of battle, the political

structure, the economy, and internal resistan

„groups. Our Center

in Miami processed 1, 309 refugees lagreek

The refugee debrief-

ing center

Is now in operation

The Department of State has no pojecuon to the

release or declassification of this document in full

Collection Act of 1992 (PL102-526)

Reviewed on

In the more dramatic sector, the infiltration of teams into Cuba,

CIA reports one team in place, a second team on the way, and two

more ready for next week.

The pace was adjusted to ensure that

really competent personnel go in. It should be noted that this is

only one sector of the collection effort inside Cuba. Again, I defer

to MI. McCone for details.

CIA has identified seven resistance organizations inside Cuba;

as realistically potential. A hard assessment, up close, is still to

come. Under the revised plan for Operation Mongoose, proposals

for supplying arms and equipment to these groups will be submitted

to the Special Group for decision, ad hoc. No proposals have been

.. roceived.

On political activities

State reports that the Cuban government

was made aware that a ded

"Tor the prisoners could be made, through

the Italian UN mission

Also, as reported in the press, a refugee

delegation is seeingethe

Cuban government, to negotiate a deal. State-

ments calling for a fair trial and humanitarian treatment of the pri-

soners were stimulated from 9 Western Hemisphere chiefs of state

or foreign ministers, and in an OAS council resolution.
