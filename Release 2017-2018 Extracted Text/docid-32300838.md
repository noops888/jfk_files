DIRECTOR, FBI (92-3267)

SAE, LOS ANGELES (92-113-€)

JOHN ROSELLI, aka

LA 4268-C advised that ROSSELLI was at the Friars

Club, Beverly Hills, California, during the afternoon on

28, 29, and 30, 1964.

On July 28, and 29, 1964, ROSSELLI

spent most of the time while at the club playing cards with

BEN WOHLSTAEDER.

On July 29th he was observed in a close

five minute conference with a member named MAXWELL RUDOLPH.

Source advised that ROSSELLI does not look well

physically and on July 30, 1964, arrived at the club at

about 5: 35 p.m. in a very intoxicated condition. He asked

IRVING J. LEFF, who was playing pool, to drive him home.

LEFF 1s a stockholder in the Hotel Last Frontier Corp. and

resides at the same apartment house as does ROSSELLI.

LEFF

told ROSSELLI to sit down and wait until LEFF finished his

game of pool. When LEFF finished, he and ROSSELLI left the

Friars Club together at 6:15 p.m.

In conversation with source, ROSSELLI stated that he

might have to go back to the hospital in Santa Barbara,

California, and have an operation performed on his stomach.
