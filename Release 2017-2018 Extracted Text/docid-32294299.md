The accounting fire of FERNANDEZ Y FERNANDEZ of

Marianao, Cuba, according to Dr.

LOPEZ, was the firn

that

had performed the accounting operations for the Sans

Souel Night Club up until 1958, at which time he vaguely

recalled some of the bookkeeping duties of this firm may

have been taken over by the Consultorio Fernandez.

This

was all that Dr. LOPEZ stated he knew of the accounting

operations of the Sans Souci.

Dr. LOPEZ advised he knows nothing about the

subject's present or future plans, stating he has had no

legal contact with the subject since subject's departure

from Cuba in 1959.

in theColumbia Restaurant a week ago, Saturday, at which

time he asked LONGO where SANTO was and LONGO said he was

in Miami. He has not seen TRAFFICANTE in a long time and

can furnish nothing further as to his location.

He last examined TRAFFICANTE on March 22, 1961,

ad gave hin a prescription which he knows he had filled

with MAX CASTRO in Miami.

He believes CASTRO's place is

called the Union Optical Co, and SANTO bad several pairs of

glasses made there. When asked why he would have

several

pairs, he said he likes a lot of different kinds of glasses,

some dark glasses,

some plain, some with bifocals, some

without the bifocals, pink glasses, etc. He said he had had

some contact lenses made when he was in Cuba and thinks he

had the examination for these made in Cuba.

He is near
