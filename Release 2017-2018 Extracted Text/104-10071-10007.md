Black Nationalist Writers in Paris

I. At present there dom not seem to be many black nationalist

(perican Negro) writers residing in Paris, apart from William

Gardner SMITH who is employed by Agence France Presse as editor

of its English language service, the latter is now at work on a book

about his summer trig to the United States and meetings with black

power and other civil rights activists there.

2. According to Carlene POLITE, American Negro writer living

in Paris who is of moderate views although she knows many black

nationalists bere, there are a couple of young Negro writers being

" handled by Ellen WRIGHT, white widow of the late Richard WRIGHT

(author of Native Son), who is now a literary agent at 20, rue Jacob, Pariso.

"3. Ellen WRIGHT's daughter Julia is married to a Frenchman

-named Fierve, and Julia is an editor of Jeune Afrique. The Herves lived

in Gbana along with the William Gardner SMITHS until the coup which

c overthrew Nkrumah. Ellen WRIGHT has another daughter who, accord-

ing to Carlene POLITE, was seen at a jazz concert on 7 January with

i won 31335. BIBBS, according to FOLITE, has written some pamphlets

which he has had published himself, as well as a poem or pamphlet

/attacking James BALDWIN as an inadequate leader of his people (whom

be characterizes as a homosexual). Julia Herve and her husband want

to publish BIBBs' work, according to POLITE.

Leroy HAYNES an American Negro about 56 years old has been

a resident of France for eighteen years and runs an American Negro

restaurant near Pigalle. HAYNES is mentioned in William Gardner

SMITH's last novel, The Stone Face. His restaurant is a meeting place

fo= all American Negroes who visit France. His guest book contains

"aignatures of the Martin Luther KING group and Stokely CARMICHAEL.

HAYNES gave a party for CARMICHAEL during his recent visit to Paris.

5.

Leroy HAXNES said that the writers he knows are Chester

-HIMES and Alex HALEY. According to HAYNES, HIMES is not known

for his nationalist views and now mainly an author of crime novels.

HILVES used to live in Paris but apparently lives in Copenhagen. Alex

HALEX is the author of The Autobiography of Malcolm X. HALEY has

been living in France temporarily (his address is 13, rue du Dr. M.

Provencal, Faut-de-Cagnes, Alpes-Maritimes), but will return to the

United States in February.

He recently traveled in Africa and claimed

to have traced his ancestry back to a particular African community,

according to HAYNES.

5. Another Negro writer living in Paris is Melvin Van PEEBLES:

who is also not particularly known for militancy. He has had 3 or 4

works of fiction published in France (in Erench) and has just made a

film, La Permission, which is being shown at a U.S. film festival

(possibly in San Francisco); Van PEEBLES went back to the USA for

this showing.
