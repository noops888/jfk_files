I. PREFACE

A. Purpose of Paper

This paper has been prepared to compare the results

of the 1967-68 interrogations of YURI NOSENKO with a CIA

paper dated February, 1968, entitled "The Examination of

the Bona Fides of a KGB Defector." This CIA paper was based

on previous interrogations of NOSENKO and concluded that

NOSENKO is not a bona fide defector

$ (4)

According to the paper, in arriving at this

conclusion the lengthy interrogations of NOSENKO, analysis

of KGB operations

which he related and comparison of his

assertions with collateral information from , ther sources

were considered.

B. Background

For convenience in assessing these papers, the

following chronology of events is set forth: (lU)

NOSENKO first made contact with CIA in Geneva in

June, 1962. After several meetings he returned to Russia

and was not again in contact with CIA until his return to

(U)

Geneva in January, 1964.. On his return to Geneva he indicated $

Significant inaccuracies were detected in the CIA

paper regarding the

(s)

and ABIDIAN cases.

Contrary to statements in the paper,

was not inter-

viewed about homosexual activities before he left Moscow;

did have contact with a girl at American House posing

as a

West German journalist; the Soviet maid TATYANA FEDOROVICH

did have access to ABIDIAN's living quarters within six months

after his arrival in Moscow.

COMMENT :

A number of previous CIA conclusions

regarding this period were based on deficient

interrogations of NOSENKO and inadequate

collateral inquiries. These conclusions have

been invalidated by current interrogation and

collateral Inquiries and there is no substan-

tial basis for doubting NOSENKO's basic claims

regarding this period.

is alleged that NOSENKO did not indicate the sources from

which he obtained the information regarding the cases.

4)

During current interrogation NOSENKO provided

sources

or logical explanation for his knowledge in sixteen of the

nineteen cases referred to above. He also provided adequate

clarification regarding three of the other five cases which

were subjects of CIA criticism. In addition a current review

of his notes by NOSENKO provided the translation "'ECTOR",

instead of "ACTOR"' or

previously obtained, as the

name of an agent. Collateral investigation has developed

a logical suspect by this name. (Logical suspects named

"ACTOR" or

5)

were not previously identified.)

COMMENT:

Previous interrogations of NOSENKO in

which information was not obtained regarding

the sources for these cases were obviously

Inadequate. Current interrogations have

provided significant clarifying information. Su)

I.

New Cases and New Information

The current interrogations of NOSENKO have developed

six new cases involving nine people which were previously not

uncovered during his interrogations. Collateral investigation

has identified six of these persons and one:

has been interviewed and admitted the allegations. This case

is considered significant corroboration of NOSENKO.

Additional significant data was developed on three

cases previously mentioned by NOSENKO. Data in one case (the

Brussels case) may assist in the identification of a KGB agent

who supplied NATO codes. * 4)

Considerable Interesting, new and confirmatory data

was obtained during the current interrogations. Twelve examples

are cited

4)

COMMENT:

The new cases, new information and

confirmatory data obtained in the current inter-

rogations and collateral inquiries also clearly

establish that the previous interrogations were

deficient and collateral inquiries inadequate.

Failure to acknowledge significance of NOSENKO's

personnel identifications and organizational data

denotes lack of objectivity in CIA paper.

In addition the "Characteristic" which was prepared

on him 1n early 1955 was critical of him and his

mother had

interceded with FETR FEDOTOV, Chief

that although NOSENKO could give a breakdown of the network

type of

not provide personality information on any of them

which he turned over to PHILLIP VASIIYEVICH KISLITSYN

when NOSENKO began work on military attaches.

He

had no opportunity to use "RAKETA"' in 1953.

"RAKETA"' was an agent for some officer of Section II,

the Soviet Union which NOSENKO did not report.

It was also stated that NOSENKO did not

have been NOSENKO's agent.

COMMENT:

response to a request, furnished a handwritten list

of his agents.. For the period 1953-54 he listed as

he indicated that this was the name of

first name was probably MARIYA but recognized DORA

stated that a driver for the military attache office

NOSENKO also pointed out that KGB obtained

considerable information from microphones concerning

operations and plans of the Military Attache personnel

including their discussions before trips, their plans

for visiting various cities and points of interest

and their. conversations after their trips.

In addition

KGB knew how much money they had each year for

other, etc.

It appears that NOSENKO's failure to recall

details of this incident could be due to his

hospitalization at the time it occurred.

said that the Sergeants of all of the services were

IRVING R. LEVINE and according to BELITSKIY was involved in

the sexual entrapment and KGB recruitment. of

Elt was stated that NOSENKO's apparent ignorance of

SHULGINA's Involvement with LEVINE and other Americans belled

his claim that she was his agent during the 1955-58 period.

It was also noted that in 1964 he failed to recognize her photo-

he was a homosexual, concluded he was a threat, after intercepting

it is noted therein that NOSENKO claimed SHAKHOV was not and

never had been a KGB officer.

stated that RASTVOROV had

NOSENKO was interviewed concerning SHAKHOV on

February 24, 1968, (N-108), and related that he was a

diplomat in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the

1930's and before that had worked for the Young

Communist League in leningrad. In the 1940's he

had worked for the Soviet "Embassy" in the USA and

was an FCD agent with the code name "RICHARD". In the

1950's KGB stopped work with him as an agent and put his

file in the archives. He participated in many meetings

and conferences relating to disarmament. In the late

1950's KGB started a "checking file" on him because

he was suspected of connections with American

Intelligence and there was a "signal" indicating

a connection with the American dipiomat

After NOSENKO's 1962 report regarding coverage in

Geneva, PETR IVANOVICH MASSYA was later sent to

Geneva with a delegation and also checked SHAKHOV

negatively.

NOSENKO commented that, although the file was

closed, any KGB officer who would be present at any

conference attended by SHAKHOV would be told to keep

_an eye on him. Also SHAKHOV would never be trusted (4)

Case is discussed.

NOSENKO claimed that:

visited the Soviet Union in 1958-59,-

was placed under KGB

surveillance, was observed in a Ministry

of Defense automobile and GRU later admitted to KGB he was of

interest to GRU.

Subsequently in 1962 while NOSENKO was reviewing

asserted that

had

no valid U. S. passport between 1940 and

June, 1961, and if he visited the Soviet Union during that

period it was not as an American tourist under his true name.

Consequently he could not then have been the tourist target of the

7th Department as

• NOSENKO claimed. If NOSENKO was mistaken and

was referring to

1961 visit he could not have noticed

his name while reviewing tourist lists because NOSENKO was in

the American Department at that time.

COMMENT:

This case has not been clarified but no

ulterior motive is seen in NOSENKO's insistence

that the first incident occurred in 1958-59, if it

were not true. His insistence can only raise

questions concerning the accuracy of his

recollections.

12. LEE HARVEY OSWALD U

On page 309 it is stated that NOSENKO's apparent

ignorance of LEE HARVEY OSWALD's communications wich the soviet

Embassy in Washington (in efforts to return to the USSR in 1963)

discredits his claim to complete knowledge of all aspects of che

KGB relationship with OSWALD.

COMMENT:

This matter has not been completely clarified

although NOSENKO's lack of cognizance of this matter

would not appear to seriously discredit him.

This case was referred to in notes brought

out by NOSENKO in 1964. FBI translated the

name in these notes as "EKIER." On December 8,

1967, (N-60), NOSENKO translated the name "ECTOR"

but acknowledged it could be "ACTOR." He related

that he had noted this name when a representative

of the ECD had complained to the 7th Department,

SCD, that this name had been included in a

communication sent by Intourist through the

open mails to various Soviet stations abroad.

F'CD was afraid its valuable agent would be

by GRYAZNOV. Investigation to identify this individual has

not been initiated but there is no reason to doubt the accuracy

of NOSENIO's information

On January 13 and 30, April 10, and August 1, 1968,

NOSENKO furnished information pertaining to this case. On

January 13 (N-97), he stated that ALEKSANDR STEPANOVICH MALYUGIN

was working with agent "AMICO" (PIETRO CECCHT), an Italian

cook working in Spaso House. He said that MALYUGIN had

another Italian agent who was working in the Argentine Embassy.

On January 30 (N-114), NOSENKO stated that MAÏYUGIN recruited

an Italian cook of the Argentine Embassy, a friend of PIETRO

CECCHT, in the late 1950's. About 1960 or the beginning of

1961 this agent left Moscow for New York to work as a cook

Chief of an Intourist Department, was also present. The meeting

was purely social and there was no recruitment attempt. On
