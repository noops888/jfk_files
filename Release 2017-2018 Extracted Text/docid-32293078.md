he is safe and well. According to RAND, the subject should

return to the United States

about October 1, 1959, if he

returns at the expiration of his present 20-day tour.

The

subject has in his possession his return air transportation

ticket to the United states.

RAND stated that although the

subject is still on their payroll, upon his return to the

United States he would be terminated.

RAND said that the subject has no knowledge of

RAND's connections with the United States Air Force, and the

subject was not utilized by RAND in any intelligence capacity

whatsoever.

The current city directory for East Cleveland,

Ohio, reflects a ROBERT WEBSTER, wife MARTHA WEBSTER, residing

at 15321 Welton Drive. No employment is listed in this

directory. On the basis of the information available as set

out above, the Cleveland files reflect no reference identi-

the die yeah. hon

Due to the basis on which

was contacted

and in view of the current connection

between

the Rand

Development Corporation and the United States Air Force, no

direct questioning concerning the solent was made mee

view with RAND and

and information furnished by them

was mere ay accepted.

If any of the information as furnished

by RAND and l

is disseminated outside the FBI, their

identities should be carefully concealed. The Cleveland

Division feels that further investigation of the subject is

warranted; however, no specific recommendations are being made

or leads set out at this time pending Bureau advice as to the

scope of investigation desired.

Since the subject is an

employee of the Rand Development Corporation at the Moscow

Fair and due to the connection between the Rand Company and
