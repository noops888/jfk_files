RE: WALTER HENRYK DUDA

105-111366

San Diego should endeavor to obtain copies of all

of subject's letters to Mrs. Stowe in order that the exact

statements of the subject and the pertinent dates will be

available for preparation of the eventual interview with

him. Some plausible reason for wanting this correspondence

can be given to Mrs. Stowe as for example that it may give

pe interesting insight into conditions in Poland during this

If he has been recruited, the subject is possibly

not yet operational but he may be communicating with his

principal in Poland through a mail drop in Poland.

Los Angeles should immediately submit its recommendation

regarding mail cover on subject. When subject is interviewed,

he should be questioned about his relatives and friends and

what reports he has received from them concerning

developments in Poland since his departure. If he fails to

volunteer intormation concerning one of his correspondents,

It may be an indication that this is his mail drop. (S)

It is noted that in a letter to Mrs. Stowe on

9/25/58 the subject stated that he was not a member of the

Polish Communist Party (PZPR), but admitted membership in

October, 1960, when applying for a U. S. visa. When the

Letter to Los Angeles

RE:

WALTER HENRYK DUDA

instigated the charges concerning cement production in order

to put pressure upon him; that in March, 1960, subject may have

agreed to cooperate with the fIS and that in April, 1960, the

charges were disposed of by dropping the serious charges,

sentencing him to six months on a minor charge and giving him two

years probation as a further hold over him. This reconstruction

of what may have happened is, of course, merely tentatives. (5)

Subject was reportedly in prison from April until

October, 1960, and

yet he wrote at least one letter to Mrs. Stowe

during this period. If he was not cooperating with the IS,

it seems unlikely that he would have been permitted to send a

letter from prison to a person in the U. S. with whom he was

negotiating to get out of Poland. (5)

On 10/22/61 subject stated the U. S. Embassy had asked

him to apply for Polish passports for himself and his family

and on 11/13/61 he said their passports had been obtained. Since

the normal waiting period for Polish passports is four months for

persons with clear records, it appears that there must have been

some intervention on his behalf in order for him to obtain these

passports so: quickly. (c)

The information developed thus far tends to indicate

that the subject is identical with the individual named by

CSNY 3581-S. The evidencing of anticommunist sympathies by the

subject since his arrival in the U. S. is merely what might be

expected of a recruited PIS agent.

This case may present,

therefore, an excellent opportunity to penetrate Polish

intelligence.

VFROM :Director, FBI (105-111366)

SUBJECT: WALTER HENRYK DUDA

IS - PO

Re San Diego report of 11/13/62.

The fact that Mrs. Gardner Stowe,who assisted

subject to come to the U. S., has retained all of his

letters to her may be very helpful in this case. It could

probably be presumed that the subject's correspondence was

examined at least on some occasions by the Polish Intelligence

Service (PIS). On 11/16/59 the subject mentioned in one of

his letters that it would be easy to get an entry permit

(into the U. S.) from Germany; his statements in this letter

may have indicated that he was considering an escape of

illegal departure from Poland and may have alerted the

PIS to take action concerning him. On 4/25/60 he was

sentenced by the Polish Court to six months' imprisonment

and two years' probation for producing substandard cement.

The investigation of the subject with respect to this

charge undoubtedly covered several week's preceding 4/25/60.

It will be recalled that CSNY 3581-S reported that subject

was recruited by the PIS about 3/20/60. It appears quite

possible that between November, 1959, and March, 1960, the

ET a may dave en

PIS may have studied his case; that the matter was brought

to a head when he received notice from the U. S. Embassy

in Warsaw on 3/2/60 that favorable action was anticipated

on his U. S. visa application; that the PIS thereupon

Reurlet 3-16-61.

The Bureau has no objection to your office conducting

a preliminary survey to determine the feasibility of establishing

a proper contact with the U. S. Postal Inspectors in Los Angeles

in connection with this matter. During this survey you will un-

doubtedly ascertain the volume of airmail going to various

countries from Los Angeles.

The Bureau does not desire at this time for you to make

any request to institute special type coverage.

In the past, any

coverage of this nature has required contact by the Bureau at

postal headquarters and postal authorities have been cooperative.

He recently requested and received approval for certain additional

special coverage and in view of this fact we do not desire to make

any additional request at this time.

Also for your information the Bureau contemplates dis-

cussing this type of coverage at the Internal Security-Espionage

Conference scheduled for way & and 9, 1961, which will be attended

by representatives of your office. Los Angeles is one of several

airmail facilities handling mail to foreign countries and it is an-

ticipated the results of your survey will be of interest to others

attending the conference. You are requested to conduct this survey

promptly and furnish the

results to the Bureau with any recom-

mendations you may have.

The New York Office has had considerable experience in

this field and may be in a position to offer suggestions should

special coverage of this nature be instituted by your office at a

later date; therefore, a copy of this letter is being designated

for the New York Office with a copy of referenced letter and a copy

of your letter to the Bureau submitting the results of your survey

should also be furnished New York.

On 4/15/64 Postal Inspector WILLIAM LANGSTON, Riverside,.

California, advised he had made arrangement with the mail carriers

who delivered mail to DUDA, 2002 7th St., Riverside, so that in

the event subject places mail on his own mail box to be picked

up, that the Postal Inspector will be advised. LANGSTON will in

turn advise the Squad 6 Agent who is in Riverside at that time.

LANGSION ascertained from the mail carrier that mail

had been delivered within the past week to another man at the

DUDA residence.

The mail carrier could not recall the name of

this individual but believed the name was Polish.

LANGSTON also advised that he would have available in

the near future a list of all mail boxes in Riverside with the

pickup times listed thereon.

In the event subject or subject's wife mail a letter in

any box, the Agent is to obtain the location of the box, check

the list for the next pickup time and call Postal Inspector

LANGSTON, who will then have a collection made of that box and

the mail

will be available in the office of the Postal Inspector.

Inspector LANGSTON also advised that for the time-

being the outgoing air mail which is dispatched approximately

11:55 a.m. Will be available sometime after 10:15 a.m. and

schedule, with one flight leaving at 11:30 AM, six days a

week, no flight on Wednesdays.

The mall for scandinavia carried by Irans world

Airlines and American Airlines 10 transferred at Idlewild,

New York, but is in sealed pouches and not reworked at that

point, merely transferred from one plane to another.

NK. STODDARD also furnished figures for the total AMF

dispatch for 4/4/61 broken down by major cities and countries

throughout the world.

This scnedule is not being set out in

this letter but is avallable in this file.

There is a constant flow of incoming mall at AMF,

being heaviest from

about 11:00 PM through the early morning

hours. AF starts "tying down" the mail an hour and a half

before flight departure time.

"Tying down" refers to the

final assembly into the sealed pouches, separated as to dest1-

nation,

destination) goes on constantly. AME tries to deliver the

sealed pouches to the air carriers thirty minutes prior to

flight departure but often the dellvery tine is meh closer to

departure time.

It is reconmended that at as early a date as practical,

the Burcau contact postal headquarters regarding this program.

When approval is received, this Office will certainly appreciate

recelving suggestions from the New York Office concerning the

operational details of the program.

For the time being, no further action is being taken

concerning this program by the los Angeles Office.

This examination is made for a twofold reason:

(1)

To identify persons corresponding with known

Soviet mail drops in Europe

(2)

To identify and locate individuals in the

United States sending letters to Europe which

may be part of a Soviet illegal network.

The latter purpose is accomplished through the knowledge

we have obtained

that illegal agents use certain signs in their

correspondence which can be detected from an examination of the

envelope. In one case a common name and city are used as a return

address

on the letters.

A street and a number are not used

this return address.

In two other cases, it was noted that an

Illegal agent used the same type of return address. Other signs

developed from investigations to date are:

(2)

The name and citybut not the street of a return

to take over space presently occupied by TW at the airport

for housing the foreign Unit. TUA expects to nove from the

present space to a new passenger service terminal some time

about November 1961.

If AMr is successful in getting the TWA

space,

the foraign Unit would probably remain at that location

for at least a year or two until a proposed new AMF building

is constructed.

Construction of the "Inspector"s Room" for Bureau

use will probably be completed at the present location during

the week of 9/25/61 and the survey can start operating soon

thereafter. The Bureau will be advised of the actual start of

the

Foreign Unit will move into the TWA space and a more permanent

SAM SURVEY

ESPIONADE - R

Reference is made to the watch Ilst concerning

Tokyo, Japan, and the address of TONGPREDSIVO NO. 12

shinryudo-cho, Azabu, kinato-ku, Tokyo.

During the two weeks that the Sam Survey has been

In operation in the Ios Angeles office, about ten letters have

been observed going to the above address, none of which were

addressed to TORGEREDSIVO. It appears that this address 1s

quite possibly that of a commercial building in tokyo and

that a number of other business concerns occupy space therein.

It is suggested that legat, Tokyo, either physically

observe the building directory at this address or through use

of a city directory, obtain the napes of all occupants of the

bullding, in order that Offices serving Tokyo mall can elininate

mall directed to business concerns other than TORGPREDSIVO.

Until such information 1s revived from lesal, Tokyo, the above

office will continue to survey all mail destined for

address.

421783 As the Bureau 15 aware,

these cases have Involved

Soviet espionage against targets In Southern Calffornia and

directed from the soviet Embassy in Menico City.

In the TORO Case upon instruction from the Soviet

principal there was an exchange of letters and post cards

between the Soviet and SD 852-s in 1955, 1955 and 1957- Some

of this mail originated in Mexico but in 1956 the Informant

directed a letter to his principal from san Diego, California.

In 1957 the informant sent a post card to his principal in

Mexico Olty from Arizona.

In the IAROB Case In 1957 the Soviet principal asked

MEX 87 to act as a mall drop for him and furnished the informant

with certain indicators to denote the mail was to be handed on

without opening to the Sovie.

Subsequently In 1959 MEX 87*s

brother, LA 4199-5, also agreed to act as a mall drop to forward

to Mexico City any mail received nich bore the indicators.

1958 the Soviet asked for the address of the mother-in-law of

NEX 87 In Mexico City and this was actually used by the soviet.

While lt 1s true the known mail received In this case on behalf

of the soviet principal in Mexico City has originated in Mexico,

truo the tho lotters in this case were Intra-United States mail

but GROVES apparently had some means of comminication with the

Soviet in Mexico CIty. The CROVES letter was chamfer-trapped.

Above instances indicate the Soviets heve for several

years considered the use of air mail as a means of communication

between the United States and Mexico City.

While It 15 historicully true the Soviers have used
