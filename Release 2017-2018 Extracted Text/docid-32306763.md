TOP ECHELON CRIMINAL

LA COSA NOSTRA

ANTI-RACKETERRING

It hasy previously been pointed out that one of

our primary goals in the Criminal Intelligence Program is

the full identification and subsequent prosecution of the

membership of la Cosa Nostra (LCH), the dominant group in

With an ever-increasing

publio awareness of the significance of LCH on a national

basis, and in consideration of the Bureau's heavy

responsibilities in the

field of organized erine,

it 1s

necessary that complete intelligence be developed regarding

LCH .

A substantial number of LCN members have been

identified by many offices, however, a review of monthly

airtole submitted by your office regarding acconplishments

the past ono-year period, the numbers of ICN members

identified within your division has decrensed fron sis to

five.

identifying LCH membors within your division.

To this end,

there must be a concontrated and imaginative effort to

penetrate ICk with nember-informants.

The significant

achievements by many offices in this field clearly establisheil

that an aggressive and vell-planned program will produce

concrete results.
