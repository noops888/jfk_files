ReBulet to New Orleans, 7/30/68.

On 8/27/68, a review of the morgue of the Laredo Times.

of the articles printed locally in connection with the trial of

the subject in Laredo in May 1968, failed to show any statements

made by the subject or any of his

ments by the subject in Mexico. It should be noted that the

Laredo Times is the only English language daily newspaper

printed in Laredo.

9/10/68, SA 496-C, a confidential source in

Mexico, advised that he read most of the

articles printed in

Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, newspapers concerning the subject and he

did not recall that any of them made any mention of any investa

ments in Mexico by the subject.

He. said that due to his

position in Mexico, he had

interest in the subject and

especially in any information which might reflect any invest-

ments by the subject in Mexico.

On 9/23/68, BARRY BROWNE, former reporter for the

Laredo Times, advised that he had

written most of the articles

for the Laredo Times concerning the subject while the subject

was in Laredo, Texas, on trial.

He could not recall any

articles in any local newspapers mentioning

the fact that the

subject had any investments in Mexico.

Portions of the article

in the 5/30/68, issue of La Prensa

newspaper were read to

him and he stated that about the only truth in the article was

that MARCELLO was on trial in Laredo.

Re LEGAT Mexico City letter 7/17/68.

Enclosed for New Orleans and San Antonio are

copies of referenced letter which are self-explanatory.

This letter requested investigation by the San Antonio

Office.

New Orleans should also review its files and

contact logical sources for any information indicating

Marcello to have investments in Mexico, or any contacts

or association with Bruno Paglial.

It is noted that San Diego may have informants

who can furnish information concerning Pagliai, particularly

SD 1064-C-TS.

New Orleans should set out appropriate leads

for San Diego to contact logical informants for any

information indicating association between Marcello

and

Pagliai, or that Pagliai's interests in Mexico were

funded by La Cosa Nostra.

NOTE: LEGAT Mexico City reports an article appeared in the

Mexico City Spanish language newspaper, "La Prensa," concerning

Marcello's recent trial in Laredo, Texas, for assaulting an FBI

Agent.

This article quoted Marcelloss attorney as stating

Marcello had investments in a firm in Mexico.

.. LEGAT advises this

firm to be largely controlled by Bruno Pagliai and his associates.

Pagliai is a naturalized Mexican citizen of Italian descent, who

has had gambling interests in Mexico in the past. He is the

husband of actress Merle Oberon and reputedly wealthy and politically

influential in Mexico.

Although "La Prensa" is considered leftist,

and

irresponsible, it's believed appropriate inquiry should be made

to determine whether Marcello may have interests in Mexico.
