The Honorable Robert G. Torricelli

Ranking Minority Member

Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere

Committee on International Relations

House of Representatives

Washington, D.C.. 20515

Dear Mr. Torricelli:

In response to your letter of February 28, 1995

regarding the whereabouts of Mr. Gilberto Lopez, we have

examined Agency records and have found no reference to his

activities after his departure from Mexico in November 1963.

With regard to the Cuban Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquin

Hernandez de Armas, our

information is that he remained

Cuba's Ambassador to Mexico.

He was recalled to Cuba in

July 1970 to attend the

ending of the sugar cane harvest.

Our records reflect that he died in Cuba in September 1972.

(S)

If you have any further questions, please do not

hesitate to call. (U)

Sincerely,

anne 0. Sake
