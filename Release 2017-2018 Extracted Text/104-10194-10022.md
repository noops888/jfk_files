INTS gir": HIdalgos health caused hin to be absent from his duties

several times during the first part of 1966

but these absences

were

for a limited period.

From my observation, his health has not

presented a serious problem to the performance of his duties.

Several

times during the absence of Mr. Tsikerdanos in the year

1966 Mr. Hidalgo was the acting desk officer.

His performance was

most satisfactory, and his supervision of the other desk employees,

albeit for a limited period, was fully satisfactory.
