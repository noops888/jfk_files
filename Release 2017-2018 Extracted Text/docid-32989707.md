RE: HOUSTUDY

Shaheen also said that he is presently. drafting a letter

to Chairman Pike concerning the request in the July 22 letter for

all. documerts furnished the Senate

Select Committee. He

said that

the Department is considering several alternative replies, one of

which is to suggest that Chairman Pike attempt to obtain these

materials from the Senate Select 'Committee.

In the meantime, he

Isaid, we should not attempt to comply with that request.

Later that afternoon, Mr. Hotis and Section Chiefs

Clyde Groover and Bill Cregar met with Shaheen and Steven

Blackhurst; Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

in an effort to determine the Department's position on these

requests

Shaheen said he felt that the letter of July 22,

setting forth a

general request for all documents provided

to.

the Senate Select Committee,

was 'superseded by. the July 2e

letter and does not require

a response.

Mr.. Blackhurst said

Field asked that we

give prompt attention to. Items C, D, E, F

(3 and 4); and & in

the July 28 letter. Field requested that

he be given access to this information prior to the hearings on

Thursday, August: 7:

It was pointed out that some of the infor-

mation,

such as informant payments. and the cost effectiveness of

the informant program, is impossible to retrieve. Shaheen said

that we should make a

good-faith effort to comply and if it was

not possible to. do so, we should discuss the matter with the Com-

mittee Staff. He also said that if the Staff Members go beyond

mere access and ask for delivery of such materials to.

the Commit-

tee, these requests must be submitted in writing by the Chairman.

With regard to the letter of July 30, Shaheen said the

Deputy. Attorney

General had instructed that' the materials re-

quested in the

first paragraph be furnished to the Committee as

soon as possible. These included: (1) the Spring Planning Call

submitted to the FBI by. the Department of Justice; (2) the Spring

• Planning Call response sent by the FBI to the Department; and (3)

the ten-year. budget charts indicating resource allocations.

The letter also requested a briefing by Mr. Groover on

budgetary matters. Shaheen said that if Staff Members inquire

about any particularly sensitive matters they should be töld to

submit their questions in writing.

It is possible that such in-

formation may. be made available to the Committee at a later time

in Executive 'Session, upon approval. by the Department.

Mr. Shaheen also said that we should attempt to furnish

all budgetary information already provided to GAO pursuant to.

its investigation for the House Judiciary Committee, but it is

not necessary to meet the August 6 deadline.

Memorandum Neudorfer to Decker

RE: HOUSTUDY

enclosed copies of this material for use in responding to the Committee.

It is felt that the three sections of the Manual of Instructions plus the

material that we furnished to the Department will suffice as a response

to the Committee on the Bureau's policies and procedures for developing

and paying informants.

With reference to category J, which covers the Committee's

request for information on all payments and breakdown thereof made to

persons outside the FBIwith respect to intelligence and counterintelligence

activities, the Computer Systems Division will not be able to respond

because such information is not available from the payment records that

we maintain. The payment documentation does not indicate whether a

particular payment to a person was for intelligence-and/or counterintelligence-

type activities. Any possible payment of this type made by our Field Divisions

would be included in the monthly report entitled, "Confidential Fund and

Informant Report" under the category of Miscellaneous Expenditures. It is

also possible that payments of this type could have been made by FBIHQ. In

order to accurately respond to this request, all miscellaneous expenditure

payments made by the Field Divisions as well as payments made by FBIHQ

covering the designated period of time would have to be manually searched

and compared with background material relating to the authority for such

payments. Since the Computer Systems Division does not have the

responsibility for authorizing confidential payments, this analysis therefore

would have to be made by the appropriate Investigative Division and the

Intelligence Division. If it becomes necessary to go to this extent in

responding to this category, the Voucher Unit of the Data Processing Section

would conduct the survey to locate all possible payment records that might be

involved and made such records available to the appropriate Division for

analysis purposes.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum with enclosures be forwarded to the

Administrative Division for their use in responding to the House Select

Committee.

CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1084 -D

DEFINITION

An indiridaal who furnishes valuable information within our

criminal

investigative jurisdiction or concerning other criminal matters of

interest to the Bureau

Bo

ILLUSTRATICN

This type informant includes members of the undermorld, those who closely

associate with criminals or have intimate knowledge

criminal activities.

Typical examples of such persons are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fences,

con men, hijackers, robbers, burglars, hoodlums, gangsters, and those

individuals who associate with or have knowiedge of such persons.

C.

The listing of an individual as an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether he or she can regularly furnish valuable criminal information.

In most instances an individual will be approved who has:

rurnished worthwhile information in two or more Bureau cases

Furnished worth-while information

in one Bureau case and better then

average informationirelating

to criminal intelligence investigations l

Furnished worth-while information in at least one Bureau case

one other state or local case which is acted

upon by the responsible

authorities so as to obtain corroboration o1 the. informant's redori

Furnished worthwhile information in at least one Bureau case and ji

one other Federal case which is acted upon by the interested federal

agency, so as to obtain corroboration of

the informant's report

DO DEVELOPMENT OF CRIMINAL INFORMANTS

1.

One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi-

fication of prospective criminal informants and the development of pros-

pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute

information to the Bureau.

20

Criminal informants are used to:

3.

4.

5,

6.

¿o iuvalo iugivires and winesses

Report cases we would not otherwise receive

¿. Report plans to cormit offenses

Advise of general criminal activities

Informants are developed from those no volunteer to be of assistance;

from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed during

investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi

tion to obtain worta-while information.

Their development frequently

requires patient, protracted effort to

find a basis for persuading

them to cooperate in furnishing information.

Care must be exercised in attempting to persuade individuals to act as

informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence.

An individual

who is in custody and wo offers to furnish information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any irmunity or any reduction in sertence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnises information

of value, his continuea

for services rendered

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to informants who

supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

the assistance.

Another. important factor in the initial problem of getting a potential

informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treatment

sometimes generated during the handling of a case.

Agents must be alert

to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize on

indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,

and should he be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his

background and associates, then affirmative action should be taken to re-

contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

Consideration should be given to the assignment of

specific projecis to

good informants, particularly those who have had little current opportunity

Information from informants of interest to another Government agency must

be furnished to that agency.

The too echelon criminal informant program is aimed specifically at developing

informants who can provide a continuous flon of quality criminal intelli-

throughout the nation.

It is directed at developing informants in the

following categories:

Informants who are

members of La Cosa

Nostra (LCN)

Informants who can furnish significant information

regarding other

organized criminal groups

Informants at the top level of organized

gambling activity who can

provide information

that will enable

the Bureau to effectively

extent of grait and corruption in each

sector of the

Informants ho can furnish information which will enable the Bureau

to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber

is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

This program calls for the selection of targets for development.

qualifications by virtue of

his position in the organized hoodlum element

and upon circumstances indicating his possible susceptibility to development.

PAYVENTS TO CONZIDENTIAL INFOSMANTS

-- The Bureau has received inquiries.

regarding the amount a Special Agent in Charge may approve paying an informant.

without prior Bureau authority.

You are advised you may approve payment, of an amount up to 950 to an

informant in a specific instance for information subnitted.

The blue slips

submitted for claiming these payments must clearly and adequately explain the

circunstances and sumnarize the information obtained so the Bureau will be in

a position to intelligently pass such slips for payment, receipts to be attached

wherever possible.

This does not change the present instructions that prior Bureau author-

ity nust be octained before paying an informant on a regular basis at a rate

exceeding $10 per nonth, but applies only to specific instances in wich it is

expedient or necessary to expend money to obtain information concerning matters

or persons under investigation which information is not othetirise obtainable.

This of course does not apply to expenditures for entertainment. You will be

held responsible to insure the Bureau receives full value for all the money

expended by you and such matters must receive your personal attention and ap-

proval.

(C) CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS -= Full coverage of all our investigative activities

must be maintained and the use of paid confidential informants

is necessary.

With-

out a constant and careful

check of the procuction of these paid informants, it is

possible that full value will not bo received for the services rendered.

You are instructed, therefore, to personally review all reports submitted

by paid confidential informants either National Defense or General Investigative

to be certain that they are providing information commensurate with the amount of

money being paid to them.

If it is determined after a personal check of each paid

confidential informant that the Bureau is not receiving an adequate return, pay-

ments snould be immediately discontinued and the Bureau advised. Likewise, if

you feel that any informant's compensation should be adjusted based upon a de-

crease of his activity, a summary should be furnished to the Bureau together rith

your recocrondations concerning a change in paymenu to him.

After you have completed this check of all paid confidential informants:.

you should continue to affora this matter your personal attention to insure the

Bureau at all times receiving a full return for any money paid to informants.

(D) "SECURITY INFORMANTS - CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS -- A sIt=

quation recently arose whereby an informant complained that he signed

receipts for money which he did not receive from the contacting

Agent.

It developed, that the Agent was in the habit of obtaining

a receipt for a specific Bureau-authorized amount, but if in the

opinion of the Agent the informant did not deserve the full amount,

only a part of the authorized sum would be furnished to the Informant

at the time the receipt was obtained.

The Agent would then deposit

to his own personal account the sum which he had not given to the

Informant with the Idea In mind of later furnishing to the informant

from his personal account an appropriate sum when he felt the

Informant deserved the additional money. As a result, confusion

arose as to whether the informant received the fully authorized sum.

Pay a chorized sum.

This type of operation, of course, results In lalsification

is a serious responsibility and all employees should exercise good

charged with the duty

of handling Government money, the rules and

I want each Special Agent in Charge to review carefully

the methods presently in operation in his Division concerning the

handling of the confidential fund, particularly as it relates to

informants, and make certain that disbursements and receipts are

being handled in the proper fashion.

In transmitting the receipts to the Bureau, they should

not be stapled to any other documents but should be enclosed in an

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there

were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning fu:

militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field

offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field.

The conferees were unanimous in their observation that

money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.

In view of this, they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be

given authority to expend up to S400 in the development of racial

informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

• may now expend on their own authority.

I concur with this recommendation of the conferees and

effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field

divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development

of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money

expended for informant development must be on a c.o.d. basis and full

value must be received in proportion to the amount of money expended.

Appropriate Manual change will be forthcoming.

(D) SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you

are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

the same amount each month with no variation in payments during

periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

incurred or both seldom, if ever, vary. . This practice must be

discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are

independent contractors remunerated on a C.O. D. basis, and they must

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary..

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration

at the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure

that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to

develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling security informants and

sourceS.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION

LETTERS-- Effective immediately justification letters for security

informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four

months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for

four months should be considered extended to six monts from the

effective date. Under item four, requiring a "summary of information

furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period, " you

should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or

information furnished is available only from that source. In the event

there is none, a specific statement to that effect should be set out.

As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to insure all expenditures for information

are on a c.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.

Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unwarranted

expenditures for the same incormation must not be approved. Good

judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforts

of established informants must be directed into areas where increased

'coverage is needed, such as the New Left and other radical subversive

groups. You must not be complacent with mere numbers but take

positive steps to insure your coverage of subversive groups is suf-

ficiently flexible to adequately meet the Bureau's responsibilities in this

constantly changing field.

Appropriate manual changes will follow.

(B) CRIMINAL INFORMANT PROGRAM -- It is incumbent upon each

SAC to insure that ail letters to the Bureau requesting authority to

make payments to criminal informants clearly reflect the value of

information or service received that will fully justify any payments..

Recently, the Bureau has noted too many instances where the

value of informant's information has not been adequately set forth

causing additional correspondence between the Bureau and the field.

• You must closely examine all future requests emanating from

your office to insure that adequate justification is provided the Bureau

in each and every instance.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS -- Section 107 .N, 2, of the Manual of

Instructions authorizes an SAC to make payments up to $200 to security

informants on a c.o.d. basis. Effective immediately, this authority is

increased to $400 in order to be uniform with the amounts availabie in

criminal and racial informant cases.

You are reminded that this increased authority in no way

lessens your responsibility to insure that payments are on a c.o.d.

basis and full value is received.

Appropriate manual and handbook changes are forthcoming.

(BI AUTOMOTIVE EQUIPMENT USEL IN SURVEILLANCES - You are

reminded ci the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

be sufficiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under

surveillances will recognize it as "policemen's equipment. " A limited

amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various oifices.

Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until

...procurement of sufficiently varied automotive equipment can be obtained.

you are authorized io make appropriate use of rental cauipment where

necessary: however. it is your responsibility to see that such rental

equipment is competely iustled. Whenever such use will be extensive

and the cost is estimated io exceed $100. brior Bureau authority must be

obtained ana may be obtainea on an expedite basis. You are reminded oi

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate iacilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware

informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are

reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,

services performed aid expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in field submissions to request special payments or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

.on personal needs cí the informant as distinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred. The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not

be influenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The

basic concept that the informant is selling information of value on a

c.o.d. basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an

employee must be.adhered to and understood by contacting Agents and

the informants.

This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-

iúrämon then a source of considerable poteniial value needs financial

inducement to engage in gathering of intormation under conditions which

will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and

hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and

present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ

and you will be held accountable to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources..

and sources have been routed to the Administrative Division for information.

order to exercise adequate control of the overall expenditures of the Bureau, 1

is necessary that the Administrative Division have an opportunity to review

confidential expenditures before final approval. This would include new

authorizations of payments to informants or sources; authorizations to increas

payments to regularly paid informants or sources; lump'sum or bonus paymer.

• to informants or sources; and any other unusual or special confidential

expenditures.

During the first nine months of fiscal year 1973, confidential

expanditares incresaed a total of S28e, 475, or 9.3%, when compared to the an

- period in fiscal year 1972. Like all other expenditures, confidential expendit

must be closely followed and controlled.

Since the Computer Systems Division is responsible for the recorr

keeping of confidential expenditures, copies of all authorizations for such

expenditures should continue to be sent to that Division but informational copir

of authorization memoranda for the Administrative Division are not necessary

RECOMMENDATION:

Dear Sir:

In connection irith expenditures of a confidential nature

•such experditures must be linitea strictly to investigative cases

of major importance iiterein monies nay be paiu to confidential

inforrants or for confidential purposes, reimburserent for which

could not be claired by regular personal service voucher nithout

jeopardizing the successiul completion of the investigation.

You are, therefore, advised that it will not be neces-

sary to continue

the retention of copies of confidential blue

slips in the various field division files.

The present field

blue slip files should be foriarded io the Washington head-

quariers of the

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disburserents being made by special agents for which reir

burserent is claired by blue slip that in many instances the

receip is executed in the name of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbarsement.

It is desired that nonever possible the receipt

oe made in the nare of the agent iho pays the bill and iho

will clain reimbursement.

It is understoca that in all

instances this mill noù se practical, for instance, if Agent

Smith rakes arrangements for the rental of an apartrent for

surveillance purposes and he is later transferred from this

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

Tho rays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per-

sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimburserent there-

for.

If the receipt is made out in the aâne of an alias

being used by the agent this caci should be explained in the

blue slip.

In those instances where payment is made to. an

iniornant for services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning ard ending of the period should be

indicated on the blue slin.

Inis matter should be brought to the attention of

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips

sibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they

conforn irith the above instructions.

Close attention to this

matter inll coviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

Very truly yours,

QUANTICO

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

Agents in Charge of abproving confiderivial expenditures which cay at some

time be subject to question.

The Bureau refers particularly to those ex-

penditures nade by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential inforeants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

inburse

certain Agents for expenditures made when it appeared that the ex-

penditures rade were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

information was concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a terdency

growing up in the field for Special

Agents in Charge to approve contidential

expenditures for l0g and l5% and other very minor arounts wnich probably

should be subject to further scrutiny by the Special Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditures zut sust insist that each Special Agent in Charge perschally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction.

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently being performed by a great rany Spacial Agents, certain

necessary. experditures must be made in connection with physical surveil-

lances and like maiters; horever, it shouid be undeistood that & Special

Agent, in so far as food and entertzinment are concerned, is under certain

RUDEFENSexpense at the present time,

evEn

though he is not assigned to confidential

surraillances and liken any charge is made for reimbursement for expendiura:

BUymade by him in connection with the successful handling of a surveillance

enco matter, only thet cortion of the charge which

would be over and abore his

horos regular living expenses should be subnittea.

For your intonation; the auca quat certity to all conticanta.

*expenditures as follows:

"The confidantial infornation ites as above was paid in the

interest of the Government service and that no other amount

has been vaid tofore for the same purpose, the amount repre-

senting expenditures incurred in making secret investigations

of alleged plots and conspiracies ageinst the united States

Government, and tnat the detailed information has been sub-

mitted and is now and will be heid in the confidential files

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will be open to

inspection for any purpose by the representative of the Corp-

troller Goneral at any time he may desire."

The Bureau fill continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reincursesent any confidential expenditure rhich does not ap-

pear to be fully and thoroughly justified.

The Bureau must, of course, in-

sist on

each Special Agent in Chargs making it his personal responsibility:

without delezation to other subordinate employees the review of confidential

expenditures:

to definitely ascertain that the expenditure has been proger

and that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bena-

fit and advantage to the Governnent.

PROVIDENCE

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

•of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

lund and the submission of monthly reports in connection thererith.

You are aware, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential

that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential fürd in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the cash balance on nand, plus disbursements nich

have been made during the current accounting period. •

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such nonthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurave

record upon the casis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be derinitely determined.

In this connection, a review of blue slip items received at

the Bureau over a geriod of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to 920.

At the time the monthly statement is subaitted by the field

office involved, such

statements invariably fail to indicato that the

experditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances-they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

+ =10

NW 55315 Docid: 32989707 Page 103

---

## Page 104

.==.

an accurate accounvirg on the part of the sureau

respect thereto.

For your guidance in the preparation o future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in mhich disoursements, zavances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent monthly statements prepared by

your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Spacial Agents have not been submitting receipts to justicy the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being clained through blue

slips.

For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

oicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been securea.

It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has- been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily avare of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, cue to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of

investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so. Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended iron the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and.

related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

iccordingly, it is

desired

that you forvard to the Bureau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the sureau's records.

Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by cach of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment. With

reference to future parchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate nor-expendable receiving slips.

Such slips should indi-

cate that the item vas purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted

and suspensions from the vouchers will be made in those instances

-where-fiold-offices-rail-to-submit non-expendable receiving slips.

WW 65315 DooId: 32989707 Page 104

Accordingly,

desired, that the non-expend

eceiving slips

• covering purch

o? furniture, bedding, and

her equipment by

blue slips, be attached to the voucher when it is submitted for .

payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected

that

in the future there will be

strict compliance

with the fore-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

Very truly yours,

an expenditure was made for the purpose of securing information relating to

matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other nanner.

In making such expenditures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

that repagment san be nade only in the event the curtification can lu incão diau

• the payment for such confidential information was made in the interest of the

Government Service, and that the amount paid represented expenditures incurrea

in making corfidential investigations of alleged plots or conspiracies against

the United States Government or for the purpose of securing confidential in-

formation pertaining to violations of the Federal Statutes which could not

otherwise have been secured. The information contained on the confidential

AND SUPERVISORS

RE:

FROM CONFIDERIAL, FUND

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

authority to the fiela offices to make expenditures from the field office

confidential fund. . When Bureau authority has been granted for an experditure

of this natize,

the field office is required to give such authorization on the

confidential item submitted to reclaim the expenciture.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expenditures. In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is noted that in many instances there

will be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. .

In the future when authorization is granted for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division rust be auvised.

In the field office is

frented authority by letter, a copy of the leiter must be rada for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517.

If authority is granted telephonically, it will be necessary

that the official or surervisor granting the authority notify the Administrative

Division by remorandim, giving the name of the person to nom payment is authorized

and the field office involved.

The above instructions are to be placeà into effect irmediately in order

to preclude the delay which is now being experierced in determining whether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices nare properly authorized.

RE: ACTIVITIES OF THE

CONFICENTIAL FUND

The Bureau is desirous at the present time of bringing to your attention

the absolute necessity for the careful handling of expenditures iron the con-

fidential Furd and the

subniesion oi nonthly roports in councotlun Shccinish.

You are aware that woder existing Bureau regulations it is absolutely

essential that an abpropriate staterent be submitied at the end of each month

reflecting the condition oi the Confidential Funà in each fleld office, including

therein its status with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus discursements

which have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to submit such

monthly steterents promptly, as a consequence of which it is becoming increasingly

difficult to properly audit the Bureau's records in connection therewith. As

set out in SAC Ietter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, ell Confidential Furd reports

should be received at the Bureau no later than the 20th of the following month.

• For your guidance in the preparation of future ronthly reports concern-

ing Confidential Fund expenditures, there is enclosed a sample for which outlines

briefly the proper method of preparing the report. In aadition, there is enclosed

a sample form which outlines the netrod which should be used to

summarize the

• payments to informenta and confidential sources. In this regard your attention

In directed to Section (A), SAC Letter No. 23, dated April 4, 1950, which is

retised in that the Atonio

it the to to me ty spe

shergy informants should be deleted iron the report.

The surmary should now reflect payments to Criminal and National Defense

Confidential Sources.

It has beel

oted that in a great number of

istances Special Agents

have not been sumitting receipts to justify the expenditures for which re

imbursements are being claired through blue slips.

The Bureau is awere of the

fact that receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to

exigencies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained therever rossible..

In connection with the preperation of the blue slips it has been

noted thai some are being prepared too euch in detail. In those instances. where

the payment 1s rede to an authorized reguler said informant, the followins

Intoration is sufficient to support the clair:

I, Amount of payment

2. Nare and symbol number of Informant

4.

Date of authorization letter or teletype

5. Period of rayment

A sample form reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip

is attached.

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming susperded blue slips, are reflecting in the voucher that the item was

suspended from a previous voucher. It is rointed out that no reference shovid

be made to the previous toucher nor showd the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Stetement of Difference with whe

Toucher.

Your attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of lunds available to operate the Corfidential Funds of the

field divisions, thereiore, you should make every elfort io operate on your

present fund.

It is cointed out that a more irequent submission of Confidential'

Fund vouchers will kely to naintair a higher balance in the fund.

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidentiai

Funa,

it will be necessary that the office furnish the Bureau full and complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlinod herein your

immediate personal attention and

supervision.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

FASHINGTON 25, D.C.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCCUNTING FROCEDURES -

FBI FORMI BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed bj the various field divisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from a revlew of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handiing

the operations of the confidential Funds maintained by the various

field divisions should be

established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accounting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that

wuild affect this fund are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from the informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning. balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund as the total amount to

be accounted for.

?.

A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

lutilized to reflect all cash transactions which afrect the total

fund.

This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two, which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained Indefi-

nitely and should

be used as the basis for the preparation of the

WW 55315. DocId: 32989707 Page 126

## Page 127

monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number

One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau. All payments made

to criminal Informants and sources should be reflected in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security inicrmants

or sources should be reflected in the column captioned "security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box: rental, etc. The

reflected

in the column captioned "Miscellaneous."

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment.was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.

• Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent Increases

should be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas any

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which •

must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the "Refunds" column.

Ilke-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau

should be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Two.)

In view of the foregoing,. you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, l.e., in either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column.

Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts

column, there

should be a

corresponding entry in one of the credit

columns, A.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts.from

Bureau column.

_ It is to be further noted that the totals of Column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "Sum-

mary of payments to Informants" 1ll connection with the monthly

report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the creaiit side of Column One from the

total of the debit side of this column.

•3. An Individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the ledger should be divided into hree parts; namely, Criminal,

Security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid

criminal confidential source.

The Security section should reflect

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

Bureau letter and the date of

the incoming letter when authorization

Is made by stamping "approved"

on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the field division requesting authority.

Before making

any disbursements from the Confidential

Fund to an informant, the authorization should be checkes

sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and

that the

period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization.:

These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau.

In connection

with SAC authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is. being made under authority of the SAc will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

•date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 should be removed from your form book and your supply

destroyed.

4.

After a careful review of the many suggestions received

In response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-

Ing funds from the Confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of

which is attached. You may print a supply of this form for use in.

your office.

•FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have

been approved for your office.

A copy of FD-235 is to be placed in

the FBI Form Book.

This form should be prepared in duplicate by

the Agent requesting

the funds, and after approval by the Agent

supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the SAC for his approval

before any disbursement is made from the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the sAc and

after the employee handling

the disbursements from the fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accordance with existing authority,

one copy of the

• form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file wich should be

divided Into two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ari a

vouchered file.

These forms can be used by the employee responsible

for disbursements from

the fund as the basis for preparing blue

slips for submission io the Bureau.

Of course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the

Informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and in

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the

Agent making the payment.

At the time the voucher is prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared

and retained in the accounts receivable file until reim-

bursement is made, by the Bureau.

At the time reimbursement is

received, the voucher should be

removed together with the attach-

ments and a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an item has

been suspended from the voucher and returned to the field office,

1t would be necessary to remove the Request for Funds form from

She voucher on which the blue silo was rtquested and returned to

the unvouchered file until such time as it 1s resubmitted or It 1s

determined It will not be resubmitted.

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential Fund is presently prepared

and submitted to the Bureau by the twentieth of the month folloring

the period auring which

the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested

and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it 1s felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five):

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under the direct supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent in Charge or a regularly

designated Field Supervisor.

The fund should be audited once each

six months, on June ju and December 31.

This audit shall be

personally performed by a Special Agent Accountant. The report oi

this audit shall be forwarded to the Bureau by the twentieth day of •

July and the twentieth day of January. In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and Inspection Division during a, regular inspection, the next

regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the special Agent

With regard to the summary. of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, it is desired to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

c.

The explanation should reflect the

name

and symbol number of the informant

as

well as the period covered by the payment and

in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund. to be accounted for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.aum. An example of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau. Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connection with the summary of payments to informants.

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion.

This breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them

should be Included under miscellaneous

expenditures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to: the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

proper review of the expenditures. Samples are attached

reflecting payments made to informants under bureau authority

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These samples

are general but should be used as a guide for preparing all blue

slips.

In addition to the attached samples, it 1s desired

that

the following, be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each

payment.

It is not desired to nave numercus

payments listed on a single blue slip in view

of

the possibility of error which would result

in the necessity. of suspending the entire blue

slip; whereas 1f

only one payment were listed

on the blue slip, lt would

be possible to re-

turn only the one item and the remaining items

could be processed for payment.•:

b. The authority must be clearly reflected

on the blue slip.

When authority is based on

the letter from the Bureau, actual date of the

Bureau letter shall be used as the date of the

authorization.

Then the field office, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

authorization has been granted in the form of a

copy of the field office letter returned by the

Bureau wich the Bureau approval

stamped thereon,

the date of the authorization in this instance

shall be the actual date of the rield office let-

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

C .

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body or the blue slip. Fon example, see

"Period"

_reflected in body of

Exhibit Number

Six.

• It 1s

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, both by time

and amount. Receipüs should be obtained whenever

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the refusal of the informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate notation should be reflected

on the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which 1s a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting receipt of money from the SAC 1s

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of

Seat

of Government employees to be judicious in authorizing expenditures

to be made and to practice proger economy.

For your Iniormation, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenalture and will trace

through the files information received and results obtained,

following the expensiture and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

In the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees Involved will reimburse the Government.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTICATION

July 8, 1954

FASHINGTON 25, D.C.

RE:

CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation oi

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau 1s now in receint of a suggestion which it

Is felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug-

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants.

It was suggested

that the

formants' files be checked and the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954, be entered on the informants' individual ledger pages.

This

would apply only to payments made under SAC authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will save considerable

cime and work in the iield: and ycu are accordingly instructed

to put It in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

very truly. yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

Ing: Items to your attention:

1, There has been a noticeable lack of receipts to suppari

blue slips.

Receipts should be obtained in every possible

instance.

2. Fallure to properly explain lack of receipts has been

noticed in numerous

instances.

If the informant refuses to execuis

the receipt, a statement to that effecü should be included on the ciue

slip.

Where it is not deemed advisable to obtain receipts for secur-

Ity reasons, this should be fully explained on the blue slIp: This

does not apply to blue slips reclaiming bank.charges.

3. All blue slips must show to whom the payment was actu

ally made and the city where the payment was actually made.

4. The receipt signed by the informant should reflect the

name of the person actually making payment. Any departure from this

should be fully explained on the blue slip.

5.. In the future where a symbol number has been assigned

ta the informant, only the symbol number should be reflected on tre

FD-221 und FD-22la forms; however, the name of the informont shall ta

reflected on the blue slip.

The new forms will be printed and placed in stock at the

Bureau. • As soon as they are avalluble, a suprly. will be sent to

In the preparation of future blue sllos, the

to:

The blue

the name used by the Informant in signing a receipt for

payment must be explained

or. the blue sllo.

When a name

other than the individual's full correct name 1s used in

Initial development as an informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue slip as soon as it is known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure 1s necessary to enable the

Bureau to property contrus payments and to make sure that

all payments to one Individual

are consolidated. It has

been noted in some Instances that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the individual's middle namè as & last

name.

This 1s especially true in connection with Spanish

names. Inis praculce leads to the possibility o1 carrying

& separate account of neyments under each name.

Make sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the

need. for

consistency.

In addition, where an informant or individual

Inow to have been formerly contacted by another division

Is bald by your division, the blue slip claiming reimburse-

ment should refer to the-fact that he is formerly from the

other division.

This is necessary to insure that the

Bureau's accounts of peyments are properly credited for

payments irade.

The Bureau has noted that in many Instances the

field Is not following instructions concerning the forward-

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-22la be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

"the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

F1-421 and intormant receipts. The matter concerning security ior

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security:
