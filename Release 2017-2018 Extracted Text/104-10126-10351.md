22. (Unclassified - DTC) LIAISON At the request of Kenneth Klein,

Assistant Deputy Chief Counsel, House Select Committee on Assassinations,

I accompanied Carroll Lucas, NPIC, and Allen Riggs, NPIC, to discuss

photographic enhancement techniques. Also present at the meeting

from the Select Committee were G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel

and Staff Director, and Jackie Hess, Deputy Chief/Research. A general,

unclassified discussion was held during which the NPIC engineers

gave advice to the Select Committee staffers on what firms in the private

sector could be of assistance to them in the general area of photography.

It was made clear to the Select Committee staff members that we would

be unable to provide them substantive assistance in this area.
