Enclosed for the Bureau are two copies of

Vilet to Chicago, 3/4/69, captioned as above,

which set

forth background information regarding an incident recently

reported by MI 623-C-TE concerning members of the Rockford,

Illinois, LCN family.

On 3/13/69, MI 623-C-TE furnished the following

information to SA DANIEL E. BRANDT:

The informant said that he went to Rockford,

Illinois, over the weekend of 3/1-2/69, for the purpose of

straightening out the incident involving JOE ROBERTS and

NICK GENTILE, which possibly involved the Rockford LCN

family. On 3/2/69, the informant met with FRANK BUSCEMI,

Underboss of the Rockford LCN family, and CHARLEY VINCE,

Rockford ICN member.

They both remarked about the recent

publicity involving members of the Kansas City LCN family,

who were served with Federal subpoenas to testify before a

Grand Jury in Florida as soon as they departed an airliner

in Miami, Florida.

They both commented that JOE ZAMMUTO

was in Florida at that time, and they hoped that ZAMMUTO

was not the victim of one of these subpoenas.

BUSCEMI made the statement that as of the present

time the entire Rockford, Illinois, ICN family is experiencing

a great deal of trouble.

The entire membership has been

forced to testify before a Federal

grand Jury, and that

they feel they will all have to go

to Chicago

to continue

their testimony before the Grand

and local authorities have been exerting tremendous pressure

onmny of the operations connected with the Rockford family

to the point where they are not able to make any move without

being under the scrutiny of the authorities.

In view of

this added pressure, BUSCEMI said he wants no incidents

to take place and was extremely upset at the possibility

that there was some possible "muscle action" being exerted

by JOE ROBERTS, in connection with NICK GENTILE.

BUSCEMI

said he wanted

this matter to be straightened out completely,

and that later on that same day he was arranging with informant

to meet personally with ROBERTS so that this problem could

be solved.

Before leaving, BUSCEMI told him that if JOE

MARINELLI should come to Milwaukee, the informant was to give

him nothing, show him no respect,

and make no effort. to

have any contact with him.

BUSCEMI gave no reason for his

instructions regarding MARINELLI, but the informant was of

the opinion that any individual who is treated in this manner

is in bad straits with the LCN family, and in many instances,

many individuals who received this type of treatment are

possibly set up for a "hit."

The informant commented the

possibility existed that MARINELLI may have been suspected

of talking to the Grand Jury about ICN matters.

Later that same day,

the informant was contacted

in Rockford by

KNOBBY GULOTTA, Rockford ICN family, and

JOE ROBERTS. It was evident to the informant that ROBERTS

and GULOTTA were working to gether in a house siding

operation.

The informant made it clear to GULOTTA and

ROBERTS that there was to be no muscle action upon instructions

of FRANK BUSCEMI.

ROBERTS and GULOTTA both agreed that they

would have nothing further to do with NICK GENTILE, and that

they would not create any incidents.

The informant said he received the impression

through the above meeting that everyone in the Rockford

ICN family is upset at the recent action of the Federal Grand

Jury in that the pressure exerted by the Federal and

local authorities has brought their gambling and other illegal

activities to a standstill in Rockford.

AS THIS MOST VALUABLE INFORMANT WAS DIRECTLY INVOLVED

IN THE RECEIVING OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION,

• UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES

SHOULD THIS INFORMATION BE DISSEMINATED OUTSIDE OF THE BUREAU

AS SUCH DISSEMINATION AND THE FACT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL FROM

MILWAUKEE WAS FURNISHING INFORMATION REGARDING THE ROCKFORD

LCN FAMILY WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF

THIS INFORMANT'S IDENTITY
