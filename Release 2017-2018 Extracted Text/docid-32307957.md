as well

Detroit LCN family.

He should be requested to comment

on the relationships and inter-relationships of any other

groups with which he may be acquainted.

4.

Any information which he may be able to

relate concerning any of these individuals which might

lead to possible prosecution.

With reference to FAT TONY RUGGIRELLO and

BIG LOUIS RUGGIRELLO, it is generally agreed that FAT TONY

is the sharpest of the four RUGGIRELLO brothers. BIG

LOUIE is, however, the

one most oiten referred to as being

actively

engaged in the numbers racket in Detroit. At

the time that the RUGGIRELLO brothers operated a bowling

alley, all four were connected with the bowling alley, and

JOSEPH, the oldest brother, and TODD, the youngest brother,

were the two most actively engaged in

this operation.

of ICN and is known to have been close to JOSEPH ZERILLI,

boss of the Detroit family.

With reference to the individuals on page 10

it is noted that ROUGH MANUEL BADALAMENTI lives in Monroe,

Michigan, and is a part of the old "Down River Gang"

, which

engaged in bootlegging on a large scale during

the

prohibition era.

He was close

to JOE

"'ONE EYE" TOCCO and

River Gangs.

JDE BARBARA,

JR., is the son of the JOE BARBARA

who was host at the notorious Apalachian Meeting

TONY D'ANNA and SAM PERRONE are both old-

time Detroit mobsters who received a great deal of national

publicity in connection with the Senator KEFAUER Committee

hearings. PERRONE was also the subject of a bombing attack

was given a great deal of national

publicity in this regard.

BLACK LED CELLURA and SAM FINAZZO are both old-

time members of the Priziola Group and were suspected of

handling narcotics for many years.

PAUL and PITER VITALE are both originally from

the Wyandotte Down River Gang. They are believed to be

MATTED VITALE of Wyandotte,

Michigan, who may have been related to SALVATORI VITALE

whom SD 1064-C-TE has previously furnished a great deal

of information.

the Detroit family in terms of commanding respect.

all members of

the Detroit family. One member, informant

has indicated that MELI is more important and stronger

than JOE ZERILLI.

San Diego is requested to question SD 1064-C-TE

concerning his knowledge of the early history of the Detroit

LCN family.

Numerous reports have been received

indicating

that JOE ZERILLI, who has been head of the Detroit family

for more than 40

years, was close to AL CAPONE in Chicago.

He also organized the

Detroit east side mobs in the gang

wars against the old Detroit Purple Gang and eliminated

or unified the Italian mobs in Detroit in the late 20's

and early 30's to become one of the wealthiest and strongest
