It is noted that HARRY COHN has denied that ROSELLI

was ever employed by him.

MUIR stated that BRYAN FOY (a movie producer) was

ROSELLI'S sponsor when he came out of the penitentiary, and

FOY and ROSELLI produced several pictures together and made

quite a bit of morey.

She added that ROSELLI is no longer in the picture

business and now has several concessions at las Vegas casinos.

She said he has had io give these concessions up since the

shake up of the Tropicana Hotel following the finding of a

casino "taice" on a slip of paper on FRANK COSTELLO when he was

shot.

MUIR could furnish no information as to why ROSELLI

could lose these concessions.

She said ROSELLI used to be mixed

up in a lot of things but had "gone straight" since his release

from prison.

Informant I-l advised on February 26, 1958 that he

first met ROSELLI in the office of WILLIE SHEAN at Twentieth

Century-Fox Studios in about 1932; that he was impressed at

the time because ROSELLI then had the reputation for being

a gangster and it was the informant's first impression of

meeting a gangster.

He knew nothing about ROSELLI'S

activities at that

time and knew him only very casually until

after the war, when he met ROSELLI again at Eagle Lion Studios

where informant, who was a writer, worked on some filus in

which ROSELLI had an interest.

Informant said that ROSELLI has frequently mentioned

and has stated

again.

Informant stated that in his opinion, ROSELLI is

"sex crazy"

that women play a very important part in his

life, and he is "always looking for women".

Informant said that he honestly believes that

ROSELLI has reformed in recent years; that he, informant,

knows nothing wrong concerning ROSELLI'S activities at the

present time.

He has never heard any information which

would indicate to him
