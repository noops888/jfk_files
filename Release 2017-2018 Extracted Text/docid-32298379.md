head of the Movimiento Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR),

held a press conference in Caracas, Venezuela. : ARTIME

stated that he had nothing new to say and no comment about

the possibility of new operations against Cuba, but he'

did claim it would take from one to three years to over-

throw FIDEL CASTRO, present Prime Minister of Cuba.

ARTIME said that the only practical measures

would be a series of commando raids against Cuba, and he still

felt it would take from one to three years to overthrow

CASTRO.

ARTIME said his group at that time had 8 training,

camps, however, he refused to reveal their whereabouts or

the number of men in training. He said some of the camps

were functioning without the knowledge of the local govern-

ments and in three different countries the exiles were

forced to close their camps when they were discovered.
