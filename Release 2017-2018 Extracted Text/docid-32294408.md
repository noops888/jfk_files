MUST NOT BE

DISSEMINATED OUTSIDE THE BUREAU IN

ORDER TO PROTECT THE LIFE OF THIS SOURCE

OF CONTINUING VALUE:

dissemination will be paraphrased and. set forth within

the body of Miami reports.

On August: 16; 1968, MM 1298-PC advised

that he had not personally contacted, SANTO TRAFFICANTE

for skin cancer which was causing him mental worry, and

also was the cause for his postponement of his trip to

Ecuadoria

Source stated TRAFFICANTE still intends to go

to Ecuador. soon:

On September 6, 1968, MM 1298-C-TE advised

that SANTO TRAFFICANTE, had töld EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL that'

he was concerned about a "leak" within his organization

but felt it did not involve his Cuban contacts in Miami,

which included EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and HUMBERTO TRUEBA

"ROJAS." This "leak!'' concerned information that the Cuban

associates did not know about.

Because of this "leak!

SANTO TRAFFICANTE refuses to meet personally either

with EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL Or HUMBERTO TRUEBA ROJAS and

has again postponed his trip and planned business venture

in Ecuador

LAZARO MILIAN DID,

associate of EVARISTO, GARCIA

VIDAL,

and fiance. of VIDAL's daughter, has stated that

he has been able to fix his recent bolita arrest bý

MM: 1298-C-TE advised

that LAZARO: MILIAN DID and GRISELLE GARCIA SARMIENTO

will be married in early October, 1968, and planned

upset" with EVARISTO

GARCIA VIDAL and feels that either EVARISTO GARCIA

VIDAL, his son, or LAZARO MILIAN DID are "informingi

to local law enforcement officials.

MM 1298-C-T furnished a photograph of

the proposed Hotel Continental with floor plan,

as:

well as financial arrangements required by the

Government of Ecuador for any foreign corporation

which intends to go into business in Ecuador.

This

hotel and gambling casino is the business which SANTO

TRAFFICANTE, HUMBERTO TRUEBA ROJAS, and EVARISTO GARCIA

VIDAL plan to negotiate in Ecuador

Source advised that the large bolita raid in

Key west the previous week-end by the Florida Bureau of

Law. Enforcement, which included the arrest of ARTEMIO

CRESPO and the impounding of over $100,000 in cash, was

part of the operation of HENRY TRAFFICANTE, brother of

SANTO, and controlled from Tampa, Florida.

that on Saturday evening, September 28, 1968, he received

motive for TRAFFICANTEs interest in Ecuador would be

narcotics traffic and that he was using the gambling

casino as a front. Source did not know who the other

persons would be at this meeting other than one of them

would be an American who would

come from Brazil

During the call TRAFFICANTE stated he did not

want to personally contact EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL Or

HUMBERTO TRUEBA ROJAS prior to going to Ecuador

to make this trip previously because of two cancer

operations on his face.

on October f, 1968, MM 1298-C-TE aavised that

suspects since they were not in possession of information
