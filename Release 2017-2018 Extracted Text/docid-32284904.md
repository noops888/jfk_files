Memo

- SAC

2/13/56

CONXDENTIAL

7. The addresses of the meetings set forth in the last para-

graph of page 15 and

in the first paragraph of pag√® 16 of

the referenced report was

the address of DI-2-s and DL-15-S.

For security reasons, the names and addresses of informants

have never been set forth by me in reports.

I do not be-

lieve it is good security to do this.

The address of the

meeting set forth in paragraph 4, page 8, of this report

was not furnished to the Dallas Office by the Oklahoma City

Office, possibly for the same reason.

The meeting set forth

left out, and every effort will be made in the future to see

that this does not reoccur. AD

SA JAMES P. HOSTY, JR.
