ADMINISTRATIVE:

Tampa has assumed origin in this matter under the

ORLANDO, FLORIDA, as it has not

on which Miami is origin.

The latter designation is added to

the title in this report for the sake of clarification, as

most of the information developed on the Orlando, Fla., group

appears to pertain to SNFE, Operation Alpha 66.

CIA advised the Bureau on 9/17/63 it had no

operational interest in the project mentioned at Orlando, Fla:,

concerning the T-6 military type aircraft purchased by Alpha 66

and its plans to ready

tris aircraft for possible raids againsth

a twice cally basis, operations and weather permitting.

They

also have intermittent

patrols every six days in mau o1 the

above) of other areas of the Bahamas, including Acros Island.

The numerous airstrips

throughout the Bahamas are spot checked

in connection with this plan.

Cutters and patrol boats also patrol the Cay Sal Bank,

Florida Keys, and Marquesa Keys.

Te SNE formerly utilized Williams Keys, northwest

of Andros faland, as a base.

There is an airstrip on this key

which the British plowed up in April, 1963,

but which may

now be usable.

Coast Guard Intelligence Office, Miami, had

no information regarding such a base.

on 10/10/63, TR 59+S furnished the identities of

the two"Americans' as DONALD SELIGMAN, of the Seligman Insurance

OF RANK JACKSON, But

Fla. and an individual who uses the alias

who has a completely different true name

which is unknown to the informant... Informant feared some type

of reprisal if it were revealed that he had identified these

two individuals.

For this reason, Tampa did not deem 1t

appropriate to disseminate the identity of the "Americans" at

this time, nor is it

deemed advisable to approach or interview

either one.

Case as been opened to obtain background through

usual sources.
