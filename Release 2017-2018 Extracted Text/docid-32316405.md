On March 19, 1958, DAVE OSTICCO, a known racketeer,

was interviewed by SA FREDERICK T. HOULIHAN and he advised that he

went to the home of JOSEPH BARBARA in Apalachin, NoTo, on November 14,

1957, accompanied by ANGELO SCIANDRA.

Philadelphia Confidential Informant I-12 advised SA FRANK

W. MULDERIG on March 28, 1958, that he is convinced the purpose of the

meeting on November I4, 1957, at the home of JOSEPH BARBARA was to

take control of the women's garment industry. He said that LEONARD BLANDINA,

who is a partner of ANGELO SCIANDRA in the S and B Machine Company,

which is located in the plant owned by ANGELO SCIANDRA in Pittston,

Pa., told him that this was the purpose of the meeting and further that

on other occasions he heard NICK ALAIMO and SAMMY DI BELIA, associates

of RUSSELL BUFALINO, discussing the purpose of the meeting and they

too in their conversation said that was the purpose of the meeting.

T-12 said that the only one who told him directly the purpose

of the meeting was LEONARD BLANDINA but on three other occasions he

overheard conversations between ALAIMO and DI BELLA indicating the

above was the purpose of the meeting.

Themmeeting was to include jobbers, manufacturers, truckers,

and others who would have only a financial interest in the industry.

The meeting was for the purpose of deciding what preparation or what

interest or what phase of the operation each would have when they took

control of the industry. He said they intend eventually to put

pressure on buyers to force them to buy garments from their group.

I-12 said that SCIANDRA and his associates in the Pittston

area intended to completely dominate the area from Binghamton, N.Y.,

to Buffalo, N.Yo, since they had insurance they would have garment

trucking rates from that area to New York City guaranteed to them.

It was their intention to use the plant of SCIANDRA for cutting and

distribution and any garment manufacturer in New York would be forced

to operate from SCIANDRA's plant.
