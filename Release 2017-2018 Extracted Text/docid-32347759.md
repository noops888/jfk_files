MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting with Gary Cornwell, Deputy Chief Counsel, House

Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

1. (S) On 19 May 1978, Messrs Sturbitts, DDO/LA Division, and

Shepanek, O/SA/DO/O, and the undersigned met with Mr. Gary Cornwell,

Deputy Chief Counsel, HSCA, to discuss aspects of the HSCA staff TDY to

Mexico City:

2. (S) As background, Mr. Cornwell indicated that the team was

investigating the Elena Garroide Paz reporting on Oswald's contacts outside

of the embassies while he was in Mexico City.

He further indicated that our

de Paz file begins to show reporting on Oswald in October 1965. COMMENT:

Reporting would have been received after the Warren Commission filed its

report.

3. (S) Mr. Sturbitts briefed on the results of our inquiries to Mexico

City Station regarding individuals of interest to the HSCA and on personalities.

and procedures for the team to contact our Station.

1. (S) Mr. Cornwell then discussed a further request for access to

additional individuals for interview purposes during the trip. The request

is attached. Mr. Sturbitts will review the files on the individuals and

advise of his recommendation. Also requested was access to selected

project files. As a review of these project files will require an extensive

effort, Mr. Cornwell was advised that a determination on access to these

files could not be completed prior to his Mexico City TDY. Mr. Cornwell

understood our problem and acknowledged that, given the circumstances,

the urgency of his request no longer applied.
