over the activities of her brother because their parents reside

In santiago de Cuba and are planning an imminent trip to Spain as

His actions she is

afraid, will jeopardise their parents position in Cuba. y

She also stated that she is concerned that DIEGO

his activities. Also her sister has recently called CISNEROS

about their parents' problens and her concern about DISGO's

activities.

She also requested that in any interview of members

of duke in Miani that her brother's name not be mentioned as

she furnished the information or else JURE offictals would

suspect he was an informant.&

Referenced Miani report reveals that in Decerber of

1963 FAY was interested in obtaining 500 to 1,000 pounds of

C-4 explosives and had funds available for the purchase. U

From Infornation available it appears probable that

JUnE has plans for an iuminent: raid on Cuba and that ABICH

had attempted to secure arus and explosives for JURE although

he appears to have abandoned this attempt stating they had

made other arrangements. U
