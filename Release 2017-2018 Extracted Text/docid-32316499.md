ENPLOYMENT

Until February 24, 1964; this informant was

employed full time as a trück unloader for the Beatty

Motor Express Conpany, Washington, Pa.,

and unloaded that

company's trucks making deliveries in the Pittsburgh

district.

He elected to do this type of work in order

to remain in and about Pittsburgh and exercised his

seniority in the Teamster's Union in order to gain it.

On February 24, 1964, the Interstate Comnerce Commission

put into effect. new regulations barring trucking companies

from furnishing helpers for the loading and unloading of

their trucks at the points of origin or destination

without charging the shipper for such services. As a

result of this, the amount of work available to informant

has been limited since that order went into

effect

So that in order to work regularly, he has had

to accept driving assignments and now works principally

as an over-the-road driver for Beatty Motor Express

Company.

When he does obtain unloading assignments, they

are for unusually early morning hours when he has little

contact with other workers.

LABOR MATTERS

On June 23, 1964, CI furnished current photographs

of 1l prominent, local Teanster Union officials which have

been retained in file for possible future use.

On September 24, 1964, Cl advised that Local 249

International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), Pittsburgh,

is voting on September 27, 1964, on the ratification of a

contract with A&P and that both the company and the union's

officials are obviously working to gain a favorable vote:

In this connection, source advised that James

Halbert,

Pittsburgh District Supervisor of Transportation

and. Warehousing for A&P, residence address 220 Orchard

Drive, Pittsburgh 35, Pa., has stated that negotiations

on a national level have been conducted in New York City

between the IBT

'and a labor consultant firm which is

representing the A&P. Two of the negotiators for the

A&P are a Mr. Avery and a Mr. Lewis. He stated that .

the labor/consultant firm is actually owned by

"Tony Pro

(Anthony, Rrovenzano, prominent New Jersey Teamster Union

official and that during the last

week of the "Hoffa trial in

"Chicago, Avery and Lewis were vacationing in Connecticut an

were summoned to New York where they met with "Tony Pro"

in regard to the pending negotiations.

From other sources, CI advised he has learned that

Jinny Hoffa, IBT President, desires ratification of the A&P contract

and, at the same time that Avery and Lewis were in New York

City, Tom Fagan, President of Local 249, was summoned to

Chicago where he met with Hoffa and an A&P representative fron

the East in connection with ways of obtaining the desired

ratification..

the obtaint

Subsequently, in the same connection, Fagan has

made

two trips to New York City without divulging their

purpose to anyone.

Fagan is most desirous of pleasing Hoffa

in this regard because Harry Tevis, Third International

Vice-President of the International

Brotherhood of Teamsters,

a Pittsburgh resident, is slated for removal from office by

either voluntary or involuntary means, and Fagan is the leading

contender to be his replacement.

The source stated that the current grocery

warehouse strike situation in California is the result of

rank and file rebellion inopposition to the new AP,

contract.

On October 5, 1964, CI advised thatat the time

Halbert mentioned the trip to New York by Avery and Lewis

he commented "We finally got around to fighting you guys with

of your own guys.

We got Tony Pro's boys working for

He does not recall that Halbert disclosed the name of

the labor consultant firm employed by.AiP, but described the

firm only as "Tony Pro's firm."

During subsequent contacts with

Halbert he has been unable to determine the identity of the

consultant firm.

CI advised that Hoffa is endeavoring to establish

a national contract, that he has achieved his

goal within

the "Central Conference," and is endeavoring to obtain a

similar contract in the East. The source explained that the

voting on September 27, 1964, by members of Local 249, related

to a national contract

in that a failure to approve the proposed

contract with A&P locally would result in their being subjected

to the terms of a national contract similar to the one negotiated

in other sections of the

country. Reportedly Fagan told members

of Teamsters Local 249 that if their negotiations on a

local contract with A&P at Pittsburgh were unsuccessful

they would be forced to accept the terms of amtional contract.

The implications to this CI were that ratification of a local

contract was essential because A&P would receive benefits resulting

in cancellation if its proposed transfer of distribution

facilities from Pittsburgh to Salem, Ohio. Under a national

contract these special advantages would not be granted to A&P

and therefore the firm would proceed with its plans to nove

out of Pittsburgh.

On October 15, 1964, CI advised that the President

of the Teamsters Local Union at Youngstown, onto, 1s an

known as

to be John

On about September 15, 1964, James Matoney, Business

Agent forTeamsters Local_635, Pittsburgh went to washington,

International,

the purpose of this meeting being to meet with

Hoffa on the labor agreement with A&P and

,to discuss the

effect it would have' on Local 635. At the meeting in

Washington a question arose concerning the moving of A&P

facilities to salem, On1o,

and Hoffa telephonically contacted Johnny

rather than Presser, and from the conversation

Angel raspired, Hotra acceded to Angelo In the asture d

seniority of the Youngstown men that would be transferred to

Salem, and it was decided that Pittsburgh men would gobehind

the last man from the Youngstown group in seniority status.

A week previous to this discussion in Washington,

James Matoney met with Hoffa alone and at that time Hoffa

did not concede

any seniority standing to the Pittsburgh

group.

CI advised that the above information was

obtained by him from Matoney and it is his, CI's,

onclusion that Hoffa had to conver with Johnny Angelo prior

to making concessions. ¡The CI advised that Angelo

been told that Angelo testified

against Presser in a previous

trial in which Presser was convicted and served time.

the Bureau developed no substantiating data regarding the

foregoing information derived by CI through Halbert. Further

inquiries at Pittsburgh, within limits set by the Bureau, also

failed in this regard.

Further action is not contenplated

until substantiation or further developments occur.

CRIMINAL MATTERS

CI advised on September 21, 1964, that on Friday.

evening,

September 18, 1964, he was at the Club Riviera, Route

51, and learned through mutual acquaintances that Don Flexo

(about whom Las Vegas had inquired as a bank robbery suspect),

was in the Pittsburgh areaand had just left the Riviera prior

to CI's arrival.

On the following evening, CI was at the same

location and noted the presence of Flex's girlfriend "Terry."

He did not see Flex.

Las Vegas was advised of the above:

On May 20, 1964, CI advised that Richard Thompson

a white mae, 32 years of age, living at 711 Eloise

Street,

Pittsburgh, Pa., and Frank Thompson, white male,' 22

years of age, 612 South Main Street, West End, are both employed

by the Beatty Trucking Company on a truck-lease basis.

Informant stated that the Thompsons are over-the-road drivers

but yet: in spité of this, on May 20,

1964, were making a

city delivery in violation of the union contract.

Informant

stated that he observed the Thompson brothers park their

tractor trailer near the Footlong Hotdog Restaurant and

watched them unload three carton boxes and deliver these

boxes to their residence at 711 Eloise Street.

Informant

stated that any city driver who has freight left over, must

return it to the terminal immediately, unless he is scheduled

Special Agent John S. Portella proceeded to the area

of the Footlong Hotdog Restaurant and verified what the

informant had furnished and learned that the three carton

Restaurant o

boxes contained Master, No. 1, 12-4 place setings of dishes,

Temperama Pattern with blue. Both of the Thompson's admitted

that these cartons were excess items and that they planned to return

them to the Beatty Trucking Company.

Special Agent John S. Portella contacted Jim McDonald,

Beatty Trucking Company, who advised that the dishes involved

in the three boxes in question all came from the Canonsburg, Pa.

area and were being shipped to the Thorofare Markets in the

Pittsburgh area.

He stated that all of the items on the truck

handled by the Thompson brothers were intrastate items.

McDonald stated that while it is company policy that overages

are to be returned immediately, he does not expect the

truckers to drive all the way from Pittsburgh to

Washington, Pa., to return three cartons when they can be

returned on their next trip to Washington, Pa., and that

he would contact the Thompsons and insure

that this was done.

The noted circumstances so strongly indicate that

the Thompsons were converting the dishes in question to their

the opinion

own purposes that it is the opinion of this office that the

information furnished by this CI insured the return of the two

cartons, valued at $50 each, to Beatty.

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the services of this

informant be continued.

It is recognized that his

productivity has been

limited, but this is a result of the

dislocation in his employment as described in the section

of this letter devoted to that matter, and an improvement in

this respect is anticipated. There has been no reason to

question the reliability of any information that the informant

has furnished and all experience with him has indicated that he

is reliable, cooperative, loyal and definitely interested in

rendering any service he might to the FBI. It is also noted

that under present circumstances, this CI's services

are on a cost-

free basis.

There has been no indication during any contact

with this informant of any degree of any emotional

instability.

Although formerly an abstainer, informant

has in the past months indulged to a temperate degree;

in the use of alcoholic beverages.

In fact, informant's

working hours and conditions preclude in temperance in
