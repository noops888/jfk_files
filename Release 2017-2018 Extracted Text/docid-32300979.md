At 10:45 a.m. of this date Mr. Walter Sheridan, Assistant

to the Attorney General, contacted office of Assistant Director Evans

concerning the captioned individual. Inasmuch as Bartone had previously

been subject of a Registration Act inquiry, Mr. Sheridan was recontacted

I1 a.I. today by SA R, D. Cotter of Nationalities Intelligence Section

to determine nature of his inguiry.

In summary, Sheridan advised that Bartone was convicted in

1959 on gun snuggling charge prosecuted by Customs; that he was

convicted, given five years suspended sentence and placed on probation

for that period; and that a hearing is scheduled to be held before

Federal Judge Ennett Choate at Miami on Thursday, 9/6/62, on a motion

brought by Government to have Bartone's probation revoked. Earlier

this year Bartone violated terms of his probation and, after warrant

was issued by U. $. Board of Parole, we opened parole violator case

which was closed when subject voluntarily surrendered to our Savannah

Office on 6/29/62.

"Sheridan said that he was contacted earlier this morning

by U, S. Customs agent Edward Ficke of Miami concerning this matter.

Ficke said that Customs agents at Miami have learned through a source

employed

as a reservations clerk at Northwest Airlines, Miami, that

Bartone is seeking to leave U. Se prior to thehearing on 9/6/62. In

fact, subject has asked this individual to arrange a flight for him

out of the country to some foreign country from which he could not be

extradited.

According to Sheridan, Ficke inquired as to whether FBI

would be able to undertake physical

surveillance of Bartone between

now and next week's hearing so that if he does attempt to leave

U. S. jurisdiction, he can be arrested. Ficke Indicated that Customs

does not have sufficient man power to

handle surveillance" but that

they might be able to control subject's daparture time and give us

advance notice through their source at Northwest Airlines.
