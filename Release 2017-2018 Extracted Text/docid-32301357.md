main report,

She was told nothing specific

but only that it was the

its contents, same old theme of the revistonists."

She asked about DOROTHY HEALY, member of the CPUSA National

Committee.

She mentioned that she met HEALY in Moscow some years

ago,

and she said HEALY and GIL GREEN were swinging from revisionism

to an outright rightist position.

She offered the comment that

HEALY waS

rom Hollywood and is a frustrated would-be movie

actress.

The conversation shifted to the PLP: The informant

had left PLP and she wanted to know where he

received this bit of information. He told her that solishe denied

in New York had mentioned her leaving PL some time ago

that she was ever a member of PLe, but admitted that she had

written articles for them and had spoke

in their behalf.(()

She admitted that she continues to be sympathetic to the

PLP, but was critical of their present line on Black Liberation,

the

working class in the uS,

and on youth. Her criticism on PL'S

Black Liberation line was that they do not understand the positive

aspects of nationalism; on the working class, she thought PL's

line too rigid in that it emphasized the industrial worker with

little thought to the general laboring masses; on the youth,

her criticisn was that PLP was unable to see anything progressive

in a youth movement which was not composed of workers!:

She

als

had before her a copy of the 2/69 issue of

PAd Hoc Bulletin}

which she had obviously gone over very carefully

informant dismissed this with the comment that this issue was

the product of "our youth section.!

The informant told of AHg Contacts with the Revolutionary

Union on the West coast:

He mentioned the name "Comrade LEIBEL"

several

times,. and she at one point interrupted him to inquire if

this is the comrade who was in China..

Inentormant answered ii

the affirmative.

He then told how the AHC had gotten some

answers

to some questions which the Chinese desired as a result

of a trip to Moscow, and at the direction of BERGMAN, a document

was turned over to the Chinese Embassy in Paris. She made no

renark at hearing this information.

The conversation turned again to PLe.

She asked why

Hoc is diaccustful of PLP

S/ The informant stated that pL's line

is no good:

pither are

"eir tactics.

He further stated that the membership

youth.

The informant told FRANK of the work of AHC!

that its main task at present was that of bringing together Blacks.

and Whites for unity of action in all areas possible. : He produced

a leaflet issued by the Black Panther Party of Chicago which

announced a demonstration of members of the BPP and SDS at the

U.S. Court House, Chicago on May 1, 1969 in support of Panther

leader, HUEY NEWTON.

He told her because AHC has youth in the

leadership of both the BPP and the SDS, this

Joint Black-White

action was possible

FRANK was most impressed and elated at

this development

FRANK was apologetic about her failure to come io

Chicago as

pronised.

She indicated that it was getting quite late

in the Spring

in the Fall.

The

informant asked her about SYDNEY RITTENBERG and

ANNA LOUISE STRONG.

She reported that RITTENBERG is no longer

under house arrest

and that STRONG was never detained as was once

reported.

Informant said he had heard she was very generous with

financial assistance to left organizations in this country and

mentioned that the BPP and SDS have received gifts of several

thousand. dollars from STRONG.

FRANK inacated that she was

aware of the gift to the Panthers and SDS (aU)

Throughout the meeting FRANK was cautious not to reveal

her contacts and activities.

The infornant believes that by

nature she is a suspicious person.

He does not think, however,

that she questions

the fact that AHC is anything other than what

it purports to be.(5)

During this contact the informant emphasized the role AHC

is playing both in the class struggles at home as a potential

channel for espionage for the Chicoms.

It is hoped that in her

contacts, FRANK will pass this information to contacts who are,
