INFORMATION CONCERNING

(INTERNAL, SECURITY)

REBe 24

There are enclosed for the Bureau two photostats

of material issued by the "Minutemen."

The material was

mailed in a double envelope on 2/13/64 at Norborn, Missouri.

The material was addressed to R. PAPRICE, 237 Pearl,

Denver, Colorado. PRICE is a source of information and his

- identity should be protected.

The Bureau's attention is called to the paragraphs

contained in the material that the "Minutemen" organiza-

tion is now the object of an intensive investigation and that

"Many (perhaps all) major FBI offices have received identical

memos from Washington to investigate Minutemen activities in

their areas."

It is assumed that the Kansas City Office has re-

ceived through its sources copies of this material.
