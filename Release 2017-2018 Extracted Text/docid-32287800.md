WEEKLY SUMMARY

MM 675-C on 5/2/62, advised he received info that

HAROLD SOLOMON has not been making any bail bonds for past

3 weeks; that SOLOMON's insurance company refused to insure

his bail bonds any longer; that Miami and Miami Beach authorities

will no longer accept any of SOLOMON's bail bonds, because

SOLOMON allegedly had $24,000.00 worth of estreatures in

Miami and $5,000.00 to $6,000.00 estreatures in Miami Beach.

It had previously been alleged that JOSEPH INDELICATO (Miami

file 92-404) has some interest and control in the activities

of the Harold Solomon Bail Bond business. He further advised

that SOLOMON is presently very active and on the payroll of

JACK M. TURNER, who is a candidate for the office of Circuit

Court Judge.

GEORGE LEBOWITZ, landlord of SOLOMON, advised

on 5/7/62, that SOLOMON told him that he had a

new insurance

company backing him and that he expects to continue in the

bail bond business at the same location.
