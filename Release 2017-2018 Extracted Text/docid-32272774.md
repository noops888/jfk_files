Dear Mr. Carpentier:

In connection with its investigation into the circum-

stances surrounding the death of President Kennedy, the Select

Committee on Assassinations requests access to all

files and

file references pertaining to the following individuals:

1) Edward Jay Epstein

2) Marvin Kantor

3) Charlotte Bustos

4) Annie Goodpasture.

In addition, please provide the Committee with access to

the following

information:

5) Any and all investigative reports prepared by E.

Howard Hunt pertaining to the John F. Kennedy assas-

sination.

(These reports were not necessarily pre-

pared during the period of Mr. Hunt's employment

with the CIA).

6)

The file

that was prepared by the CIA in reference to

E. Howard Hunt's alleged Watergate-related activities.

The Committee previously requested access to all CIA files

pertaining to E. Howard Hunt in its letter to you of January 6,

Roger Gabrielson, of your staff, has requested

that the particular requests identified above, be put in writing.

The Committee would also appreciate a response from the

CIA regarding the following matters:

The CIA's written statement replying to the Committee's

request

of February 21, 1978 for an explanation of the

criteria that governed

the opening of a 201 file dur-

ing the years 1958-64 was not responsive to our inquiry

because

the CIA's written statement did not focus on the

relevant time period.

Accordingly, I am renewing our

request of February 21, 1978.

In the event that there

were no criteria governing the opening of such

files

during that period, the Committee would appreciate a

written statement indicating that this was the case.

CIA document #563-810 indicates that there

are 37 docu-

ments that should be in Lee Harvey Oswald's 201 file

but which are missing from the file.

Furthermore, this

document also indicates that there should be a machine

listing of these documents attached as part of document

#563-810, but no such listing appears in the file.

The

Select Committee on Assassinations requests that the

CIA provide a listing of such documents as well as a

written explanation of where those documents are 10-

cated and

why they do not appear in Oswald's 201 file.

Pursuant to my letter of December 27, 1977, I would like

to note that the document referred to in this paragraph

is a classified document.

9)

both the documents contained in

the CIA's files on Priscilla Johnson McMillan and the

materials that were independently made available to her

under the Privacy Act, it is apparent that the files

which were made available to the Committee did not in-

clude HTLINGUAL materials. As the Committee has

already requested. all. information contained in your

files on the individuals who are the subjects of our

requests, please

review the files that you have pre-

viously made available to us for the purpose of ensur-

ing that all of the information pertaining to the

individuals involved has, in fact, been provided.

Finally, the Committee would like to interview all persons

who served as case officers in the Soviet Russian Division of

the CIA's Tokyo Station for the period 1963 through February

1964, as well as the Chief(s) of Station and Deputy Chief(s) of

Station

for that period.

The Committee requests that the CIA

or provide

their last known address

that

contact them

directly.

Thank you for your continuing cooperation.
