ADMINISTRATIVE:

The SAS of the FBI attended the public

meeting of the Monroe Defense Committee on 10/5/61 in NYC and

are ANTHONY E. CONSTANITNO and PHILIP H. SHERIDAN.

Concerning the attempt to identify RONALD GRAHAM,

who was called fron

the subject's

telephone on 5/19/61 at

telephone TH 1-7598. It is noted that he is the only

RONALD GRAHAM listed in this directory.

Background Investigation concerning this individual

developed that he is RONALD LEWIS GRAHAM, a WMA, born 10/31/35,

at Taft, California,

He is a graduate student at the University

of California, Berkeley, working toward his M,A. and Ph.D. in

Mathematics.

Indices of the San Francisco Division were

negative concerning him.

It is believed that when GIBSON made the call on

5/19/61, to RONALD GRAHAM, he was attempting to call RONALD

ARTHUR GRAHAM, who is the subject of SF 100-47554, and not

the above RONALD LEWIS GRAHAM.

alIFORNia

the person who

was at the 6/3/61 meeting

in San Francisco, of the Bay Area Fair Play for Cuba Committee,

which GIBSON addressed, and a later reception for GIBSON at

a private residence.

The informant advised that GIBSON resided

in Oakland with GRAHAM on the night of 6/3/6]., although GRAHAM;

did not appear to be well acquainted with GIBSON of the other

at these functions.
