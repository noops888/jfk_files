COSA NOSTRA

AR - CONSPIRACY

For intormation of the Bureau, daily contact

nas been maintained with LA 4440-C-TE since the death of

former Los Angeles La Cosa Nostra (LCN) "Boss" FRANK

DESIMONE on 8/4/67 relative to any change in the leader-

ship in the Los Angeles LCN "Brugad"

Informant advised that subsequent to the death

of DESIMONE, Los Angeles LCN "Under-Boss" NICK LICATA

has been in charge of the Los Angeles "Brugad" and will

remain in charge until a new "Boss" is selected.

Informant advised again on 8/30/67 that, to

his knowledge, no change in leadership has yet occurred.

Subsequent to

maintained contact with various other Los Angeles LCN

"members" and none of them are yet aware nor have they

been contacted relative to a change in leadership.

Informant and former ICN "Capo" JOSEPH GIAMMONA

have had several discussions recently relative to the

new leadership. GIAMMONA stated he is certain "Under-Boss"

NICK LICATA will attempt to line up support to have him-

self (LICATA) appointed "Boss"

GIAMMONA is opposed to

LICATA but would support "Capo" JOSEPH DIPPOLITO for this

as well as by LON "

LOUIS TOM DRAGNA, nephew of former Los Angeles LCN

JACK DRAGNA (deceased 1950) and son of former Los Angeles

ICN "Consiglieri" THOMAS F. DRAGNA. DRAGNA has some

scattered support in Los Angeles "Brugad", according to

LA 4448-C-TE, but informant doubted that such support was

adequate.

GIAMMONA told informant on night of 8/29/67 that

"Under-Boss" NICK LICATA had been in recent contact with

"Capos" ANGELO POLIZZI, JOSEPH DIPPOLITO and JOSEPH ADAMO.

GAMMONA then noted that LICATA holds considerable influence

"Capo" ANGELO POLIZZI. GIAMMONA then speculated that

LICATA would attempt to line up support of POLIZZI in his

bid for leadership. GIAMMONA stated he would not go along

with POLIZZI in such event.

Informant advised that neither GIANMONA, TRIPOLI

or informant have been in contact with "Capo" ANGELO POLIZZI

during about past ten days.

POLIZZI has not been to Villa

capra Kestaurant, Hollywood Park Race Track or Hollywood -

Roosevelt Hotel during this period -- places he frequents and

where contacts are made with him.

LA 4448-C-TE will continue to maintain his contacts

with Los Angeles ICN "members" and will immediately advise

interviewing Agents of any information he might develop

relative to new leadership of the Los Angeles ICN "Brugad"

The Los Angeles Office is following this matter

closely and will immediately advise the Bureau of any infor-

mation developed relative to new leadership of the Los

Angeles LCN "Brugad"
