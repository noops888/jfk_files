Cuban exile at Miami, had attempted at time of subject's

arrival in U.S. from Cuba, about end of 1962, to have

subject appear

for interview on radio program of Cuban

commentator JUAN AMADOR.

However, this plan did not

materialize, apparently because subject did not want such

interview.

Thereafter her whereabouts became unknown.

On 6/14/63, PSIC

stated she contacted the

•E RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO on 6/13/63, and ascertained that

the husband of subject was named LUIS COJIGAL.

PSI :did

not; however,.

determine the whereabouts of subject and

husband and believed this information was not currently

knöwn to RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO or wife

Records of INS, Miami, and the Cuban Refugee

Center, Miami, checked on 6/14/63, were negative on LUIS

COJIGAL:

These records were previously found negative

Miami will continue through PSI

.to develop

information leading to location and identity of subject

and husband.

If PSI is unproductive in this matter direct

interview of FRANCISCO RODRIGUEZ TAMAYO will be undertaken

but in a manner to protect PSI., To date interview of RODRIGUEZ

has been withheld to avoid compromising the PSI
