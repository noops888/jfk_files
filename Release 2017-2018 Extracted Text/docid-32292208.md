belleves that the floor show at the tropicana

Hotel will continue to have a greater drawing power 1f 1t

does not follow this trend.

LA I-5 stated that in June, 1958, the owners of

the Tropicana Hotel believed that Monte Proser Productions

was receiving too high a percentage of the total cost of

the show and tried to persuade Monte Proser Productions

to take a smaller amount; however, according to LA I-5,

•and /ROSSELLI damanded that the Tropicana Hotel live

up to its contract of giving Monte Proser Productions

ten per cent of the gross cost of the show and this

agreement is still in effect.

LA T-5 stated that the contract between the

Beverly Hilton Hotel and

Monte Proser Productions, Inc.

to stage a floor: show at the Beverly Hilton Hotel

will

be canceled because the Beverly Hilton has found that

the cost of the show

that JOHN ROSSELLI is still connected with this firm and

that he spends more time in los Angeles now than he previously

did. He stated this company had received two letters in
