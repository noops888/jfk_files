GARRETT then got into the car with the person he identified as

GARRISON. He stated that GARRISON then officially identified himself.

GARRISON then

began to ask him if he was acquainted with a number of

people, whose names GARRETT did not now recall. GARRETT did recall

one of

the names GARRISON mentioned to him, and he told GARRISON what he

knew about this person.

GARRETT stated that the name he did recognize was that of a

former supervisor of his by the name of DON THERION, who is a white male,

residing in Anahiem, California.

GARRETT described

THERION as being a

white male, retired U.S. Navy, a "gun-nut"

of President KENNEDY. GARRETT told him that he had not.

In addition to the above, GARRETT stated that once GARRISON

obtained the information he had concerning THERION, they discussed

the assassination itself.

During this discussion, GARRISON stated

that after LEE OSWALD had been shot and after he began to be interested

in the case, OSWALD's mother gave him a number of reports which she said

were written by her son, even though they were signed with aname other

than her son'so GARRISON stated that he has these reports, that he will

use them in the future and that they will prove beyond a doubt OSWALD

was working as an informant for the FBI.

GARRETT stated that the above was all that was discussed at this

meeting with GARRISON. After the conversation was termineted

he returned

to RAY's car and she drove him back to the Plantation Club.
