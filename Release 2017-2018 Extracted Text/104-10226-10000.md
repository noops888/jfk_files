Ambassador Thompson remarked that he had just

to turn him back to the Soviets.

At the point it was

several such turn-bucks havo buch made in the past

and this has been accupted by the soviets. Nubassador

Thonpson asked .why we

could not indict the man and try

his for espionage.

We explained that it nould bo dif-

ficule to prove

this even if ho vere to give us a full

confession since the only evidence would be his ovn word.

No are anxious to lourn the truth but are not

interested in a

trial or punishment for Nosenko.

• Ambassador Thompson

then said that the only aspect

of our planning which save him pause was the idea of re

turning the man to soviot custody.

He felt that we would

inevitably encounter criticism from the press if they

speculated the turn-back was in exchange for the releaso

of the thrue flyers.

This the Government would very nuch

wish io avoid.

Murphy showed Ambassador Thompson the

drafe press statement we had prepared by which me hoped

to mako clear that this was not an exchange of any type

but rolated solcly to the fraudulent character of the

Nosento defection.

This accompanied by additional news-

paper publicity would

serve to make. clear the real reasons

for Nosenko's return.

In a bricf aside with Nr. Davis, the discussion

an inconclusive dis-

cussion of then.

i'c igreed that the lotter which was to

sent to the Embassy nor should the Embassy become

involved

in this.

We'also

discussed the possibility of sending

other letter through regular mail channels to the vifo's

addiess.

He did not discuss what the Embassy was to say

if the wife called again and I feel I must go back to Mr.

Davis on this question.

Mr. illughes then asked if we vere sure we had
