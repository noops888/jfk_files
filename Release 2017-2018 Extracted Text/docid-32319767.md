He considers now, as he always has, that the specific,

direct and unequivocal promise of confidentiality that he

requested and received from the United States Government and the

Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) regarding his identity and

information which he may have provided to the FBI to be binding

forever. He firmly believes that his children, his grandchildren,

and his great-grandchildren could be subjected to physical harm

or embarrassment were his relationship with the FBI ever made a

matter of public record.. He has never told his children of his

relationship with the FBI, and would consider it devastating 1f

that relationship were to be made public in any way.

He has a clear recollection that when he first agreed

to become an FBI informant, he requested and was given a form to

sign which specifically and expressly promised and guaranteed

that his identity as an FBI informant would never be revealed by

the FBI, and that that promise extended beyond his death, but was

to be in

effect forever. He also clearly recalls conversations

that he had had with various FBI Agents who were assigned as his

contact Agent, in which that same promise and guarantee of

permanent confidentiality was repeated and emphasized. He would

hot have become an FBI informant without such an express promise

of confidentiality.

He expressly requested that his identity continue to be

protected for all time, and that any documents that would

Identify him, or tend to identify him as the source of that

information,

and furnished the following information:

She served as a confidential informant for the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for many years. As

a condition

precedent to her association with the FbI, and without which she

would not have agreed to serve as an informant, she recalls that

she signed a document in which the FBI promised and assured her

that her identity as

an informant would never be divulged, that

there were no exceptions to this guarantee, and that the promise

would extend beyond her death and would last for all time. This

promise was express and explicit and was not subject to

interpretation. Throughout her tenure as an FBI Informant,

discussed the confidential status of her relationship with the

FBI with each of the FBI Agents who were assigned as her contact

Agent. Each of these Agents affirmed the confidential nature of

her relationship with the FBI.

She has never told her children or closest friends of

her relationship with the FBI, would be personally devastated

should they ever learn of it, and believes that her family could

se put in grave physical danger in the event it were made public

that she was an FBI informant. She ensured that all contacts she

had with the FBI were conducted in such a manner that they would

be secret. She has never been identified as an informant, and

believes she has never even been suspected of being an FBI

informant.

She expressly requested that her identity continue to

be protected at all times, and

that any documents

that would

identify her, or tend to identify her as the source of that
