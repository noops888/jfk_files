On September 12, 1962, Captain RAYMOND WATERS, Texas

Rangers,

Lubbock, advised

he does not believe there has

been any

increase in gambling in the area around Lubbock during recent

years.

He said there have been a few permanent residents who

do nothing but gamble for a living, but the games are not regular

and are not held in any permanent location.

He continued that

gamblers hold card or dice games in hotel and motel rooms, and

occasionally in an office such as a cotton broker's office. He

said that usually a number of them will play with a very few

(sometimes only one) "pigeon." He stated it appears. that they

telephone "pigeons". and invite them to a game, giving the location,

and therefore it is not necessary for them to have a permanent

location.

He said he considered CECIL EUGENE HARRIS the most.

active local gambler and the only one who might be suspected

of having

bookmaking contacts in dallas or elsewhere.

DL T-16 advised on January 4, 1963, that he considered

BILL WATSON the most active gambler in

the Lubbock area at the

present time. He advised on February 25, 1962, that gambling in

Lubbock had been quiet and was mainly card and

dice games.
