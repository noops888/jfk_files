FCUM was in no way affiliated with the Traurig

Insurance Agency and to knowledge, FCUM

sold insurance

to companies, such as shrimp boat companies, who were

unable to secure insurance through American

Insurance

Companies. FCUM, through his son LEONARD, would contact

foreign insurance companies, names unknown, who would

underwrite any policy sold by FCUM.

Any business dealings that FCUM or his son,

LEONARD, may have had are unknown to him. LEONARD is

presently employed by the AOU, 1221 North La Salle St.,

Chicago, Ill., and he maintains a residence at 350

Oakdale Street, Apartment 1403, Chicago, Ill.

He does not know where the books and records

of FCUM might be retained but feels that LEONARD Would

know the location of such records.

Chicago locate and interview LEONARD TRAURIG,

owner and operator of the Florida Caribbean Underwriters

of Miami, in accordance with lead and instructions set

forth for Miami in referenced Bureau airtel.

For the information of the Bureau, prior to

contacting any established sources in Nassau, Bahamas,

concerning JOHN KEARNEY and Intercontinental Insurance

and surety Company, Miami, will hold this lead in abeyance

until such time as

the outstanding investigation in the

San Antonio and Chicago Offices is completed relative to

this phase of the investigation.

It is felt that Miami

this matter prior to any inquiry in Nassau.
