The 19 sembers of the group (list attached) side thetr way in

three fishing boats to Key best, florida, where they arrired during the

night of 25-26 January.

14. This Interrogation lasted from ten am to

one pe at which time

Gutlerrer Menoyo vas returned

so a detention cell in the Imigration head-

Q. Maurice Hunsaker was present during this laterriew. During

a break for lunch, Mr. Edward Ahrens, District Director, IalS, stated that

the members of the Menoyo group would have to be removed from the IGNs

building In Miami because he feared an attempt to remove Quierrez Menoyo

from the building might be made. Arrangements were made with the Coumanding

Officer, Homestead Airforce Base, to place the Cuban group under custody at

the Base until arrangements could be made for them to be fion co the IGNS

Detention Camp at McAllen, Texas.

15.

Therefore, It was agreed between various CIA representatives in the

area chat Hunsaker aided by Luis Rodriguez, ACSI representative, would

continue interrogating Gutierrez Menoyo during the afternoes.

The group would

then be taken to Homestead AFB after dark.

It was agreed thjt lunsaker and

Rodriguez would question subject in a friendly and pleasant zanner in order

to acquire as much information as possible from him so that discrepancies

In his story could be ascertained.

It was the consensus of all concerned

that subject was telling cosplete untruths, but that he was extremely skilled

in doing so.

16.

Consequently, Hunsaker and Rodriguez continued questioning subject

from two pm until five pm.

During this cim, subject maintained the general

continuity of the story he had expressed during the morning bours. Many

attempts were made to secure Order of Battle infornation, panes of military

officials, sympathies of naped officials, plans of the Segundo Frente or of

the Government of Cuba.

Subject pretended ignorance of all chese subjects.

He maintained that because he was not trusted by Castro be had not been

allowed

access to any

military bases for the last two years.

Because of

the numerous personnel changes he did not know the names of cificials in

important posts, etc.

By this time it became evident that firmer measures

of interrogation would be required,

and it was planned that coatinuous

Interrogation and a polygraph would be employed on subject after arrival at

Homestead Airforce Base.

17. However, a sudden change of plans occurred and shorily after five pa

the entire group of Cubans was whisked to the airport and put aboard a chartered

plane for New Orleans.

At. New Orleans they were to be transferred to another

plane for passage to McAllen Detention Camp. No further tacerrogation of

subject was possible.

18. Eloy Gutierrer Menoyo is an Intelligent and capable man. He did not

give up a shred of useful Information in alx hours of interrogation.

once gave any indication of nervousness and was cool, calm, and collected at

every soment. He pursued his story carefully and correctly, never gọt mixed

In his details, and alchough his explanations of many things, in particular

his lack of occupation the last tuo yeara, were completely unbellevable, he

did such an excellent job of discussing the situation chat he sounded plausible. .

19. It 1s the opinion of lunsaker that this man will not divulge information

under normal interrogating techniques.

It appears evident that he hes a great

dmiration for himselt, ho feels he is & great man doing & great job--regardlesa

of. what he considers that job to be at the moment-and could not be shaken by

ordinary means of persuasion. Subject is an extremely handsome young man, and

1c la obvious that he is proud of his good looka.. It is the opinion of some

of the nen who have interrogated him that the weakest spot in bis armor would •

be a threat to mar his good looks.

The threat of a good solid poke in the nose

nighe have considerable ellect upon subject'e willingness to calk.
