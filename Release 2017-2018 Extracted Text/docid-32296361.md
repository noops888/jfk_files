Re New York quarterly informant report captioned

"NY 4336-C-TT" and dated Novenber 1, 1964.

Referenced quarterly report includes informition

from N7 4336-C-TS that, in view of the trouble between the

Bonanno "fanily" and other La Cosa Nostra "families," one

"Chichu Garofano" had been sumoned fron Italy to function

arbitrator

this dispute.

New York should consider the possibility that the

above individual referred to by NY 4336-C-75 may be identical

with Frank Garofalo, forner "underboss? of the Bonanno

"family," who returned to Italy Shortly arter the palachin

meeting

In November, 1957.

You Should make appropriate

inquiry at INS to deternine if Carofalo has recently returned

to this country, or may be planning such a return.

Keep the Bureau advised of developments in this

matter in view of the major importance of the Bonanno

"tanily's" dispute with other La Cosa Nostra groups.
