2. MARTINEZ SAID THAT THE EMBASSY BELIEVES BOSCH HAS BEEN

RECEIVING ECONOMIC AND OTHER ASSISTANCE FROM THE UNITED STATES

• GOVERNMENT (USG), VIA ITS INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES, SINCE BOSCH IS

ABLE TO MOVE ABOUT FREELY AND OBVIOUSLY WITH FALSE DOCUMENTATION,

AS HIS MOVEMENTS CANNOT BE TRACED. HOWEVER, MARTINEZ SAID THAT THE

CUBANS DO NOT BELIEVE THE USG IS OR WOULD BE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN

THE BOMBING OF THE CUBANA FLIGHT. USG INVOLVEMENT IN THE INCIDENT,

MARTINEZ SAID, WOULD BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO THE USG 'S INTERESTS

Cuba

BECAUSE CUBAN PRIME MINISTER FIDELE AS I ROX RUZ WOULD SURELY

BREAK THE AIR PIRACY AGREEMENT, WHICH IS TO THE BENFIT OF THE USG.

3. THE CUBANS, MARTINEZ SAID, ARE CONCERNED ABOUT APPARENT

CONNECTIONS BETWEEN BOSCH AND CUBAN EXILES WORKING FOR THE CAPRILES

PUBLISHING CHAIN IN VENEZUELA. SHOULD FREDD* XL UG O, ONE OF THE

TWO VENEZUELANS CURRENTLY UNDER DETENTION IN TRINIDAD IN CONNECTION
