Criminal Division

SUBJECT: United States 7. Bonanno

Reference is made to your memorandum of October 19, 1959,

replying to a letter of October 6, 1959, from Thomas J. Dugan

seeking certain original documents.

Mr. Dugan's letter was

sent to several investigative and

other agencies for the purpose of establishing the admissibility

of secondary evidence by proving that a careful search had been

made for original documents.

Your memorandum states that some of the items requested

by Mr. Lugan had been previously turnished on September 17, 1959g.

however, only photostats were sent and there is no indication

whether or not the originals are in the possession of the Bureau,

although presumably the originals were left with the

source.

In örder to satisfy the best evidence rule it will be

necessary that you turnish us with the originals or a statement

that the originals are not in the possession of the Bureau.

Inasmuch as the trial of the case has already started,

we would appreciate a reply hereto at your earliest convenience,

Hotel.
