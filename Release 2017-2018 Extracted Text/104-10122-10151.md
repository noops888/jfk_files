In view of the above, it would appear that a separate

file did exist prior to November 1974, the contents of whier

would appear to have now been consolidated within the above

noted official Office of Security file on ROSELLI. Fu thie'1s

presuming that the heretofore missing "Project Johnny" file

nee an official file, the conclusion may be drawn that all

Office of Security files relating to the MAHiU ROSiLt matter

have been reviewed, and that the pertinent infornation contained

therein has been forwarded to the Inspector General for review.

6. It should be noted that in 1967 the Inspector Genoral

conducted an investigation into the MAHEU/ROSELLI matter, and

In so doing collected numerous memoranda from the various

Agency components directly involved. As a result, additional

memoranda which may have previously been held separately by

the Director of Security, may be in the possession of the

Inspector General.
