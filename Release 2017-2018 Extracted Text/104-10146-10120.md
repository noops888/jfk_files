MEMORANDUM FOR: Chief, Domestic Collection Division/ DDO

FROM

: S. D. Breckinridge

SUBJECT

: Quebec Separation Movement

1. I was in Wilmington, Delaware, on Saturday attending a

meeting of an organization to which I belong. One of she members

of the group, l

who I have known for several years,

approached me concerning information a friend of his has on the Quebec

separation movement.

Os is a straightforward man, and he believes that the

information his friend has would be of interest to someone concerned

with ramifications of the Quebec separation group. He says that nis

friend has contacts with radical members in inner circles of the group.

has suffered some sort of injury to his spine, and has

been a semi-invalid in recent years, so I do not know his current

employment status. He is a graduate of Toronto University in Canada,

and his wife is Canadian.

His source was a classmate at Toronto U.,

a retired major now in charge of the school's alumni program. This

alumni work has brought him in contact with a wide range of persons,

apparently out of which has come his contacts and this information.

I gather that he does not want to tell it to official Canadians,

but seems concerned with what he knows and feels that it should be reported

to someone in official U.S. circles.

I told 007 th

that I would report his willingness to speak

with Agency

representatives, but that 1 could not say

that he would be

contacced.
