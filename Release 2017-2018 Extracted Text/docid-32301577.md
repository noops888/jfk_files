information contained in Miami teletype 12/28/63, which

related to the exact details of the departure plans

preparatory to the raid are set forth in this report

in a very general and incomplete fashion in order to

protect MM T-1, who is the only person, except Dr. :

ORLANDO BOSCH, who had knowledge of these details.

The se

details were furnished, however, immediately to U.S.

Customs. Seizure of the boats in this case was greatly

facilitated by MM I-l's information.

Although this office has done everything

possible to protect the identity of MM T-l, it is felt

that U.S. Customs is undoubtedly aware of his identity

but will do everything possible to protect MM T-l in view of

the excellent relations existing between the U.S. Customs

and this office.

It is to be noted that the facts set forth in

this case should enable the U.S. Department of Justice

to give an opinion concerning prosecution.

This report is being classified CONFIDENTIAL

in order to protect MM I-l who is in a vulnerable posi-

tion.

MIRR, an anti-CASTRO organization of Cuban exiles, began mak-:

ing plans during the early part of 12/63 for an air raid

to drop bombs on oil installations at Nuevitas, north coast

of Camaguey Province, Cuba. BOSCH negotiated with WILLIAM

JOHNSON, U.S. citizen, residing Miami, to secure a boat

for transporting bombs

and men from Miami to Bimini, Bahama

Islands, where the bombs would be loaded on a plane and

flown by a Cuban pilot and crew to the target in Cuba under

cover of darkness. Several postponements occurred. On

12/27/63 MM T-l reported that the raid was to occur on the

night of 12/28-29/63 and that a 28 foot boat, the EBB TIDE,

was scheduled to rendezvous with another boat at about 6 PM •

12/28/63, at a point east of Government Cut, South Miami

Beach, Florida, and proceed with the bombs and crew to

Bimini.,

MM T-l advised that on the afternoon of 12/28/63

DETAILS:

AT MIAMI, FLORIDA

I. PREDICATION

Previous information was reported by MM T-1,

an Individual who has been involved in Cuban Revolutionary

activities directed against FIDEL CASTRO of Cuba, that

DI. ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA, head of the Movimiento Insurrecional

de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MIRR), an anti-CASTRO

organization of Cuban exiles, has been planning another

bombing raid by plane against a target in Cuba.

BOSCH began making these plans during the

early part of December, 1963, and intended to make the

raid prior to Christmas, but encountered several obstacles

such as engine trouble and bad weather which necessitated

postponement.

The purpose of the raid was to drop bombs

on oil installations at Nuevitas on the north coast of

Camaguey Province of Cuba. Investigation reflected that

BOSCH was utilizing the services of DANIEL ORLANDO RAMIREZ

DENIS, a Cuban exile, as the bomb expert responsible for

constructing a number of homemade bombs to be used on the

operation. Investigation also disclosed that BOSCH was

in close contact with WILLIAM JOHNSON, United States

citizen who resides in Miami and who has been previously

implicated in Cuban Revolutionary activities. JOHNSON

was reportedly making arrangements to secure a boat which

would be used in transporting the bombs and men from the

Miami area to Bimini, British Bahamas, where the bombs

would be loaded on a plane and flown by Cuban pilot and

crew to a target in Cuba under cover of darkness.

It was

also reported that JOHNSON was negotiating with CHARLES BUSH,

a United States citizen who operates

a charter plane business

at Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale, Florida,

- 3 -

NW 45881 DocId:32301577 Page 6

MM 105-2855

to obtain a plane for this raid. The plane was reportedly

scheduled to be flown from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini on a

pleasure flight by a pilot who would be instructed to leave

the plane at the Bimini Airport overnight, check into a

hotel, and then return the plane to Miami

the following day.

However, at approximately 1:00 AM, this plane was to have

departed Bimini under cover of darkness with a Cuban pilot,

crew and bombs. The bombs were to be dropped on the oil

installations at Nuevitas, Cuba, at about 3:00 AM and the

plane

would return to Bimini at approximately 6:00 AM.

The plane was to have been left in the same location

where the Cuban crew had taken possession of the plane and the

Cuban pilot and crew would depart Bimini still under

the cover of darkness for Miami in their boat.

It is to be noted that the airport at Bimini

is on a small island adjacent to the town of Bimini

and the airport is normally not manned by any airport

personnel after nightfall.

MM T-1 learned that BOSCH had secured the

services of

a former Cuban Air

Force pilot to fly the plane on this raid.

MM T-1 also reported that during the course

of these preparations for the raid, Dr. ORLANDO BOSCH

paid WILLIAM JOHNSON the sum of $450.00 to obtain a

suitable airplane for the raid. JOHNSON then entered into

the negotiations with CHARLES BUSH who first made available

an Aero Commander, but this plane developed motor trouble.

and BUSH then provided a Piper Aztec, Registration N4811-₽,

based at Broward International Airport.

On December 23, 1963, Mr. FAY LINEHAN, Supervising

Inspector, Federal Aviation Administration, Miami, advised

that Piper Aztec N4811-P was leased by CHARLES BUSH in

April, 1963, from the Fleet Rental Leasing Corpoation, Post

Office Box 948; Clarksburg, West Virginia. MM T-1 said

that BUSH had undertaken to secure the services of a pilot

in flying this plane from Fort Lauderdale to Bimini on

the date when the plane was needed there. BUSH also gave

practice flights to the pilotl

on several occasions

prior to the scheduled bombing raid.

II. INVESTIGATION

On December 27, 1963, MM I-1 advised that DI.

BOSCH had made final preparations and had scheduled

departure plans for the raid to begin on December 28,

1963. MM T-1l verified that the larger of the two boats

to be used was the "Ebb Tide",

, a 28 foot sport fishing

boat with

. a flying bridge docked at Baker's Haulover.

It is to be noted that U.S. Customs Service, Miami,

had already placed this boat under

as the

suspect boat in this case. MM T-l said that the "Ebb

Tide," with a Cuban captain aboard, was scheduled to

rendezvous with a smaller boat at about 6:00 PM on

December 28, 1963, at a point several miles east of

Government Cut and South Miami Beach. The personnel

scheduled to participate in the raid would then proceed

to Bimini according to plans, transporting with them

the bombs for the raid on the

night of December 28-29,1963.

MM T-1 also advised that the Piper Aztec,

N4811-P, was scheduled to depart on the afternoon of

December 28, 1963, for Bimini in accordance with the plan.

MM T-1 did not know the identity of the pilot..

The details of this

_Plan were immediatel)

urnished to the U.S. Customs Agency Service and other

interested agencies.
