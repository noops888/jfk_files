FIORINI appeared to be a "New York Italian gangster type"

who spoke only broken Spanish and with what appeared

to

be an Italian accent.

In view of the fact that investigative informants of this

office have considerable difficulty in checking official

records in the State of Michoacan, any effort to take this

action has been delayed until it is possible for this

investigation to be conducted by personnel of this office

or an investigative informant who has adequate credentials

for that purpose.

From the foregoing data concerning FIORINI, it

appears that he is probably identical with subject FRANK

ANTHONY STURGIS. It also appears possible, in view of

FIORINI's reported presence in Cuba, the question of his

identity may already have been fully clarified.
