For the information of the Bureau, on 5/11/64,

WALLACE SHANLEY, Assistant Supervising Customs Agent, Miami,

Florida, advised SA LEMAN L. STAFFORD, JR., that he had

conversed with subject on frequent occasions over the past

few months.

He stated subject has furnished him very little

valuable information in the recent past, and felt at this

time that any active investigation conducted by the Miami

Office would not jeopardize the relationship between the

subject and Customs.

SHANLEY added that he is not utilizing

subject as a source anymore, though subject does contact him

infrequently.

The extensive period of this investigation was

necessitated by various expeditious technical matters

assigned to the reporting Agent.
