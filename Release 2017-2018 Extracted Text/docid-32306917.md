advised that ROSSELLI is one of the

but belongs to the Chicago "Brugad, "tanking members of LCN

on the West Coast and handles interests of the

Chicago "Brugad" in Las Vegas, Nevada.

On 3/4/64 this source advised that ROSSELLI is one

of the most powerful and influential men in LCN. He is

considered one of the sharpest and most intelligent men in this

organization.

He is highly respected and frequently consulted

relative to and handles matters of highest importance and

greatest delicacy.

He was a member of the Los Angeles "Brugad"

but later transferred to the Chicago "Brugad."

On 2/16/65 LA 4448-C-TE advised that FRANK

BOMPENSIERO was the

"Capo Regime" in charge of the San Diego

group of LCN some years ago.

When he was sentenced to state

prison in about 1955, he was succeeded in this post by

ANTHONY MIRABILE, who held this post until his death in

December, 1958.

advised that BOMPENSIERO is presently a

Diego "Capo Regima."

LA 4412-C-TE furnished the following information

concerning a conversation he had with FRANK BOMPENSIERO on

12/4/65:

BOMPENSIERO stated that although they (LCN) must

ask the "boss" before moving into anything, he does not have

respect for FRANK DESIMONE and therefore he will ask only one

man, "GIOVANNI" (JOHN ROSSELLI).

Using the Italian language, BOMPENSIERO stated that

the "Boss" called him from Detroit not too long ago and asked

him to do him a favor commenting,

"I know that you can do it."

BOMPENSIERO said he tola him that,

"I ain't nothin'...only a

soldier" but the "Boss" said,

"I didn't go the other route

can. BOMPENSIERO said,

"You don't know how happy I've been

since that call. I don't have to ask ADAMO, the 'blind guy'

(DESIMONE), or the 'cigar: (LICATA)...only one guy I have to

clear with...GIOVANNI (ROSSÈLLI)."

To this LUIGI MERLI commented to informant, "maladrino,

which, according to informant in Italian means

"at top,

has proven self, belongs."

He was referring to

BOMPENSIERO.

BOMPENSIERO said that he has to meet "GIOVANNI"

early this morning (12/6/65) to talk to him about this matter

and, since he had to catch a plane for Mexico City at 10:00 AM

from San Diego

he will meet GIOVANNI "half way" (between

San Diego and Los Angeles).

BOMPENSIERO also stated that he still meets "GIOVANNI"

every week "but it's no good where we were before" (Brown

Derby in Beverly Hills because he and FRATIANNO were shaken

down in there by Los Angeles Police Department Intelligence

recently). He stated that they are looking for a new place

to meet.

On 11/17/65 informant advised that on the night of

at the Villa Capri Restaurant in Hollywood, California.

On this occasion, both BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO

spoke freely to informant of the fact that they were partners

along with FRANK LA PORTE of Chicago in the Fratianno trucking

companies.

They both also mentioned that they are in regular

contact with JOHN ROSSELLI and that ROSSELLI also has some

Rosselit and

sort of interest in this trucking operation. Informant noted

that this was the first time that BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO

had, personally, stated this fact to informant.

Informant

JOSEPH ADAMO

"Brugad," JOSEPH ZERILLI. ZERILLI, according to BOMPENSIERO,

is an ICN "commissione"

member.

According to BOMPENSIERO,

ZERILLI did not have BOMPENSIERO's telephone number as he hac

moved a couple of times within recent months. ZERILLI called

California (not further identi-

fied).

This individual called "Capo"

JOSEPH ADAMO in San

Diego and requested ADAMO to contact BOMPENSIERO and ask

BOMPENSIERO to call LERILUL.

ADAMO was given a telephone

number at which ZERILLI could be reached.

BOMPENSIERO stated that he did call ZERILLI whom he

BOMPENSIERO stated that

he then tola ZERILLI that he was no longer a "Capo" but only a

"soldier"

and that this matter would probably have to be

cleared with his "Boss" FRANK DESIMONE and his "Capo" JOSEPH

ADAMO.

ZERILLI then told BOMPENSIERO,

"Don't worry about

them,

I'1] handle anything that comes up."

BOMPENSIERO said

he then told ZERILLI that he would give the matter some thought

and would recontact him.

BOMPENSIERO told informant that he desired to discuss

this matter with JOHN ROSSELLI and was going to try to see

ROSSELLI, if possible, before he (BOMPENSIERO) left for Mexico

City on 12/6/65.

BOMPENSIERO did not discuss further specifics of

this matter with informant nor was it possible for informant

to ask any further questions in connection with it.

BOMPENSIERO did, however, indicate that ZERILLI's request

related in some way to an LCN matter.

On 12/6/65 informant advised that he had dinner at

the BOMPENSIERO residence on the night of 12/5/65: BOMPENSIERO

told informant that he had not been able to get in touch with

sad ost 20Cor the gate or Max Head on it no,

On 12/5/65 BOMPENSIERO told informant that he wanted

to see ROSSELLI about the "ZERILLI matter"

if possible before

he left for Mexico City and would leave for Mexico City either

the morning or the night of 12/6/65.

BOMPENSIERO again told informant he would be in

Mexico City for most of the week.

He also stated that he

(BOMPENSIERO) intended to come to Los Angeles to see JOHN

• ROSSELLI some time soon after his return to Mexico City and

at that time he would contact informant so they could also

get together while BOMPENSIERO was in Los Angeles.

BOMPENSIERO then stated that DESIMONE was afraid

to make a real decision on his own and always discussed such

matters with JOHN ROSSELLI.

ROSSELLI

actually is JOHN ROSSELLI.

Informant noted that normally such comments from

BOMPENSIERO would be highly dangerous. However, according

to informant, ROSSELLI is the real power in this area, and

BOMPENSIERO is closely associated with ROSSELLI. In addition,

informant pointed out, before his imprisonment,

BOMPENSIERO

had been a ranking ICN "member" in Southern California and

has highly placed, ranking ICN friends throughout the country.

It is noted that informant has previously identified

the Brown Derby Restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, as

a "meeting place" used by FRANK BOMPENSIERO

as well as JOHN

ROSSELLI.

Informant has also previously furnished specifics

relative

to several "meets" held or planned to be held at

this restaurant between ROSSELLI and BOMPENSIERO.

In this same connection, informant advised that

during the course of his discussions with FRANK BOMPENSIERO

in San Diego on 12/4-5/65, BOMPENSIERO made several references

to the fact that he continued to meet with JOHN ROSSELLI on

about a weekly basis.

BOMPENSIERO then told informant that he and ROSSELLI

had changed their "meeting place" as "We can't use the Brown

Derby anymore.

place.

It's no good anymore. We have to set up a new

BOMPENSIERO did not tell informant why this "meeting

place" was no longer being used by him.

Before informant left for Los Angeles on the night

of 12/5/65, BOMPENSIERO again told him that he was definitely

going to Mexico City n Monday, 12/6/65. He again stated

that he would be gone most of this week, but that sometime after

his return he would come to Los Angeles

to meet with JOHN

ROSSELLI. BOMPENSIERO told informant that he would plan on

meeting with informant also when he was in the Los Angeles

area.

While informant was with FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO

on the morning of 1/18/66, they discussed the following matter

with informant, requesting him to treat it in the strictest

of confidence.

Both BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO spoke in extremely

critical and profane terms of HAROLD "HAPPY" MELTZER and

LOUIS TOM DRAGNA and his father, THOMAS F. DRAGNA. FRATIANNO,

in particular, was quite bitter

in his comments.

FRATIANNO reminded informant that prior to his

(FRATIANNO's) imprisonment in the mid-1950s, he had always

been close to the DRAGNAs, particularly JACK DRAGNA (deceased

"Boss") and had always been fair in his dealings with them.

Prior to his imprisonment, FRATIANNO noted that

he had been a

"Capo." FRATIANNO reminded informant that the "regimes" led

regimes in the

DRAGNA had always been "cut in" to all their operations and

this had always been a highly prosperous association.

Even without a successful operation,

it was still the duty

of DRAGNA to see that his wife, JEWEL,

FRATIANNO claimed to informant that he received

assurances from JACK DRAGNA that this would be done.

Instead, according to FRATIANNO, this was not done.

His wife did not receive any appreciable proceeds from "those

DRAGNAs that she would "be taken care of" through "HAPPY

months.

nothing remained of

making a "pest"

of herself in continuing to come to him.

FRATIANNO then noted that when he finally got out of

prison, that it was LOUIS TOM DRAGNA that had a legitimate

business in the garment industry in Los Angeles. He also

noted that it was now "HAPPY" MELTZER that had the "most going

for him"--taking cuts from bookies and being involved in money

loaning deals.

He pointed out that MELTZER had always "fronted"

for the DRAGNAs and

that they were sharing in MELTZER's

operations.

FRATIANNO took the position, according to informant,

that the operation he (FRATIANNO) had

once developed had been,

in effect, taken over by the DRAGNAs and their associate,

MELTZER.

Both FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then told informant

that BOMPENSIERO, too, had a profitable operation going in

san 220 per 107.

San Diego prior to his imprisonment and this operation had

been allowed to dissipate and disintegrate and he, too, hao

been "let down" by the 'family."

FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then indicated to informant

that the reasons they had been making their inquiries with

AM LAZES, WILLIE ZEVON, ELI LUBIN, GEORGE GORDON, etc.,

o ascertain the nature and extent of themerations of th

DRAGNAS and MELTZER.

FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO then told informant that

they had discussed this matter at some length with JCHN

ROSSELLI. They had not, as yet,

made any move and did not

intend to make any move until such time as they ascertained

more specifies relative to the operations of MELTZER.

They intend to confront them with

what they referred to as

the facts relating to what FRATIANNO considers as an

the "shabby treatment" they finsulel,

to his wife by MELTZER, and demand some sort of redress.

Before BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO left, they again

requested informant to treat their conversation in the strictest

of confidence.

They asked informant to be alert to any

information relating to the operations of MELTZER and the

DRAGNAs and to relay such information to them on the occasion

of their next contact.

Informant noted that both FRATIANNO and BOMPENSIERO

have gone to some lengths to re-establish close and regular

contact with him.

Both continue to be insistent that informant

visit them at their respective residences whenever he might

find it convenient to do so.

Part of the reason, according

to informant, is the fact that neither BOMPENSIERO nor

FRATIANNO have the contacts. that informant has in the Los

Angeles area.

Informant is in a position to know certain

information desired by both of them.

Informant has the phone

numbers and means of contact with various individuals in this

area that neither BOMPENSIERO nOr FRATIANNO have.

In addition,

informant, BOMPENSIERO, and FRATIANNO all have close, long-

standing identity with JOHN ROSseLLI.

BOMPENSIERO and FRATIANNO are slowly and cautiously making a

bid for a shift of leadership in which

that this was only his opinion--it was not based on direct

indirect statements.
