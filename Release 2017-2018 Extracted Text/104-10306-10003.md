MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Notes on Special Group Meeting, 26 March 1963

98

1. (Low-level reconnaissance of Cuba. Comparative result of high-

level versus low-level photography were demonstrated by Mr. Lundahl.

After considerable discussion, it was decided that the matter would be

held in abeyance for a week pending further developments on the Donovan

matter. In general, Gilpatric's attitude was against low-level on the basis

of Defense intelligence needs, but would agree if State felt periodic low-

levels would establish "right of access". Johnson expressed general

objection at this time. McCone expressed two prevailing viewpoints within

CIA, but recommended proceeding with low-level. Bundy agreed to put

the matter to higher authority for final decision.

McCone suggested he

was willing to accept responsibility for further delay.

Action:

Matter to be reconsidered each week./

2.

[Reconnaissance of Indonesia, State, Defense, and Bundy all

opposed overflying Indonesia. McCone recommended we support the

British effort and it was agreed that the matter would be put to higher

authority for decision. ]

98

3.

Monthly Report of NRO was reviewed. McCone reported in detail

on the failure of recent CORONA shots; specifically referred to failures

of January, February, and March, and the fact that November and

December were not usually productive of good photography. He advised

Special Group that new estimates of Soviet capability could not be made

until the Fall, rather than in June and July as is customary. He advised

that the next flight was scheduled for Saturday, 30th of March, and it

will be a standard CORONA. Gilpatric reported that adequate emergency

back-up arrangements were being made, and delays of a type occurring

in the last 90 days would not be recurring.

McCone reported the difficulties incurred with the U-? generators

and brushes and the fact that this had caused a standdown of flights in the

Far East,

but not in Cuba.

Condition was reported as having been cor

rected and the North Korean, North China flight is on a weather alert.

The two papers from ine Coordinator of Cuban Affairs

on sabotage operations and additional covert programs were

returned for consideration by the Cuban Affairs Committee.

was noted that the Cottrell Committee had not acted on these papers.

The procedure adopted was for Cottrell Committee action and

recommendations in much the same way that we now get Ambassador

endorsement of covert activities elsewhere. There was a general

concensus that actions against Cuba shipping would not be final

although it would be an irritant, since plan called for damaging and

making ships inoperative rather than destroying them. Several

details of the additional Covert Action Program were discussed.

The paper is to be revised and reviewed by the Cottrell Group.

5. [Col. Steakley eported on the results of several recent

Elint missions, and Elint destroyer operations in the Far East and

Elint operation into the Baltic. Dr. Scoville reported on the

Chasse operation.

6. Question was raised as to the results from overflights over

Laos.

Action:

I would like a thorough briefing on this as I have

heard nothing on this.

7. It was reported that SAC seriously questioned CIA's con-

clusion that the SA-3 sites in Russia are low-level intercept

ground-to-air missile sites. Apparently SAC has prepared a report

on this. Gilpatric noted the March 18th CIA memorandum reaffirmine

our conclusions.

MEVORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group (5412) meeting, 25 April 1963

Attended by Bundy, Johnson, Gilpatric, McCone

CIA weekly report on our activities was reviewed without

comment. No requests were made. No actions are needed.

2.

[Extensive discuasions of DCI'e recommendations for low-

level reconnaissance of Cuba. Clipatrie rained the question of political

consequences.

Johnson responded that Mr. Hughes had submitted a

paper to him indicating the Soviets would take a harder line under these

provocations. He reported that Thompson appeared to feel that low

levels would be uned as a basis to halt withdrawal and possibly intensify

the situation in Laos and elsewhere and that our Interests would be

adversely affected. I took the position that intelligence requirements

were such that low-levela must be tontinued. It was agreed to go to

higher authority with the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense

present. Arrangements were made for a meeting about 6:30, 25 Aprily

3.

Mr. FitzGerald presented the proposed new covert policy

toward Cuba, reviewing the situation and speciile operations in con-

siderable detail. The Group were Impressed with the planning. They

were not prepared to act, and suggested the matter be discussed with

higher authority, and also that action be withheld until the Standing

Group had further deliberated on the question.

4. [Covers aetion to the Congo was dincuated. Bronson Iweddy

reported briefly. The CIA proposal was approved.

The proposed feint operations of GROSBEAK were discussed

in some detail.

Colonel Steakley suggested this operation might prejudice

their ELINT operations. However, it was agreed that the exercise would

be undertaken during the May dark-of-the-moon perlod and the results

reported back to the Special Group prior to reaching a decision for reaching

approval of continuing operations. Jorgenson was instructed accordingly.

ACTION: CIA is authorized to undertake this operation;

it should be watched carefully, reported accurately and

fully, and brought before the Special Group at the time

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group (5412) Meeting, 1l April 1963

1.

[Reconnaissance of Laos and North Vietnam was reviewed.

The Group expressed approval of the CIA program. They authorized two

flights over Laos and North Vietnam on the assumption that one of the

NEFA flights would cover the extreme western targets desired by Sarit.

If, on the other hand, the four India - Communist China border flights

were not executed at thistime, then CIA was authorized to fly three

flights over Laos and North Vietnam to cover all of the targets desired

by both Sarit and COMOR.]

2.

Status of negotiations for India - Communist China recon-

naissance was reported. It was agreed that this question should be

pursued further by CIA. No immediate action was indicated. Dr. Scoville

reported that no further information would be forthcoming from either

India or Thailand until about the 20th of April.)

3.

Cuban operations. The proposed infiltration-exfiltration

operations, past and projected, were reviewed and approved.

The

proposed program of sabotage and harrassment, both the general

program and the detailed plan, was discussed at length. It was reported

by Mr. Bundy that this program was developed more or less at the

direction of higher authority. It was not the intention of higher authority

to approve and authorize specific actions; what he was seeking was de-

tailed information concerning our capability and what might be expected

on a series of operations which were within our capability. I took the

position, which was supported by Alexis Johnson (somewhat less vocally,

however) that I questioned the advisability of proceeding with the program

until we had crystallized the total policy designed to remove the Soviets

from Cuba and also remove Castro. I said I was not clear as to how this

was to be accomplished, nor did I feel that there was any agreed series

of actions designed to meet this end objective. Therefore, it appeared

to me that we are projecting a few of the annoying operations, none of

which would permanently impair the facilities under attack nor would

they seriously impair Castro's economic or military posture and, hence,

serve no useful purpose. Furthermore, I estimated that under the laws

of averages, a number of the teams would be rolled up and they would

as they had in the past attribute the whole thing to the U.S. Government

and the CIA. Since we had stood down the ALPHA 66 and others, more or

less disenfranchised ourselves from the Cuban colony in Miami as a result

of the Miro Cardona incident, we would have no plausible denial and in fact

would find ourselves in a rather difficult position. It was agreed this matter

should be further studied and reported on next Thursday, and possibly

discussed with higher authority on Friday. An important part of this

issue is the SNIE now under preparation which has to do with the future

ACTION: I should discuss this subject with

General Carter and some of the

Senior Staff on Friday morning to

prepare an agreed CIA position

and also to schedule the completior

of the SNIE.

4.

North Vietnam monthly report was accepted.

98

5. The funds for Kong Le were approved. However, Alexis

Johnson was asked to go back to Ambassador Unger with an insistent

message that Phoumi support Kong Le with money now in which came

from the United States. However, if this appeal failed, the support

recommended in the paper should be given for a limited period of time.?

6.

[The covert annex to the Bolivian internal defense plan was

remanded because the Special Group (Cl) had remanded the basic internal

defense plan. However, there was no objection expressed to the annex

but it must not be construed that the Special Group approved any subjects

covered in the annex.

7.

The Colombian internal defense plan was not considered.

8. [Colonel Steakley submitted a report on inadvestent over-

flights by reconnaissance since l January 1961. This report was noted.

DCI raised the question as to why he had not been informed. Apparently

this was an oversight as written procedures had been established by

Colonel Steakley for prompt informing of all members of Special Group

when instances of this type occurred. Apparently, Alexis Johnson was

informed by Colonel Steakley's office and he was under the impression

that I was informed. However, he was on leave and therefore did not

know that I had not been informed.

British Guiana situation was opened up for discussion and

placed on the agenda for next week. Alexis Johnson reported on

MI. Burdette's position, substantially parallelling Helms', with the

effect that he was disappointed in the British position, that he felt time

had run in favor of Jagan, and they would like an appeal made to

Macmillan. Bundy took exception. McCone stated that CIA felt much

as Johnson reported and furthermore objected to the

in its own political actions which would be attributable

It was agreed to place subject

ACTION: Subject should be carefully reviewed by staff.

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Special Group 5412 Meeting - 23 May 1963

1. [After general discussion the North Viet Nam paper as presented

by Colby was approved with the exception of Item b. State took the position

that work with isolated ethnic groups in North Viet Nam should not be

undertaken unless specifically approved by the Department. Defense raised

the question of more extensive operations than anticipated by CIA and

indicated that the JCS had developed a plan which would be submitted to

the Secretary of Defense and then to the Special Group. I raised the

question as to whether the General Harkins command working with the

South Viet Nam army could conduct truly covert operations north of the

17th parallel, pointing out that if such actions were attributed to either

•the United States or the South Viet Namese, then the North Viet Namese

with their substantial military organizations could retaliate against the

South Viet Nam with punishing consequences. The JCS plan was not

formally presented. No actions were taken eithra although it is expected

that it will be presented in the near future.

ACTION: General Carter has had this matter under

consideration with Admiral Riley. We

should receive and study the JCS plan

immediately upon its approval./

2. Defense indicated that the Army have developed plans for large-

scale operations against Cuba involving sabotage. No presentation was made

however the Special Group was advised that such a plan would be forthcoming.

3. [Plan for disposing of the 14, 000 sacks of sugar in Puerto Rico was

discussed. I explained the actions being taken by DDP under FitzGerald's

direction and indicated the sugar would probably be sold by the Soviets to a

The

800 bags in question would be disposed of.7

5. The probable position of the Nenni Socialists at their July

Congress was discussed.

ACTION: CIA was requested to explore the possibility

of political action at this time designed to

influence a favorable decision by the Congress

concerning the Party's support of NATO and

the West as contrasted with the taking of a

neutral position. As an alternate possibility,

it was suggested that the Party might be

influenced to refrain from making support

of NATO an issue on which the Government

might be brought down. Such a course would

make it possible for the Christian Democratic

Party to conduct its support of NATO even

though the CD are closely associated with the

Nenni Socialists.

McCone stated that Mr. Karamessines

would report on this matter at the earliest

possible time.]

6. After a brief discussion on conditions in Haiti, Mr. Bundy

stated that NSAM

would be issued and would impose on CIA

certain responsibilities for covert action among exile groups.

ACTION: CIA should immediately study the prospect of

creating an exile group around dependable

leadership, prepare a plan, estimate of cost,

and a forecast of success of intervention in

Haiti and make specific recommendations on

course of action if one is indicated. Care should

be taken not to initiate action until policy has

been agreed upon at appropriate levels of

Government and of higher authority. Under no

circumstances should a course of action by

tied to a particular date or be otherwise 7

inflexible.

7. After a brief discussion of the overflight problem in India, Special

Group urged that ClA seek an appointment with Amb. Bowles prior to his

of the problem so that he will be fully informed upon his arrival in New Delhi

and will not necessarily be prejudiced by the views of Amb. Gailbraith.

1. [In connection with the scheduled monthly overflights,

Johnson brought up the question of overflights on Laos and North

Viet Nam, stating that he understood the COMOR requirements for

Laos had been completely filled and nothing was left over, but there

was a requirement for one flight on North Viet Nam. McCone answered

he was not sure but would check up. It was agreed that any unfilled

requirements on Laos would be taken care of.

4. The Cuban program was reviewed by Mr. FitzGerald and

was approved. McCone brought up the question of extensive coastal

defenses being built up by the Cubans as evidenced by the arrival of

new PT boats and advised the Group that we must plan contingent

methods for evading such coastal defenses. Also McCone stated

that he had asked for a review of all reports for the last 90 days

because of his continuing concern over the large number of

unexplained reports we are getting on Cuba which indicates some

ominous situation might be developing.

Present were: McGeorge Bundy, Mr. Gilpatric, Alexis Johnson,

General Carter and Paul Eckel

98

1. Reconnaissance Requirements for Current Contingency in

the Far Hast

The requirements for overflights were approved subject

to the following:

For the Sino-Indian border when a base becomes

available. Bundy wanted to know if we were ready for a high-level

approach to Nehru. I asked him to hold off until we had taken a better

reading and our team had returned. As to the Mainland of China,

to include Manchuria, Bundy did not want to go near the Soviet border

and felt that 10 or 15 miles was entirely too close. He had no objec -

tion to anywhere over the Mainland of China providing we kept well

clear of the Soviet border. I told him that if we did this we would

not be meeting the requirement to keep track of anything occurring on

the Sino-Soviet conflict along the border and the general consensus

was that we could do without this type of reconnaissance rather than

run the risk of an incident. The Group established a "bank of two"

missions for operations against Laos, north of the 17th parallel, and

against North Vietnam. There appeared to be no problem about

replenishing the bank when it was drawn down. The mission against

Laos south of the 17th parallel was approved.

The mission for cover-

ing North Korea was approved as a high priority requirement subject

only to the return of Secretary Rusk

2. Cuban Operations of August

Mr. FitzGerald briefed the Special Group along the lines

of his briefing notes (SAS 63-481 of 7 August). Everything was

approved except that State had an opportunity to reclama the sabotage

operations if they felt the need--Johnson said he would know definitely

by Sunday (presumably thinking that Rusk may have had some private

conversations with Khrushchev that could indicate the need for soft

pedaling actions in Cuba).

The undersigned was present at this meeting

only for the brief item on Cuba which involved the

final decision whether or not to postpone the two

external sabotage operations planned for 26 July.

Mr. Bundy referred to the fact that the Agency repre-

sentatives had previously stated that they would

prefer, in terms of the morale of the case officers and

agents, to have a decision to postpone made at the

earliest possible moment rather than to have such a

decision reached at the last minute. Hr. Bundy stated

that in light of this he felt it reasonably certain

that Higher Authority would consider that negotiations

in Moscow were proceeding in a sufficiently favorable

manner to warrant a postponenent decision at this time.

Mr. Bundy said that if the undersigned did not hear

from him during the course of the day Higher Authority's

decision to postpone could be assumed. Mr. Bundi

further said that it was only fair to warn that there

might be a resumption of Moscow negotiations at a later

date - perhaps August - and that these resumed nego-

tiations might in turn call for postponements.

September 23, 1963

SECRET EYES ONLY

MEMORANDUM FOR MEMBERS OF THE SPECIAL GROUP

SUBJECT: Covert Operations Against Cuba - Security Within

the Government

As you know, in August the U. S. Government directed two

"exile" raids against targets in Cuba. From the evidence now

available, it appears that our security, with respect to U. S.

participation in these operations, was excellent.

While there will always be public speculation as to the extent

of U. S. involvement in raids of this type, I think we would all

agree readily that it is important that there be only speculation,

and no direct knowledge.

Unfortunately, the maintenance of a

high degree of security is not a simple matter in view of the

numbers of people within the Government who have to know a

pf pecurity

little or much about a U.S. -directed raid against Cuba.

For example, without counting CIA personnel and secretarial

and staff personnel of other agencies, there were probably over

20 people in the Executive Branch who knew details of the August

raids while many other people were generally acquainted with

the U. S. involvement. Among others, the Navy knew where the

attack boats were going; the Coast Guard, Customs, and INS

knew about the "comings and goings" of the raiders; a few DOD

people, who had to procure special equipment for the raids,

could presumably surmise that something was going on somewhere;

and a few intelligence watch officers and press officers were told,

for their background, that the U. S. Government was aware of

the raids.

I think there are two important, if obvious, security lessons

we have learned from the August raids - one, that it is in the

nature of the problem that many people probably have to know

something about such raids; and two, that these people apparently

can maintain adequate security. At the same time, in view

of the truth that security leaks are more likely to occur when

substantial numbers of persons are involved, it seems

essential to me that we constantly convey the high importance

of security to others who are privy to information about our

covert activities against Cuba®

May I ask that members of

the Special Group take such steps within their areas of

authority as they think appropriate, and may I in particular

urge that the Central Intelligence Agency, as executive agent

for these enterprises, emphasize the importance of security

to all those with whom it has necessary business on these

matters, so that we can maintain the high level of security

set in these recent operations.
