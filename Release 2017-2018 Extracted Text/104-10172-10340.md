and, as courtesy vould demal, asted permiasion to quote IVERSEl's article.

IVERSEN vas delighted at Source's interest in the article, gave peralasion

for him to quote 1t, and inquired 11 Source would consider going to the USSR

for a speaking invitation. Source said that he would be interested.

2. A fer weeds after bis talk with IVERSIN, be received an lavitation

to give several lectures in the USSR..

The Invitation vas D'on tbe USSR

Prof. IVERSKN about this satter.

Soon after receiving the invitation Subject and hie wife vere in

"Fleberman'& Cottage", when Gregorel COLOB, whom Source thinks 18 either

a Consul or Vice Consul at the Soriet Embassy there, and snu RASt, a

Finnish Communiet, both case up to his table and introluced thesselves..

COLOB mentioned Source's iminent trip to the USSR. COLOB and RASKE sat

down and COLOB began to discuss the trip further.

Source feele that

COLOB'a interest my bare been prompted by the fact that Prof. SOPOLIV bad

Issued the invitation on bebalf of the USSR Academy of Sciences. COLOB

bad about 5 drinks before be and RASKR finally Left, Source remarked to

COLOB earlier that be was not sure that he vould be able to manage the

trip to the USSR sinaacially. COLOB laid be didn't think this would be

uny special problem and asted bin to come to the soviet Bubassy tbe

fallowing day to neet the cultural Attache, who could arrange to set him to

tbe USSR and back without cost. At one point in the conversation after they

appointment to see them.

When Source arrived COLOS bad juat completed a

sonewbet ruthless intervier with sone finniab nothers, tho bad been bessing

of bin to allow the return of their sors from the USSR. CULOB appeared

quite stern as opposed to tse pleasant side of bia personality diaplayed

the previous evening.

S.

COLOB Introduced Source to VORONIN, who was particularly cordial

and agreed to finance tbefour or five day trip to tbe loss 1n May.

asked 1I Source's Invitation to COLOB for Sunday was atill good and asted 11

he and his wife could come too.. In effect, VORONIN Invited himself, tbough

Source said be vas glad to bare his.

Source met fnu SAIGEYEV briefly later

In the Internew. Source belleved SERGEYSY to be GOLOB's chief.

6. COLOB and VORONTH appeared on sunday with their wives bearing a

great many presents, more than the custon would require.

bottles of Stolichagya champagne, costing 25 rubles for a half liter, which

Source thought to be Russia's finest, also a bottle of vodka, chocolates for

tbe children, and several otber saall gifts. RISKS and hia wife did not

appear. Actually Source was disappointed that RASKE did not come as be bad

enjoyed very much talking with bin at tbe Kalastejatorppa the week before.

RASKE had said that he vas a travel agent and showed Sourca his passport,

which indicated that be bad trarelled virtually the vorld-over and even to

Kenya and other parts of central Africa. Source inquired of COLOB why RASXOS

bad not come and GOLOB gave him a son-commital ansver.

7.

Inter in the evening COLOB called Source aside while in Source's

study and said

to him, "this RASKA 1s a sviDe."

constantly with such people but resents the fact that his wife must mingle

with them socially.

Corminiats politically but that they cannot be trusted.

8. The conversation became quite free is the three men drank a liter

of champagne and a fifth of Scotch.

The wives conversed very little during

the evening. VORONIN kept asking Source questions about life in tbe United

States--how much professors are paid, bor many cars Anericans own, etc. At

first be asked tbe questions for the purpose of pointing out that conditions

vere better in the USSR, but later said that he bad bad a number of alacon.

had never net an American fanily and Source felt that his curlosity sus

genuine.

9. The three discussed their general backgrounds freely. In all their

conversations they used Finaish, which both of the Soviets knew rather vell.

vere hard Communisto, Although they admired she material accomplishmenta

of the united States.

Re our earlier report that COLOD professes sarathy

for the United Statia, Source feela that this atatement probably means cal

that ClOB expressed to him that the United States and the Soviet Union mist

Ery earnestly to understand the point of view of the otber and bargain 1n

good faith.

He, as well as VORORIN, 16 very much a Soviet Coumuniot, and

10. VORONLY called Source on 7 April saying that 1t vould be best not

to plan bla trip to the USSR for Msy Day as had been originally planned siece

there would be a great many dignitaried in Moscow then and it would be astricult

to arrango adequate accoumodations.

VOROlaN asked 1f he could go the falloving

week. Source replied that be could not as he vas scheduled to leave for Egland

on l May to Elve a series of five lectures tbere lasting t1l the end of say.

11. The trip was postponed until late June. Source Left Helsink for

Moscow on 22 June and returned 8 July.

Both COLOB and VOROHIN saw him oft

at the train station. This vas his laat contact with them. In sumary,.

Source feels that they did not have any undue interest in hin. They may bave

been asked through channela to be particularly cordial to bim because

Prof. IVERSEN and Prof. SOBOLEV had inatigated hia invitation to tbe ussR.

12. Il Subject can obtain grante for the trip, he hopes to retura

to the Univeralty of Heleink1 next summer. After a week's visit to Eaglen!,

be hopes to attend the Scandianavian Congress on Mathematica following which

be 18 to speak at tbe World Conference on Complex Varlables In Helsinkl. Fe

WIll see Prof. IVERSET, with whom be says he has quite good relations, ard
