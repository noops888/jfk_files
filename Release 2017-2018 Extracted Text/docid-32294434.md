Miami, Florida

September 18, 1968

I, MARIA DE LOURDES BLANCO DIEZ DE CUESTA,

2155 SW 5th Street, Miami, Florida,

make the following

statement voluntarily to Special Agents WILLIAN W.

STEVENS and GEORGE E. DAVIS who I know to be Special

Agents of the FBI

On the morning of September 18, 1968, from

approximately 8:30 through 8:50 A.M., ORLANDO BOSCH

AVILA ate breakfast at the Dog House Restaurant, 3695

West Flagler Street, and discussed his activities with

a friend. The following is what occurred on that

occasion:

At approximately 8:30 A.M., ORLANDO BOSCH,

dressed in a suit, entered. the Dog House Restaurant

alone and sat down in the first booth to the right

of the Flagler Street entrance. He advised the waitress

that he vas waiting for another fellow and kept looking

at his watch. Aîter some five minutes, an unknown

individual entered the restaurant and approached BOSCH,

who stood up and greeted him, and the two sat down at

the table. This unknown individual is described as follows:

male, white, latin, approximately 42 to 45 years old,

about 5' 11" tall, weight about 180 pounds, appears

slightly husky and/or overweight, hair, bald on top

with a black fringe around the edges, tinged with gray,

eyes, dakr and small, complexion, medium, scars and marks,

none observed, attire, medium gray suit, white shirt and

tie.

The waitress, who was apparently an American

and did not appear to understand Spanish, approached

BOSCH's table and said to the newcomer something to the

effect that his friend had been waiting for him and

thought he would never come. At this point, ORLANDO

BOSCH introduced the newcomer to the waitress as the

leader of the Cuban Power group. This conversation

was apparently in jest, and the waitress laughed but

gave no particular indication that she knew

the

significance of this comment or that she knew either

BOSCH or his associate personally. They ordered breakfast

and proceeded to eat it and discuss their affairs.

SECREL

At the outset they each discussed various

aspects of practicing medicine as Cuban refugees in

the Miami area and the problems of passing the written

examinations and the fact that they were making medical

state boards more difficult each year. BOSCH's associate

indicated that it was necessary to study even harder

now in order to pass these examinations. They discussed

working conditions

in various hospitals in the area,

and BOSCH's associate indicated that he had a friend

who was opening a hospital or clinic in Fort Lauderdale

which would contain

some 40 beds. Both BOSCH and his

(ui

associate seemed to feel that this was not a smart

thing to do and might very likely prove unsuccessful.

It was apparent from their conversation, which was in

Spanish and frequently punctuated with swear words,

that they had known each other for some time, although

probably not closely, and that they were both occupied

in the medical profession.

BOSCH then launched into a discussion of his

recent activities and those of Cuban Power. He talked

openly and freely in the Spanish language in a boastful

manner to his associate about these affairs, apparently

being of

the opinion that no one else in the restaurant

understood Spanish or was interested in their conversation.

He explained that in past months various

individuals from several groups locally had been placing

bombs in the Miami area and elsewhere, that these

individuals, however, were nothing but gangsters and did

not actually represent the Cuban people. He stated that

he and his group were the only true representatives of

the Cuban people and their activities vere directed to

advance the cause of Cuban independence: Among some of

the recent activities, the responsibility for which he

credited to Cuban Power, were the following:

The recent bombing of the boat in San Juan,

Puerto Rico, harbor was an activity of Cuban Power, and

he was sure that the boat would have sunk if the Coast

Guard had not been alert and prevented it from doing so

by going to its assistance.

The recent shelling of the Polish vessel, the

"Polanica", in Miami had been a Cuban Power activity,

and BOSCH explained how they had prepared a car for the

little cannon and driving out along the causeway to the

appropriate spot.

He indicated that they had had to get

out of the car to actually fire the projectile and after

firing it, jumped back into the car and fled the scene.

In his account

of this activity, although he used the term

"we", it was obvious that he was probably not among the

group who actually participated in this activity. BOSCH

indicated that the next major planned activity of the

Cuban Power group was to go to the Olympics games in

Mexcio City to make their cause known.

He said that in connection with these activities,

it was necessary to raise some $200,000.00 in order to be

able to continue the bombings. He said that some Cubans

mistakenly thought the CIA was involved in these activities

and was, perhaps, helping to finance them but this was

not the case. He said it was necessary to raise the funds

through contributions from the Cuban community. He

acknowledged he was aware of the fact that it would be

impossible to raise so much money under his name, ORLANDO

BOSCH, or under the name of his organization, the MIRR.

Because of past unfavorable publicity and involvements

with the United States Government, many local Cubans would

not contribute to any program of which he was the acknowledged

leader; therefore, it was necessary to create a front or a

consolidated organization, such as Cuban Power or a group

perhaps using another name, to collect the needed funds.

Someone would have to be the leader of this group who

commanded the respect and support of local Cubans. He

pointed out that "ERNESTO" who had come to be known as the

spokesman for Cuban Power, was respected by many and could

perhaps serve this purpose.

BOSCH indicated they would use various techniques

to raise funds and stated that one "GUADO", an individual

whom they apparently knew by this nickname, contributed

$5.00 per month to the organization as did many others.

BOSCH's associate, who appeared to be hearing much of this

for the first time, raised the question of the legality

of these activities and asked BOSCH if it was not likely

these activities vere illegal and the participants might

very well be arrested and sent to jail. BOSCH said he

did not care whether they were illegal or not, they were

still prepared to carry them out for the good of Cuba.

He boasted that the authorities were afraid to arrest

him, BOSCH, because they knew he would cause a great

deal of trouble and unfavorable publicity if arrested.

He said, in the first place, he had never actually

personally been involved in any of the bombing

incidents and could not be directly identified with

these activities, and Government authorities could

not prove otherwise. In the second place, he and

his committee had agreed that if he was arrested and

sent to jail that he would go on strike in the same

manner as had FELIPE RIVERO. He would refuse to

cooperate in any way and would refuse to eat. He would

live on bread and melado, which was a liquid form of

sugar. He pointed out that the bread would stand for

the fact that they were Christians and the melado would

stand for the fact that they were nationalists. BOSCH

indicated that the publicity from this would be most

unfavorable for local authorities and for that reason

he considered himself more or less untouchable.

BOSCH's associate had asked him what about

CARLOS RIVERO? BOSCH indicated that CARLOS RIVERO,

who has been the leader of the nationalist group in

New York City, has not joined with the Cuban Power

movement and is apparently still in New York City.

He stated, however, recently four or five members

of the New York nationalist group had come to Miami

from New York and had met with BOSCH and his associates

at the doctor's residence.. As a result of this meeting,

they had joined with, and supported, the Cuban Power

movement.

It was not known but BOSCH in making this

statement, implied that the residence at which the meeting

had been held was, in fact, the residence of the individual

to whom he was talking. If this was the case, however,

and the associate did allow his house to be used for

meetings, it was equally apparent that he himself had

not been at the meeting mentioned above and had not known

what had transpired on that occasion until BOSCH had

advised him.

Apparently the two continued to discuss

these

affairs at some length but details of any subsequent

discussion were not known.
