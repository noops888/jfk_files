MM 977-S, the Dominican Consul General in Miami,

said no visas had been issued, would not be issued, and

no Cuban exiles were needed or wanted in the DR.

GERALD PATRICK HEMMING has been investigated by

the Miami Office for over five years, is of known unreliability

and has never been able to send an expedition out of the U. S.

IM osy-s, a close associate of HEMMING, on June 21,

1965, said that HeMMING is no longer interested in the DI

is now working on a plan to bring South Vietnamese into

the U. S. to serve as training troops in a Florida National

Guard training program.

Informant said that the entire story

of sending troops to the DR is a figment of HEMMING's imagination.

It is not based on fact but just another one of HEMMING'S

many impractical and illogical dreams.

On June 23, 1965, JULIO ATON CONSTANZO PALAU'

Miami files 105-2528, "LUIS

GOMEZ VARGAS, IS - CUBA" and also "DENIO CANTON, IS - CUBA"•

In these two cases ATON was the orginal complainant

concerning these two subjects who reportedly are CASTRO agents,.

On interview on June 23, 1965, ATON furnished information

concerning two more Cuban exiles in Miami suspected of being

During this interview, ATON said

onelof the two unidentified suspected CASTRO agents is known .

*King Kong", true name unknown, but that this person

signed up to fight communism in the DR and filled out an

application form with complete background information. This

ATON said

he would locate this form and make the information available

to interviewing Agents.

ATON explained that he had more

than 100 such forms containing the identities of persons he

recruited to fight in the DR but so far he had been given

no money, no uniforms, no arms and there were no plans to

leave the U.S. He said the whole thing had been postponed.

ATON later volunteered that he is connected with

ROBERTO ALEJOS ARZU, a rich Guatemalan national in Miami,

who plans to use Cubans to overthrow the present government

ATON laughed and said his men planned to cooperate

with ALEJOS just to the point where they can locate and steal

ALEJOS' arms for their own use in Cuba.

In view of comments to SAC, Miami, in referenced

Bureau letter, no attempt was made to interview ATON about

his plans

for

the DR or ALEJOS' activities. No questions

wEre

asked concerning these matters and no arrangements

were made to interview ATON later about them.

For the information of the Bureau, ATON is a

countryman, farmer-type from Cuba with little education.

He works in Miami as a day laborer, is obscene, loud,

but

apparently courageous.

He does not know about

Federal laws

dealing with expeditions and arms and considers himself as

a natural ally of the FBI in the fight against communism.

For this reason, he proudly talked about his anti-communist

to be of any service to the Bureau in

investigations of CASTRO agents in this country.

Miami Office feels

this matter has received undue

importance and

alarm because of CIA reporting and classifying

such

material "Secret"

The Miami Office, from previous

experiences with HEMMING, and a quick check with established

sources, feels this entire matter was the result of one of

HEMMING's day-dreams•

MM

639-S, who has been in daily contact with

HEMMING, since June 18, 1965, advises that the whole idea

about sending volunteers to the DR has been abandoned by

HEMMING who is now working on a plan to bring in South

Vietnamese.

The Miami Office feels that further adequate

coverage will be afforded by MM 639-S and there will be

no necessity for interview of participants.

A letterhead memorandum suitable for dissemination

will be submitted and contact maintained with MM 639-s.
