Thuermer noted that Time magazine editors have offered

the Director an opportunity to comment on the SSC report.

The Director asked Thuermer to decline this offer. Thuermer

also advised

that Strobe Talbott has withdrawn his request

to see the Director.

Bolten reported that he will meet with a member of the

louse Ethics Committee team investigating the leak of the

ISC report and that the investigator may also

wish to talk

with CIA officers who had access to the report.

Bolten suggested that we maintain a good record of

foreign and public reactions to the SSC report for possible

use with our oversi

Bolten stated his

belief that the Agency has been hurt most by allegations

of CIA involvement in Watergate and President Kennedy's

assassination.

he said a study on

the Warren Comnission will be published by the SSC next

month; the theme they are developing is that, because of

CIA plots against Castro, the latter retaliated and was

connected with

President

Kennedy's assassination.

Bolten

suggested

it might be worthwhile

talk with Senators

Schweicker and Gary Hart, the principals behind the study,

as this could prove more damaging domestically than the

SSC report.

sai repot the so shorse he esteaded query post en

CIA involvement in the JFK assassination but could find no

indications of such involvement.

Chamberlain added that,

although investigations could not prove that Castro knew

about CIA plots against him and took retaliatory action

against JFK, they did not disprove this either.

Bolten reported that Senator Church's SSC will issue its final report,

on CIA and FBI cooperation with the Warren Commission, on 23 June.

Based on circumstantial evidence, the report comes close to charging the

FBI and CIA with a cover-up or deliberate failure to provide information

to the Warren Commission. It also recommends that the matter be pur

sued by Chairman Inouye's SSC; Bolten said it is his understanding that

Inouye will await public and press reaction to the report before deciding

whether to investigate further.

The Director asked that background in-

formation on this report and on recent allegations by a Chilean intelli-

gence officer (see Morning Meeting Minutes of 10 June 1976) be provided

to Falkiewicz for handling of press inquiries. Bolten suggested that, if

press queries on the SSC report become intense, Falkiewicz be prepared

to say more than "no comment"; e. go, a statement that the judgments of

the report are highly speculative and based on circumstantial evidence.

the subject, it is a good one. Bolten later commented that Senators Church

and Hart disassociated themselves from Senator Schweiker's "cover-up"

accusations against CIA and the FBI.

the Agency was unwilling to give them.

Lapham related that Dade County investigators will be in Washington

and have asked us to run name traces on four Cubans thought to be connected

with John Roselli, as well as for the identity of other Cubans who may have

been involved or privy to Castro assassination attempts. The Director

commented that it is to our advantage to cooperate in every way with the

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

Morning Meeting Minutes of 16 September 1976

Waller provided the Director a copy of the 28 November 1963 CIA

cable referred to in Jack Anderson's 7 September 1976 article (attached)

and noted that efforts are under way to determine what action was taken

upon receipt of the cable and whether it was provided to the Warren

Commission.

In response to the Director's query as to whether the cable

was provided to the SSC Subcommittee (chaired by Senator Sweicker) that

investigated CIA and FBI cooperation with the Warren Commission, Bolten

said that the Subconmittee had access to all Agency material pertaining

to the Kennedy assassination, including the file containing the cable.

The Director asked that we ascertain whether the cable was given to SSe

staffer Madigan or Liebengood and, if so, when.

In response to Waller's

statement that the cable was among 1200 documents CIA released under

FOlA to attorney Melvin Belli, Blake said he would determine the date

it was provided.

Miller noted Bill Miller's advice that the SSCI voted unanimously to

proceed with their investigation of Roselli's assassination, and stated

that OLC might ask that the Director encourage Chairman Inouye to act on

our CIARDS amendments.

In response to Bolten's advice that the House Rules Committee voted

to establish a new conmittee to investigate the assassinations of President

Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Waller stated that a task force headed by

the IG is already reviewing all material in the Agency's possession pertaining

to the Kennedy assassination.

Referring to the conversation about Ron Kessler earlier in the

meeting, Berend stated that Kessler claims to have new information

regarding the Kennedy assassination which he would like to discuss

with the Agency.

As a result of guidance he received from Scott

Breckinridge this morning, Berend will advise Kessler today that

(a) the allegation of Oswald's meeting with Cubans in Mexico City

was reported to the Warren Commission and Congressional investiga-

conmittees ang (b) that in view of the upcoming investigatio

y the House Select Committee on Assassinations, we deem it inappropriate

to discuss the matter further with him.

Bolten called attention to continuing press coverage of the

investigation into President Kennedy's assassination (see attached

Washington Post article, and expressed his concern over David Belin's

statements which seem to imply that Belin believes documents have been

destroyed and that there was a cover-up by CIA and FBI. Stating that

he believed Bolten misinterpreted Belin's comments, the DDCI added

that Belin has always held the view that the passage of time would

make it too difficult to assemble the facts.

At the Director's

request, the DDCI will call Belin to learn first-hand what he

told press representatives. The Director asked if we know the

accuracy of press allegations that FBI files contain a 1964 memo

written by FBI Director Hoover which indicates that Lee Harvey

Oswald told Cuban officials he planned to kill President Kennedy.

After a brief discussion, the Director asked that Lapham ask the

Justice Department if such a memorandum exists.
