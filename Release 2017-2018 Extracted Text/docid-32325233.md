F. WEINHEIMER, including an

entry dated

195% )

to OscAR J. WeINHeIMEr.

The information

appearing on the vouchers and checks

entered on the schedule.

This schedule will show with

respect to these payments the date; name; check number;

voucher number; amount of check; voucher explanation;

account number appearing on the voucher and/or cash dis-

bursement; the check endorsement where cashed and/or bank

The checks on the aforementioned schedule bear an "A"

prefix to the number and are

printed in red and blue on

It was also observed that the cash disbursements

contained certain entries payable to other individuals but

which appear to concern WEINHEIMER and disbursements made

on his behalt.A schedule was prepared reflecting these

entries (Schedule C) and they total $165,53.

concerns payments to WEINHEIMER during the months he was

in Des Moines, lova, and Detroit, Michigan, Schedules

were not posted to an accounts payable account but were

to the general colume.

The Agent's work papers will also

show that on August 17, 1957, Check Number A2113, payable
