For the information of the Bureau and Tampa,

on May 29, 1968, MM 1231-C-TE advised the following

regarding those persons whom he knows to be LCN members:

DOMINICK DEA, known to the informant as

"Little Dom," from Tampa, now residing in Miami, is a

member of the TRAFFICANTE family and handles numbers,

bookmaking and strip parlors if and when this is

possible.

LEA formerly had strip houses in Tampa and

in Broward County, Florida, and until recently had a

cara room on sunny Isles, next to or across the street

Irom the psychedelic parlor on Sunny Isles Boulevard.

In addition to LEA, the only other TRAFFICANTE

family members known to be the informant to be residing

in Miami are WILLIE DENTAMORA and TONY RANDAZZO.

Informant

states that RANDAZZO is the one person in whom TRAFFICANTE

has complete confidence, and who is always aware

of the

whereabouts and activities of TRAFFICANTE.

Informant stated that VINCENT BRUNO, owner of

Capra's Restaurant, although a close confidant

TRAFFICANTE who meets regularly at his restaurant, is

not considered an ICN member, but at best would be classed

as an "Amici."
