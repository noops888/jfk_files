LU 29044 on the car used by ALEX in Switzerland by the Zurich

Cantonal Police at the request of Legat, Bern, through the

Swiss Central Police Bureau, has been made the subject of a

letterhead memorandum, four copies of which are enclosed.

It should be noted that on two occasions investi-

gation in this matter in Switzerland has been complicated by

the fact that ALEX's name has been inverted to ALEX GUS,

possibly because "ALEX" is recognized as a first name here

and "GUS" is not.

It is believed that in the future it may

be helpful to call this potential confusion to the attention

of agencies requested to make checks.

The following is a report by the Cantonal Police

of zurich, Switzerland,

as received through the Swiss Central

Police Bureau, Bern, Switzerland, on April 10, 1963:

It has now been established that the car in ques-

tion was actually rented from the firm of Hertz AG., Lager-

strasse 33, Zurich 4. Said firm was advised by their sub-

Sidiary Company of New York (Hertz Reservation Office, 660

Madison Avenue,

New York 21) that a written reservation for

a car model "VW 1500" had been received by them for December

22, 1962g

by a certain Mr. G. N. ALEX. The enclosed photo-

copy Nr. 1 refers.

Accordingly,

Messrs. Hertz AG. of Zurich kept this

particular car ready (registration number, LU 29044) •

On

December

• 22, 1962,

the car was collected by a chauffeur of

the Grand Hotel Dolder, Zurich, and was then delivered to

ALEX, who signed contract Nr. 06476 (as per enclosed photo-

copy

Nr. 2) by paying the necessary deposit of US $100.

The car in question

was returned to Hertz AG. in

Naples (Italy) on January 8, 1963, where ALEX paid the

balance of the rent.

Further enquiries made at the Grand Hotel Dolder

revealed that subject arrived at the said hotel on his own

on December 17, 1962,

as per enclosed hotel control note

(photocopy Nr. 3) and the date of his departure is given as

December 22, 1962.

The above mentioned hotel control note

was classified under the name of GUS.

No information could be obtained with regard to s

subject's entry into Switzerland.

Copies of the photostats referred to above are

attached.
