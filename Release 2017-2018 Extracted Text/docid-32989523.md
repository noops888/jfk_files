based on the evidence

comparison of Winkler, found in Winkler's room, the

shanduntig in the notebook

recovered from him at the time of original detention

with the materials

accumulated over the

period of

the past year that there can be deduced

a strong

opinion that Winkler is, in fact, the SAO in Madison.

Roehling further stated

that it

appears that Winkler

operated

as a lone individual as they cannot locate

any individuals with whom he has associated.

Rochling

further advised that when Winkler was arrested, contained

in his wallet was a membership card for the National

Socialist White People's Party (See Appendix), Milwaukee,

Wisconsin.

mer mayor, and DELVIN HINTZiANN, operator of the Watertown

were signed SAO.

They advised that

this was a warning against them.

The latters stated that

by advertisers and that the addressees have no choice in

action to insure that advertisements would never be placed

MEMORANDUM RE JERRY LYNN DAVIS SENTENCING

Re: People V. Jerry Lynn Davis;

People V. William Francis Yakopec;

Watergate Conspiracy.

"On June 21, 1973, Jerry Lynn'Davis, former Southern California

Coordinator of the secret Army Organization was granted probation

as a result of a psychiatric and

social study conäucted by the

California Department of Corrections.

Thus ends the last of the

now famous "Sacret Army" cases, but the inferences of wrongaoing

and the patent injustice of the entice persecution remain obvious

to everyone.

Various organizations are still looking into

Watergate implications of Secret Army cases.

Other's are seriously

concerned with the wrongdoings of those who acted with implied

or explicit authority of the United States Government. These

men remain free.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation informant,

Howard berry

Godfrey, remains free.

At various times and places he aâmitted

to a number of major elonies.

These include the following:

possession of illegal explosives - these are the explosives.

which Yakopec allegealy used to blow up the Guild Ineater and

they are the same explosives which are the basis for davis' ;

conviction; detonating incendiary device (admitted at the Yakopec

trial); burglary (aamitted at the Hoover hearings); sale of explosives

(admitted at the Yakopec trial); concealing evidence of a felony

(admitted at the Hoover trial).

/ Gun. Fi

Mr. Godfrey has admitted these felonies yet he is free.

How can

the District Attorney of San Diego County sleep with his conscience

when this man remains free? Or, is Mi. Eawin Miller governed by the

Watergate standard of ethics and morality? Mr. Godfrey acted for

the best of all possible motices.

He did commit some crimes. But

"his aims anâ ideas were good."

Therefore, he should not be

punished for his crimes but should, like Mi. Barker and Mr. Hunt,

be praised for violating the law of calife 26a./ 'Is this<the"

Districi Attorney's idea of enforcing the law and protectingha

citizens of this county? Howard Berry Godfrey must be broug JuL a

to justice.

Memorandum - pag

June 22, 1973

This Federal employee wallingly and wantonly violated the

laws of this State.

He knew what he was doing. Had he advised

the local police of the Tharp shooting, the Guild Theater would

never have been bombed. Had he not permitted Godfrey to

possess illegal explosives in his home, the Guild Theater would

never have been bombed.

Without Mr. Christiansen there would

never have been any number of crimes committed in this community.

For the best of all possible motives, he too possessed

Watergate mentality and justified everything on the basis of

the results.

To him, apparently, the

"result justifies the

means."

Regardless of how much

lawbreaking there was.

Why

is not the District Attorney of this County seeking an indicinent

against Mr. Christiansen?

Does ir. Christiarsen claim "exuctive

immunity" as did the Watergate conspirators? Was the Fecezal

government justified in this sort of illegality ana immocality,

how?

The only possibility is that we citizens of this County

and of this National must accept immoral and illegal acts on

the part of our civil servants, justified because they act on

a higher morality than we near

mortals. Or, alternatively, we

may pose the question:

How deeply was the United States involvea

in the Godfrey-Christiansen conspiracy? Did Godfrey have

permission from the federal Bureau of Investigation

to violate

the

law?

Ras the Secret Army Organization really an arm of the

F.B.I?

Was it used by the E.B.I to do acts the FB.I. itself could

not do? Please -- Mr. Richarason -- answer the question.

paid by the FBI he participated in a shooting, several fire bombing:

and burglaries. It sets forth information indicating Donald H.

Segretti had been in the company of SAO members during the Summer of

1971 and discussed kidnaping "radicals" who might disrupt the

Republican National Convention.

The SAO was formed in san Diego, California, in 1971 by

Jerry Lynn Davis as an anticommunist, paramilitary group to replace

the white extremist Minutemen.

Godfrey, an FBI informant since 1967

was targeted to penetrate the SAO and subsequently became a leader ‹

'this group. He was cautioned, as are all extremist informants, not

to become directly involved in violent confrontations of activities

We have no information in our files indicating his active participa

tion in fire bombings, burglaries, or violent actions by SAo.

Specifically, we have no information relative to burglaries at ''The

Streeü Journal," described

as a left-wing newspaper, or the "Messag

SAO member who fired shots into the home of a local college professor

active in planning demonstrations at the Republican National Convention.

The shots resulted in the wounding of Tharp.

Godfrey, in january, 197:

advised SA Steven I. Christensen of the shooting and gave him the gun

used.

Christensen retained this weapon without advising the Bureau of

its existence.

on 7/5/72, after Godfrey was turned over to the

San Diego Police Department in order to obtain prosecution of several

SAO members, the existence of the gun was learned and it was recovered.

SA Christensen, on 7/6/72, after acknowledging receipt of the gun,

submitted his resignation.

Investigation of the SAO and testimony by former informant

Godfrey, Christensen and Special Agents of our San Diego Office during

local prosecution of SAO members, were coordinated with the Office of

Legal Counsel and Kevin I. Maroney, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

Internal Security Division.

By memorandum from C. L. Mc Gowan to MI. R. E. Gebhardt, dat:

6/15/73, captioned "Donald Henry Segretti," you were furnished informa-

tion indicating the "San Diego DoOr," an underground publication, made

inquiry of former SA Christensen regarding attempts by Segretti to

recruit the SAD to work for reelection of the President and that Davis

former SAO leader, stated he had no information regarding alleged

recruitment.

San Diego is being

instructed to promptly furnish any infor-

mation indicating statements in the article regarding Godfrey's actuai

involvement in illegal activities may be true.

Synopsis:

EXTREMIST MATTERS

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) Headquarters

and San

Diego Chapter have reportedly ceased to

exist as a result of arrest and prosecution of

members and associates in San Diego, California,

and because it has been revealed that HOWARD

BARRY GODFREY was a source within the SAO who

was reporting information concerning the SAO to

the FBI.

MEMBERS AND ASSOCIATES OF MEMBERS OF

THE SAO SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARIED AND DANGEROUS

IN VIEW OF THE NUMEROUS WEAPONS AND EYPLOSIVES

FOUND IN THEIR POSSESSION AND BECAUSE THEY HAVE

USED BOMBS AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN SHOOTINGS

IN THE PAST.

-P-

DETAILS:

ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

On October 8, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

leader of

the Secret Army Organization

(SAO) who is generally known

as SAM DAVIS, advised that the SAO is now "dead" as far as

San Diego is concerned.

(SD T-1, October 8, 1972)

During late October, 1972, JERRY LYNN DAVIS stated

that because of court proceedings against SAO members in

San Diego, California, the SAO has become a defunct

A small pocket of SAO members continue to

exist in Los Angeles, California, and two members remain

California, a

in the Seattle, Washington, area.

The unaffected elements

may possibly band together but under a different label.

(SD I-1, October 27, 1972)

On January 16, 1973, JERRY LYNN DAVIS was interviewed

by Special Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)

at San Diego, California. He advised that the SAO is now

no longer active because of the arrests of members in

san

Diego and because of the demoralizing effect of learning

that HOWARD BARRY GODFREY was reporting to the FBI concerning

the activities of the SAO and its members.

He said San Diego

had been the headquarters of the SAO.

Both the National

Headquarters and the San Diego Unit of the SAO have ceasad

to exist.

The only remaining group of SAO members might

possibly be a small group operating independently in

Los Angeles, California, undes a leader who DAVIS would

not identify.

DAVIS said he is completely disenchanted with

right-wing activity and will no longer participate in such

activity.

He intends to cooperate fully with law enforcement .

agencies. He complained that when he was arrested recently,

only one or two of his "right-wing friends" stood by him.

He intends to move out of the State of California and live

in Mississippi where he has relatives.

AT PHOENIX, ARIZONA

The state coordinator of SAO activity at Phoenix,

Arizona, has been instructed to include the State of New

Mexico in recruiting efforts

for the SAO.

(SD T-I, May 10, 1972)

In Arizona the SAO has mailed a considerable

amount of literature pertaining to the SAO to

"conservative"

thinking people, but has not at this time received response

from the type of people they wish to affiliate. Consequently,

no formal chapter or nucleus around which to organize has

been formed in Arizona.

However, a coordinator has been

named and is operating. Not all

former Minutemen will be

accepted into the SAO.

The SAO foresees a decentralized type of operation

in each state, where in a revolutionary situation brought

about by treasonous communist elements, the SAO could

present a militant front immediately.

Recent bulletin

material from SAO

Headquarters in San Diego has introduced

the thought that "the basic battle facing our country

today is the one between individualism and collectivism.

In its political form it appears as personal freedom versus

police-state regimentation.....In times of emergency, our

members

are not going

to depend on General Headquarters

for training material, bulletins and printed propaganda

items.

Local units

and often the lone individual will

have to improvise all these things. Communications to

and from higher commands may be uncertain and the transmission

of organization orders may be slow.

We must have people

who think for themselves.

Equally important, we must

have people who can

see

what needs to be done and. get at

it without being told."

ecret Army Organization "Comba

feam", we usvally think

of a small group of pooble mio live very close to one another.

Such an arrangement

has certain advantages, such as case of communication and travel for collective

training and team operations, but there are also several disadvantages.

• "Among iho disadvaniages are these: Team members may be well acquainted

with only a small geographica! arca. If forced in leave this aren the team may be

placed at a serious disadramage. l is harder for a toam of SO members who

live closely togcher to seep from auracting arention, thus unit security may be

poor. If one i caber of ihe toam is ever discorered and arrested by the encry,

a chances are that all members of the team will be rounded up together.

These considerations have caused us to esperiment with a new arrangemoni that

we refer to as a "Dispersed Team". Such a team hos the same number of members

(usually six) as a regular Cordbai Toani.

Eaci team is split into to sections as is

-the old team. The members have the same type of indivicual spcciaities and dudes.

The big difference lies in the fact that the team members may be located over

a comparativoly larger area - perhaps as much as 25 to 50 milos in diameier. In

urban areas one sean member mer lire in exca of sin afferent cities. Thus ile

team may range over a fairly large geographical area with at least one team menber

being lamiliar with the immediate territory through which they are traveling.

When potire as vart of an underground movemost (as opposed to the classical

formas of guerrilla warfare) the Dispersed Ican has several other advaniages.

• For example, in one meraber of the toam gets too "hoi" in his area, he antomtically

bas five other bite-ous to which he can go for essistones or to whieh he can sord

his family for temporars safety.

Ine Dispersed Team can couveniently cover a

larger arca in the Holds of recruiting, psycbological vortare, and propazanda.

Operations oi sabotage, suersiilance and harassinent of communist personnel,

raids, and ocher comont ipo operations can be sueccastully condieted while moving

a minimum of people over a minimum distance.

During the present period of deliberate delay the activities of the team wil

naturally be difterent leon some future period in which all out warfare between our

organization and our country's communist enemies develops.

Il the team is to achiove its ultimate objectirus the foilosing activities must

Charao-

cris-

ties, uses and manufacture of explosives will be dealt with in

another chapter.

A very simple device can be made from a screen door spring

that will explode an ordinary rifle cartridge when activated by a

trip wise. Although the "explosion" is almost harmless it can be

very nerve racking to an approaching enemy.

A more deadly booby trap consists of a short piece of pipe

which is driven into the ground, & plunger cype trigger rechanism

is dropped into the pipe and an ordinary rifle cartridge placed

point in in the pipe so that porhaps one-half inch is excosed

above the ground, The weiglit of a man stepping on the bullet

releases dio triggei and fires the cartridge which wiii penetrate

well up into the leg or the body.

Some maunanical triggurs are activated by friction just

like striking & maich on che rough matorial of the match cover.

Figure do. I shows a cut-away daving of the uos. Army firing

devies, puil friction type M-2. The coated wire is covezed with .

a skitty substance much like the strip on a book of matches.

When this is palled out through a container of flash compound

(chenically similer to the match heads) the friction ignites the

flash compound which may be used either to lighi a fuse or fire

a blasting cap.

crude üu: effective friction dovice can be prepared by

sticking the end of a fuse in some small cylinder Billed wich

natch heads through which is placed a small strip of tin or heavy

cardhoard with a friction strip fion natch books glued io both

sídes:

In fleid use the friction type ignitor can be hidden in

many ways connected with trip wires or attached to movable objects

to set off cither instant or delayed charges.

PeEral, IGNITORS, In some cases the ignitor, (fuse or primer)

can bo used as a trigger mechanism.

for example in lorid War iI

the Germans were known to tear down fireplaces and cement thea

back together with hidden charges that wouid ignite when a fire

was built.

A simple hond gicnade or anitar shell hidden in 3

hollow log by a burned out fire rould, of couse, explode if the

log tere used

as fuel without being inspected.

A common trick is for a retrenting army to leave behind coal

When anti-vehici mines are placed by regular.army forces

:

The use of booby traps is very adaptable to boch guerrilla

and counter-gucrili: activity. Guerrilla va-fare involves two

basic typos of action:

ambushes and raids. When the guerrilias

ambush rozular arty

forces, they are the ones that will make use

of the booby traps.

In railing an enemy garrison or supply depot

they must baware of booby traps thai the regular forces have

placed io protect their fixed

positions.

The embush may start when the leading vehicle of an enemy

column strikes a nine or drives

on to a bridge which is dynamited.

Parhaps time delay booby traps activated bj the first vchicle in

the coluan may be usod to destroy ocher venicies several positions

behind. Irnops riding in a truck convoy may be expected

to seck

cover in ditches beside the coad or other points of natural pio

tection. If these ditches have been booby trapped beforehand, they

will be killed in the very process of socking shelter.

Before noking iny raid on a fixed enems position, guerrilla

forces should carefully consider the potential danger of booby

traps.

When rogular arny forces are boirg harrassed by guerrilias

they may be exoseted to leave supplies badly nooded by the guerrillas

in slightly protected warcbouses as traps.

These supplies may be

hievaly booby trapped and rounter guerrilla forces may be wailing

a short discence away to ceke pursuit.

To guard against these

things: the guerrilla should atteapt to keep their target under

•surveillance for several hours or days before making the raid.

They should observa the coming and going of encmy personnel.

the enemy is very careful to always come and go by the same route

it may mean time othei routes are bochy trapped.

If the supplics

are noü added to or taken from regularly, this may indicate

that

they are bring used to bait a trap.

By scouting the goneral area

guerrilla forcus should quard against surprise by other enemy

forces waiting within donger distance.

After waking cithis a raid or an ambusi, gucrrilla forces

should place boaby treps dubind thom to

reds on it silver plater. Time and time again these "mistakes" have been concealed

from the people or hare been white-washed by persons in high goreramont office. How

can anyone slame ise american public for beginning to wonder?

All to olion people who have tried to call attention to these facts have themselves been

• smeared as "fascisis". "extremists"

people it "too busy" even to inform themselres as to the true nature of the communist-

some constructive action which they can enter into.

AS YOU FORM YOUT OWN GROUP KEEP THESE FACTS IN MIND:

(1) The underground needs all linds of people, young and old, men and women. Those

who the encar "sculd never suspect" can act as spies and messengers. The underground

needs many dittoront things in addition to fightors : sources of supply, lies of commu:-

icutions, a multilate of skills that can be supplied by many different kinds of pcoule.

(?) To roluntarily star training in the use of arms, especially in the abscnce of a dir

clared state of war, requires i deey personal conviction that this must be done now fui

the salration of ourseives and on county. If you do not believe this yourself you wit

noon be able to pass the necessary conviction to other menbers of your group.

(3) 1 small group that is resolute and dedicated will be more effective than a large

group containing people thal my cioubt the importance of their cause.

For a batalliun of men to attack the onemy in the face of gunfire requires courage. to:

one or tiro men to fight alone in the dark requires bravery. For the wires of such me

to spend the night waiting und wondering requires even greaici bravery. These are lie

Wo of pople vos MEST Colleci about vou.

It is nameal for thing things io want to keep on living. The kind of bravery we are tali-

ing about is rot something poopie are hom with. It is something that a person must de-

velop sphin bimself. It comes caly froin the absoluie belich thai our cause for freedom

is more important that aurthing else in this world.

Where can you fied such people? You tind them among your neighbors, among the people

you work with, among your friends and your relatives.

You might never guess it as jou

move among these peuge in their daily lives but there are countless numbers of lor-

icans who share this belief with you.

This doce not mean that such people are going to be immediately enthusiastic about

dorming in undergramd. Some mas, but others may never have had an opportunity to

fers only lo information that is

false and misleading.

Propaganda refers only to the use

of information to attract people to your way of thinking. Truth is the best possible kind of

propaganda.

Here then are the step-ly-slep suggestions on how to go about forming your own group:

1. Know the truth. Be abic to back up your view of the current situation with facts

and r'elerchces.

• 2. Make a list of everyone you know even casually: friends, fellow workers, neigh-

ebors, lodge or chich members and relatives.

3. Reno: old acquaintances. Get to reaily know these people. Feel them out on

curricht events, porities, and world aftairs. Let them know where you stand,

1. Do not choose people just because you think they would be willing to join yow

growly. Choose insted those that you want in jour group. Remember that if fight-

ing actually starts these people will be closely associated with you and themselves

for long periods of time. Eliminate the braggaris. Pick the quiet confident people

that son't get on each other's nerves when the going gets tough.

5. Aftor you hare decided on a list of five to helve people you are ready to give

thom: your "soles tali".

You can do this with each one individually of you can get

them together as a group ior this purpose. If you talk to them singly you can main-

tain a gronic degree of secrecy about other members of the group.

Group discussion has the adrantages that each prospect is more lilicly to take your

vier point seriously if he is sitting down among other people who seem to be tuking;

it seriously also. Since you wan't be taking up anything too secret during your

first ivo or three moctings. there will be plenty of time to eliminate any doubtlius,

or more lisely: they will eliminale themselves.

G. Wnother you talk to your prospective group members singly or as a group: your

first discussion should convince them of these things:

a. That the fee world is losing the cold war against communism.

be. That as things are now going we will keep right on losing and that soonct or

later americans may be forced to defond their oun property and their 0171

•families by wintever means are still available to them.

• c. That your small god; may not be able to do anything to change this situation

but in any dress you should get togeter regularly for at least i few meetings

to examine any possibilitics that may exist.

c De willing to acuit that thines may not actally be as bad as you believe but

gel jour prospective coup mcmices to al least admit that they owe it to their

coleo lo dieter the loris.

know no more aboat cour monbers of operations than necessary lo gain their coopera-

lion.

They will torm an auxiliary force to work with thie individual group member who is

responsible for their special iciivity.

The group leader, it he is to successfully maintain his position must by one means or

another make certain that all sis of these activities are provided for.

ORGANIZATION:

The onganization of the group is primarily the responsibility of the group leader. Hc

must intervies persorally each new prospociive momber and make certain that they arc

suitable material. This means more than simply being loval to the United Siates.

The

prespective member must be inpressed with the faet that he is undertaking a grave

respecult to must be made io undersiand that even though he has joined the group

on "Tuth" rather than from complete Inowledge of its overall activity: that withdraving

froin tie croup will noi be easy and that if he should in the future withdraw from the

group that he vali ever after he considered as suspect by the other group members. The

prospectise group member must he a type that will get along well with othor peoplo.

He must noi be a hraggart or a show-off. Under no circunstances must he become in-

toxicated or loose-mouthed, He must be a willing worker and ready to assume his share

of the lo.d.

The group leader shodd determine the stillis and interest of his mombers. He should

talk oron vith thom the carious tasks thai need to be performed and ask for voluntcors

until cach icember has a responsibility that they are interested in and that they are

capablo diffilling. Since membership in the organization is essentially voluntory

• the

group leader cano! force any member to perform any activity against his will and

should not attempt to do so. When a member assumes responsibility for a certain field

of activity ne must realize that he will be expected to fulfill that task successfuly re-

gardless of any other conditions that may arise. If a number is unwilling to assume

responsibility on this basis, ha should be given another responsibility that better fits

his capabilities or should be gracofully eased out of the organization.

INTELLIGENCE:

Intolligonce includes all types of information that may be of value at either the national

or local level. Scraps and bits of information that may seom of little value alonc may

eventally lit into o pattern that will someday procidc important information for either

defensive or odeneiro activi, either propaganda or open warfarc.

The group member in charge of intelligence should enlist the assistance of several

am-emmatat to hely gather this information. One or to of these should road all

the loed wed corind papers carcially crery day.

Il's surprising how much information

can in midled to trom those sources concerting individuals that may be aolive in commu-

nic fiem activity If ode or more memers el the group are union members, they should

peria the mion pipers for carmination.

An auxillary member should carciully evaluate all of the "Lelters to the Editor"' that

appear in various papers in the area.

Those who express especially patriotic senti-

ments and those who an outspoten in their defense of the merican constitution and

way of life should he truard pier to the recruiting officer who can contaci them as puien-

Li: membor's or custilary members. Those who advocate collectivism in any form shou.!

be turned ovar to the secury vilicer who can look up their full names, addresses, eic..

and file them aray among the potential tuncoals.

The inteligence oricer should evaluate ad the information sent to him by his auribary

members to determiur the sentiments of people in his area especially those in politics

or in a position in intuence other people. He should pass on lo the regional headquarters

nay icfornation that incolves national or international figures or organizations uhcre in

tum it will be compled with other information and sent on to the national headquarters.

SECURITY:

The security officer musthe responsible for secrecy within the group and about the

group. We have learned that those members whose memborship or identity becomes

krown will in all probability be subicot to abuse and harrassment from the liberals

ned connuaisis. Therelore; one major duty of the security officer is to proven: the

identity of the group's actual members from becoming laown.

He should also review from time to time the methods of communications between member-

of the group. He should insure the secrecy of the mecting places and the iraining sites.

He should arrange for at least to or more secret addresses for receipt and delivert of

mail heticen groups and particularly the regional coordinaior. He shoudd be carcivi

that the amount of mail, frequency of meetings, number of partied cars and similar cir-

cumstancos. do not draw attention to the group or its activities.

One ol the securly oncers most important projects is to arrange for a numoer of "sala

houses". Those are people botain city and rural arcas who have no contact with group

member's at all and who are quite ordinary in their daily life and yet have a strong syi

pathy for the organization. They must be willing to care for wounded members or pro-

vide niching places for group members that have been discorered by the chenis. if the

ard ils members will be declared outlawed and it is also possible that individud? montr

PROPAGANDA:

"Until such time as fighting mig

ctually break out we must copec

engage in a con-

tinuous propaganda wartare against the communists, communist sympathizers and dupes

within our borders. Our ultimate victory or defeat may depend on the outeome of the

propaganda battles that ve are fighting right now.

By planted newspaper articles and by slanted programs over radio and TV the enemy is

eren now trying to "sincar" us out of existence. They are also starting an all-out cam-

paig to outlaw the use and ouncrship of firearms by civilians.

During the cold war period the propagenda officer should act as a public relation man

for the organization in his locality. I is important that this individual make a good per-

sonal appearance and be able to speak and write well. Without actually acmitting that

ho is a inciber of the organization, he cai still contact various news modia, television,

ote, and ask thom to find out the true facts about the organization bofore blindly re-

peating hall truths and insinuations that come over the wire services or that they read

in other papers and maguzines..

Whenever lend popors car?y articles detrimental to the organization, he should have

all meinbers, auxillary mombers, their friends, rclatives, and associated groups food

that paper, radio or TV Station as the case may be with both signed and unsigned leltess

demanding a retraction.

In cases wicre some particular news media makos a habit of slandering the organizalion

oi when some particular nows commentator or TY personality does so repeatedly, then

the organization should write repeatcily to the companies that place advertising with

then to domand a retraction,

Articlas or comments which are actually libelous should be forwarded to the regional

headquariars ior investigation and the possibilily of law suits against the offending per-

sons.

The propaganda officer should prepare himself to speak publicly and should arrange lo

give talke to various civic organizations on the importance of the cilizen's right to seli

defense.

RECRUITING:*

The recruiting officer should discuss with other members of the group what additional

sills are needed and

1 wilh their help should attempt to enlist the assistance of people

who have such skills. He should cooperate with the socurity officer to delcimine wicther

or not prospective members are loyal to their country and have ideals in liceping with

our organization.

He should recrive from the intolligenee officer names of prospoctive

members or associales and contaut them to evaluate their possible usefulness lo the

Together with the secu

officer he should attempt to find

printer locally who will

supply the group with literature on an absolutely confidential basis. All of the other

members of the group should be contacted by the recruiting officer and passed on by the

securily officer after checking any information known about the prospective member with

the intellignece officer.

MEDICAL:

This man may be i ductor' or one skilled in first aid. In the latter case, he should malic

contact with a physician who will work with the group to provide necessary drugs, medi-

cal supplies and confidentiai assistance in time of need.

This momber will also be responsible for obtaining medical supplies and kcoping adequals

rescrves on hand. Ho should give consideration to the general health of all group mem-

bers and should encourage each member to maintain a maximun degice of physical

fimess for their age and circumstances. A medical officer should malic all grouy mem-

bers keep on hand a large amount of special rugs or medicine each member must for

his hesith.

COMMUNICATIONS:

This mumber of the groip should have or obtain a working knowledge of all radio equip-

•ment, feld telephone, codes and signals. If he is not an amatuer radio operator himsclf.

he should woin with the aceruiting officer to enlist the aid of onc or more amateur iadio

operators cither as group mambers or as associales. He should be responsible for pass

words and other words of identifying frichdly supporters. Hc should arrange suitable

code phrases by wrich essential information can be given over the lelephone betwcen grou

mombers without giving it away in case the phone is tapped.

ARMAMENT AND DEMOLITION:

The armanent officer, with the assistance of other group members should see that

ail of the groups equipment is safe to use and kept in good repair. He should have sui-

Ticient. kunsledge of firenims and weapons to instruct other members in their use and

maintenance.

He may designate other members to become specialists in certain lypes

of weapous and so forth.

Al loas! one group member shold make him self an expert in the use of all types of

explosives, body traps, time fuses, and similar material. In cooperation with the

armanch! officer and other group members he showd determine both immediate and

funds necds and sources of auch maicrials along with moans to obtain such items and

a also the raw materils from which these items can be quickly manufactured.

stried as raising an army which would be a violation of the law.

A

sugh ho may coor-

dinute the stock piling or obtaining of material, it must be clearly underslood by all that

each individual item is owned ly some individual member. The supply officer is pri-

marily responsible for the storage of reserve materials.

Each group should prepare a number of escape and crasion kits. These showd be of

thrce types:

1.:

A very small kit which cach member can carry on his person.

2. A suitcase size kit that can be liept in the car or home at all times.

3. An inexponsive lit that can be buried at strategie places or hidden in other

strategic localities.

TRANG:

The training schedule may be arranged for by the group leader or he may elect to

assign this responsibilily to a training specialist. In either case an inventory should

be made of the various stilis, talents, and kowledge of each member. All members

should discuss logother the thrity different paris of the initial training program. They

shold diade those sections up among thosloves so that some member can road and

siudy caci subject prior io the training session and be prepared to instruct the other

members in his oin speciality.

FIXANCES:

Although the individual group members must be self sustaining

as far as their individual

equipment is concerned, there will be many expenses that must be met collectively. To

fight the propaganda war requires printing, postage, trarel, and so forth. Although the

individuai group members may be able to meet this espense to a minimum degree they

will not in most cases ba able to finance the maximun effert that is required. The fin-

ance officer should thercfore consult with the other group members as to means of rais-

ing additional money. One possible source will be from peopic who will agree with the

aims of the organizatich in theory but who are unwilling or unable to take an active

part in the program. Such people may be willing to set up a serics of regular monthly

contributons to hely finance our fight against communism.

In small groups one member may have to doubie up ou tiro of these duties. In Jarger

groups, the division of responsibility may he spread. among a greater number of indi-

viduals did still other duties may be assigned to individual members,

The important thiag is to modi regularly and discuss your mutual problems. If euch

meither has a job he is interested in and leeps busy it, morale wid stay high and you

will really set trings done. Without such team work the group members will soon lose

interest and becoie discomraged..

There are great many wogs in which women can be a valuable aid to the group cither

as members or assoc

s. Each group should obtain by

means the part time service

of one ol more secretaries who can type up literature to be printed, articles to the

newspapers, communications between groups and so on. Much of the intelligence work

can be nundled by women. They can assist the propaganda effort by handing out litera-

ture, giving talks to women's clubs, PIA associations and so forth.

It is felt that it would be a mistake to sot down hard and fast rules for the group's con-

duct and activities. To do so would run the risk of making each group a carbon copy of

every uli.cr group and possibly of stifling individual ingenuity. One of the greaiest ad-

vantages that an underground has is the simple fact that the enemy never knows what he

"is up against.

The group leader must continually merit the respect and confidence of his members. This

respcct is the only incans he has of maintaining discipline. Before taking any action,

all members of the group should hare an opportunity to voice their opinions. But it must

be mutually understood that when the discussion is over, the group leader must make tic

tinal decision. His decision must be complied with and in return for the compliance, he

must bear responsibility for the groups ultimate failure or success.

Past experionce has shown that the successfil underground leader: must possess certain

minimal qualifications:

1. He must hase a strong personal conviction as to the righteousness of the cause

for which he is Ogiting.

2. He must have the ability to infuse other members of his group with this same

conviction.

3. Ile must be able to exercise effective command over his group through personal .

loyally and political enthusiasm when no other means of discipline are available.

He must be able to keep secrets and organize crch quite important actions so

that as few people as possible low his plans.

5. He should be a born conspiralot, capable of decciving not only the enemy but

evon his members of his own group if this is necessary to insure absolute securit.

6. He must be able to act inventively and imaginatively so as to constantly scize

the initiative away from the enemy.

%. He shoud have risen to his position of leadership through his own abilities and

execution.

S. He cheuld he phusically vigorous and self-denying so that he can accommodate

himsell to primitive surroundings.

9. He should have no addictions of strong habits thit might distract him at sume

crucial musicit.

10. He must have the bulloog tenacity to see that important tasks are completed

no maller what difficuties or obstacles may be placed in his path.

11. He must have the pationce to remain inactive when such is the best course and to

wait for exuclly the right time to strike.

12, He must have the moral courage to accept full responsibility for his own actions

and those of his group.

You should think these requirements orer carchily. How do you measure up? Il's best

ifle aumil our weak spots to ourselves and start now to strengthen ourscires for the

trials ahead. With advance preparation, seli-discipline and a firm resolve we cau meet

the lest.

The human rose is much inclined to wishful thunking. Even though the communist have

lold is that they will never rest until they have conqured the whole worid, most people wil

no allow themselves to even consider this cossibility. as war clouds gather on the horizon,

most peopie focus their attention all the more on other things and hope that if they just

ignore the threat of war it will somehow disappear.

When the line for underground warfare suddenly comes there will be a hundred civilians

wanting to fight for every one that is trained or equipped to do so. Under these conditions

each member of pur or ganization and similar groups thai are making ready for this

emergency will sureiy und himself acting as leoner of an underground group. As a pari

of your self-training it is thus recessary to give some thought as to how you can quickly

train new recruits, how you can maintain discipline and security. In short, you must give

some serious advance thought as to your own abilities and possible short-comings as an

underground Icader.

SE OF AMMONTUS NITRATE IN

GH EXPLOSIVES

atfe

Ammoniun nitrate is a common furtilizer used on Irms throughout the United States

and most foreigu countries. I is readily availablo from farm agencies, general sionca

fertilizer comparies, die. in most farning communities.

Most people imow thei cmonium nitrate can be used as the basis for various high

explosire mixtuc:. Tattle information has been available as to the best proportion,

uses and means oi detonating, these mixtures.

Depending on the methed of mancincture armonium nitrate may occur as irregular

§Talus, fries, small crystels or spall round "prills". Any of these types can be deci

but prilled co montum neute is mosi ofücient, f'ortunatoly, the prilled type is also

the most common.

Explosive mixtures my be made by mixing ammonium nitrate with such organic

compounds 23 full oil; powerca cool, lamp black, eir.

Its quite possible that powercu

sugar, starch, and mony similar compounds could also be used but further experimen:-

ation is nerded. Ammonium nitrate itself is extremely difficult to detonote.

Th: most common and probably tro lost all sound mixture consiste of 91% prilied

ammonium nitrate rug 0C, fuei oil, In this easo to iorm fuel oil can include No. ?

diesel fuel, kerosche, light lubricating oil, etc. The culy requiremenis are that it be

thin enough to he readily absorbed by the rather porous prills of ammonium nitrate and

on the other hand it must not be so volarile as to evaporate easily.

The amount of fuel oil can vazy from 27 to 13m and the mixture will still exploss

profidad inat il strong detonator is used. Maximum explosive force is achieved betvee:

5% and 6i These percentages are figured by weight. Presumably the best percentace.

of lanip black: or finely povered coal would be approtimately the samo.

Because tiese mixtures are comparatively insensitive they all require a rather

strong explosive to start the detonation. In neorly all cases a one pound sticle (ded inch:

of 60% dynamite will suffice.

The dynamite itself must, o course be detonated i"

suitable blasting cap. One stick of 40% dynamite does not have chough power to deton

an ammonium nitrato-muel oil mixturo coliany, li this is all that is availeble, tarco

sticks iied toucher shouid be used.

The shape as well as the size of the actooter has an offect. For amble, it an

This will increase it reliabiliis over thai achicoed by a single eight inch stick.

Several other factors ofleet the efficiency si AN-FO (ammonium

nitrate-lucl oil)

mixtures.

Among these are the amount of explosive used in a single charge, degree

of confinement, moisture content, purticle side temperature, etc.

AN-FO mixtures are commonly used in mining rock or ore from large open pits.

In this application, holes are drilled back into the rock and the At-FO mixture is poured

into the holes. Normally, the ammonium nitrate and the luel oil are carried separately

to the mine and are mixed together just before they are used. The holes into which the

AN-FO mixiero is pourer are usualiy several icet long. In this case the diameter of the

hole has consiccruble effost on the caplosive losse generated.* A hole diameier less than

threc inches will not explode with suiticient force to carry itseli along the bore hole. The

• maximum detonation velocity reonires that the hore hole be at least six inches diamoter.

In using smaller amounts of AN-FO mixtures the charge should be kopt approximately

equal in dis lougth, waith and dopth, In practical opplication a container about the wize

ni a tire gallon ga can do co sicall as can be laca. Chargos the sire of à 55 gallon drun

can provide much more explosive force in proportion to their weight. A small amount of

AN-FO peguiras just as strong a priner to doionaie as does a larger amount.

Close confinement is reguired lo achiere maximum explosive force from AN-FO

mixtures. in nuining operations the rock surrounding the charge provides this confine

ment.

To bi explodud abore ground the AN-lO maure should be confined in an iron

pipe not less than teree inches in diamotor and pectorably larger. Since these mixtares

nee "paching" lope coplosives

rather than "shatering" tapes they must be properly placed

10 achieve usciul results.

Suppose the objective was to destroy a large bridge. A dozen five gallon cans of

AN-FO minute are available to do the job. If those sze set in the middle of the bridge

or between the girders and "exploded" jule it any real damage will cesuit. In this case,

a tannel should be dug through the dirt lohind the concreta abatrent at one end of the

bridge. Dupending on the width of the bridge all melve cans of explosive could be packed

lightly together at they could be spaced three to four feet apart. In cither case each can

shouki be provided with iis own primer and all the primers should be lied logsther with

two lengths of prima cord.

Moisture content of the ammonium nitrate is very important. This chemical absorbs

moisture from the air quite casily. After being mixed with the fiel oil it is protected

from this to a considerable calent. For maximum explosive effect the AN-FO mixture

should corain to more tam t? males and if the moisture content excoods t it may not

explode at sil.

If it is suspected that the AN-FO misture may be damp, double the size

of the detonaer.

«IN

Poe military use, suitable changes could be made from dey ammonium nitrate mixed!

with to pemper mope of fail oil and thin pleeed in water tight containers, Those coi-

tainers shoud goride some neons of crickly placing the doteaster into the approximate

conter do the chare just before it is de be used, Jhe usual cost of ammonium nitraio

is about si Ol get 100 pounds.

UNDERGRDUND BULLETIN

GENERAL HEADQUARTET'S

MAY 1972

"siberty has never come from the government. The history of Liberty is the history of

the limitations of government power, not the incrense of it. "

Woodrow Wilson

Fellow members,

Evory few days the American people are presented with reneived evidence of treason

wiltin our own countly.

Soine of our national leaders have bacome so brazen that thay

now icadily somit lo things which a low jears ago would have resulted in public indigoston

to the poini of revolurion. Good propaganda is noi recognized as such and for forty years

at least,

the American people have been subily brainwashed to the point that their apathy

and indifference is a sickness.

In our organiactional literaure we have often stressed that the basic battle facing our

country today is the one between individualism and collectivism. In its political forin it

appears as pereonal freedon vorus police state regimentation. This war can only be won•

by personal initiative.

In times of emergency, our members are not going in be abie to dopend on General

licadquarters for training material, bulletins and printad propaganda itoms. Local wits

and often the lone indiridual will hare to improvise ail those things.

Communications to

and from higher commands may be uncertain und the transmission of organization oders

may be siow.

We must hure people who think for themselves. Equally important, we must have

people who can see what needs to be cone and get at it without being told,

In a combat

emergency individual toat and group lendors must he able to carry on the battle at the

local iovel without direet support or contact with higher command.

a ivery wi: should establish a pro-emergency command post which can be activated e!

shrie! notice once fighting breaks out. The location of this cormand post should be kout

secrettrom all umi members, except those needed to set it up. The site could be tit

uf a garage, basements rented building, cle. If the communists ever attempt a genera:

ronder of 9.0 members the nit must have a scours site to reireat to, reorganize, and

The question of loaring for a mooting must be thoroughly planned. It is particularly

both a rcasonable and required time, how to explain their visils to certain public places,

Recommondations For The Conduct Of SAO Officors

Engaged In Personal Communications

Conduct of a meeing is the basic phase of resistance operations. lectings play

an imperint role in the iraining of the individual resistance member. Therefore they

should be conducied in & precise, well-planned manner, with a thorough knoiledge of

the case and paring arention to all circumstances. During the meeting the officer must

not only describe the order of the meeting with the member and the cover story lor the

mecting, coxion the instructons for the alienate inceting, hear the member's report,

and assign him iasks, but he must also instruct him in various mattors, listen to his

questions, and give him competent answers. The ofticer must take a constant interest

in the member's peroonal allairs and situation so thai the momber can be cautioned in

advance, if nead be, about possible errors in his conduct.

Because mectings should not be too lengihy, the officer musi be well prepared for

each mecting. Daring the mesting he must be alert to caich the most fleeting changes

in the member's mood.

To a large estent, an oficer's authority depends on his con-

duel, his discussion of opurational matters, the ability in conceal the fatigue which he

might be fecling after a long irip and many security chocks. Nor should he show any

nervousness, whaterer the esternal reasons might be. If the officor exhibits stability

and self-control, the member will acquire confidence in working with our organization.

The conduct of an officer bears diroctly on his work with memhers. The people

with whom me officer comes in contact mast be convinced that all this actions and his

bearing are determined l his job, by the nature of his persoual life, and by his cultura!

Lasies.

He mast accustom hose around lim to a pattern of actisities which naturally

incluries underarmed bodli. To mercome the dictacles of counter-intelligence,

Tort

It lie is sure that heds not under surveilies, the officer uses this trip to the cit lo f

a holler knowledge of the city

choose mucting places, dead d

s, and locations for

pusting signals, and lo select and confirm routes along which cheens can be made for

surveilance.

It he detects surveilance, the officer must act according to a previously

conccived cover plan.

It would be helpful if an tnderground incher could give tie impression that he is

fond of taking walis about the cil!.

At the same time, he must tiy to learn the methods

of suzicilance, in order not to shor his familiarity with the modus operandi of enciny

counter-intelligerce personcol. Similarly, an underground member who is under sui-

veilance must ect exhibi: nectrueness oi do anything which is unnatural.

Every SAO ofticer who bandles other members must hare previously selected and

soll-learned routes which afford the most favorable opportunitics for the delection of

suricilance.

A check route may inolude travei by autombile (which can then be parked on a side

strect or in some city garage; the use of uncrowded streets, especially in those arcas

where poulel surveilance is impossible; travel by subway or bus with severai transtors

al quite siations; visits to large stores and other buildings with numerous entrances and

exits. At the sume time chai such routes are being selecied, a good cover story should

also be deveioped to explain to undorground member's presence in a ceriain area.

When different members of a resistance movement meet cach othor for the first time,

the identity of each should be comfirmed by prearranged signs and countersigns. The best

sign: is a question, ond the countorsign, the answer to the question.

Both sign and couni-

ness, initiative, and creativity, and to solve all problems with originality and with due

consideration to local conditions.

In communications via a live drop there is no personal contact butween the member

and the officer. Operational mierials froin the comber to the case officer, and vice

versa, are passed ihrough a thiid porson who more oficn than not is the proprictor of a

small private business ¡book stores, gas stitions, antique stores, drug stores, etc.)

2. IIPERSOXAL COMNILNICATIONS

Under the complex opcrating conditions that will confront any resistance movement in

the. United States, most communications will be by indirect methods. Esperience has

shown tha: this is the most secure type of communication, because there in no direct con-

tact between members,

Impersonal communication is lised to pass operationel materials, to assign missiors,

and to pass materit! (technical cupplies), to the unit leader and individual member.

The basic forms of impersonal communications are radio communications, dead drops:

postal-telegraph systems, telephone, press, und communications sia signals.

Radio Communications

Ultrashortware julify radio sets may be used for communications under some condit-

ions. These sets gready immore the efficiency of undergiound communications.

They

haré a small operating radius. Nevertheless, while on the air, accidental or intentional

radio monitoring is possible; and the resistance movament cannol afford to ignore this

consideration,

The use of specially dovised codes, ciphers, signal system, and operating

schedule males the use of this set completely secure. Radio communications can be used

to call members together for an emergency moeting, to inform a member when a dend droy

hus been loaded or unloaded, to notify him about a change in dead drops, etc. UllF radis

can also de used Sao commands le assign missions io membors and to receive intolligenee

infermation from them. Radio communications over Uilt must be kept shori.

To hide com cadentions via will, one must set upd schedule for radio contact. This

schedule presided int a location loo cach radio station, the precise time to start sending

Dond-Deop Communications

Doad drops may be extens

lised for com-mmications with

In underground noissork.

The use of dead drops in communientions with members has sereral adrantages over per-

sonal meetings. Some of those advaniages are:

1. Dead drop communicalions are safer as licle is no direct contact between officer

and member.

2. They are more secure, because the member need not know the officer with whom.

lie is in contact via the dead drop.

3. When necessars; it is possible to replace or substitute one officer with another.

*1. There is the possibility of wide llexibility in time.

The use of dead drops, however, is not without drawbacks. The dead drop is aw

intermerlito links between the officer and member, and materials placed in a dead diop

arc outride their e-utrol for a certain longuh of time. Thorolore we must reduce to a

minimum the length of lime during which materials are located in a dead drop.

In psgotice, stationary, portable, and mobile dead drons are used. Stationary dead

drops are selected ca spocially prepared in parks and squares, in trees, in the ground,

in fences, in benches, in monuments.

in public buidings, and beyond popuinted places

such as foresis, fields, seashores, direrbanks, etc.

In selecting and provaring a dend drop in a park, one must bear in mind that squireis

or othor animals can destroy the dead crop (especiaily in holio trees) or carry the mossage

off.

As a mile, a dead drop is used only one time, atter which a different one is used. It

is preferablo to adopt a system consisting of a reries of dead drops for each member. One

should work out a schedule for using doad drops so that the member will know the dend drop

to be used in danuati, the one to be used in Ecbrunis, etc. The schedule can be prepared

for a half joas er for a full year, depending on the number availaole.

•The use of portable doad drous is more worthy of consideration because it is consider-

ably easier io find places for them. We have no particular ditficulty in finding places that

papers, eic.). Often these objects lie about in plain sight for long periods of time without

arousing any interest. Among such objeets, which are of no ise to anybody, and which.com

be found in yards, in parks, etc., an underground ofticer can leave a similar object with

material lus a member concealed in it at a preselecic place to have it picked up later by

the menther.

• American honschold articles, medicinos, and many other ilems are packaged in ali

kinds of borer, cans, lobes, cases, and made of cardhoard, melal and plastic. Hence

there is in extremoly wide selection of packages ishich can he used as poriaile doad drops.

Amone the ioma which con be used as portable dond drops and which can be propared in

advance are pieces of unod, stone, brick, clay, cement, plastic, and others.

In communications through a dead drop the member receives his assignments in

written form. These member assignments must be encoded or enciphered. Also, the

material itself ninst be in a form suitable for pussing through a dead drop. Therefora

we must trin the underground member in the use of ciphers, codes, the proparation

of soft emulsion film, microdot, and secret writing.

The types of signals and the places for posting them in connection with doad drop

communications are the same as those which were discussed in the seution on personal

mectings. Here we need only to emphasize the particular importance and convenience

of radio in exchanging signals.

several hours bofore the operation (no later than two hours) the officer travels to

the cily.

We uses the time available for & thorough check to determine whethei or not

he is under surveilance. At iho same time, he checks a prearranged place to see if a

danger signal has been posted.

As a rille, the chock: for a danger signal is made in an

area wher than the area where the dead drop is located.

Having dotermined that he is not under surveilance and that there is no danger signal,

the officer goos to the dead drop. In the immediate vicinity of the dead drop ho must

once more contem that conditions are right; then, without losing any time, so lo the

dead drop, load (unload) it, and proceed on ihe prescribed course.

Ou his return irip the resistance officer can place his signal that the dead drop has

boon loided bladed). These same rules hold true for individual members ingaged in

using dead drop communications.

The Clandestine Use Oi Postal,

Telegraph And Telephone Systems

• :The postal and telegraph system are most valuable in the sending of concealed under-

ground messages. Secist messages must in no way differ from an urdinary letic, either

in superficial appearance or in their overt contents. When making clandestine use of the

postal und iciegraph system to send organizational messages, members of the rosistarce

morement must make full use of ciphers, codes, secret iriting, and other meuns of

concealing the message being sent.

The most convenient telephones for in underground member te use are those locate

in large departmel stores, train or bus stations, drugatores and outside pay phones.

By moans dr inocent sounding code words it is possible to use a underground member's

phone even chen it's laped.

Do within the context of the conver

cation.

Experionce shows that individual members not intrequently forget the communications

arrangements, resulting in a break of the work routine. It is, therefore, advisable to

check periodically the member's knouledge of individual parts of the communications system,

including code words and their meaning.

. If the unit officer plans to use a telephone when organizing a communications network,

he must give e mious consideration to the use of cui-out telophones. As a rule, a cut-out

telephone is called from a public tolophone. Such conversations are in code and should

correspord to the cut-out telephone ouner's work so that they will not vazy in the loasi fron:

the owner's daily teleplione conversations.

Signals can be given over the telephone ( by

voice or by rines. In transmitting signals over the iclephone,

we must pay attention to

the time set for the signal; the time of das, code phrases, and the number of rings should

be changed frequently.

The Use Of The Press As A Sigmiing System

The United States has about two thousand daily newspapers with a circulation of abo.it

fifty-seven million, and more than seven thousand magazines. Most give considorable

space io advertisements and all kinds of announcements.

Miny advertisements can be adaptod quile casily to the transmittal of information.

Among the code words which can be used are: the names or doscription of a lost article:

a discription of line circumstances; the place and lime lost; the size of the ravard offered

for its relu?s, etc.

In arranging communications insolving the use of the press, it is necessary to specity

the purticular rewspaper or magazine in which the coded intolligence information will sppour,

the approximate date uf publication, anci the form of the correspondence (advertisemont or

annesncenient).

The Usc O: Signals

As & rule, signaling plays an auxiliary role in organizing communications. When

using dear! drops and when holding personal meetings and recognition meetings, under-

ground members use signaling a great deal.

Signals should be varied as much as possible. We must make sure that the signals

are natural and do not attract the attention of in outsider. Thuy must be sufficiontly cloar

and precise to proclude any misinterpretation.

a Numbers can exchange signals at a distance while in sight of each other. Various

objeers may be used lor tbis (handkerchicks, gloves, cigarettes, ete.) as woll as certain

coince of clothind and other means.

For comple, if a member on look-out duty remicred

his jackel, it could serve as a warning to othors engaged in in assigntent or raid.

Object signals are vrious small objects put in a specific, prearranged place. The

the most natural signals. Signals can also be made by sending the underground member

books, magazines, or merchandise from self-scivice sores (markets) where it is the

practice io deliver those things to the home.

A large variety of signals allows great diversification in the use of signals and pre-

vents pattorns. Certain signals (graphic and objeci) are used with dead drops; others

(light signals, and soued signols transmitted by phone or radio) are used to call a member

given through the mails or pross) is used for communicating with the commands HiQ.or with

civilian population in their territory as the civilinas nay be their

22. It is almost essential that the guerrilla band have at least

one

This hide-out nay be in some large Eciest or

mountainous area but such is not always necessary. During lorid Hat il

industries of activities vital. to the cacmy at that particular tina.

42. Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to

achieve maximum damage to the chony with least risk to the guerrilla

then buzning a varchouse full of gans will not count for much wiereas

burning a varenouse full of armunition vould ba a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be plannad in such

a manner that the arount of armunition and supplios capturad are at

dependent upon accurate knowledge of the enery's strength, location,

best obtained first hand by guerrilla scouts.

Investigation by the Mobile Office during the past

year has reflecied that Murdock is the icader of the group

referred

as the "Idontity Group".

He refors to himsel

as Reverend MURDOCK and the organization Ministry of Christ's

Church.

The group meets each liednescay night 'at MUrDOck's

residence.

WILLIAM POTTIE GAL iS alSo referred to as Colonel

GAIt and Rererend Gale, leader of the Ministry of Christ's

Church, Post Difice Box 123, Glendale, California.

At wackly noctings at che Minock residence, tapes vi serons

by GALl are played.

A Mobile informant attending these

have been had concernins

"Posse Comitatus".

Members of

U.S. Christian Posse associalth, organized under the

auspices of the linistry of Christ's Chuich,

stated by

this sroup to be able to make ucrests and trial by citizens:

jury in event local Sherifl fails to perfor a lauful duty.

MURDOCK and other members of his group at Mobile

have likewise refused to pay Foderal income taxes and

reportedly have urged others to refuse to pay income taxes.

Investigation of MurDock and the "Identity Group""

at Mobile is continuing, and my pertinent intormation

developed vill bo reported to the Bureau and inierested offices.

IN VIEW OF GILLINGS' STATEMENTS, HE SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED MNED AID DANGIOUS.

in

and had been receiving telephonic death threats as the

resuli of their political activities, CHRONIS wrote that

these have escalated to the point of written death threats,

which was why he was enclosing the above items. CHRONIS

that the prinary responsibility for investigation of this

matter restel with the FBI.

The abowe matter was discussed on 1/9/73 with

Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) BRIAN J. O'NEILI,

Chief, Criminal Complaints, United States Attorney's Office,

LOS Angeles.

Mr. O'NEILi advised he woula aecline

prosccution in this matter since there was insufficient

evidence to prove a violation of the Federal Extortion

Statute as no specific or direct threat was contained in

the letters to the SARNorrs, as furnished by CHRONIS.

CHRONIS was advised of AUSA O'REILI'S opinion

on 1/9/73. He stated he had rather expected such would

be the case. - He was further advised that if the Sariorrs

feared for their personal

safety, they should contact local

police

authorities.

He retorted, among other things, that

he did not f'erl this would solve anything, and he could see

no justification Ior the iBI not proceeding on an

Re:

Secret Army Organization (SAO);

Tax Rebellion Committee (TFC)

With respect to the National Association to. Keep and Bear

Arms referred to in referenced airtel, you should through established

scarces discreetly ascertain nature of its activities, identities of

its officers, relationship with SAD cr other extremist groups, and

any other pertinent information which will assist in making a determina-

tion as to whether an extremist-type investigation should be initiated.

Expedite and furnish iIIQ your reconmendation in this regerd.

Sacramento and Los Angeles review indices and conduct a

discreet inquiry through established roirces to identify Faverend Cail

mentioned on Page 3 of referenced airtel. Los Angeles make a

recommendation as to whether active investigation should be conducted.

San Diego conduct necessary investigation to identify

INFORMANT

and determine the extent of his

involvement in extremist activity. It is noted Calvin Hendell Fox,

Bufile 157-2033, SDfile 157-3170, is a known associate of the SAO.

-

NOTE:

The TRC is an organization ostensibly designed to challenge

taxation and embargass the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Limited

investigation to date suggests the possible involvement or influence

of the extremist SAO, Minutemen organization, and a group calling

itself National Association to Keep and Bear Arms on the TRC and/or

its membership. Gillings, 41-year-old male Caucasian who operates

a service station in Iracy, California, has been involved with the

IRC and has stated the country is on the verge of collapse and some

people in the movement were planning to assassinate the President,

Vice President, and others of "leftist tendencies." Gillings is also

being investigated in a Threat Against the President matter.

In view of the extremist remarks of individuals associated

the extent of its membership's involvement in white extremist activity

and other violations within the jurisdiction of the FBI. Maintain

contact with astablished sources and informants for infomation regarding

NOTE:

Calvin Hendell Fox in May, 1972, was identified by former

Bureau informant Howard Barry Godfrey as one of the most rabid and

violent new members of the paramilitary, ultraconservative, anti-

communist SAO. Godfrey furnished information that soon after the

attempted assassination of Presidential candidate George Wallace, Fox

indicated he was going to Washington, D. C., to do some demonstrating

of his own. Investigation to develop background information and the

license number of Fox's autonobile. resulted in SA Arthur J. Hooper

and former SA Steven I. Christensen making inquiry at Fox's service

station where an employee of Fox's looke through Fox's file cabinet

.in a futile attenpt to find the license number of Fox's automobile.

As indicated above, Fox, during testinony in the trial of William

Francis Yakopec, alleged the FBI had planted a document in his personal

files on 5/18/72. Fox, because of his testimony, has been indicted

for perjury. Testimony by SA Hooper, during the Yakopec trial, and

testiniony by Fox's former employee, Gregory I. Pitran, refuted

Fox's

allegation.

This matter has been coordirated with SA James L. Williamsc

of the Office of Legal. Counsel.

Report by raResT

Rebruary 1, 1975

SUBJECT: Ron Eddy; George Mitchell Hoover.

It has been ascertained that at this time Ron Eddy of Poway

is not interested in trying to form or lead any type of security force

for any right-wing extremist group. When asked by James K. Warner

of Los Angeles (via Dennis LOsO of Escondido) if he would do this,

Eddy stated that he would like to see the formation of a security

Force with teeth in lt but does not consider himself to be enough

of a leader to do it himself.

While declining to lead a Security Force, Eddy did say thai

the only way to stop FBI infiltration of rightist groups would be

3or one of the infiltrators to "wind up in the river" someday. Eddy

is positive that Iom Knight's San Diego unit of the Nazi Party has

a regular FBI infiltrator. The only ihree men of whom he is not. eus

picious are Mickey Walefield, Ray Wilson and Gerald Smith. Said Eddy,

"Those three men aropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

but you can bet that the fink is still in there pushing".

Joso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey

should be learned and they should be telephoned and intimidated.

Eddy said he thinks such intimidations roula be a waste of time and

chat people like Godfrey should be killed. Mickey Wakefield of San

Marcos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

having had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who commits himself to one

organization in the Far Right should not be involved with others.

Ke says he would be very suspicious of anyone who is. He is also

somewhat suspicious of lom knight. He says that Joe Brinker gave

Knight

the same of a man interested in Nazism and two weeks later

the FBI interviered the man. Also, Eddy wonders how knight

saved

his federal job in the face of his continued Nazi activities. Eddy

Leels that any regular rightiet extremist who stays on with the kazi

Party now miut warrant heavy suspicion of being an isl informant.

On Friday night, January 31, 1975 Fon Eidy net Tom Metzger of

Fallbrook for the first time. Netzger showed judy some pictures and

slides of New Christian Crusade activities and the two seemed to hit.

it off pretty well. Metzger told Eddy, Wakerield and Ioso of a vialt

George Mitchell Hoover

Here is one last bit of information. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the secret army Organization.

At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe liccar

Geoxge Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named R. Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom lom Metzger knows

Is going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressran

In Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

• to investigate the fBl. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

activities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoove:

from

¡Prison. By the way, the NCc people do not refer to Hoover by.

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

As to my thoughts on the MCC, I feel that this group has the potential to

comand much more support from a broader base of people than most of the righting

extremist groups. It

seems significant to this informant that men like Vic "alton

and Bill hiller would actually get up the nerve to take to the streets in union,

a thing they never did for the Nazi Party although both supported it.

**.

It is also noteworthy that the NCS was able to draw supporters from so many

other extremist groups. Taking part in this demonstration were elements fron the

Nazi Party, the las Rebellion Connittee, the National States Rights Party, the linasti

of Christ Church and the old Secret army Organization.

Also, this group does not automatically get adverse responses fron the public

RCT: Posse Conitatus.

During the last two years this informant has yent a great deal

ime studying the tactics, personalities and stated goals of both

National Socialist White People's Party and the Ministry of Christ

ich. Until recently I considered the HSiPP to be more of a threat

he security of peace and law in the United States than the rice but

events of recent months have caused me to change my view of these

groups about 180 degrees. I now regard the lic to be a far greater

ice than the kSiPP is likely ever to become.

The main reason for my change of relative attitudes toward these

groups has been the incrcased preoccupation of certain NCC members.

• Posse Comitatus. Also known as the Christian Posse Association,

organization serves as the paramilitary arm of the NCC. The goals

its most ardent activists seem to be very similar to those of the

is but their tactics are quite different. Instead of wrapping them-

res in the swastika, they uphold the Christian Cross as their symbol.

ike the head-on street clashes which many of the Nazis seem to relish,

bers of

Posse Conitatus generally tend to prefer being secretive ara

adestine in their operations. They generally seem to fancy themselves

pe revolutionaries and as fanatical as some of then appear, I believe

potential exists ior the posse to become a truly revolutionary group.

Dennis Loso was at one time a major financial supporter of the

FP. He has renounced that group since 1972 but not because of its

poses but only because he considers it to be ineffective. He is noi

edicated supporter of the ICC and its national leader, "illiam Gale.

• almost never misses an ICC meeting in San Diego, frequently visits

Glendale meetings of MCC, and more recently attended the NCC seminar

kanassa Ranch in Hariposa. If loso is not already an officer within

se Conitatus, then the potential certainly exists for him to become

•. Loso is also an adrirer of Jack Fredericks and was just elected to

San Diego County Central Comittoo of the Amcrican Independent Party.

Welt Kendall, another ex-Nazi supporter who has turned to the Mcc,

also a potentirl activist fox Posse Comitatus. Kendall attends perhaps

#of Gale's meetings in San Diego and is definitely not bothered by

prosycet of using violence to attain political goals. He once sug-

ded that sherifi John Duffy of San Diego County should be assassinatra.

Jexry Busch, a li.a. Karl: Roberts, is another man to vatch. " He

Eddy stated, however, that he is very distrustful of anyone whom

he has not known for a very long time and would definitely do some exter-

sive chucking into a porcon's background before trusting him as a con-

federate in any terririst activity. Eddy seems to enjoy violence but

he is also a clever, intelligent man and should never be underestinates.

I regard him as being one of the most dengerous people named in this

report even though I do not believe hin to be a member of Posse Comitatus

as yet.

Vic Walton is another figure who is likely to have a hand in the

organization of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. This attorey,

in this informant's opinion, presents no threat of physical violence

whatever but he serves as a

sort of liaison man between the various

right wing extremist groups in the Southern California area. He is

intelligent and seems to be fairly well off financially. Through him

many others can be reached as lalton has been involved with people in

the NiPP, the NCC, the SAO, Comparet's group and virtually any other

extremist outfit in the right-wing which one might think of in this ares.

I hope this report will give you some idea as to the current status

of Posse Comitatus in San Diego County. At least I believe it to be a

fairly accurate description of some of the prime-movers

of Posse Comitatu

as of the present. Due to the more underground nature of this group,

It is more difficult to keep tabs on than is the openly lazi Party.

However, as this organizational arn of the MCC makes the attempt to

establish itseli as a force to be reckoned with and to consolidate

whatever pover it might gain, certain characteristics of it are bound

to surface and becone more clear. This informant will do his best to

learn as much about this emerging group as quickly as possible and to

relay the information to you as accuately as can be done. One thing

seens to be very certain and that is that San Diego County seems to be

extremely fortile soil for the flourishing of a group like Posse Comitati

That is all for now.

Report by INFORmANT

Meeting of Colonel WILLIAM GALE at

O Neira Hall on the Evening of

March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

4/5/77

Approximately 75 persons were present at that

meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,

VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD, J. ANDREW SIMPSON,

ELLEN ADAMS, BILL MILLER, JONATHAN WEST, JOE BRINKER,

HARRIET BRINKER, JANET BRINKER, COlonel WILLIAM GALE, ANN

NUTTER, and others who are very old and very inactive.

There were

a number of individuals present who are as yet

unknown to me.

GEORGE UDVARY does not seem to have made his

move yet--permanent move out of the area. He's still in

• process, I believe, as best I can tell at this time. MICKEY

WAKEFIELD came down from Escondido, was hoping to run

into some of his para-military friends, one or two of whom

did not evidently arrive. He did run into VICTOR WALTON

who he is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved--

on the surface at least. ELLEN ADAMS was distributing

literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that

monthly meeting and so they were working with that.

## Page 251

There was security that night--more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

DENNIS was inside with a 23-channel, five-watt Citizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand, sold by Radio Shack. He

kept monitoring another individual whose name I do not have

who was outside. He had a two or three channel Citizens

Band walkie-talkie, Midland brand, and they were checking

to see if anyone would give them any trouble. This was

because of a publication that indicated where their meeting

would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if.

such trouble arrived.

• • :

Colonel GALE discussed an article on himself and

the identity movement as written up in Volume V, Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

I believe that's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the article and made comments and corrections

as he went.

• He said, now I will read--follow this and read as

much as possible that seems relevant. He read from'the

• article: "But the public meetings are only part of

the

• paciage. Whenever GALE speaks, he recruits followers into

the para-military part of his organization. That part is

called 'Identity' and has so far incorporated many old

Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern California."

To that, Colonel GALE indicated that "Identity"

was the name of his church publication--he thought it was

NW 55000

DocId: 32989523. Page 251.2

---

## Page 252

very humorous. that they thought it was something else.

The term is used to describe their philosophy.

The para-military part of their operation is under

such titles as the "Christian Posse Association."

I will make another quote here from the publication:

"JERRY LYNY DAVIS, the ex-head of the SAO in California,

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

to MICKEY WAKEFIELD who.was sitting next to me during this

meeting, DAVIS had not, as far as he knew, ever been to a

San Diego meeting.

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations--

i small cells communicate through a series of

intermediaries

and blind post office boxes." Golonel GALE did not comment

further; however, the mailing network for the rational tape

groups, the Christian Posse Association groups, and the

amateur radio network are the primary communication links

Of GALE's group.

• : Another quote Colonel GALE made from the article:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation.

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club

on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th

and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Avenue." The

street was incorrectly quoted--it's Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

the information was transferred to the person at this publication

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523 Page 252

---

## Page 253

by telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication: "According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has about 50 members

In the San Diego area, including members of the San Diego

Sheriff's Department and reserve police officers." Colonel

GALE indicated support from and for law enforcement--indicated

he has an assistant pastor in Glendale who has an important

position in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, and

that he claims support from a number of law enforcement

areas.

Another quote he indicated: "As for GALE, he

pretends to be a minister of his church and operates through

it as his front. GALE was one of the driving forces behind

the militant Christian Defense League (CDI) in the 60's.

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50's.

The California State Attorney General's Office described

the Rangers as," then they put a quote in here, in this article,

" 'A secret underground guerrilla force, linked with other

non-military organizations by a common ideology and leader-

ship."

Colonel GALE indicated at this meeting the Rangers

vere registered with the state and had support of California

lav enforcement.

Another quote from the article that the Colonel

-NW-55000 DocId: 32989523.. Page 253

---

## Page 254

!

made: "GALE'S

strategy to recruit member

through veterans

organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the Long Beach Press

Telegram exposed his efforts to convert the American Legion

Post in Signal Hill into a Ranger front. It was after this

that one of the Rangers was arrested for selling a machine

gun and a stem gun to undercover agents." Colonel GALE

indicated that he was involved to some extent with this

particular post, with this particular veterans group, that

he transferred from the Hollywood post. Also, he said that

the Ranger's, that particular

Ranger's arrest, was an.

entrapment and an unfortunate error on that Ranger's part.

Another quote he made: "The CDI was quite an

• organization when GALE was a part of it. It grew to

include the Klan, the National States' Rights Party., and

many other Right Wing groups." Colonel GALE admitted

connection with the Christian Defense League, indicating

that he was very active.

Another quote: GALE has ample experience to

found a para-military organization. In addition to more

than 20 years involvement in right wing circles, GALE is

a retired Lieutenant Colonel, U. S. Army. He served with

the MAC ARTHUR command after World War. II in the counter-

insurgency staff," and it goes on. But Colonel GALE corrected

this counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

was on the staff of MAC ARTIUR in Japan, but previous to

• 1

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523

Page 254.-

## Page 255

that was when

he was involved in counter- insurgency and

that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,.

which was also indicated in this article.

Then, another interesting thing, he quoted: "The

SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an

FBI Agent." He didn't have arything notable to say about

GODFREY.

Actually, one of the things he indicated, too,

in this discussion of his was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different right wing groups to cooperate in

a military fashion and that that is very necessary and I

get the impression that he is attempting and wishes to whip

these groups into line in a really efficiènt military manner

that will be very effective and efficient. 'That is the pri-

mary problem. He also indicated his willingness to cooperate

with law enforcement, of course on his terms no doubt;

and he said he was ready and they were ready to face those

Jews and their articles and their so-called

exposes and

whatever else they might happen to want to do; that they

are ready to communicate with their people and take care of

anyone who gives them any trouble. He indicated that he

had communication links all over--that

• Exom his car he

could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't

know what link he was referring to, but it was in Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like that, which he mentioned.

NW-330002o01d: 32309523 Page 255

## Page 256

That covers much of his comments at that particu-

lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--the people

enjoyed that immensely.

It was a reaction similar to a

•grandstanding and I think he was milking it for all he

could get.

Jo ANDREW SILIPSON resides at 229 Kalmia Street,

San Diego, California 92101, telephone number in San Diego

232-5658.

There were some questions and answers during

this session. JOE BRINKER was passing out blank piaces

of paper so that people could write their comments and

questions on the papers which were then passed up to Colonel

GALE. Along with those blank pieces of paper, JOE BRINKER

had a throw-away on the tax revolt. The heading was "Sunny

. San Diego Invites You to 1974's Biggest Tax Expo" and then

another heading, "Tax Foes Iell why and How They Stopped

Paying Income Fax," etc., etc. It talked about meetings in

the San Diego area on that. Registration forms for special

get-togethers, in this case, Sheraton Inn-Airport on

Friday, April 5th and Saturday, April 6th, Y P.M. to 11 P.M.

on Friday, April 5th; 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Saturday, April 6th.

For those who wish to write for information, they'd write to

(for registration or information) to Tax Expo, 1570 Lily .

Avenue, El Cajon, California 92021. Now whether this point

was being stressed more by JOE BRINKER or whether it was also

under

the tacit approval of Colonel GALE, I do not know.

Among the other literature and material which was

picked up at that meeting, I acquired an application for

Underneath the application: "We wish to attend the Identity

number öf adults, number of children, ages of children,

type of recreation vehicle (tent camper; truck camper, motor

¡ECT: Thugs attack SAO member.

As you can tell by the content of the enclosed letter, terrorist

Arity seens still to be going on in San Diego County. If true, what

letter says definitely refutes Paul Fuplinger's denial that he was

* a member of the Secret Army Organization.

This beating incident also seems to bear out this informant's sus-

Ions that there is a leftist underground SAO type organization operating

the Sün Diego area. Perhaps these assallants who attacked the Ruplingers:

their friend were the same group who shot up the mobile home park in

ondião where Mickey Wakefield resides. In any event, this latest

lence is bound to heighten tensions between the warring factions.

Ray Wilson is obviously very pleased that the zionist headquarters

New York was bonbed. It was news to this informant to learn thai

Milson's landlady is & close friend of the Ruplingers.. This means

at she must be at least semi-politically aligned with the Ruplingers

possibly even Wilson himself.

That'is about it for now. Hope this will help.

THE STRANGE TALE OF

THE SECRET ARMY

ORGANIZATION (USA)

an Diego is a strange town, where the niceties of West-

ern civilization cannot hide the power of the buck

and the hint of brute force. It is the city built with

the largesse of twenty-five years of imperial sway: a

stronghold, a haven of anticommunism, a base for racke-

teers. Richard Nixon considered it his lucky city. He

wanted the Republican. Convention to be held there, and

though the city fathers and the people of San Diego were

not terribly enthusiastic, the plans went forward until May

1972, when the President abruptly changed his mind.

Included in these plans, it turns out, was a tumultuous,

massive, bloody riot-on such a scale as to justify the most

extraordinary preventive measures, including burglary, bug-

• ging, sabotage, and perhaps even kidnapping. Watergate, we

learn from the likes of John W. Dean, was simply part of a

strategy, to maintain domestic tranquility in the face of a

serious left-wing threat.

Presumably, this Red Menace existed in San Diego as

well as Miami. But San Diego has never been a radical

stronghold, and while local activists did undertake extensive

preparations for anti-war demonstrations during the GOP

convention, the Committee to Re-elect the President seems

to have had a far higher opinion of their organizing suc-

cesses than they themselves dared to entertain.

Unless, of course, CREEP and its local San Diego allies

were hell-bent on making certain that bedlam did in fact

occur. That is precisely what a defecting agent provocateur

named Lewis Tackwood suggested almost two years ago.

Tackwood told an incredible story back in• October and

November 1971, one which suggested the Republicans were

doing their utmost to turn San Diego into a bloodbath

during, the convention, with the aim of annihilating the left,

smearing the Democrats, and coasting comfortably into

four more years of conservative rule. His allegations were

regarded as the ravings of a madman until testimony in the

Senate caucus room appeared to corroborate some of his

wildest stories. He told of preparations to seal off and then

bomb 100,000 demonstrators attending a rock concert on

Fiesta Island in Mission Bay, San Diego. All sorts of may-

hem was supposed 10 occur. Bombs were to be smuggled

into Convention Center in hollow furniture, which was al

ready being built in Los Angeles. At least one major Repub-

lican official would perish in the melce. The Democratic

Party would be tied in to the events, discredited, possibly

outlawed. The Republican candidate would then win an

easy victory with the overwhelming support of an Outraged

citizenry. Today, Tackwood sticks by his original story (10

be published in September by Avon as The Glusshouse

Tapes), though he now adds that the plan also called for

blowing up the podium as President Nixon was making his

acceptance speech!

(CIVIL WAR IN SAN DIEGO]

ncredible as the Tackwood scenario seemed back in

1971, it sounded less outlandish to San Diego radicais

than to those on the outside. For two years, they had

quite literally been engaged in protracted warfare

with right-wingers determined to drive them out of the

area. As early as 1970, activists associated with the San

Diego Street Journal, an underground newspaper, were liv-

ing in an armed fortress which they guarded around the

clock against the attacks of night riders who would shoot

into their houses, firebomb their cars and threaten their

lives. (Curiously, this terror campaign intensified as the

paper exposed more and more illegal activities of San Diego

kingpin C. Arnholt Smith.) On one occasion, for example,

sentries spotted two men crouched behind a car with a

high-powered rifle trained on the house. It was late at night, •

but they were prepäred for such emergencies. At a signal,

they switched.on floodlamps which bathed the house in

light and they announced over i loudspeaker systen that

they would open fire if the men did not withdraw. The

gunmen waited a moment, then dismantled their rifle, and

drove off into the night.

By late 1971, the vigilantes had stepped up their attacks

and had chosen their principal targets. One of these was a

certain Peter Bolmer, a radical who at the time was teach-

ing economies at San Diego State College. He began receiv.

ing threatening phone calls, and on November 13. 1971, i

car parked in front of his house was firebombed. Then on

December 27, 1971, a group calling itself the Scorer Army

Organization put out a Special Bulletin on Perer Bohmer.

Alter listing his anti-war activities, and his background, the

letter said: "For any of our readers who may care to look

Warren Commission sent Secret Ser-

vice agents to track down its author

and printer. They worked from late

November 1963, to May 190+, until

they found that Robert G. Klause had

printed the flyer and that Robert

Allan Surrey, an

associate of Gen.

Walker, had ordered it. When Surrey

testified before

the Commission on

June 16, 1964, he pled

the Fifth

Amendment on all questions concern-

ing the leaflet. The late Hale Boges, a

member of

the Warren Commission,

pointed out that Surrey "is the only

witness out of hundreds who has pled

the Fifth Amendment." Klause denied

any interest in or involvement with the

contents of the leaflet, and there the

matter was allowed to rest. By that

•point, the Warren Commission was

determined to prove that Oswald had

acted alone, and therefore lost interest

in trying to connect the assassination

with the leaflet.

ing to cooperate; some were even

friendly. And as the SAO began to

open up, a pattern began to emerge

which seemed to link the San Diego

events to Watergate.

(BREAKTHROUGH]

T The breakthrough came

this

spring when an editor of the

Door made contact with a

former SAO militant named Jerry

Busch. From November 1969 to the

summer of 1971, said Busch, Howard

Berry Godfrey made frequent visits to

the Gunsmoke Ranch in El Cajon. "It

was aiso during June, July, and August

of 1971 that Berry Godfrey and

Donald

Segretti (posing as

"Don

Simms') visited Gunsmoke and though

supposedly not knowing each other,'

they spoke together on at least one ou-

casion,

•"in a quiet conversation asle.

•Chapin and Strachun in June 1971,

but before commencing work as

dirty trickster in September 1971.

Busch did not say what Segretti dis-

•cussed at the Gunsmoke Ranch, but he

did report that following "these casual

conversations" Godfrey came up with

bizarre ideas to take care of what he

called "those sed punks" —in the event

that the GOP held its convention in

San Diego. Among Godfrey's plans in

October 1971, were:

1) the use of massive dosages of LSD,

cyanide or strychnine introduced

into the punch at anti-war group

meetings;

2) bombing

of the VVAW head-

quarters, the Guild Theatre, and

several porno shops;

3) bombings of the homes or offices

of anti-war leaders:

4) kidnapping or assassination of anti-

war leaders and activists;

5) fire bombing of vehicles and other

• property belonging to anti-war ac-

tivists.

By November and December 1971,

Busch continued, Godfrey had become

more ambitious: he wanted to acquire

drone planes which would carry pay-

loads of high explosives and phospho-

rus to be dropped on the demon-

strators. In addition, Godfrey spoke of

using similar air craft, loaded with

TNT or C-4 plastique, to blow up Air

Force One and assassinate Nixon. The

• idea was to fly a bomb into the Presi-

dential jet as it landed either at Lind-

bergh Field or at El Toro Marine Base.

Busch claimed. that he had expressed

horror at the suggestion and told God-

frey he had lost his mind suggesting

anything as insane as an attempt on

the life of the President. Shortly there-

after, Busch and Godirey parted ways

after the former grew suspicious that

he was being set up to take the rap on

the shooting of Paula Tharp. By

March 1972, he had left San Diego

and has not yet returned.

Even before Busch left the SAO,

the "Wanted for Treason" leaflet was

printed

and distributed. Another

Fiesta Island.) After Busch's depar-

ture, the SAO issued its April 1972,

bulletin, which began with a quote at-

tributed to Abraham Lincoln, "A ty-

rant would not come to the United

States from across the sea. If he

comes, he'll ride down Pennsylvania

Avenue from his inauguration and take

of

House.

" Then followed detailed in-

structions on the manufacture of ex-

plosives which might be used to de.

stroy a large bridge (Tackwood's

scenario included the demolition of

two bridges on and off of Fiesta Is-

land)

so bridges on various

and on various methods of

forced entry into buildings.

(A SINISTER PLOT?)

Tas there a right-wing plot to

kill the President? Tackwood

says so. Busch says that FBI

informer Berry Godfrey talked about

it. The "anted for Treason"

certainly indicated no loss of love be-

tween the extreme right and the Presi-

dent, and Godfrey was checking out

the availability of drone planes.

There are other curious, if admit.

tedly inconclusive, clues as well: The

day Nixon went to China, E. Howard

• Hunt was working as a public relations

man on a Julie Nixon Eisenhower TV

spot. He raged about the China trip,

"We should not send people to China,

we should send bombs to China." This

from a man supposedly involved in a

secret scheme to re-elect the President

by illegal means.

Or take this item which appeared in

the March 9, 1972, issue of the N.Y.

Times (10 days after Nixon's return

from China):

WAR ALERT SENT IN HOAX

BY A COAST GUARDSMAN

"New Orleans, March & (UPI)--An en-

listed man standing watch sent a hoax

message 10 ships at sea during Presi-

dent Nixon's visit to China, saying the

President had been assassinated and

the Vice President had declared World

War Ill, the Coast Guard revealed yes-

terday.

"The authorities said that the hoax

message had not been taken seriously

and that the man who sent it from a

small Coast Guard stacion in Texas had

been confined and was

undergoing

medical evaluation.

•Sle message was sent February 27

by teletype lu 22 ships in the Gull of

exico.

There was no further story on this

that i have been able to find. It thie

hoax message had gone out to a Polaris

submarine, Hunt might have gotten his

wish, that bombs would be sent to

China.

Then, the L.A. Times reported on

July 13, 1973 that a former Minute.

man had requested political asylum in

Fiji, saying he had secret information

on Watergate and feared assassination.

All

of

this

proves nothing,

of

course, but it suggests that the Dirly

Tricks operation may have been much

more complex than we have been led

to believe. Perhaps there was a plot to

kill Nixon, and then again Godfrey's

plot may have been à further hoax

aimed at discrediting the left and the

Democratic Party. What did Segretti

discuss with Godfrey, and why and

how did he meet Godfrey in the first

place? How did it happen that the FBI

financed a threat on the life of a Presi-

dent (a crime which carries a penalty

of up to five years in jail and'a 51,000

fine)? In the past, the Secret Servive

has taken such threats very seriously.

A check of the New York Times index

shows that at least 11 people were ar-

rested between January, 1972 and

May 1973 for doing much less than

Godfrey. Most seem to have been

psychopaths or drunks, with no posi-

tive plan-just verbal threats.

But then there are other instances:

Arthur Bremer's Ottawa visit on April

13-14, 1972, for example, when he

supposedly stalked Nixon. On May 30,

three bombs demolished the tomb of

the father of the Shah of Iran an hour

before Nixon was scheduled to lay a

wreath there. On August 11, a certain

A. B. Topping was arrested in New

York after paying an undercover agent

$1,000 to kill Nixon. Topping: it

developed, was well-to-do, of

American Nazi political persuasion,

and interested in having the President

killed the week after the pay-olf. No

trial has been held: And then in late

May 1973, one of Nixon's helicopters

went down in the Bahamas. Il subse-

quently came out that the President

has three helicopters ready at all times

and chooses which to use one minute

before the flight.

there have been other tensions as well?

Were there elements which opposed®

Nixon for his policy of rapprochement

with China and Russia, and which

would have preferred; say, Spiro

Agnew as President?

After returning from San Diego in

July 1972, acting FBI director, L.

Patrick Gray, talked to Nixon and

said: "Mr. President, there is some-

thing I want to speak to you about.

Dick Walters and 1 feel that people on

your staff are trying to mortally

wound you by using the CIA and the

FBI ...

" His words may have carried

greater import than any of us have

• heretofore suspected.

In August of this year, Godfrey

reportedly admitted to the San Diego

Door that there was a real plot to kill

Nixon. He blames the plan on his erst-

while cohort, Gary Lynn Davis.

i.a.

Fox stated that he was approached many times by Berry Godfrey

who said he wa:, It. Commander in the secret Army Organization.

He tried to sell fox illegal weapons, etc. and invited him to

join the 5.A.0.

Berry Godfrey vas a paid agent for the lBI for at least 5

jears and was assigned to investigate Right-ding Organizations.

Fox said that codfrey hung around his station alot but that ne

did not join as he was doubtful of the organization.

In May, Fox west to washington to march with McIntyre in the

May 20th. protest, "To win the War".

¡While he was. alay, FbI agents through an informer, Mr. Pittman

working for fox, went through various files without permission.

Upon his return from Hashington, Fox tried to discover why all

the interest from the fBI.

After many phone calls and many

days ha was told that since ic was a former member of the

Minutemen, involved with the S.A.O, a known wallace supporter,

since wallace ias shot and tr. Fos was not far from the area,

that. he was suspect and they were trying to get his license

number to give to the Secret Service.

Fox frals the FBI and Godfrey are :ecruiting and pushing to involve

rigit-mingars in illegal operation; along with the police depart-

ment (bombing and laying the blame on the right-wing), were setting

the stage for a riot so.Marshall Law could be called

I also sensed that Rod Duff is trying to pull himself out of..

a slump or depression.

when mentiching it to Julie Hanna,

He fell short as a leader in my opinion, as he asked the group

I asked him, after the reeting, what the dues ware and did he

ment - he looked

startled and replica,

"I'm afraid right noir I

Informed by them that they had discovered his gate open

the Secret

Army, Organization trials, HOARD BARRY GODFREY

had testified that JERRY LYNN DAVIS had known about the

weapons stolen from MARSHALL. MARSHALL could not recall

whether GODFREY had testitied that he had actually at

the time seen these weapons or had testified that he had

merely been informed of these weapons by DAVIS.

MARSHALL stated that he desired to know

whether or not the FBI had any intormation regarding his

weapons and his primary interest was to recover his

weapons.

MARSHALL was advised that all information

furnished by HOWARD BARRY GODFREY to the FBI regarding

violations of local or state statutes had been disseminated

to the appropriate local or state agency, and that he

should contact the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice as

that agency would have jurisdiction over the burglary

which occurred at his residence. He said he had been in

contact with the San Diego County Sheritt's Oftice, and had

been advised that his weapons had not been recovered and

that the Sheritt's Ottice had no information regarding

the whereabouts of these weapons.

MARSHALL turther advised that he is aware of the

location of the Gunsmoke Ranch, but does not trequent

this location, and again advised that he has never met any ...

of the persons affiliated with the Sccret Army Organization

except RICHARD FLEURY. He turther advised that FLEURY has

a considerable number of weapons at his residence, including

shot guns, rifles, and automatic pistols. He has made

statements to the ettect that he will not again be taken

alive. MARSHALL expressed his personal point that FLEURY is

mentally unbalanced,

and turther advised that FLEURY is

highly critical of all law entorcement in general, and of

the EBI, Inparticular. He said fLEURY plans to file suit

return of weapons which were seized from him at the

time of his arrest.

He said that FLEURY also talks

about going to south America and is highly critical

of the United States Government in his conversations.

MARSHALL further advised that GENEVIEVE FLEURY in con-

versation with other neighbors which have been related

tO MARSHALL, has indicated that she thinks her husband,

by out of the ordinary, and further advised that he has had

no direct conversation with her, but has been hearing

these runors from other people, and he expressed the

opinion that FLEURY's departure from the Ünited States

may be what these rumors refer to.

He said that GENEVIEVE

FLEURY has indicated to neighbors that RICHARD FLEURY

thinks that she will accompany him to South America,

but, in fact, she does not plan to go with him if he does

leave this country.

MARSHALL advised that he is not on friendly

terms with FLEURY, in that he somewhat suspects FLEURY Of

burglarizing his home, and he feels that FLEURY does not

trust him.

he said he would relay any intormation regarding

FLEURY's activities to this office, but said that because

of his relationship with FLEURY, he would not bee in a

LYNCH

Evidence is accumulating that if

you are. Jewish or Negro, you can

PARTIES

break the law with impunity, but if

you are White and a patriot, you

are a second-class

citizen. There

is a gioving

double standard of justice in the U.S.-harsh pin-

ishment for patriots (secured by the perjury of

federal agents) and leniency for the Left.

Last month saw two outrageous miscarriages of

Justice in San Diego. On Ircembe: 21, ten tax

protestors were declareci "guilty" of "conspiracy

to rescue seized property" by a jurv which

for which

followed the promptings of a federal judge.

Judge Leland C. Nielsen clearly had received

orders from higher-ups to convict the ten de-

fendants, no matter what he haci to do. He show-

ed open contempt for the rights of the accused,

refusing even to recognize that the Flech Ware-

house-the focus of the picketing that led federal

agents to physically assault the patriots and ar-

rest them on trumped-up charges-had not even

been legally seized by the IRS until the day after

the arrest of the defendants!

• The federal agents involved perjured themselves

on the witnesss stand but the jury (composed in

large part of bureaucrats and others whose salaries

are paid for by tases) refused to believe that FBI

and Treasury agents would act in the criminal

manner they did and then lie under oath.

Although prosecution testimony was inconsist-

ent, distorted and contradictory, Nielson brusquely

dismissed defense motions and objections and

upheld the prosecution throughout.

The other lynching bee in San Diego concerned

two men who were admittedly entrapped by un-

dercover FBI agent-provacateur Howard Godfrey.

Undisputed are the facts that Godfrey incited

William F. Yakopec into bombing a porno movie

vas sumited the the losing con

Godfrey's testimony. A witness for Yakopec, Cal-

vin H. fox, was subsequently convicted of per-

jury on Godfrey's testimony, although the evidence

clearly indicacted that Fox was colling the truth

In retrospect 1972 was a precedent-

shattering year in Amcricas inter

national relations. President Nixon

abruptly reversed his previous anti-

• Communist stince. The machinations of his for-

was enthusiastically supported by the

"liberal" news media and paved the way for

Nixon's highly publicized trips to Red China and

Sovict Russia. The general public, bemused and

confused by an avalanche of promotional publicity

featuring world peace as the ultimate goal, was

cajoled into accepting the bland assurances of the

Kissinger-Nixon team. WO readers had been fore-

warned about the Nixon-Kissinger scheme of

Soviet-Americon convergence as the first step in

the 'Grand Design of One World Goverument.

In reviewing the many exclusive news items of

WASHINGION OBSERVER in the course of 19T2 it

will be noticed that on March 15, 1972, WO ex-

clusively reported that Nixon's bauman and po-

litical mastermind, Murray MI. Chotiner, was

surreptitiously channelling funds to the pro-Com-

munist People's Party. The purpose of the oper-

ation was to draw left-wing votes from Democrat

candidates. This was the first reported act of

sabotage against the Democrats.

On May I, 1972, WO exclusively reported:

'... In his desire to run as the 'Peace President'.

in November 1972, President Nixon has let the

Kremlin leaders know that he is ready to grant

One of the most frequent complaints heard

you just have to pick the lesser of awo evils.

How often does it occur io us that the

the whole point: The present election system

doesn't really give us a choice. In many cases,

"there ain't a dime's worth of difference"

between the Democrat and Republican can-

didates.

What we need is one more pesition on the

Edisor:

Your articles in AMERICAN MERCURY have

been very interesting although those on

"The

Economy" and "The Money Supply" are

partially hogwash. I don't object when a

writer expresses. his opinion ever

though

different from mine. but when you make

statement in your Newsietter which is in error

(=145, Sept, 15rh, 1972, last page) quote,

"for

every dollar

• the national debt

which has been manufaciured by bookkeepinz

entry," you are in error. The real truth

is

that the entry is not manufactured but is

very real.

The process is that the U.S. Treasurer has

a supply of unsigned engraved U.S. Govern-

ment

Bonds which when the Fed "buys

bonds"" are taken to the U.S. Treasurer who

signs them, ratums them and then the Fed

"buys" them by running off on a printinz

press

an equivalent amount of fiat paper

labelled "Treasury Notes" such as used by

the public. These nores are no longer "re-

deemable in lawful money of the U.S." as

they used to ba because there is none. Only

a relatively small amount of illegally debased

coinage. These. notes have no value being

merely paper with ink on them.

Meanwhile, the American Public pays in-

terest on the U.S. Govemment Bonds to the

tune st over $15,000,000,000 (Fifteen Billion

Dollars) every year..•

That certainly is not a manufactured book-

keeping entry. The Treasury notes are phoney

but the Bonds in possession of the Fed are

very real, also the interesi as it comes due.

ir Sirs:

le, the andersigned, vigorously protest the arrests of alliam F. Yakopec, George M.

over, Sam Davis, and tr. & irs. Richard J. Fleury all of whom were arrested in connec

on with alledged "secret irty Organization" activity.

Iside from the question of their direct zuilt or innocence, there is the matter of the

curstances surrounding their arrests, the importance of which overshadows the question

culpability. le are referring to the gross imbalance of justice exhibited in excessive

reillance, harasment, and penalties for Rightist and White Racialist activists, as con-

isted to the alnost universai leniency granted the Radical left.

a hear constantly of riots, viet Cong flags being raised over li.s. cities and institu-

ins; of Islessness, murder, riolence, conspiracy. In connection with these sordid pieces

news, we typically hear of token arresus for no arrests), light sentences (if any):

pittals, slaps on the wrist. In short, the infting i dias country, as in most

miries, isagrantly breaks the lan with little er no consequence to themselves.

he saliaat point is this: the Racical Left consistently breaks the law to advance their

3, and ganerally gets away with it constituting a clear and present danger to the inter-

security of merica. It is also apparent that the "authorities' have abdicated fror

1r responsibilities to stor this threat, and have instead scooped to spring on richuiet

i Racialist groups and individuals the overwhelming rajority of nom are

Jair-no sing.

in this repressive and threatering atmosphere it is hardly surprising that patriotic

ricans are sorely tepted to resort to violent neans io preserve their liberties. Fron

s simple observation no can drail the folloing conclusion: THE ALLEDGED INCIENTS

•HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN THE IN NECROSENT AGENCIES HAD FEEN DOING TIDIR JOBS. The fact

it the agracies in question did not do their jobs in dealing iritin the left neant that for

the safer sf us all someone else had to do it for them the best nay they knew to. irà

& "someone else", whoever zhey may be, should not be held culpable for whai ultiately

ints to the "authoritias'" dereliction of duty.to stop treason, sedition, and subvercion.

le consommently demard three things: the dismissal of all chonges against the aforementiores

spects', the end of all surveillance of Rightist und thite Racialist groups and indivi

1s, and strict enforcement of the lair against ill leftist miscreants.

SUBJECTS: Activities c

Dennis L0s0--Joint activ.

es of NSWPP & SAO..

Enclosed you will i ad a newspaper clloping & photograph which

describes the opening

of the John Schnitz for President headquarters

in Escondido. As described In the clipping, Dennis Loso is the second

nan from the right.. It figured that loso would be involved in this

because he was a great Schmitz supporter long before this presidential

race. The other three men I do not know. However, there are some of

his hunting and political associates of which I could tell you somethirg..

One is Wesley Rounds.

This man has been worked on fog a long time by

toso. Politically, he has always tended toward the right, but loso has

succeeded in bringing him much farther along toward National Socialism.

Rounds is manager of the Californian Motel. It is located in Esconảião

ut the northeast comer of. Hwy. 395 and Washington Avenue. Rounds' eract

age I do not know but I would guess him to be somewhere in his 40s.-

iometime back loso took Rounds to his first William Gale service at Oneira

(all in San Diego. Rounds seemed impressed with Gale.. Ves is married.

Another man vo periodically visits loso is Al McDonald.. Al is 40

cars old and is a friendly, congènial type of person. He is single and

spenda much of his

time in Montana "living the good life." In lever he

runs low on money, he comes down to Escondido

and works for Dennis for

3 while. He claims that he managed to live on just $3,000 last year.

AcDonald

• also spends a fair amount of time living in Montague, Califomia.

this town is located in Siskiyou County near the Oregon border. McDonald's

parents also live there. They very much disapprove of his Nazi sympathies.

i one occasion, his Mother found a large swastika in his cabin nile he

asn't there.. She threw it in his wood burning stove and would have burnes

It except that she couldn't find any matches. His most recent visit to

Escondido

was in July and August at which time he gave the swastika flag

0 Ioso for safe keeping. Loso allowed McDonald to stay rent free in

one

of his unoccupied apartments.

I leamed from Gerald Smith recently that as long as one year ago,

there were joint target practice sessions. between members of the NSWPP

the SAO. The site of these little excursions was the Gunsmoke Fanch.

gerald says the place is virtually a stronghold of the Minutemen, Farti-

ipants in the target shooting sessions most frequently were Gerald Smith,

3ay Wilson, urs. Ray Wilson, Stanley licdade, Jerry Lynn Davig and George

1. Hoover. Gerald aays Hoover is a crack shot with either a rifle or

istol. Gerald himself qualified as an expert rifle shot in the service.

tioned. However, as you are well aware, there are few willing

witnesses in any criminal prosecution and the nature of the

subjects involved dictate they be brought to the bar of justice.

I have been advised of your communications with Mr.

thereof you will arrive at a

mutually agreeable course of

action.

I would like to mention that any proposed trial testimony

regarding information developed as a resuli of your official

duties as

a Special Agent of the FBI must be identified and

furnished to the Department of Justice in order that considera-

tion can be given as to whether information is to be disclosed

by you.

assist you in any way possible.

With hopes that the ends of justice will be served with

the minimum of inconvenience to you, and that you and your family

Rex I. Shroder

Special Agent in Charge

Federal Bureau of Investigation

San Diego, California 92103

Dear Mr. Shroder:

In connection with the investigation and prosecution of the

shooting of Paula Tharp, for which Geroge M. Hoover has been indicted,

I have received correspondence from Mr. Hewicker of the San Diego

County District Attorney's Office asking whether I would be willing to

testify in this matter.

The purpose of this testimony would be to.

substantiate the reliability of Howard Godfrey as an informant and

provide information as to the custody of the weanon involved. I have

indicated to Mr. Hewicker that I would not be unwilling to furnien

such testimony but would be somewhat reluctant due to my present

circumstances. It would appear to me that the interests of the Bureau

and the District Attorney's Office, as well as myself, would be better

served if this information was furnished by someone still connected

with the FBI. Godfrer's reliability should be a matter of record to

which Earl Petersen could easily testify. Furthermore Mr. Petersen

has some first-hand knowlege as to the location of the weadon, and,

because of the nature of the incident, I imagine my testimony

respect would need as much substantiating as Godfrey's.

in this

Another decided disadvantage for me would be the disclosure

• of my present whereabouts to individuals such as redresentatives of the

"Door"

, to whom you made reference in your letter of the Fifteenth.

I do not desire to be located or contacted by thase or similar people.

However, if this should occur, I intend to state merely that I left

the Bureau on the advice of my personal physician, which would have

been an actuality within a period of a few weeks or months anyway.

I would certainly appreciate it if such a course of action

as I have mentioned could be made feasible.

Sincerely!

SECRET ARMY

UNDEROROUND BULLETIN

RGANIZAMION

GENERAL HEADQUARTERS

JUNE 1972

" The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion".

Edmund Burlie

Fellow members,

At a recent meeting of the SAO General Staff a very important problem was discusse

and the decision to issue a new Organizational Directive made. The problem is ina: si

new members who join our organization and then immediately become totally inactive.

Typically these new members submit a well qualified application form together with

their membership fee. Uniortunately, after being accepted, as provisional membars

they never pay a month's dues or send in any report forms.

"It would really haip us to

know why some of these people have acted in this way. Did our organization turn out

to be something different than they expected ? Did they expect a fancy uniform and it:

to be handed to them on a silver platter ? Or did they suddenly become afraid to stick

their neck out ?

Whatever the reasons, it isn't fair to our good members to waste time and money ch

those who do nothing to help or support the organization.

Therefore, effective imroe-

iately, the following rules shall apply to such cases as mentioned above.

1. If, three months after submitting an application to the SAO and being accapted a. '

a provisional member, the new member has not begun the basic correspondence trainin

submitted monthly report forms, paid monthly dues, or provided a reasonabic escue

for not having done the above, their file shall be turned over to our Intelligence Section

for special attention.

2. If, after six months, the member in question dosen't respond they shall be 2as:

from our rolls and their names shall be circulated to all members as a potential sce ei

risti.

We don't mean to imply that a member can't resign from the Secrot Army Organisiti

However, we do require that a menther notity us of there intent and reasons fi dui::

If this new Organizational Directive applies to any member in particular let hire laiü iri

and govern himself accordingly.

HOW TO PREPARE GUNS FOR STORAGE & BURYING

Although cosmoline can be purchased in many surplus stores, li may be more

practical to make your own from the following directions.

One advantage to malalig

your own preparation is that it is much easier to apply while it is in a warm stats.

Heat non-bleached petrolsum jelly (ember-vaseline) in a small-pan or can. Add

30 or 40 weight motor oil to obtain the proper consistency. Using an inexpensive

throw-away paint brush as an applicator, brush the warm solution over the weapon.

While the solution is still warm it can also be poured into those hard-to-get-at-areas.

One large jar of peiroleum jelly and approximately one-hali quart of motor oil

is surficient to prepare several reapons.

When the solution has cooled it will set and form a protective coating over the

weapon which should then be wragped in sheet plastic (available in most hardyara or

paint stores) or in a G.i. plastic gun case (available in mosticuaplus stores ). Wrap

well and seal with black electrical of plastic tape. It is also wise to enclose a small

sack of silicagel crystals to keep the moisture out.: These crystals can be purchased

at any industrial chemical house or most applicance stores will give them away as they

conie with cartons of appliances when shipped and they usually have an abundance on

supply.

Long guns which cannot be easily torn down can be stored in surplus rocket type

boxes readily available in most surplus stores.

Try to obtain aluminum or stainless

steel containers since they will not tend to rust when buried. 20mm ammunition cars

are adequate and a convenient size container for burying smaller weapons and other

items. They should be well sealed. The cans should be wrapped in plastic io prevent

rust.

Buried containers should have at least one and a hali feet of earth over them.

Gua

should be careful also in selecting an area to bury material. Areas that could be liceded

during even the most unusual weather conditions should be avoided.

Buried containers should be in such a position that they can be found easily and

quickly ivithout the use of maps. This can be done by correlacion between two or more

specific points that will remain in tact, such as trees, large rocks, etc. To assist

your memory, paces should be marked of by using the day,. mouth, and yet. of jour

birth or that oi some family member which you can easily remembor.

Another suggestion would be for burying containers along or near ros ways whic

are marked with numbered signs indicating the iootage of road per county.

Those 44:25

are permanent, but it must be remünbered thut the state has a 50g foot right drug o

most roads which means tha brush may be cleared or the existing road might be wideaud.

All material which is buried shbuld be cheched within three tn six wecks for saulias

or sinking of tie ground.

GENERAL RULES OF GUERRILLA WA

ARE

I. The first rule of guerrilla warfare is lo dispease with any

rule or set of rules which resulis in routine or predicrable activity.

Any time the enemy commander can anticipate what the guerrilla band

will do next, ha can then lay a trap by which his superiority of

numbers and equipment may be brought to bear upon then with devasts-

ting effect.

2. Military action by guerrilla bands cannot achieve maximum

effect unless intelligence and security capabilities are developed to

an equal degree of parfaction, principally through the cooperation of

friendly nor-combatants.

3. Propaganda warfare is one of the guerrillas most effectiva

weapons.

It must be waged continuously to decoralize the eramy,

enlist support of the civilian population and to justify the existence

•and actions of the guerrilla bands.

4. Each member of the underground novement must ba rendered: :

Immune to the enemy's propaganda by continuous counter-propaganda.

They must realize that the enemy is certain to spread lies about their

leaders, to try and break the bands up by encouraging petty jealousies

and dissensions, to make them feel their fight is hopeless, to encourage

them to get on the winning side, to offer mercy and rewards to those

sho voluntarily surrender.

Most of all enemy propaganda will be aimed

as destroying the individual organization nembar's faith in the honesty,

capability and true.notives.of other members of the underground move-

ment.

5.

Surprise is the main element of successiul guerrilla warface.

No matter how vigilant the enemy may be there will be times your band

can take hin by surprise.

Perhaps he is tired, perhaps sleeping,

perhaps he is in an area where he feels so completely safe that he

lets down his guard-- that's when you hit him.

6. 'Any guerrilla that wants to keep on living must constantly

remind himself that var is not a sporting proposition never give the

communists an

even break.

7. Genarally speaking guerrillas must work in saall bands. From

five to fifteen is usual but even here its best not to ge into a rut.

If the encay commander in your area knows you always work in small

groups he can then divide his available anti-guerrilla forces into

groups of 1s to 25 and thus cover more ground than if he had to matn-

tain groups of two or three hundred to make certain his forces would

always out nunber any guerrilla band they happened uçon.

8. The guerrilla leader must always keep ils thinking one step

ahead of the enemys. Hace are some exemples:

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523 *Page

The car stops and

the enemy rificiis get out to in-

vestigate.

Suddenly the "corpse" rolls over and cues them doin

with a machine gun.

This little trick migue work several times but eventually the

enemy will figure ir out.

The criver of a truck full of erony troops

sees a "corpse" lying in the road.

Quickly he stops the truck. The

troops pile out of the truck and riddle the "corpse" with bullets.

Too late they discover its only a dummy made of old clothes and straw.

They are caught in a murderous cross-fire between guerrillas hidden

along both sides of the road.

a murderous

Most are killed but one lives long

enough to

tell what happened.

A few days later another truck of troops sees a "corpse" lying

in the middle of the highway. The driver has been forewarned so he

knows better than to stop. Instead he steps on the gas, runs over

the dummy as he spaads on around the next. curve in the road perhaps

into a hidden land-mine. Or perhaps into a chain stretched between

two trees.

Or perhaps onto a part of the highzay that has been

covered with fresh oil which sends the truck skidding over an embank-

ment.

What will the next truck full of troops do? What can you

figure

out so you will still be thinking one step ahead of the enemy?

:

9. Generally speaking the guerrilla band must avoid suparior

forces. When attackod by a superior force the guerrillas must quickly

retreat or disperse.

When the enemy stops, they may return to harass

him-- or perhaps they won't. When the enemy is exhausted they may

attack-- but again they may not.

When the enemy retreats the guerrillas

may give chase-- but only if they can be very sure they are not being

led into a trap.

10. Guerrillas must always fight at a time and place of their own

choosing-- never at a time or place of the enemy's choosing.

* 11. Before any raid on enemy troops or installations the guerrilla

leader must obtain complete and accurate intelligence on the number

of

the enemy on hand, the number near enough to ba called on for assistance,

amount and type of enemy armament, location of sentries, scouts or

protective patrols and all other information that will

effect the plan

ning or conduct of the raid.

12. All raids against the enemy must be exactly planned ind care-

fully rchearsed.

It is ofton desirable to draw a miniature copy of che

enemy installation so that all memburs of the raiding party can play

out their respeciive: duties several times to make sure they do rot

forget or become cor.fused in the heat of battle.

13. Evirything that could jus ibly go trons, rust be anticipated

ãd alcernare plans made to cope rh any evencunlity.

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523 Page 389°

14. Guerrillas

should strike a violent ligh

Ing blow that leaves

the enemy stunned at least long enouji for them to makie a safe retreat.

15. In no case must the guerrilias allow themselves to be drawn

into a

long pitched battle with cheny orcops.

16. So long as friendly forces of the conventional military

are able to retain their offensive potential it is expedient for

guerrilla forces to coordinate their activities with such friendly

troops.

17. Guerrilla bands must always nove in secret - their whereabouts

must always be hidden from the civilian population as well as from

enemy troops.

• 18. When possible always attack the enemy at places which are

distant from centers of population as this will reduce the possibility

of his making reprisals against friendly civilians.

19. If a lone enemy soldier is way-laid in the city or suburbs it

to carry his body away where it can be buried and the grave

camouflaged

so his commander will not know whether he has been killed

or has deserted. Take his uniform and hide it carefully where it can

be later retrieved. It might come in handy.

20. The guerrillas must always operate in their home territory

where they have intimate knowledge of their surroundings. If driven

from their own territory by a superior enemy force they should return

as soon as they safely can, provided that their main hide-out has not

been discovered and there is no chance of an enemy ambush.

21. Guerrillas must make every effort to stay friendly with any

civilian population in their territory as the civilians may be their

best source of food, other supplies, or valuable information about

nearby enemy forces.

22. It is almost essential that the guerrilla band have at least

one secure hide-out where they can rest up, store their supplies and

care for their wounded.

This hide-out may be in some large forest or

mountainous area but such is not always necessary. During World War II

one Russian guerrilla band had their headquarters in a storm sewer.

Another band headquartered in the basement of a hospital in one of the

smaller towns. Another operaced from an abandoned coal nire.

23. The guerrilla band should have one of more alternate hide-outs

and be ready to move quickly and quietly to another prepared location

in case their main headquarters is discovered. To preserve maximum

security the location of these alternate hide-outs should be known to

the least possible number af their own band.

24. To operate successfully over long periods of time tho

guerrilla band must have plunty of space in which to manucver-

preferably a large enough area that the enemy is incapable of

covering all of it with anti-guerrilla forces at one cime.

25. Guer.

activity is most suilably

ducted in nuuntsins,

swamp and other

pas of tarrain that are inace

sible to tanks,

large guns and mechanired forces hut with proper strategy at least

some guurrilla activity can bu suited to almost any type area- even

large cities.

Furthermore, due to the widespread use of ligit weight

weapons such as the bazoula and rocoilless rifle it must be expected

that mountains will piovide somawhat less protaction to guerrillas

in future vars than they have in the past.

Therefcie it is essential

that undcrground activity be diracted against the enemy under every

possible condition and over tha widest possible area so as to prevent

his concentrating nis forces foz a complate "nop-up" operation in

any one district.

26. Guerrilla furces cannot ordinarily afford to take prisoners.

If you are lucky enough

to capire a high-ranking officer or party

official he may be held for ransom or as a hostage to guarantee against

extreme brutality by the enamy or raprisals by the enomy against tha

civilian population. With extreme caution he may be traded for

guerrillas held prisoner by the enemy.

Most .commonly any captured enemy must be shot. If prisoners are

taken they must ba kept in chains and closely guarded day and night.

If one were to escape he would certainly lead the enemy back to your

hideout.

27. Due to their superior forces, the enemy may male several.

mistakes and still fight effectively.

For the guerrilla band a single

mistake may lead to complete annihilation. Therefore every activity

must be conducted with extreme caution and complete secrecy.

28. Guerrillas must be extremaly tidy housekeepers. Garbage

thrown out around camp may actract birds which in turn may alert the

• enemy. A tin can, carelessly tossed aside may catch the sun just

arelessly tossed

While on the march a brokan.

or a thoughtlessly dropped maich cover may give your presence

away to the enemy who could radio abead to set up an ambusa.

29.. Each member of the band must be constantly alert that his

own action does nor give away the guarrilla position to the eneny.

In remote areas the smeli of smoke may carry for many miles.

30. A single car-less or obstinate menber must not be allowar so

31. Gucrrilla forces camont afford defeat and are poorly

equipped to care for casualties.

Therefore, action against the

enemy must be taken only under such conditions as insure maxinum

opportunicy for success.

35. Guerrilla forces seldon attempo to occupy territory in tre

usual sense.

Instead they sack to dominate the territory by con

tinuous raids, ambushes and harassent of enemy croops to such en

extent that continued occupation by enemy forces is no lorger wozsi

the price they must pay.

36. Success in guerrilla warfare dapends largely on superios

nobility.

Transport and movement are therefora of great importance to tha

guerrilla band. So long as the civilian population is allowed to use

their automobiles the guerrillas can (wich forged identity cards):

do likewise. If the civilian populacion is rigidly controlled or

largely enslaved then the guerrillas wust depend on other machods of

transportation.

Bands that must move on foot are limited in the distance over which

thay can operate.

Possible targets for sabotage must be within two

is more important that coinini-

cation between bands be secure than choi it be fast.

41. Hit-or-miss sabotage is not nearly as effective as coordin-

'ated sabotage that strikes systematically at some few essential

industries of activities vital to the enemy at that particular time.

42. Targets for raids and sabotage must be carefully selected to

achieve maximum damage to the enemy with least risk to the guerrilla

band. If the enemy has an abundance of guns but is. low on amunition

then burning a warchouse full of guns will not count for much whereas

burning a warehouse full of armunition would be a vital blow.

43. Each military action against the enemy must be planned in such

& manner that the amount of armunition and supplies captured are at

least enough to replenish the amount expended in that action.

44. Both offensive and defensive guerrilla activity is vitally

dependent upon accurate knowledge of the enemy's strength, location,

movements and so far as possible his intentions which is usually

best obtained first hand by guarrilla scouts.

45. In the event that troops have settled down in the guerrilla

area for a long and routine occupation, efforts should be made to

determine whether of not they are conpletely loyal to the foreign

ideology before antagonizing a possible potential ally.

46. The guerrilla must be continuously imagining himself in the

shoes of his enemy. He must get to know how the enemy is likely to

react in any given situation.

He must be able to guess what the

enemy commander will expect his band to do next.

In this way he can

often anticipate what the enemy will do. By then acting in some

totally unexpected manner he can continuously catch the enemy in a

series of embarrassing situations.

47. Guerrilla forces must remain widely dispersed throughout the

entire area of enemy occupation. They must never accumulate in large

numbers in a given area that the enemy can surround and eventually

starve them out or gradually close in on them.

48. Guerrilla forces must be always alert to possible anti-

guerrilla action. that may be taken against them and constantly

•Prepared to take suitable evasive action..

49. The guerrilla bands most essential function is to guarantee

its own continuation. The very existence of the guerrilla band

requires the enemy to guard against then and in so doing they are

drained of manpower, supplies and equipment which the enemy forces

might be needing badly in some other area.

50. Clear-cut victory is seldom possible either with or against

guerrilla warfare-- the side that hoids out longest will be the

ultimate winner.

ter when thrown.

PLASTIC

Potassium Chlorate

Petroleum Jelly (Vascline)

A round wooden stick or rolling pin

Spread the Potassium Chlorate thinly on a hard surface. Roll the round stick (rolling pin) over the

crystals to crush them into a very 'fine powder (until it looks like face powder). Take 9 parts of the.

powdered Potassium Chlorate and one part of vaseline,

and kread them together until a uniform

paste is obtained. Detonate with a blasting cap or with a . 30 caliber fused blank.

BLACK POWDER

Potassium Nitrate - 25 parts

JELLIED GASOLINE

Pour the contents of one bottle (1 pint 3 o%.) of Dynamo concentrated liquid laundry delergent into a

bucket or large mouthed can of about two to five gallon size. Fill the detergent bottle twice, shaking

well to rinse it out with gasoline (any grace) and ace it to the detergent. You will now have about

3 1/2 pints (57 07) of material in the bucket. The detergent will be at the bottomandthe gasoline on

the top. Stir this rapidly with a wooden or wire paddle so as to mix in as much air as possible. Soun

the mixture will take on the appearance of soft vasoline.

Now add in a gallon of gasoline and stir again until the mixture thickens. At this point, transfer the

mixture to clean containers. No return iype beer and soda bottles are ideal. For chemical land

nines, use two gallon oil cans.

The container should be tilled approximately one third full of the

Finish filling the container with gasoline leaviny a little air space at the top. Place your

finger or hand over the opening and shake well until the gasoline and mixture amalgamate. You can

verify this by looking at the finger or hand occasionally lo see if a film of jellied gasoline about an

eighth of an inch thick clings to it. When proper consistency is reached, the bottles may be capped or

corked. Cans should have tight fitting lids screwed on.

This may be stored up to two weeks. Tie

a rag around the neck of each bottle being careful not to leave the ends of the rag too long or too loose.

If necessary, this mixture can be "eut" SU.? with gasoline or other petroleum product. The tendency

to "cling" will sutter slightly, but consistency can he maintained by pouring off the excess gasoline

whenever the detergert refuses to "take" any more.

To use, saturate the rag with gasoline or the mixture from the bottle.

Keep the flamable material

off of your person and clothing. Lighi the rag with match or cigarette lighter and immediately serve.

Throw hard against a solid object such as masonry, concrete. or metal.

In using the mixture in

a chemical land mine, wrap three or four wraps of pri macord around a to gallon can and tie the prim:

acord under the can around a pound of explosive. This may be exploded either electricaily ir by a per-

cussion such as a booby trap device or anti-personell fuse. Do not contact wires to the blasting

machine until after you have carefully removed all traces of your work and camouflaged the position.

Never us any plastic article in contact with the above mixture.

We granted the interview with the newspaper women I wrote you about.

It should be

out in a week or so, will send you a copy when its printed.

We really put on a show for

this girl, the seciet contact, mceting place, radio communications, etc. The whole secret

agent bit. During the intervicw she told us that the police had been out to see her after the

first article. The San Diego Police wanted to know who she had talked too (we mailed the

information for the first story to her). Later she had a visit from the feds asking her if

she would infiltrate our organization for them. They must be getting hard up for information

when they have to go out and try to recruit people.

This girl might be alright, but we are

not going to trust her anyway. Its getting where I can count the people I trust on one hand

and still have four fingers leît.

Enclosed are three more letters for you, two wrong addresses, and one hate letter.

Just so you will not think that you are the only one who gets these letters, I have enclosed

one lve received a few days ago. If the literture we send out gets these types (religous

nuts and love creeps) so upset, then we must be on the right track.

Sorry about the delay in mailing you the May Bullotins, we just did not have

the funds to pay for the printing until now. If nothing go's wrong we will be able

to print-up the Security Training Program and your Mail Drop Transfer Letter

this coming weekend. Flope to have the funds available for the Special Bulletin

the following weekend.

I have enclosed a copy of the first part of the newspaper interview we gave.

Will send you the other articles as they are printed. The way we understand it

is that it will be a three piece article, The first one is not to bad. We have

been receiving articles from other papers in the area too, but they have all been

of the smear type.

On the subject of bulletins; when would you be able to write another one, and

what subject would you be covering. Also would like for you to write the foremat

(one or two pages) for some of the bulletins. We have been trying to keep the

bulletins between 10 to 12 pages long. The only original bulletin we have put-out

so far is the one you wrote on lock picking. I am fairly good at stealing material

and rewriting it, but have trouble writing anything orginal.

Would like to set-up another meeting with you in the near future. There are

some things we need to talk over with you that we cannot put in a letter. Let me

know when you will have some time off and we will try to make some arrangements.

The shit hit the fan here this week again. We put out a Special Bulletin containing

information about some of the San Diego City officials. The fuzz was out to see me two

days after we mailed it out. They told me that the city had assigned to detectives on

full time duty to keep an eye on SAO activities. The left fired bombed one of their own

cars and tryed to blame it own us, plus one of the city councilmen received a threating

phone call. The detectives told me that one high ranking left winger had call the police

and demanded they assign him policemen to protect him.

We have been making some real good headway in setting up new groups in California.

Some of the new people we are getting are working out real well, others are the hanger-on

types. We are having a little trouble with some DePugh types up in Los Angeles. They

don't like the idea of us organizing up there. If they start any trouble we will give then

more than they are looking for, you can bet on that.

We should have the May Underground Bulletin ready to mail out to you by the first of

the month. We are reprinting the Communications Bulletin. Rewrote it to fit our group.

Il we have the money I will try to print up both of the letters at the same time.

Sorry to here about you being out of work again, no how it is trying to make ends meet.

I can only draw eight unemployment checks then I will have to go back to work. Sure wish

some fat cat would finance a few of us to work full time on organization activities. Guess

there is no danger of that thou.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

SPECIAL BULLETIN

As most of the citizens of San Diego County are no doubt aware many liberals, pinks,

reds, and other fuzzy thinking types. will be bringing themselves and there gas masks here

in August for a "peaceful" protest during the Republican National Convention.

While local left-wing groups are preparing for the "peaceful" protest by stock piling

gas masks, flak vests, firearms and ammunition the city of San Diego is rolling out the

red carpet (aptly named) for these profession revolutionaries. Yes, as strange as it

may seem some members of the San Diego City government are going out of their way to

make sure these communist revolutionaries are made welcome here.

Mavourneen O'Connor, twin sister of City Councilwomen MAUREEN O'CONNOR

• (Home address: 5821 Lauretta, San Diego, Telephone: 295-8693), is one of the more

prominent members of the community who is engaged in this strange behavior. Miss

O'Connor is employed by the Southern California First National Bank as a Community

Relations officer, taking time off last year to run the campaign of her sister Maureen.

Her new duties are setting up a central headquarters for the protestors to use during

the convention. The Unconventional Center (also aptly named) is to be this headquarters.

Located at the corner of Jefferson and Riley Streets just six blocks from the Sports Arena

• •

the site of the convention, the 7, 800 foot warehouse is being stocked with the expected

services that may be needed by the protestors.

These include; transportation, facilities

for the printing of propaganda, a telephone message center, legal aid services, and a

medical aid center.

These last two are odd, considering its to be a "peaceful" protest.

The bill for all this is being picked up by the Southern California First National

Bank who's chairman is ROBERT OSCAR PETERSON (Home address: 567 Gage Lane,

these left-wing type activities, in fact as late as January 1970 he was on the recciving

end of a smear article done by the San Diego STREET JOURNAL. The Strect Journal

for those citizens lucky chough not to have seen an issue is one of many pro-communist

underground newspapers that operate in the San Diego area.

The article on Peterson exposed his business dealings with a number of large com-

panies; Foodmaker Corporation (owners of Jack In The Box drive-ins), and the Ralston

Purin: Corporation among others. At the end of the artiele the Street Journal made the

ww 5500dem6atdh8bsas5zgingagetiglg would expose other of his business dealings.

---

## Page 414

Needless to say, the article never appeared. One can only wonder now that Mr.

Peterson is supporting these same type of people if some kind of blackmail was not used.

Many of the members of the staff of the strect dournal live at a commune supported by

the paper at 173 4th Avenue in Chula Vista.

The first news conference of the Unconventional Center was attended by these noted

prominent city officials: Councilmen Gil Johnson and Jim Bates, and city manager Kimball

Moore.

Others not quite so prominent attending were a long haired representative from

the Community Congress and Shari Whitehead, 21, a representative from the Convention

Coalition. The Convention Coalition is the group that plans to coordinate the activities of

protestors expected to arrive for the convention. While Mayor Wilson was not able to

attend this inceting in person he later made this comment on Mavourneen O'Connor's pro-

demonstration activities " I commend her for her energy and her efforts ".

• Of all the organizations preparing to protest at the convention the Convention Coal-

ition is probably the most active.

Some of the leaders of the coalition are; Peter Bohmer,

the off again, on again, economics professor at San Diego State, seen recently at 4931

Coronado Street, San Diego: Michael Kenneth, address 3777 Fairmont, San Diego; Pam

Williams, also seon at the Coronado Street address: and last, but not least, Doug Porter,

recently seen at 2445 Albatross, San Diego. Headquarters for the coalition are at 309

6th Street in San Diego.

While the Intelligence Branch of the San Diego Police Department has reported to

city officials the militant activities (stock piling weapons and explosives) of these leftest

groups the city fathers have annoy all warnings. Instead of spending every dime the

city can spare on weapons and equipment to help the police put down a possible riot the

powers to be believe the money can better be spent for SENSITIVITY TRAINING.

While the left is planing a full scale battle the public officials of San Diego spend the

tax payers money on sensitivity training for the police department. And guess who they

pick to teach this garbage, a foreign born (Iran) Professor of Psychology who was kicked

off the staff at San Diego State becausc of his profanity and teaching of left-wing views.

JAUAD EMAMI was a Assistant Professor at SDS before having been removed, he and

his wife Minou live at 3850 American Avenue in La Mesa. The 5'10", 190 pound, black

hair, brown eye professor was educated at UCLA and the University of Arizona.

Emami

drives a white van (California %M.J 141) and is payed $25 an hour to teach our policemen

to talk nice to these creeps that will be invading San Diego in August.

• Instead of hiring this fuzey headed professor the SAO believes the City of San Diego

should have hired Lieutenant Cally, then at least the police would have received some

expert training on how to handled RED TRAITORS.

Dear Mr. Gibson:

As I am a former FBI Agent, one of my friends forwarded

to me information which she received through the mail from

a "Secret Army Organization."

You probably have this back-

ground information, but if not, I felt that it deserves

your consideration and attention.

Mrs. Lusk does not know why the literature was forwarded

to her.

She is employed by the Pacific Telephone Company

and several weeks ago she wrote a letter to the Editor

which was published in the Union Tribune on the subject of

amnesty for the draft dodgers.

If you desire any further information concerning this matter,

please give me a call.

Very truly yours,

Dear Fellow American,

At the request of a mutual friend we are sending you this invitation to

join the Secret Army Organization.. Those of us who have been members for

some time sincerely believe that our organization can be of real value in pre-

serving for future generations the land of freedom and opportunity which our

forefathers handed down to us.

It is the belief of our organization that the communist-socialist con-

spiracy has infiltrated the United States Government to such an extent that the

American people cannot rely on this country's elected leaders to protect them

from communist domination and slavery.

We believe that the time will come when the American people will have

to fight for their lives and their liberty. In this belief, we have formed in

advance a secret underground army with but one objective, to defend our con-

stitutional republic and to help our fellow Americans to do the same.

We do no want lukewarm members. We are an organization of people

willing to make any sacrifice necessary for our country. If you feel the same

way, we invite you to join us.

History of

Secret Army Organiz

DIY

Oue carly morning in February, 1970, a group of six Minutemen leaders from

four states mot secretly in Northern Arizona to discuss the crisis that the arrest and

imprisonment of two top MInutemen leaders and the assassination of a third had

brought on the organization. Although some of these men had met before in their roles

as Minutemen group leaders, others were meeting for the first time.

After much discussion, two principal points were agreed upon. First, that the

Minutemen as a national coordination organization of militant right-wing groups had

effectively been destroyed by the pro-communist ciements inside the Justice Depart-

ment. While individual units still existed throughout the country, few had the financial

support or leadership to be really effective. Second, that the need for such a coordi-

nating organization wasgreater than ever in view of the increased revolutionary activity

by communists in the United States.

With these two points in mind,

suggestions were pit forward on a course of

action to be followed. After ameeting that lasted all that day and far into the next

morning, an overall plan of action was finally agreed upon. All present agreed to

merge their individual units together and form a new organization under the command

of one leader elected from among themselves, with the other five to be members of a

General Staff that would advise and assist the new leader.

While retaining the basic programs and policies of the Minutemen, it was

decided that not only should this new organization have a different name, but also a

completely new chain of command and organizational structure. If the new organiza-

tion was

going to survive the attacks that befell the old one, a whole new approach

would be needed. Never again could the arrestor death of a few leaders be allowed to

cripple the entire organization.

For this reason it was decided that only a highly disciplined military type

orgainization with a definite chain of command would have any chance of success. This

then, was the beginning of the Secret Army Organization. Beginning with an original

force of hard core patriots that numbered fewer than two hundred, the Secret Army

Organization began the job of picking up the pieces and continuing to fight for national

and individual freedom. Using this cadre of dedicated personnel as a nucleus, the

S.A. O, has been recruiting and training new members in the skills they will need as

the heedom fighters of tomorrow.

The leaders of the S. A. O. have no idea of fighting a last ditch stand. We have

no desire to commit suicide ourselves or to let our members do so. We have a

strategy which we believe will ultimately lead to victory. Only one thing is essential.

We must start proparing and training NOW! We of the S. A. O. believe that our country

is worthy of any sacrifice. If you fecl the same way, we invite you to join us.

TO F

pective Members Of The

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

The Secret Army Organization is the most active, most complctely dedicated and

most selective in its membership of all the many patriotic organizations in America.

We are willing to make any sacrifice for pur country and ive fully expect that some of

us will have to make the ultimate sacrifice before victory is achieved. Our very lives

depend on each other. There is no place in this organization for bunglers, playboys or

lukewarm conservatives. If you join the Secret Army Organization, there might easily

come a time that your life would depend on how competently some other member had

• learned his job.

Unless you are

especially well informed on the domestic and world political

situation, it is probable that you have a lot to learn about the present threat our nation

faces. Unless you have had many years experience in actual underground warfare,

there is undoubtedly a lot you can learn from the experts in our organization who have

developed and supervised our training program.

OUR NATION IS IN IMMEDIATE DANGER

It is possible that within a very few years, perhaps even within months, our

nation could be conquered and enslaved by the communists. To prevent this we must

know as much as possible about our enemies. Unless we know who they are and what

they are doing we will not succeed in our efforts to maintain a free America.

THE RESISTANCE MOVEMENT

In driving an invader from your land the resistance involved goes through three

stages of development.

1) The Underground Network

2)

Active Guerrilla Warfare

• 3) Open or Conventional Warfare

The conventional warfare stage uses everything in the way of weapons that the

enemy does but must also have activeguerrillas and underground agents working against

the enemy, too. In the present state of military tactics conventional warfare cannot

succeed unless these other two ingredients are used simultaneously.

The first step is to form an underground network. An active guerrilla system

must have the support of an underground network of approximately three times its own

size. This underground must supply the active guerrilla fighter with supplies, con-

cealment, information, etc. An underground network starts with departments of

intelligence, security and propaganda in that order.

Sabotage, espionage, subversion, infiltration, escape and evasion, training,

clandestine fabrication of supplies, counterfciting enemy documents, recruiting, com-

munications and propaganda are other phases of underground activity. Each member.

of the Secret Army Organization, to be effective, must have a working knowledge of

all these tactics as well as the military tactics more commonly associated with guerril-

la activities.

## Page 423

ASSIGNMENT TO UNITS

Many people that inquire about membership in the Secret Army Organization

scem to have an idea that they will be immediately accepted into an active unit.

Look at it this way. Suppose you had spent a year or more carciully recruiting and

training until you had a hard hitting team where every individual was reliable, dedi-

cated, and had contidence in his fellow unit members. Wouldn't it make you mad to

have the national or regional organization assign some rank amateur to your unit

that you you knew little or nothing about?

Before any new member is assigned to an active unit or to an important under-

ground project, hemistundergo a period of training. During this training he will be

directed through the mails by an experienced member and some of his activities may

be observed by other members without his knowiedge. Only when a new member

proves himself to be conscientious, trustworthy, self-disciplined and able to operate

effectively alone will he be accepted as a "'secure member" and invited to participate

with other unit members in a teamwork operation.

EXPENSES

Unfortunately, most good things don't come cheap. Although we make every

effort to keep down the expense of membership in the Secret Army Organization, you

must expect to pay your own way.

Dues to the Secret Army Organization are $3. 00 per month. This money is

absolutely necessary for use to maintain our central files and headquarters, for

postage and printing, to finance our extensive intelligence network, and to maintain

training areas.

Each member will have other expenses depending on the type of activity he is

engaged in. Every member will be expected to buy his own gun, amnunition and

other basic combat equipment. During training the new member may be expected to

buy certain books or subscribe to certain magazines that his work requires. During

this time the new member will also be supplied with reading material on the strategy

and tactics of guerrilla warfare. This home work will make it possible for him to

fit in quickly to an active unit and participate effectively in actual maneuvers,

marksmanship training, etc.

Following this preliminary training a member may be either assigned to an.

existing unit, assisted in organizing his own unit if he has shown sufficient leadership

qualities or become part of an underground network.

Upon your acceptance into the Secret Army Organization you will be given a

definite scries of projects described inwriting so you will know exactly what will be

expected of you.

We hope that you can succced in this effort because your country desperately

needs patriots at this time.

NIXON

DESCRIPTION

FULL NAME: Richard Milhous Nixon. DATE OF BIRTII: January 9, 1913 at Yorba Linda,

California. FORMER OCCUPATIONS: Used car salesman, law clerk, second rate congress-

man, and mediocre Vice President. PRESENT OCCUPATION: Professional liar and double

crosser (part time employment as United States President). WEIGHT: 170 pounds. EYES:

brown. HAIR: black, HEIGHT: 5'11", ' RACE: White. NATIONALITY: Claims American

citizenship but actions prove this unlikely. LAST KNOWN ADDRESS: 1600 Pennsylvania

Avenue, Washington, D.C. (Rumored to have a California hideout.)

CRIMINAL RECORO

RICHARD NIXON (alias Cry-Baby Nixon, alicas Tricky Dicky) is an expert in disguises and

has successfully passed himself off as an anti-communist in the past. He may again try using

this disguise if pressed for votes in 1972. Saying one thing, then doing the opposite is Nixon's

MOA. While he campaigned in 1968 on a platform of curtailing socialism he has in fact done

more to establish a socialistic dictatorship than either of the last two Democrat administra-

tions. His economic policies have continued to enrich Big Industrialists while rising prices

and higher taxes have all but reduced the average worker to a state of financial slavery. This

criminal has even made vicious attacks on small children (forced busing to acheive "racial

balance") and has caused the destruction of local school systems. WARNING: Nixon suffers

from an EMPEROR COMPLEX and becomes extremely dangerous when criticized.

CAUTION

Trickery and deceit are Nixon's trade-marks. At the present time Nixon and his chief hench-

man HENRY (CZAR) KISSINGER are engaged in forming an alliance with another gang of

criminals, the Red Chinese. The RED CHINA GANG have slaughtered an estimated fifty

million of their own people since coming to power. This Godless horde of barbarians killed

thousands of Americans in the Korean War (shooting captured soldiers and starving and tor-

turing prisoners of war). The RED CHINA GANG have been supplying the NORTH VIETNAM-

ESE BANDIT'S with weapons and bullets to kill American soldiers in another no-win war in

Vietnam. The very fact that Nixon is dealing with these ARCH ENEMIES OF FREEDOM iS

enough to convict him of treason. DO NOT LET THIS CRMINAL STEAL YOUR FREEDOM.

of the FBI, or whether he, or the people he appoints will be able to

be trusted-as i. Edgar Hoover and his mon. Thore will never be

su man as good or competent as j. Edgar. Hoover. And I fear for the

salety di our country, Il and when ho retires. lI do not trust nixon,

I don't even respett him, and he is not, what many people used to

think he was:!.)

If the SAO, are truly dedicated Counter-Revolutionary's, then they

are your only hope, and mine.

and 1t would seem that every 10Ja1

Therefore,

It would be In your best interosts to either destroy

and to protect them.

BecRusa

mo wrlting to you, not because they don't trust fbI agents or

up In the fort.

and they don't trust AiY Attorney General's anymore,

for which I don't blame them!! (any Attorney General who would quit

If the SAO are true patriots, with high principles and standards, and if

thoy have faith in God to deliver us from our brutal deadly enemies,

then I would do all I could to help them -within the Law.

The only roason I revealed all this information to you, and to my

But, I repeat-are they really Pro-American, or have I walked into

& TRAP? The communists have succeeded in causing unprecedented

SUSPICION and FEAR, In our once great and glorious Nation. Now:

we are reduced to suspicious and wary warring factions--a CIVIL WAR!

As I have said bofore --I would rather that we (my children and I) d10,

than to live under Communism. (The next world, with God, will bo

better than this one anyway!)

II Red China is going to take us over (and 1t looks liko soon) then I'd

rathor work in an underground Resistance movement--and die like a

America.

Truly, it looks like the days of the Vigilantes--has

REPORT OF JEROME

February 6, 1970

I talked to BILL CLAY last night. He has

• been out of touch since last Friday night,

and could

not be reached by telephone and was never at home

when I went by.

Apparently some member of the Minutemen

Organization or another right winger is being watched

or surveilled and CLAY is quite excited about it.

He

thinks the FBI is doing the watching and he wants to place

a surveillance on the San Diego FBI Office for the pur-

pose of determining the times of arrival and departure

of the employees and obtaining the descriptions and

License plate number of FBl autorobiles.

He is going

to try to get

several people together who will be able

to spend time

watching

• the FBI Office.

REPORT OF JEROME

February 5, 1970

I learned-today that FRANK YAKOPEC found a

• dead skunk on the road yesterday which he picked up,

placed in a cardboard box, which he then wrapped in

plastic bag, and born paper on the outside.

He mailed

• this package from the del Mar post Office yesterday

addressed to JAN DIEPERSLOOT at the Peoples Commune.

He was told that the Minuteren are going

to try to begin printing a news leaflet that publi-

cizes names and activities of interest amoung the left

wingers.

I talked to PAUL RUPLINGER this morning

who said ht would like to get some kind of harassment

•going again against Professor MARCUSE at UCSD.

RUPLINGER

also said that his son PETER RUPLINGER has a close

personal friend who he knows has been informing on both

left and right wingers for the FBI, for about a

year. RUPLINGER sáid he intends to make this person's

name known to a number of people so as to destroy his

_activities as an informant.

MARCH 6: 1970

JEROME

I atténded the CHC planning meeting in Balboa

Park last night.

Igot there at about 7:10

but the meeting

did noù get going til 7:35.

There were approximately 50 to 60 people present.

•The meeting was chaired by the Reverend BILL COATS.

•I saw FREITJOF THY GISON "there, however, he left early,

in disgust.

no recognize And Search st

SHAPIRO and BERNIE SENTER in the crowd.

Also present

was a young white individual in his early 20s with long

dark brown hair. He was wearing a fatigue jacket with

red

stars

on the collar.. I heard him refer to as "ILorn" (Lowell

and he said he was a representative of the san Diego

Street Journal.

Bargaial

Two other persons who spoke at the meeting

claimed to be representatives of MDM. One was a clean

cut white male with a military 100k, medium bulla, about

5'9" tall.

he has Light colored hair and wearing a Mao-

tse-tung

style guilted cap.

other vias also about

5'9" tall, medium buila, long blond hair who wore gold..

rimmed glasses; a red jacket and camouflage pants.

It was decided there would be city wide peace

activity. during the week of April 13 to 18, 1970. However,

there

was a lot of arguments and backiting as to whether

the actual peace masch should take place on April 15 or

April 18, 1970.

Tt was agreed the march should probably

start at noon and that it would be a flop if less than

8,000 people showed up.

The MDM representative with the Mao tse-tung

cap was screaming that people from the military and people

with jobs could not come of the rally was held on the 15th,

wednesday,

and finally the MDM and Street Journal prople

walked out of the meeting.

After they left,

there was

some discussion about a possible compromise where the rally

would be held on Wednesday evening and servicemen would

be bussed to it.

Before they left, the people from the Street

Journal announced that they had moved into new offices

but were evicted the same day after the police department

talked to their new landord. They said that they had an

offset place which they would use to make posters for.

the April demonstration.

(Lowell Bergman)

"ILOYD" from the Street Journal oredicted

there would be a breakup in san Diego in

future due to polico department harassment.

During the meeting, it was announced that there

would be efforts made to organize a city wide student

strike at high schools on April 15, 1970.

It was also announced that MDM would have a

mock trial of the military on April 1, 1970, which with be

composed of active duty CIs and with MARK LANE as prosecutor.

It was eventually decided that the April demon-

stration would again consist of a march from downtown San

Diego to a rally in Balboa Park.

People were asked to volunteer to work on the

various planning committee.

One interesting thing that occurred was a

speech by a man from the audience who claimed that

the November 15, 1969, demonstration

in San Diego

was nothing more than a disorganized mob.

He said

the planning for the peace demonstration was all wrong

and

that the demonstration should be held on a weekend

workers could join in. He said the people at the meeting

should que as had been done where, he said, groups of

30,000 to 40,000 workers had been organized to march down

the

streets chanting.

This individual seemed to be well known, was a

white male, about 60 years old, gray hair, 5'7"

•and

stocky built. He had a flat, round face and spoke with

a heavy European accent.

There were no colored people at the meeting.

JEROME

A demonstration began today at San Diego State

college and students from the school took over part of

"the administration building and at one time there were

close to 700 students there with more expected to arrive

after 4:00 p.m, when classes were out. It has the earmarks

of lasting for a long time.

The demonstration was touched off at about noon

by a speech given by KARL KELIER at a rally on the llbrary

loan. The students are protesting administrative action

taken by the school against four professors there.

Food including apples, oranges, carrots, punch

and loaves of bread is being passed around in the building

and Is apparently being prepared at the Wesleyan Foundation

Building.

Signs have been put up in the building indicating

that the

restrooms have been "liberated" and are now co-educational

Some marijuana was seen being passed out free. About 100

students have elected to stay over night and are going home

In shifts to obtain sleeping bags and other items.

The demonstration appeared to be well planned and

some organizers, Including RHETTA ALEXANDER for one, were

seen communicating with walkie-talkies. Other persons

observed taking part in the demonstration wee RON BREEN,

STEVE NYSTROM,

BERNIE SENTER, ALAN STANCLIFF, SUKUMO and

FRIETJOF THYGESON.

JEROME

I stopped by State College about 11:00 p.m. last

night. There were about 75 students in the halls

of the

administration building who were painting 30' long banners

and placing them on the walls of the administration building.

They were also printing leaflets announcing a rally at noon

today a campus. LEON NOWER was observed there holding hands

with a young girl. BERNARD STREIFF, the french student

who claims to have participated in the french student

revolt, was also there.

APRIL 15, 1970

BY JEROME

I met an interesting individual at BILL CLAY'S

house last night.

He is ,called "The Judge" and his

first name is JERRY.

He is about 5'10"

to 5'11"

230 pounds, has heavy built, ruday complexion and is

tall,

35-45 years old.

He has black hair which is receding,

a pug nose, round face and heavy jowels. He carries

a brown and

32 automatic pistol and is apparently

an excellent

shot.

He said he spent 8 years in military intelligence

following which he

worked for the CIn and then for the FBI

ät San Diego as an informant. He claimed he was a paid

assassin for the CIA.

He seemed to be highly intelligent

and I was told he was good at make-up and voice imitations.

He said he had worked at Hollywood as a bit player.

He claimed that when he worked for the FBI

at San Diego, he was assigned to watch TROY HOUGHTON

and that he quit at about the time of the watts riot

in LosAngeles.

He said he was never a close acquaintance

of HOUGHTON but he had followed HOUGHTOr a lot and

came to the personal conclusion HOUGHTON was a Communist..m-

He seems almost to have convicted CLAY of this also.

As CInY stated, he had verified that HOUGHTON

had been meeting some known members of

the Communist

Party. BUSH and CLAY were thinking DE PUGH may have

become aware of this and had HOUGHION eliminated.

this Is so, cual said he was thinking about contacting

DE PUGH and humbly apologize for po trying to break away

Irom the national Mi organization.

"The Judge" is supposed to be from Virginia, although

he has no accent, and apparently hates colored people. He

speaks fluent German and Spanish.

CLAY stated he believes one of the leading Leftists

in the area is MORRIS KOMINSKY who lives at. 400

Street, Elsinore, ralifornia.

He has written a last Franklin

book which

is being advertised in papers like the Free Door and the

Street Journal.

KOMINSKY allegedly moved in high circles

in the Federal

and local Governments at one time and has

supposedly been visited on numerous occasions, high placed

Government people, including Congressien, senators, and fresi

dents such aS tRUMAN, ISNOWER, and NONViD.

CLAY said he wants some local Right Wing peonle

to visit KOMINSKY and somehow get his signature.

Gaperic.

BY JEROME -

Today, I went yith "The Judge" to see MORRIs

KOMINSKY •

KOMINSKY is an order man, 60-70 years of age,

about 5'9" tall, curly black hair which has a lot of gray

In it, blue eyes. He weights 160-170 pounds, has poor

posture, as he slouches and has a pot belly.

From his

statements, I gathered that he is very much in favor of

what the san Diego Street Journal is doing. He said he

gave all his records to the Street Journal

and claimed

that it took 5 Street Journal staff members 8 hours to

copy his notes oí the San Diego area alone. He claimed

he had much more information on Right Wing activities

in America and claimed he has

spent five years researching

information for his new book which will be called

l "Count

Down, USA. "

He said the first volume of this book which

will

be an expose on fascism in the United States, will

be 800 pages long and the second volume will be 1300 pages

I0ng.

Le seemed to be pleased

to talk about his work and

as we repried ourselves to be fans of the Street Journal,

opposed to lascism, he talked quite freely.

He told us of contacts he has in the San Diegn

Police Department, of the San Diego District Attorney's

Office, and also claimed to have a source of information

in the

San Diego FBI Office.

KOMINSKY said he formerly had high placed friends

in Government and claimed he had been visited at his home

in Elsinore by Presidents of the United States such as

TRUMAN, EISENHOWER, and KENNEDY.

ON MAY 8,.

1970,

BY TEROME

Today, I went to a meeting at the Greek

Bowl at state College to find out about the march route

for the anti-war demonstration to be held tomorrow.

There were about 60 people in attendance at the meeting

• which started about 3:00 rM.

These included BILL COATS,

ALAN STANCLIFF, FREITJOE, THYGESON, GARY GULLEY, JACKQUELYNE

TUMBURG, and a

reverend Irom the wesleyan toundation.

There was a big hassle about the choice of the •

march route; the ChC wanted to march from Horton Plaza in

downtown San Diego, along Broadway to the 11th Naval District

Headguarters for some speeches and then to the old ferry

landing for a rally.

SMS and the other students voted this down and

CMC almost walked out. A long debate followed resulting

considerable uneasiness between CMC and STIC. ALAN STANCLIFF

was selected as monitor captain.

Afterwards, I went with BILL CLAY to Grossmont

College where another anti-var rally was taking place and

picked up some leailets, which are attached.

We noted that they were passing out free food.

BILL CLAY went and got some

syringes and FRANK YACOPEC

bought some pickles which were injected with rubbing

alcohol and

castor oil and

were passed out to the students

who were seen eating them. It is not noted if any of

them became 111.

FRANK YACOPEC set fire to a trash can in a rest-

room to cause a little extra excitement.

Alter this, we

drove by the People's Commune and saw three male individuals

wearing Army helmets.

Today, approximately 5,000 people, mostly long

•hairs and hippies participated in an anti-war march and

demonstration in San Diego. They marched from the downtown

area to Balboa Park where

a rally was held. It was noted

that MDM marched as a separate unit in the demonstration

and was trying to cause trouble.

BILL CLAY, who was present recognized two "long

hair" Minutemen in the middle of the MDM group trying to

rabble rouse.

CLAY had mobilized between 100 and 200

right wing individuals and there appeared to be a lot of

right wing agitation.

There also appeared to be about the

same number of Marines out waiting for a fight and several

were seen in front of the Federal Building holding coke

bottles and waiting for the hippies to come along.

I was told

that the demonstration march was stopped

at the 5th Avenue Bridge over Interstate Highway 5 and that

BILL CLAY and his friends were the ones who stopped it.

BILL CLAY got into a discussion with FREITJOF

to be a

THYGESON, who appeared to be very disgusted with the repetitive

nature of the demonstration and the

location of the march.

Persons observed present at the demonstration

included HERBERT MARCUSE, BILL MILSON, WARREN NIELSEN,

PETER CARTWRIGHT, BILL COATS and ALAN STANCHIFF.

SYLVIA SHAPIRO was the Master of Ceremonies and

STUART INNERST waS the main speaker. JAN DIEPERSLOOT and

RON BREEN also spoke. Dr. GEORGE ABBOTT was also there and

had organized an emergency medical corps : using walkie-talkies

and with ambulances available.

Sergeant BILL COOK of the La Mesa Police Department,

and the Captain of the Security Guards at Convair (NFI)

were there and were taking good photographs of the demonstration.

It was learned that BILL CLAY "liberated" two rolls

of exposed film from, someone participating in the demonstration.

It was noticed that apples and oranges were being

passed out and afterwards the Minutemen made plans to load

up some oranges with anti-freeze and donate them to the

'upcoming MDM rally at Oceanside.

I was talking to BILL CLAY last Saturday.

He seemed agitated and said he had needer to use a

• of caution.

and that he wanted

this done to attract Ferera.1

attention in order to protect

someone else in the

background.

He is still talking about a new Right Wing

organization and claimed to have contacts with groups

in 11 western states and

said these people are

trying

to establish a communications network and said the

name American Resistance Movement (ARM) had been

selected for this organization.

CLAY got to talking about DE PUGH and said he

had been aware of DI PUGH's whereabauts when he was in

hiding.

said he now has reason to believe TROY HOUGHTON

may still be alive and probably connected with ARM. He

said he believes HOUGHTON may have wanted out of the MM

organization, for some reason, and had to disappear to do so.

CLAY also talked about setting up a meeting with

the Leftist student group at University of California

San Diego during the regular week and he would like himself,

BARRY GODFREY, SAM DAVIS, and GEORGE HOOVER to meet with

four students from that group.

I have learned that HOOVER always carries a

savage .380 pistol when he is away from home.

DAVIS

usually carries

a .380 or .32 automatic pistol, CLAY

usuaLly nas a •ce automatic pistoL, fRaNk lacorec always

"The Judge" (JERRY BUSH) usually has a

•380 automatic pistol, and PETER RULINGER carries a

It has

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY and FRANK

YACOPEC are going to see BILL CLAY this morning at about

11:00 a.m. to listen to a right wing speaker at UCSD.

This Friday GODFREY is supposed to help CLAY

move to his new apartment in Pacific Beach.

The photograph of ALDEN EDWARD WILLIS is not

familiar, but the one of GEORGE HOOVER IS. HOOVER previously

had a goatee beard, but has now shaved it off. In persor

'he looks much meaner and heavier than he appears in the

photograph. He always has the same wide-eyed expression on

his face.

It has been learned that BARRY GODFREY has been

picked by the San Diego Fire Department to go to a school on

bombs and explosives and he will probably be on the new

fire department bomb disposal squad.

It has been learned that with the help of BARRY

GODFREY, BILL CLAY moved last Friday, June 5, to his new

apartment at 4113 Ingraham, San Diego. This

is supposed

to be Ingraham Villa. No one is supposed to know about this

CLAY had a large quantity of personal belongings

and junk to move and has rented a garage near Second and

Ivy (between Ivy and Juniper on the east side of Second

there is a row of four garages and CLAY has the second from

the left where he is storing some of this stuff.

o4o It was also learned that GEORGE HOOVER was at BILL

CALY'S new apartment Friday evening and was in a talkative

mood as he was dead drunk.

HOOVER apparently works at the

same place as SAM DAVIS. HOOVER said DAVIS was recently

in Texas on vacation and coming back his automobile broke

down at Gila Bend, Arizona, and HOOVER had to go out there to

assist him.

Their boss at the fence-company, is also supposed

to be a Minutemen and HOOVER and DAVIS are probably getting

some of their explosives from the fence company.

HOOVER now uses a .45 Automatic Pistol which he even •

takes to bed with him. He claimed his boss recently put

up $400 to get him out of some legal trouble.

HOOVER Said he had been living with a girl (NFI)

who in the recent past,

had walked out on him and had said

she was going to contact the FBI. HOOVER seemed to be

worried about this.

HOOVER was getting more drunk all the time and

began rambling about "the ranch" where he lives. He said he

had just moved out of the hotel into one of the

smaller

houses on te ranch.

He kept

: talking about his horse and

asked CLAY to call

"WILLIE" at the ranch and ask him to feed

the horse.

NW 55000

DocId: 32989523

Page 575

## Page 576

HOOVER uses the nickname "Mick" and usually

hangs out at the "341 Club" on Second Street in El Cajon.

He also kept talking about a ROGER who went with him to

get SAM DAVIS.

This

ROGER may live or work with HOOVER.

During thé evening CLAY approached HOOVER about

doing something to PETER CARTWRIGHT for spilling the beans

on the undercover police officer named

JFK Act 6 (4)

It was also learned that many Minutemen, knowing

that law enforcement officers are prone to handcuff people

behind their backs, are now carrying handcuff keys attached

to the inside rear

waist band of their pants where they

can

avoid being detected

in a frisk.

Attached is a copy of the May issue of a new newspaper

named "The Orange County True Press" which is being printed

by right wingers in the santa Ana and Anaheim area. The

names of these people appear in the newspaper. The paper:

was

acquired

from JERRY TARTAGLIO through FRANK YACOPEC.

I have learned that BILI, CLAY has been approached

by a group of leftist students at University of California

,at San Diego who are allegedly fed up with the left wing

tactics which have been-used at university of California

at San Diego and are supposed to want to form an alliance

with right wing groups and individuals to deal with the

Government. BILL CLAY seems to be enthusastic about such

an alliance as he feels there is a considerabl amount of

agreement between right and left wing groups as to the

goals they would Ilke to achieve and their general aisillu-

sionment with the Government and the established order.

CLAY is giving the matter careful thought and may

recon-

tact this group of

students at a future time.

An acquaintance, ARTHUR HANSEN, told me today

•there is a house at It fern Glen, la Jolla, about two

houses from HANSEN's home which is occupied by "three

weirdo men" who live, there together.

They have many

stop signs, apparently stolen from intersections around

town which they have nailed to the fence in their back

yard.

HANSEN Said he recently observed one of these men

In the back yara at T11 Fern Glen wearing a housecoat and

a red wig.

HANSEN also told me that the night before the

"pig Invasion" of la JOlla, his sleep was disturbed by

loud noises at approximately 3:00 a.m. and looking out

his bedroom

window he saw many cars arriving in front of

the house at 711 Fern Glen to the point that the street

was Illled up with cars.

He said each car carried two

to five male individuals and he estimatea a total of 50

to 60 people entered the house at 711 Fern Glen. HANSEN

said he watched this incident until approximately 5:00 a.m.

when he went back to bed and as yet none of the individuals

had left the house. He said, however, when he awoke the

next day the cars appeared to be gone. HANSEN thought

this incident might have had some connection with the yippie

invasion of la Jolla the following day.

The parts are for a World War II German automatic

REPORT BY JEROIE

On August 7, 1970.

Yesteiday,

August 6, 1970, I went to watch

the National Yeople day at Disneyland. any long hairs

and hippie type people tiere at the gate and parking lot

'all day long bui

there weze never enough there at one

time to make a big crowd and most left after milling

around fo: a while.

It appeared that they just did not

have enough money to get in..

FRANK YACOPEC, JARRY TARTAGLIO and others got

in using Press Cards from the Anaheim Bulletin. Also there

was FUGE BROWN from the Orange County Taul Press,

othes there

STEVE

FRANKS frOM VIVA

and many other right wingers izo.

Orange County area. The group took several hundred photo-

gra' is and shot two rolls si movie films.

The only serious

incident occurred at about

6:30 p.m., When 300 or 400 yippies got together and started

marching fron place to place in Disneyland.

There were

several scuffles with the police who were called in at

about 7:00 p.m., and one girl was yelling "Kill the Pig,

Kill the Pig.

The yippies made an attemot to tear down the

flag in the fort Dut JaPRY TARTAGLIO and "CHUCK"

stood

against the flag pole and stopped them.

one of the apparent. leaders of the yippies was

about 45 years old with long

hair and beads.

He got into

a scuffle with the police and

a cop grabbed him by the

hair, which caine sight off showing hin to be very bald.

It looked to me as if there would have been

serious trouble if the yippies had been able to get a few

nore people in there.

However, they backed right down

when they were confronted by the police. A lot of threats

were made and obscenity used.

During the day I noted about six yippies in front

of the gate with 15 - 20 ticket books passing out tickets

to other yippies to get in. Someone put out a lot oi

money iss a lot of yippies to get in.

REPORT BY JEROME

August 27, 1970

This morning I was talking to General WILLIAM

LENLY ho lives at 1536 Glorietta Place, Coronado.

•He clained to have

been part of a

Military underground

•organization since 1927,

which was strong because of

fears in the Military of Communist takeover in this

country.

He told me that AVG actually stands fos

american volunteer Governient

He explained that

later on the arranization felt a need for an above-

ground front organization and

so established the American

Volunteer Group, with lEDRIC "BUD" JOHNSON as the lea:er

and with an Advisory Council of 13 Military officers.

•These included Connander BALDORE who refused to go to

the Government would not fight to win,

General "CHaSTY" PULLER, General CUSTIS IS MAY, and

According to LINIY, membership in American

Volunteer Groups was to be opened to civilians but

restricted only to those referred to the organization

by the Military Council and those who were already

members.

When "SUD" JOHNSON died, under mysterious

circustances, JOHN ZUMANIC and his secretary, HELEN

GRANI,

took over.

ZEMANEC and GRANT then threw the

menbership open to the general public upon which the

Militazy Council dropped out, and as far as the Military

is concerned, that part of AVG is now defunct.

LENLy told me that the nane A. DUNN which

appears on old AVG bulletins and letterhead stationery

is a pseudony for a woman fion Seattle. He said she

is an agent for a private investigative group which

has its headquarters on the east coast.

investi-

Bacive group is run by a tormer ibI Agent named FRAM

CAPELO (phonetic) and investigates left ming activities.

CAPELO is suppose to be in the san Diego area

in the near future, and LaiLY said he would refer ie

to him for possible employuent as an Agent on the west

coast.

LEMLY claimed that he and ROBERT WELSH,

• leader of the John Birch Society are good friends

and communicate frequently.

Lanty clained that he

is Vice-President of the National liberty Amendment

Committee, which is a icont group for the John Birch

SociEty.

The Liberty Anencuent

represents the

elimination of income tax and LaMLY clained he was

testifying last week before a California State Senate

Gioup about the amendent.

I saw LEMILY on PAUL RUPLINGER's secommendation.

LENLY claimed he and PAUL• RUPLINGER are also good friends.

LIlLy again talked about the American

Volunteer Governient

and said the purpose of the organization is to bring

"about a Military coup in this country if it becomes

necessary.

He said the organization's headquarters

are located in or near Washington, D.C.

LEILY said that JOHN ZEMANIC was formerly

Chief of security of the above ground organization undes

JOHI.SON and his secretary, HELEN GRANT, was suppose to

be a teacher but LIly's group was never able to verify

this. LiLy said that because of the peculiar circum-

stances surrounding JOHNSON's death, his group did a

little investigating ard found that

ZEMIANGC WaS a

Long Shorman and belonged to HARRY BRIDGES Long Shorman

Union.

LENLy said that ZENANaC night actually have

been a left wing infiltzatoi.

IEtY appeared to be very Military, anti-leit

and pro-minute-nen and way form an alliance with the

Minute-nen in this area.

LENLY who was in ONI for several years, also

claimed to have access to Canadian and British Intelligence

REPORT BY JEROIE

August 31, 1970

I found out this morning in talking with

DALE HERSCHLER that the manages of Les Girls who was

• supporting the Fece Door rinancially backed out two

• weeks

ago and the paper is now in trouble.

For the

fizst time the Door is planning to charge for the

newspaper, they still may not have enough

noney to

print it.

They have decided to stop carrying sex

oriented adas in the papes.

I also learned that the Sunrise newspaper

lost at least $8,000 on the rock concert it sponsored

and does not have enough money to go on printing.

talked

to General LINLY of AVG again who .

told me that

"BUD" JOHNSON, former leade: oI AVG,

was in the process of putting together a big expose

on the Connunist Party in the United States at the

time of his death.

LILLY said JOHNSON was getting

his information from a former Military Intelligence

Officer who was also connected with AvG. LauLY said

he and other officers in the Military part of AVG

suspect JOHN ZAMANEC may have had JOHNSON done in and

the Military part of AVG is out to get ZElANIC and

the civilian AVG organization if they can.

LEMLY claimed he and some right wing

friends

were responsible los putting togetehr and passing out

the leaflets announcing the Yippie Pig National Invasion

of La Jolla early in the summer.

LEnLy said althougn

they did not think anyoning would actually nappen, it

turned out better than expected as many La Jollans

were turned against the left and have indicated

support for right wing activities.

The new Minute-nen stickers were printed at

Alex Rapid Print in La Mesa,

California.

REPORT BY JEROME

September 2, 1970

I learned this afternoon from Message Information

Center that an unidentified group of individuals in the

San Diego area is preparing for a large scale anti-Vietnam

war demonstration tomorrow during the festivities sur-

rounding the visit and State dinner of Presidents NIXON

and ORDAZ. Apparently this demonstration is separate

and apart

from the previously announced "Yippie Dope-In"

at Coronado, California, tomorrow.

According to MIC plans for the demonstration call

for participants to gather in the Hotel Del Coronado

parking lot for a rally and march beginning at 9:00 A.M.

I have also learned that a large number of

right wing oriented individuals mostly older female mem-

bers of the John Birch Society will also be present in

Coronado tomorrow to carry signs and protext against left

wing groups.

REPORT BY JEROLE

On September 8, 1970

I was talking to PETER RUPLINGER this

. morning and he told me about DEPUGH holding sone of.

the people in cages when he was captured by the FBT.

PETER is no longer living with Professor

FRED AKERS and

has teuporarily rented an apartment in

El Cajon using the name DON FREEDMAN. He is going to

try to rent one or two. Post Office Boxes using that

name.

PETER is suppose to get married October 23,

1970, and will then rent an apartment in his own name.

PETER told me that he, FRANK YACOPEC and

BARRY GODFREY had a meeting to make out future right

wing strategy. It was decided that they would continue

to harassing left wing individual and organizations

but would avoid hurting anyone or getting involved in

any real violence.

PETER said that he made contact

with a person named

"TRAVIS" who he said is a lefty

but who he is converting. PElaR said TRAVIS told hin

on september 3: 1970, about a person named R. J. WORK,

who lives on Lincoln Avenue who had infiltrated

activities for the left.

He also told me about

an individual at the

University of Califonia at San Diego where a construction

worker dropped a five gallon bucket of tas from the

fifth floor of the new hospital bullaing into a group

oI hippies. Apparently the bucket of tar broke and

sprayed all over the hippies.

PAUL

PERS. RUPLINGER, posing as a prospective

buyer, went to the house at 1302 Union Street, San

Diego, California, on September 2, 1970. He said he

founa

the place was divided into fous apartments.

some of which he did not see.

He said he observed

nothing which night possibly

have been connected with

YSA and added that the landlady told him she had

just told the tenants to get out of one of the

apartments and had re-rented

it.

REPORT BY JEROME

September 18, 1970

This morning I went to Message Information Center,

arriving there at about 10:30 AM. Already there were TOM

HYDE and a young high school kid named STEVE (LNU) who was

learning how to be a MIC operator.

I shot the breeze with HYDE for about an hour.

He told me he is now Acting Co-ordinator for MIC. He said

, there will be a change in MIC leadership as he, HYDE, will

be leaving in about a month. He did not say where he is

going.

The former MIC co-ordinator, PHIL PLYMATE, is

supposed to be going to work full time with the San Diego

Street Journal. According to HYDE, both the Street Journal

and Sunrise are supposed to be out again in a few weeks.

HYDE said there will be mostly new people on the Street Journal

staff.

HYDE also talked about MIC's "Fugitive File"

' This

file contains information on how to help deserters and draft

dodgers get out of San Diego. He said the file had been taken

out of MIC and hidden because many of the people connected

with this work had been questioned about it recently by the law.

gerome

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523 Page 623

## Page 624

He said that when things cooled down, the flle

will be improved and put back into MIC. He said one of

the things they planned to do is to ask anyone who calls

for help if he is a Federal Agent, thus hoping to trap him.

He also said that apparently some of the servicemen who

were helped in the past spilled the whole story about MIC

and other people when they got back to their Base.

I stayed at MIC until about one o'clock. After

awhile HYDE left, and I spent the rest of the time showing

SIEVE how to do the work. I received and gave out a lot

of weird messages.

I was able taobtain the following

interesting information:

HYDE'S telephone number is 582-8203. PLYMATE'S

telephone number is 232-8657. New Adult Communities new

telephone number is 239-2119, and RICK PHELPS' new address

and emergency only telephone number are 2810 31st Street,

telephone

number 283-1934.

I agreed to pull another shift at MIC this Thursday

from 1:00 to 5:00 PM.

2) Post Office Box 76

In the name of CHARIES THROP

Some right wing people are excited about the

SIP rally on Detober 3, 1970, and may attemot to create

a liotle excitement.

One of the suggestions made was to

place black powder or primacord in the cracks along the

railroad. tracks over which the marchers will pass and

Ignite it as they go by.

I learned that approximately one month ago FRANK

YACOPEC shot a large size steal nut through a window of the

Commune at 2nd and Thorn striking a hippie inside squarely

on the side of the head.

The hippie dropped as if shot

but nothing has been heard about it since.

GEORCE HOOVER has been very quiet lately and no

what heluding BItt CLAY seems to knon where he is or

he is doing.

I learned this afternoon that STP 1s going

to hold a meeting at the 2nd and Thorn Commune at 3:00 P.M.,

today which I will attend if I can.

SEPTEMBER

1970

Yesterday, I spent four hours at Message Information

working the

switchboard from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

I spent most of my time there copying about 300 names and

addresses from the MIC files which I will furnished in the

near future.

Last night, there was an siP organizing meeting

at the street Joumal building at Second and Thorn.

Apparently,

that was the only STP meeting which will be held before the

SIP demonstration on 10/3/70.

Exploring Family school has apparently moved to

El Cajon and has a new telephone number which I will also

furnish soon.

I discretely observed

the STP demonstration

The march and rally looked like a failure

they only had 200 people participating when

they had announced that they expected 4,000 or 5,000 to

join in.

I was really surprised at the hostility of the

bystanders and onlookers toward

Many of

them were yelling "Communist"

the marchei"to to Russia"

"Pigs"

and

at the marchers.

The sailors

and Marines along Broadway

were very menacing and several times I thought therewere

going to be fist fights.

The demonstrators did not stop at the llth Naval

District Headquarters building or at the Police Department

headquarters but just walked by chanting and shouting

obscenities.

There were three speakers for the rally at Newtown

Park. The first was RON NIBBE, who apparently had just

been arrested by the police and talked about his arrest

and how it was unjustified.

He said everyone should be

good Communist comrades and buy guns. He said that the

people should oppose and defeat the

police and completely

eliminate them.

He said it was unwise to seek community

control of the police and by having them live in the communities

becuase then they would know what was going on all the time.

The next speaker was a young male Negro individual

•Who said ne was a representative of the committee to Free the

Soledad Brothers.

He said the soledad brothers trial

is going to be moved to San Diego and that as much of the

committee as possible would also be moved to San Diego. He

said however, that many people who belonged to and worked with

the committee up north won't be able to come to San Diego

and that the committee needs volunteers from the San Diego

area to carry on its work. I didn't know what this person's

name was.

The last speaker was CARLOS CALDERON who said he

wanted to organize the Chicano movement and truth about

the great heritage of the Latinos and gave several examples

such

as CHE GUEVARRA with whom he apparently was very impressed.

done sta

It was announced that Experimental College

at san Diego State College is going to have a workshop

course on Communism this fall.

At the rally, there was a guy going around

selling a copy of "Challenge"

saying that it was a

Communist newspaper. I believe I heard someone call

him by the name of MIkE.

He was about 6'1" tall, 220

pounds, brown hair, receding at the forehead, 28 years

old.

He was accompanied by a girl name KATHY, who is

apparently connected with women's Liberation and PIP.

KATHY was about 5'5"

hall, very slim build in her

early 20's, curly brown

These people said that there is

a new discussion meeting each Sunday on "Challenge"

and PLP and wrote down the address and phone number down

for me, 3993 Broadway, San Diego, telephone 263-1465.

FRANK YACOPEC was also at the rally wearing an

old felt had shot full of holes, a phoney FU MANCHU mustache

and a fatigue jacket. No one paid any attention to him.

Leaving the rally, I almost got into a fight with

three people who were very uptight and thought I must have

been a Lefty.

by Jerome

JIM STEWART, the fellow who has in his possession

SYLVIA SHAPIRO'S CHE maIlIng list, Is about 1y years old, clear

cut, short hair, seems

to be very intelligent and I believe

he is a student. He lives near the beach and it looks like he

is a person who is mainly responsible for organizing the anti

war demonstration in San Diego on 10/31/70.

I heard some very interesting information about a

store

at Julian named the Mountain Market Grocery. Apparently the

people at the store

are openly advising for the Minutemen

organization and ure selling minutemen and other right-wing

literature over the counter at the store. Iñas also told

that collections for DE PUGH'S legal defense are also being

taken at the store. I will probably goi up there soon and see

what's going on.

I learned from BARRY GODFREY that GLENN MOORE picked uy a

hippie female hitchhiker earlier in the week.

She was

apparently very radical, but MOORE got friendly with her and she

told him that the recent tires in the mountains were mostly

set by leftists and were part of a leftist plot.

I also learned that there is going to be a showing

of a film and a fund raising event at the Kent Theater on

10/15/70 to raise money and to make plans for the anti-war

demonstration on 10/31/70.

!

While I was at MIC today I learned about an individual

who is believed to be an undercover police officer by the

leftists.

This individual is 40 to 50 years old, has dark

greying hair, is unshaven and goes by the name BODINE Or BOLIVAR

or some such similar name.

Apparently he showed up several

weeks ago looking for a ride to the east coast.

He claimed to

have been connected with ahfree school somewhere in California

and also at Santa Barbara. He always carries a sleeping bag

with him and "crashes" wherever he can.

The people here have

been checking on him and contacted the free schools at Santa

Barbara and in Colorado and found out that he wasn't known

there.

This plus the fact that he is still around after having

looked for a ride to the east coast makes him believe he is

- with the police.

I also saw and met PHIL PLYMALE. He is extremely

weird looking and has a very strange beard and hair-do even

for the people at Message Information Center.

He impresses

me as being very paranoid and is highly suspicious of everyone.

Last Friday, I went up to Julian to the Mountain

Market Grocery Store

and met the owner, whose name is MARGie

MC NICKLES.

MC NICKLES sells Minutemen, Ku Klux Klan and

other similar literature and material across the counter at

her store.

She is also working with the Patriotic Party in San

Diego and told me that she is going to try to form a chapter

of the Patriotic Action Legion in San Diego.

Her son is supposed to be President of the Young

Republicans Organization at Grossmont College.

She told me that ROBERT DE PUGH has been on trial

for all the rederal charges against him at Albuquerque, swed

Mexico, and has been held in the City Jail there.

DE PUGH was to have been sentenced on 10/9/70 and said that

he was asking for a total of ten years each on nine separate

counts.

MC NICKLES said that the jailors at the Albuquerque

City Jail are taking very good care. of DE PUGH as most of

them are very sympathetic to him;? MC NICKLES also made a

statement to the effect that it DE PUGH is sent to Laavenworth

he will never get there which I took to mean that there may

be an escape attempt.

MC NICKLES also said that she Knows JOHN ZEMANEC OL

• AVG and GLENN JACKSON of the Patriotic Party at LoS Angeles.

She showed me an open letter which DE PUGH wrote to ZEMANEC

telling him to get completely out of right-wing activities.

She also had some other stuff which she claimed

to have just

recently received from DE PUGH.

MC NICKLES also told me there is a commune at Julian

not far from her place.

She said these people are long hairs,

but clean and drive nice cars.

She said they moved in several

months ago paying $32,000 cash money for the house. She said

• NW 55000 DocId:32989523 Page 646

---

## Page 647

that although the former owner of the house told her he

sold the house to a woman she has seen only male individuals

at the house.

She said there are only a few individuals who

stay at the house during the week, but that several carloads

of male individuals arrive each Friday evening and stay over

until Monday morning.

She said she and her husband feel

that some kind of training is going on at the commune as

they have been able to hear radio Morse Code signals from the

house in the evenings when the wind is right..

She said the person who is always at the house, which

is located on Whispering Pines Drive, drives a Car with

California License TXL 136 which also has a Yale sticker

on it. She said cars with the following license plates have

shown up there on the weekends:

VGL. 342

OKU 316

RGD 465

WTH 134

I have learned that SUNRISE now has a bookstore

at 4855 El Cajon Boulevard.

FRANK YACOPEC has been talking

about breaking the windows of the store.

JIM STEWART, address 5854 Ithaca Place, telephone

453-4867, has apparently been connected with a group called

the Non-violent Action Center.

pu =

"The San Diego Street Journal" has a brand new

telephone number which is 235-4478.

BILL CLAY went out of town Friday night and did not

get back until late Sunday night. He now has his pilot's

license and is certified to fly solo and wherever he went he

flew.

CLAY told me that the Minutemen lost some stuff

during the recent fires in the back country.

He said included

in the losses were a Lewis Machine Gun and several other

small machine guns and some ammunition and explosives which

NW 55000 DoeId: 32989523

Page

647

---

## Page 648

weren't buried deep enough. He said the losses weren't serious

and that most of the stuff

weren't hurt. He was talking about

running a survey to locate all the buildings and warehouses

and other places in the county where ammunition and explosives

are stored so that these places could be cleaned out or

blown up in the event it looked like the left was serious

about starting the revolution.

He was also talking about unburying 500 pounds of

explosives to have ready to use in the event of an

emergency.

He also said the Minutemen in the area have acquired a new

20mm Caliber Lahti anti-tank rifle..

It has been learned that BERRY GODFREY was

in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday. Apparently

he and GEORGE HOOVER and several other people are

planning to change their names, occupations and so

on and

s0ing "north" disappear

They are supposed to be

, however the exact location is not

known.

Their purpose in doing this is to start

a Minutemen Commune as a base of

operations against

the Left.

They have photographs which they claim

were taken of people at Communes in the Northern

California area wearing. fatigues

rifles.

and practicing with

They will try to locate these communes

and conduct terrorist activities against them.

It was also learned that DAVIS attended a

recent gun show at El Paso, Texas. He reportedly sala

he would put Godfrey in touch with his suppliers, who

can get anything in the way of weapons, ammunition

and explosives and other articles when he leaves.

Apparently DAVIS and HOOVER will put this

plan into effect auring the first part of 1971..

• It is known that HARRY RUJA; Professor at

San Diego State College, has been more active lately.

He has

been involved in trying to organize some sit

Ins and some protests against the arrest of LEON NOWER.

He looks as though he may be trying to take NOWER's place

as the radical faculty leader at San Diego State College.

It was also learned that a Datsun pickup truck

which RUJA drives to work was burned up on his driveway

last Saturday night. It is suspected that some of the

local Minutemen may have been responsible.

It was also learned that over the last weekend

the windows at the Sunrise Book Sore were broken.

automatic weapon in .223 caliber which Colt

hopes will replace the M-16.).

These weapons were all supposedly in good condition

and were fully operational.

They apparently belonged to a

::'"

Attached is an SMC leaflet which I recently

picked up at SDSC.

It appears that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM DAVIS

are bosom buddies.

They invited me to go to the Gunsmoke

Ranch In Harbison Canyon last Sunday.

They were both

there and I also met

ROGER WILLIS.. In addition there

were three women and two other males at the ranch whose

names I did not learn.

DAVIS was in Mississippi recently and at the

ranch he was driving

a green Chevrolet van with Mississippl

license F/6192030.

He apparently broke down somewheres

In Texas one the way back and HOOVeR went to rescue him.

On the ranch there is a pistol range

and a

range with phenys opts up and running targets but that

part was burned down in a recent fire.

The range is

being rebuilt.

There are also two muzzle loading cannons

on the ranch and there is a bunker or open mine shaft

type of thing in the side of ahill.

I could see shoring

and supports inside but was not allowed to get close enough

to see. what: it

.was.

HODER and DAVIS were practicing quick-draw

shooting

and hip shooting and are supposedly good

shots with a .45 caliber automatic pistol. They are

always armed at least with .22 caliber derringer pistol.

SAM DAVIS has many M-2 carbine parts which he

will sell at a good price..

He gets alot of his stuff

from a place in Los Angeles, and he has approached BERRY GODFREY

asking him to stop at that place the next time he is in

Ios Angeles and obtain some hand

grenade casings. The casings

are apparently being sold for $1.00 a pise.

I learned that the house HOOVER lived in on the

ranch was burned in the fire.

I also learned that

there are two fellows named STAN (LNU) and DAVE (INU)

who live on the ranch.

While I was there SAM was thiring about staging a

punitive raid on the SDPD in retaliation for the arrest of

ISSAC CANIRELL. He said however he did not know CANTRELL.

Jerome

NW 55000 DocId: 32989525Page-656-

## Page 657

DAVIS sald he feels that the FBI and SDPD

are, communist controled and he wants to neutralize

them.

In particular DAVIS has a special hate for

Agent O'BRIEN of the FBI. He said he knows that most

of the Agents are decent people who are just doing

their job.

However he feels that O'BRIEN is

persecuting the Minutemen as a vengeance and said he

would give anything to get O'BRIEN's home address

and telephone number.

DAVIS said he was going to price some tear

gas grenades and said he could get primacord in 500 feet

lengths for $30.00.

It was learned that the SMC anti-war march

11/1/70 was a complete failure.

There were only 150 - 200

people who participated in the

march, with a few more

attending the rally. Nothing of interest happened

and the speeches given were dull and uninteresting.

I was In contact with PETER REPLINGER

yesterday. He said there has been evidence of many

students

in the school turning against the new left

movement He said apparently the Street Journal and its

staff had been caught. in some bad lies which had caused

many students

to be disillusioned.

It was also learned that SAM DAVIS wants to order

10000 .223 caliber bullets through BARRY GODFREY's contact

which will cost $255.

It was also learned that FRANK

YACOPEC wants to order 1000 M-1 carbine bullets.

This war is costing you, the taxpaying citizen, $2 million each

FOR WHAT?

Many of the sailors on this ship realize this and do not wish

I was told that BERRY GODFREY was In touch

the beginnings of some right wing activities at UCSD.

He said that the sis there tried to stage a protest

against the Marine Corps Recruiter which was scheduled

to come to the campus.

He said one SDS member dragged

an American flag across the quad and for his efforts was

beaten up by a couple of members of a new right wing

group at the school.

The SDS had planned to protest the number of

Negro Marines who have been killed in Vietnam, however

the Marine Corps set a Negro Recruiter to the school

which really threw water on their plans.

According to CLAY it appears that a real confrontation

may be brewing between the conservative and radical students

ac UCSD. It was also learned that CLAY now has his private

pilots license.

It has also ben learned that BERRY GODFREY and

other members of the Minutemen group may be present at the

SMC march and rally on 11/1/70.

I was in contact with PETER REPLINGER last

Saturday.

He told me he has agreed to take charge

of all the Minutemen records which are presently being

kept by BERRY GODFREY.

PETER is getting ready for his

upcoming wedding and consequently has not been to active

lately.

I have noticed that someone has been painting

a number of pro-Minutemen slogans on bridge abutments

and overpasses around the La Mesa and El. Cajon area.

lately.

I had a chance to talk to BILL CLAY this

morning.

He Is still upset about MELVIN CRAIN:

He thinks CRAIN is behind a large part of the left

wing activities in the county.

He said he believes

CRAIN has a lot of weapons and ammunition stored away

on his Hollyoaks Ranch In Harbison Canyon.'

CLAY also mentioned that KENNETH GOFF was

In town yesterday. He said GOFF was and probably

still is a close associate of DE PUGH. CLAY said

GOFF is sort of a religious fanatic.

GOFF may have concealed DE PUGH forawhile when. DE

PUGH was in hiding. He said GOFF was here to speak

to a group of right wing people and said about 40

individuals attended the speech.

CLAY said GOFF told him of the existance

of a left wing revolutionary army which is operating

In this country. He said this army uses the name "Largo"

said the code used is supposed to be based on the sixth

and seventh chapters of one of the books of Moses in the

bible, which is somehow inserted into the IV program's

script. He also said there have been references to

Attached are copies of some new Minutemen

stickers and posters

which the local group has been

putting out.

They are supposedly printed by Alex

Rapid Print In La Mesa.

They are being mailed out to

many people and are also handed out locally around town.

It Is known that BETTIE HOUGHTON was in contact

with BARRY GODFREY last night. She was very excited about

the posters and stickers and said she was very glad to see

some activities getting started.

She said she is reorganizing

some of her contacts and group and said that the new posters

and stickers had caused such a flury in town that the whole

Kinutemen organization might really get going again.

She said LOU CONDE had apparently received some of the

stickers and posters and was excited about them. It looks

as though there are many people just sitting around waiting

for something like this to happen so they could get involved.

It was aiso learned that BETTIE Gave GODFREY

some plates with which to make some big Minutemen posters.

She also said she has nearly 500 negatives which can be

use to make plates for printing posters and leaflets.

I had a chance to talk to BILI CLAY again.

He maintained that there may have been some correction

between DAVIS and ISSAC CANTRELL aWhile ago. CANTRELL

is the one who was arrested by local and fèderal authorities

for unlawful possession and manufacture of automatic

weapons.

NOVEMBER 18, 1970

BY JEROME

The photo of JANES RICHARD BUSS is totally un-

familiar to me and I don't believe I have ever seen this

individual before. His name is also not familiar to me.

I was fairly well-acquainted with STEPHAN SMITH.

He was in the San Diego area for a period of approximately

a year and left six to eight months ago.

I was told that

he went back north, which I assume to mean los Angeles or

san trancisco.

SMITH was married and lived with his wife at Rancho

Bernardo while he was in this area.

He was very involved in

the right vs Leit controntation, which took place in foway

last year over the make up of the Poway school Boardo de was

Involved there with colonel SHIMP, the NORMANS, and other

people who were opposed to DANIEL PREDOVICH as School Board

Chairman and some of whom who were considering ways of getting

PLÒ OI PREDOVICH•

While SMITH was in this area, he was closely associated

with known members of the Minutemen organization, such as MiCHal

VAUBUDA, PAUL RUPLINGER aNd LOU CONDE• I dO nOT KNOW II SMIT

Is or was a member of the Minutemen organization, but if not,

be was not a member in name only as he appeared to be in total

agreement with the far Right extremist, radical, political

philosophies of VEJBODA, RUPLINGER and CONDE.

SMITH's wife

was also extremely right wing and on one occasion helped pass

out Minutemen organization learlets®

SMITh was Involved as a

partner with LOU CONDE in a business, which was named DIGISCAN.

DIGISCAN was supposed to have been an electronics research ano

manufacturing outfit, the main purpose of which was to develop

and

sell a police communications systen whereby each individual

police ollicer could,

at all times, be in constant touch with

some police base station.

SMITH and CONDE apparently had a

quarrel about the business and split up, and I believe there

may be a law suit pending over ownership of some of the equip-

went, which belonged to the company.

## Page 670

As a sidelight, SMITH would build monitoring and

"bugging" devices for a price.

He also had electronic equip

ment for use in searching buildings and other places for

hidden electronic monitoring devices or "bugs".

I heard recently that MICHAEL VEJBODA is presently

living in Salt Lake Cityo

There is to be a big gun show.in Campo on the

weekend of November 21, and 22, 1970.

and from the talk I

nave heard, it sounds as though it will be a regular gather-

ing of the Minutemen organization and other Right Wingers in

this area.

JERRY GEIER, I know, will be there with weapons

to show and sell'o

BENNY, the barber who has all the machine guns

and rifles in his barber shop, is located on the west side

of 30th Street, about 1 blocks north of El Cajon Boulevard.

I was in contact with SAM DAVIS last Saturday

evening.

For some reason he was quite upset and was talking

about making plans for a tactical squad of six or so individuals

with which to nartass and terrorize left wing sympathizers in

the San Diego area.

He said he wanted to have a meting this.

coming Friday evening to try to map out some strategy. In

particular, he seems to want to conduct a raid on MELVIN CRANE'S

ranch.

said he would shoot the Doberman Pincers CRANI has .

guarding the place, ransack the house then burn it down.

He was also talking about another place in Harbison

canyon, I will try to get the address later, where he claims

Communist Party meetings are being held. Among others, he claims

that SI CASADY and DOROTHY HEALEY (phonetic) have ceen meeting

there. He says he wants to raid that place too.

He was also talking about a 'Doc Roberts" who he says

has many weapons contacts and who may have access to machine

guns and hand grenades. He may put me in touch with this person

Later on.

• I have also been talking to FRANK YACOPEC. YACOPEC

says he has learned of a possible existence of some bunkers

which were buried and abandoned by General PATTON at the start

of the second world war.

He says the bunkers are supposed to

still be full of ammunition and explosives.

He claimed he

was told of the existence of the bunkers by a former aide of

General PATTON. He told me that he, BILL CLAY ana BARRY GODFREY

may fly up to the location at a later date and look it over.

bankers are

ina ter date

Apparently these bunkers are located somewhere in the desert

east

of 29 Palms.

I was also in touch with PETIR RUPLINGER on Saturday.

He stated he has obtained 50 hand grenade fuses and wants to

go to Los Angeles to buy 50 hand grenade casings and he will

then activate the hand grenades. PETER claimed he has a friend

who works at the Frontier Gun Shop in San Diego who is a

right wing individuals and is selling unregistered ammunition

and firearms. PETER has been carrying a t3 caliver revolver

lately.

I also learned that SAil DAVIS has an unknown quantity

of expendable rocket launchers with rounds which he will sell

for $25 each.

He is supposed to ze looking for anti- tank

weapons and mortars in the hundreds or thousands.

DAVIS apparently

has a brother who is also very militant and is working

with him.

I am supposed to see BETTIE HOUGHTON this evening.

She will put out 500 of the new posters and stickers (see

attached) .

The advertising from the posters and stickers has

obtained

BY JEROME

I was in contact with MARGE MO NICKLES at

Julian last Weanesday and talked to her for about three

hours.

We discussed DE PUGH's status.

She said that

representatives of

'the Minutemen organization and the

Patriotic Party have been talking to former Chief of

POliCe REDDIN at Los Angeles alleging that DE PUGH is

Innocent of the bank robbery conspiracy charges on

which he was recently convicted.

She said she was

told REDDIN is sufficiently convinced of the possibility

Of DE PUGH's innocence that he may search out evidence

• In this regard on which to base a program for his

television show.

She also talked about a JIM MOORE who she said

¡s in California and is on one of MC NICKLES' mailing

list.

She also mentioneä an older man in Los Angeles

named FREED who is a leader of the Patriotic Party. She

said that DE PUGH's mother is also a Patriotic Party

leader and told me that DE PUGH has asked GLENN JACKSON,

of Los Angeles, to resign as co-National Patriotic

. Party Chairman.

MC NICKIES said that she herself is Secretary-

Treasurer of the Western Region of the Patriotic Party

which covers ll states. She said in the event of a

split in the Patriotic Party between DE PUGH and JACKSON,

she will side with DE PUGH..

account and the membership list for the western Region

of the Patriotic Party in her possession.•

She also told me that the Minutemen National

Headquarters continues to function under BOB DE PUGH, JR.,

and RAMONA VAN DE PUGH.

She said there is a courier

traveling between Los Angeles and the Minutemen National

Headquarters weekly.

She asked that her son, DAN I. MC NICKLES,

a student at san Diego State College, be used at

Right Wing activities and made arrangements for me

• to meet him this evening at 8:00 p.m., in La Mesa.

MC NICKLES told me there is a woman living

in the Julian commune and said she has seen

others

coming

and going there. She gave me the license

numbers of two more of

the cars she has seen at the

commune.

One was an out of state license, white back-

ground with blue figures XVC 316, which was on a dark

green car with white racing stripes, possibly a Mustang,

which was at the commune on october 11, 1970. Ine

other was a tan over brown Volkswagen bus with California

liCense MHD 097 which was at the commune on November 2,

On Friday I saw BILL CLAY and told him about

MARGE MC NICKIES.

I asked him if he thought we should

try to use her to re-establish contact with the Minute-

men National Headquarters.

CLAY

said "I don't know.

We'll have to ask SAM about that.

I was definitely

impressed from the way he made the statement that perhaps

he has been taking orders in the Minutemen organization

from

SAM DAVIS all along.

We then went together to see DAVIS and discussed

MC NICKLES with him.

He said

that we should continue

talking with MC NICKLES to see what contact with her

would produce.

CLAY and DAVIS then got to talking

about breaking DE PUGH out of jail at Albuquerque and

I related to them what MC NICKLES had told me before

about going to Alaquerque to visit DE PUGH. CLAY and

- DAVIS became very upset and jumped all over me because

I had not told them about MC NICKIES being there and

about knowing the layout of the Albuquerque City Jail.

After this they started talking idley about

getting DE PUGH out of prison at Fort Levenworth.

DAVIS then stated he had seen DENNIS MOWBER not

too long ago and at that time MOWER was hiding out a

girl who was allegedly a former secretary for DE PUGH.

He said MOWER told him that for some reason DE PUGH had

people looking for this girl to kill her and that also

she was being sought by the FBI.

DAVIS continued talking and indicated the

possibility he hold a higher position in the Minute-

men organization In the State of California than we

previously suspected. He said he has been using the

name SAM WILLIAMS in

some of his other contacts and

Minutemen activities.

CLAY then mentioned a former San Diego area

Minuteman named ED ANDREWS who he thought had always

been very reliable. He aid he had previously understood

ANDREWS to be somewhere in the State of Arkansas but

said VIC WAITON had told him that ANDREWS was back at

Ramona, California, some time ago.

They also talked about HOWARD CLARK as a

reliable Minuieman member. He also apparently lives

at Ramona and is employed

at Convair.

MC NICKLES is

also well acquainted with CLARK and they said we should

uSe CLARK as

confidence.

a reference to MC NICKLES to gain her

CLAY and DAVIS want to have another meeting

soon for the purpose of setting up a scheâule or list of

targets in the San Diego area to hit in the event it

appears that a communist or other totalitarian takeover

in this country appears imminent.

From my contact

with CLAY and DAVIS it appears that there has been

considerable improvement in the communications and

coordination among the Right wings in this area.

Additionally, regarding my contact with MC NICKLES,

she told me she is Neo-Nazi. She also said she is

in contact with JOSEPH BRINKER and also said that HENNING

VON BECK is in town.

She said he is the son of a General

VON BECK who was in the German army and was executed at

the Nurenberg trials.

She sald he told her that last

week some one fired a rifle bullet through the windshield

of his automobile and regularly gets letters from Jews

She also told me that the local telephone

Installer at Julian, a man 40 - 45 years old, is also

a Minuteman and that he checks her telephone for her

to determine if it is being bugged.

REPORT BY JEROME

JANUARY 4, 1971

He was in contact with GEORGE HOOVER yesterday

who apparently has not been doing much of anything. He

also saw JERRYCETER last night who claimed he has made

contact with a Minutemen group at Los Angeles which is

Involved in buying and selling weapons. He told many

about some new Minutemen business cards which are coming

out of los Angeles. We got around to talking about hand

grenades and GEIER said that although he did not openly

solicit hand grenades. for money, he would obtain some for

money if he happened to run across any.

I am not aware of anyone connected with the

Minutemen organization placing Minutemen stickers and posters

around MORRIS STARSKY's apartment

house of on his car.

However, people like LOU CONDE, FRANK YACOPEC and the

RUPLINGERS are always good suspects in things like that.

REPORT BY JEROME

JANUARY T, 1971

??:?! чі:

I was talking with GEORGE HOOVER day before

yesterday. We discussed an idea which he and SAM DAVIS

have had regarding setting up a Civil War Confederate

skirmish group similar to other such groups which have

been established In other parts of the country. This

group. will be set up by HOOVER, DAVIS, STAN MCDADE, (INU)

MARTINI of the Accuracy Gun Shop, FRANK YACOPEC and BARRY

GODFREY. It Is expected as many as 50 or 60 other individuals

may join the skirmish group, some who will be rightwing.

oriented people and may who will be just plain gun nuts.

These will include JERRY GETER, ROGER WILLIS and others

probably including some from the Patch and Ball Gun Shop

crowd.

I have also learned that GEORGE HOOVER and SAM

DAVIS have three operational Civil War field artillery

pieces which are located on ROGER WILLIS' Gunsmoke Ranch

property In Harbison Canyon and may actually belong to

him. STAN MCDADE Is

building a 4th artillery piece. He

has the gun carriage assembly and has ordered the barrel

for the weapon..

## Page 690

According to HOOVER, the beauty of organizing

such a skirmish group is that it will allow the right

wingers and Minutemen to use the group as an above ground

organization and to openly drill and train with weapons.

Members would have their own uniforms and the organization

would be set up in a military fashion with officers, ranks,

etc., assigned to the members. Persons joining the

organization will be protected from police and other

outside harassment by being assigned the name of an actual

CIvIl War officer or soldier to use while they are participating

• In the organization's activities. The existence of the

organization will also give the right wingers an excuse to

have large quantities of black powder and percussion caps

• on hand to use for their weapons.

In addition the organization could be used to

provide an honor guard to be present at local appearances

of right wing speakers and to set up counter-demonstrations

against left wing activities.

This skirmish group would be controlled and direct-

ed by an underground nucleus of 6 or 8 solid Minutemen members

who are not generally lown to other members of the skirmish

group.

HOOVER and DAVIS are apparently becoming less

Interested In BILL CLAY as a member and participant in right

wing activitles. According to them, he is too busy now

adays with his own personal affairs to be of much use.

For this reason, they have said they don't want him in the

underground group of Minuteman members who will direct

the Civil War skirmish.

It has come to my attention that JERRY BUSCH

has fallen out of favor with most of the Minutemen members

who do not like or trust him. SAM DAVIS has even threatened

to shoot him: GEORGE HOOVER still likes him though and

BUSCH spends most of his weekends at the Gunsmoke Ranch with

HOOVER and WILLIS. Could their be a romance brewing?

told me he is trying to revitalize the Virtue in America

BY JEROME

I was at Julian today talking to MARGE

MC NICKLES.

She said she had sent a letter to one of

my Post Office Boxes asking me to come and see her.

She said It looked as though there had been another

split in the Minutemen organization, and

showed

bulletin which she had received

from what looks like

a new Minutemen group.

The bulletin was printed on

the original Minutement letterhead paper and was post

marked December 15, 1970.

She said she received the

bulletin about a week ago.

Regarding the bulletin, MC NICKLES said that

In the past there was always talk about DE PUGH and

other people in the Minutemen organization regarding

an Executive Committee of advisors to DE PUGH.

According

to the bulletin, It had been sent out by that

Executive

Committee and announced that during the month of December

of 1970, no date given, there had been a meeting of

Regional Coordinators

of the Minutemen

organization at

Chicago, Illinois:

The bulletin said the Executive

Committee was gratified at the large attendance at the

meeting and went on to announce that control of the

Minutemen organization was being taken away from DE PUGH

and the res's of the National Headquarters Group at

Norborne, Missouri. The bulletin said this action was

being taken as it had been learned that funds of the

Minutemen organization had been mis-used, that nalucinatory

drugs had been purchased and that erfective leadershir

was lacking at the Norborne Headquarters.

The bulletin said that DE PUGH and his

associates should no longer be considered as part of

the Minutemen organization.

The bulletin advised that

• all Minutemen literature which had not been copyrighted

was being re-printed and

aistribution.

was always available for

grome

NW 55000 DocId: 32969523

Page 695

---

## Page 696

- She

said the copyrighted Minutemen lIterature

was being reviewed for changes so as to avoid the

copyright and would been be re-printed.

The bulletin also advised that as a result

of the December meeting the country had been divided

Into ten regions with a Regional Coordinator appointed

for each. The bulletin said that the Regional Coordinator

would be

the individual member's contact with the

National Headquarters. The bulletin had a return

address of Post Office Box 396, Elgin, Illinois bulletin

a note that the second address appearing on the

was that of the receiving members Regional Coordinator.

The note went on to say that if no second address

appeared on the bulletin the receiving member was to

send all Minutemen organization mail to the Elgin,

Illinois, address from where it would be forwarded

to the Regional Coordinator.

There was no second

address on MC NICKLES' copy of the bulletin.

Enclosed with the bulletin were a number of

the original Minutemen report forms which are to be filled

out and returned. Also enclosed were a number of the

origional Minutemen application forms which are suppose

to be distributed to interested persons.

MỢ NICKLES told me

she has heard of several

other people (no names given) in our area who also

received the bulletin.

She said, however,

that apparently

none of the JOHN ZEMANEC-GLENN JACKSON grOUp at Los

Angeles got them.

With regard to dE PUGh, Me NICKLEs told me

that the charges against him in the State of Washington

have been thrown out of court for lack of evidence.

MC NICKLES said she communicates regularly with DE PUGH'S

wife and received a letter from her not too long ago

which requested more money for DE PUGH's legal defense.

She said, however,

there has been no visible action in

this regard and pointed out that the above described

bulletin implied that DE PUGH's wife is "blowing" the.

money which is being received for his defense.

feroze

WW 55000 DocId: 32989523 Page

## Page 697

She said she has also heard a rumor to the

effect that DE PUGH's wife is running around on him

while he is in prison, but she said she does not believe

this is true.

mentioned

MC NICKLES said DE PUGH's wife had previously

a person named JESSE STEPHENS who may possibly

be connected with the group al Elgin, Illinois.

She said STEPHENS supposedly started a Right

Wing group some years ago, possibly in the Northwest

but was never recognized by DE PUGH.

She said she does not know if STEPHENS is

actually connected with the Elgin, Illinois, group.

I will send a letter to the group at Elgin,

Illinois, regarding what their plans are. I will use

the name JERRY MORAN and the Post Office Box Number 76

at spring valley, california.

"..

I have not been in contact with LOU CONDE in some-

time; however, I understand he is still politically active

especially in the group named Taxpayers Concerned.

PAUL

REPLINGER 1s still In regular contact with CONDE.

CONDE has always had a reputation as a "blabber

talks about little things which

are not very important.

mount" but actually only ONDE is a clever dynamic, ambitious

and hardworking person.

He has a lot of money and

•willing to put some of it into right wing activities.

CONDE has many Cuban exile contacts and is a Cuban

himself. In particular, he is close to the Alpha 66 group

and can get them out to do things for him.

CONDE is in very tight with the local tuna boat

association and I would imagine he also has many contacts

among the shrimpers and tuna sievers.

This 1s because he

has a marine engine and shipfitting business and does much

work for the fishing boats.

It 1s'

entirely likely that CONDE may be involved in

some way with illegal arms shipments on some of these fishing

boats between here and some Latin American countries.

If this

Is happening, I doubt that the weapons are coming to the

United States through the Latin American countries, but are

probably being purchased here and shipped to Cuban guerrilla

organizations in Central

and South America.

It is also possible

that CONDE may secretly be doing some work

to.arm some of the

tuna boats to protect them against seizure by such countries

as Peru and Ecuador. He mentioned something

about this to me

about a year ago.

It looks as though I may be going to the Gunsmoke

Ranch this coming weekend.

They're going to have a pistol

shoot there with quite a

few people attending. Last weekend

they had a shotgun shoot at skeet. The group at the Gunsmoke

ON JANUARY 18, 1971, BY JEROME

I have learned that sometime ago, FRANK YACOPEC

and JERRY TARTAGLIO were in contact with a retired Army

colonel who claimed he was some kind of an aide to General

PATTON, or otherwise connected with him, when PATTON was

Involved in desert maneuvers and training in the Palm Springs,

california, area at about the beginning of the second world

War.

According to what this colonel said, PATTON and his

troops received urgent orders requiring them to pack up and

ship out to go overseas with only two days notice. Because

of such short notice, rather than taking their heavy equipmert

and supplies with them, they simply abandoned and buried theri

inmolesale quantities.

I understand that many trucks and

tanks were part in ravines and gullies and dirt was bulldozed

over them.

There are a

! Iot of recorded instances where people

have found such buried supplies in the desert out beyond

Palm Springs.

This area is still all Government property

that is very

• little inhabited any any time.

Apparently the

Government has either lost its records, forgotten about, or

simply doesn't care about all the stuff that is supposed to

be buried out there.

In particular, this colonel told YACOPEC and TARTAGLIO

about a large concrete bunker with big double steel doors which

he said was filled with ammunitions and explosives and also

buried.

He apparently told TARTAGLIO

and YACOPEC how to locate

the bunker and I understand that they

went out to the desert

and after digging through about six feet of sand, actually

found the steel doors to the bunker. Following this, they

covered the bunker up again and have not been back since.

On the 27th of this month, a group Including YACOPEC,

BARRY GODFREY and PETER REPLINGER are going to go out to the

desert to try and relocate the bunker and dig it out. I

understand that REPLINGER has access to a portable jackhammer

and some other heavy equipment which he will use to dig out

the bunker.

If it is at all possible, I will try and go along

with them to see what they actually find.

ON JANUARY 25, 1971, BY JEROME

I was at the Gunsmoke Ranch in Harbison Canyon

yesterday.. When I got there, there were already 15 people

present, most of whom I did not know and as I was leaving,

three more people, STAN MC DADE and his two sons, arrivea.

Those I knew among the others present were JERRY BUSCH, SAM

DAVIS, GEORGE HOOVER and ROGER WILLIS.

Two of the others that

I noticed inparticular were a young fellow in his early 20's

about 5' 6" tall, 130 pounds, dark brown hair, who was called

GEORGE, and a big fellow with shoulder length

Goatee board who was about 45 years old, &i Entail, 300 pounds

and.bald. I believe he may have been referred to by the name

There did not seem to be any organized activity in

progress.

Most of the people were just more or less milling

around and talking with each other.

Most were carrying pistols

and most were shooting muzzle loading weapons at one time or

another.

While I was there, I got to talking to SAM DAVIS about

DAVIS stated he felt he could

trust CLARK completely and backed this up saying that CLARK is

storing some weapons for him. DAVIS said he had also been working

on some machine guns with CLARK at Ramona at one time-ard acted

that Cattean get a11 of the INtand Et plastic explosives ho-

wants. DAVIS said he would get a list of prices of this stuff

BEam ALAFELon February 55, 1971, and added that he, DAVIS, has

to go to court that morning to answer charges on three traffic

warrants.

• DAVIS also told me he will be going up to Mud River,

Idaho, sometime in the early part of this summer with several

other

people to live.

He said he will give me his address there

when it becomes available to him as he wants to stay in touch

with me.

It appears this may be a Minutemen commune he has been

talking

about starting for several months now.

ON JANUARY 26, 1971, BY JEROME

This morning I answered an ad in the newspaper

and purchased a .22 calibre Remington rifle for $20.00.

I bought the gun from a Negro individual by the name of

MAURY (ph) (LNU) who is presently residing at 5880 University,

Apartment #9. He looked to me to be in his late 20's, about

5' 9" tall and slender and was wearing a goatee beard

and a

moustache. He wore his hair in a modified Afro style and

resembled comedian BIll COSBY very much, both in physical

appearance and mannerisms.

He told me he had just moved to San Diego from los

Angeles and is looking for work.

While I was at his apartment, I noticed he had large

quantities of Black Panther and other black militant

literature,

Including books by ELDRIDGE CLEAVER and copies of the Black

Panther Party newspaper.

- -.--

In addition to the .22 calibre rifle, he also had

in his possession a .32 calibre automatic pistol which is a

cheap imitation of the French MAB and is made in Spain.

It has been learned that there is a San Diego Police

Department officer named BOB SISK who claims he is a member of

the Minutemen organization.

I was in contact with GILBERT MC GILL Sunday. He is

still employed at the Telephone Company. He told me he has

been helping to tap some telephone lines and that it is still

a common practice for Telephone Company employees to listen in

on telephone conversations in the san Diego area.

Regarding the possibility of a big Minutemen meeting

during the middle of December, 1970, I was unable to get in

touch with BILL CLAY during almost the entire last half of

December and it is possible he may have gone to the Chicago

meeting.. It is also possiblo that SAM DAVIS may have gone as

I am frequently unable to contact him for several days at a

time.

Source also learned there was to be a closed

meeting at 3:00 p.m., on 2/11/71, to plan for the

Sunday evening meeting.

Following this the microphone was opened to

the audience but only one individual, a young male

individual with long hair and wearing no shirt or shoes,

took advantage of the opportunity.

He spoke against

carrying the viet Cong flag and against trying to destroy

the system saying he believed the necessary changes

could be made within the established frame work. He

was not too well received..

Source also acquired a leaflet distributed by

members of the Student Mobilization Committee (SMC) at

the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).

The

leaflet called for a massive demonstration against the

Local draft board office on Park Boulevard and starting

with a

"mass-in" at the local board building at 10:00 a.M.,

on 2/16/71.

The leaflet indicated that persons interested

in participating should assemble in the Urey Hall parking

Iot at UCSD at 9:15 a.m., on 2/16/71. Other persons

desiring to attend should find their own transportation.

For further information interested persons were requested

to call telephone number 453-3362.

The leaflet stated that SMC desired to obtain

the signatures of enough people so that during the period

-/10/71 - 2/19/71, 20 persons per hour could be assigne

¿o be present at the draft board for harassment purposes

: The leaflet indicated that there are many legal

forms of harassment which should be engaged in such as

bringing any kind of garbage or miscellaneous articles

to be filed in a registrant's folder as Selective Service

law states that a registrant may place anything in his

folder which he feels is pertinent to his draft status.

The leaflet urged registrants to appear at

the draft board simply to examine their tiles or to

ask any of a numoes of questions regarding their draft

status or the Selective Service System itself.

The leaflet urged females to appear at the

draft board and demand to be allowed to register for

the draft denouncing the Selective Service System as

sexist and racist

or to flood the place with tears

asking that their boy friends, brothers, etc., be

exempted from the draft.

The leaflet also urged interested persons to

deluge the draft board with letters

requiring file

searches and return correspondence in an effort to

tle up the system.

It pointed out that females by

using their first initial and last name could request

Infornation from their non-existant files without •

being traced.

In addition, the leaflet urged persons to

tie up the draft board telephone lines

with many

miscellaneous telephone calls.

I have learned recently that SAM DAVIS and TOM

FORREST have been doing a lot of business together for

some time.

The name RONALD TIMOTHY DOMENICK Or DOMINIC iS

not familiar to me but the name "PAUL" and the description

you gave me sounds like an individual who hangs around

with IRREST and some of the other gun people.

I also have heard a rumor before that FORREST is

operating some kind of a shop on the Mexican boarder and

FORREST allegedly deals in a lot of 1llega stuff.

FORREST has had two large boats and lost both

of them.

There is a story around which I believe is

BY JERONE

Yesterday at 1:00 a.m.s

I contacted the

individual who sent the note in the mail as he hao

requested.

We made arrangements to meet together at

the Denny's Restaurant in El Cajon. I plan to have

SAM DAVIS Or GEORGE HOOVER or both there to watch

the meeting and make sure nothing funny happens.

The person I talked to on the telephone gave

me what he said was his Minuteman Serial Numoer.

subsequently checked this number with BETTIE HOUGHTON

who said the number is a good one and falls within a

block of numbers which she said she knows was legitimately

Issued. She said she has access to some files which

may include this number so that possibly she can find

out who the person is.

While I was making the call I had FRANK YACOPEC

watching the telephone booth up at Alpine.

FRANK pretended

to have a flat tire by stopping about a half a mile down

the soad from the telephone booth where he let some air

....out of one of his tires. He then drove his car to an air

pump at a service station near the telephone booth where

he was able to watch the person who received the call.

After the call was. over he followed this individual to

a side street named Marshall Road. When he got to the

road and looked the person had disappeared.

He said there

were only two cars on the road which looked like they

had been driven recently which had the following license

plate numbers:

WAB 703

• and

YCB 714

I also had a long talk with SAM DAVIS today and

obtained the following information:

He said that one PAUL HUNT at Santa Monica,

California, is the person who is actually in charge of

the Minutemen in the State of California or at least

in that area and he has been so in charge since the

disappearance of TROY HOUGHTON. He added that DENNIS

MOWER is only a public figurehead and added that he

thinks PAUL HUNT is a very dangerous man.

On the subject of TROY HOUGHTON,

I have learned

Irom both DAVIS and BILL CLAY that HOUGHTON's contacts

may have been much more widely spread than I thought.

Specifically, they told me that HOUGHTON was behind an

attempt several years ago by 18 "hunters" in the State

of New York to conduct sabotage and terrorist attacks

on New Left Groups.

These 18 individuals were supposedly

arrested and a large quantity of weapons and ammunition

was confiscated.

I also talked some more with DAVIS about TOM

FORREST and it appears that they know each other extremely

well.

DAVIS said he had some business dealings with

FORRESI Involving some machine guns and other items.

DAVIS apparently has decided not to get rid

of as much of his explosives and so forth as

said.

He has a small quantity of I.N.I. and he originally

also some

C4 Plastic explosives which he will sell at $10 a pound

which is too high a price.

He said he can also obtain a military weapon

which is like a bazooka and has a self-contained 3.5"

rocket round in an expendable launcher. He said the price

of this is $25.

"Those three men dropped out of the thing and so I figure they're okay

but you can bet that the fins is still in there pushing".

Ioso said that the whereabouts of people like Barry Godfrey

should be learned

and they should be telephoned and intimidated.

Eddy said he thinks such intimidations would be a waste of time and

that people like Godfrey should be killed. Mickey Wakefield of San

Marcos went along with iddy's suggestion. Ron Eddy also mentioned

having had an encounter with an FBI agent named Peterson in San Diego

but did not elaborate.

Eddy firmly believes that any man who commits himself to one

Here is one last bit of information. The New Christian Crusade

people are very concerned about the imprisonment of George Hoover of

the secret Army Organization. At one of their banquets the NCC had

four unoccupied places set at the table which were in honor of four

men whom they hold to be absent heroes. These four men were Joe licCart:

George Hoover, Charles Lindbergh and a man named

Ro Miles.

Anyway, it has been learned that a man whom Tom Metzger knows

1s going to take a dossier of the Hoover case to some congressman

In Washington, D.C. who is part of a committee currently scheduled

to investigate the FBI. The dossier consists of newspaper clippings

and other material pertaining to Hoover's activities in the SAO, his

arrest, conviction, appeal, etc. They are hoping to stir up a big

publicity stink to give the FBI a bad name due to Barry Godfrey's

setivities and in so doing hope to effect an eventual release of Hoover

from prison. By the way, the NCC people do not refer to Hoover by..

his correct name. For some reason they all call him Mickey Hoover.

That is about all for now. I hope this will be of some help

to you.

defended SAO members. Godfrey had the best of

both worlds - he could indulge in paramilitary fun

and games while pocketing government money.

Godirey assisted his sAU subordinates in

spreading

sympainizers and po ingrature emakin of listen

also committeu a series of capers that, in two cases,

nearly ended in tragedy.

With stuuents organizing protests against the

Vietnam War. young radical demonstrators figured

near the top of the SAD "enemies" list.

In one interview. Godirey allegedly claimed the

SAO accumulated vast tiles on local lettists.

sometimes by breaking into their homes. Godfrey

passed this intormation on. to the FBI.

In late 1971, Peter Bohmer — a former economics.

instructor at San Diego State and an active war

critic - began receiving death threats from the

SAD.

An SAO bulletin berating Bohmer listed his

address. phone number. and description, inviting

readers to "stop by and deal with the Red scum."

On another occasion. an anonymous caller left

Bohmer a message: *Wish-Pete a Merry Christmas.

This will be his last. This is the Secret Army

Organization.

Other death threats followed.

Finally, on Jan. 6. 1972.

two shots were fired

through Bohmer's window. His triend, Paula Tharp

was wounded in the elbow.

As a result, police began to investigate the SAO.

But the FBi wasn't read to blow Godfrey's cover.

Six months later. Goufrey admitted

he had

witnessed the shooting. He told a court he had driven

to

Bohmer's

house

in

Ocean

Beach

on

a

"surveillance"

mission. Another SAO member.

George

M. Hoover.

had fired two shots from

Godfrey's car and would have fired more if his gun

hadn't jammed, said the informant.

Godirey had then taken the tell-tale pistol and

Hoover's jacket to FBI azent Christiansen, who hid

the evidence in his home until the SAO was exposed

later that year.

The final straw that broke the SAO was the wildcat

bombing of the Guild Theater on June 19. 1972. No

one was injured in the blast. but Rubien Brandon. a

detective on the San Diero police force. and Thorpe

Nolan of the city attorney's office. were in the

audience apparently reviewing porno films for

possible obscenity violations.

After Brandon and Police Chief Ray Hoobler

pressured the FBI to reveal its informer's identity.

Godirey soon ascended the witness stand and nailed

Davis and other SAO members.

Hoover was charged with shooting into Bohmer's

house and Godirev's neichbor. William Francis

Yakopec, was cited as the Guild Theater bomber.

According to Godfrey. Yakopec had long toved

with the idea of blowing up corno theaters, adult

book stores and massage parlors.

The informer told how Yakopec met him at the

fence between their yards, sull flushed from his

bombing exploit of the previous night.

Godfrey testified Yakopec described " ... the

sound, the blast, how the dust hung over the air at

the theater ... how he stood down at the end of the

block and listened to the blast. He then described to

me how he placed the bomb, what type ot a bomb he

used, and now ne carried it down the alley and

planted it."

Frederick Hetter. Yaxopec's attorney, believed

his client might have had grounds for pleading

entrapment but the jury found Yakopec guilty

anyway.

Godfrey's friendship with

the unemployed

carpenter began in a gun shop. Soon after. Godfrey

• encouraged Yakopec to move next door to his El.

Cajon residence.

У акорес,

a former Minuteman sympathizer,

became Godfrey's lieutenant in the SAO. Together.

they discussed their mutual hate of pornography and

communism and explored their common loves -

guns and explosives.

It was Goufrey who sold Yakopec the explosives he

used to bomb the Guild Theater. Godtrey said he

reported the transaction ic the FBI.

But Godirey maintained he advised his lieutenant

he should bury them an' save them for after the

Communist takeover.

Deputy

Dist.

Atty. Richard

Huffman,

who

prosecuted the Yakopec case. said there may be

other SAO information in the FBI files. But he criti

ized the ACLU for wanting to "rummage ireeiy

through FBI records."

Conviction

Upheld In

The state Supreme Court

has upheld the conviction of

George Mitcheil Hoover, 37,

a key figure in a series of

trials here in 1972 involving

alleged members of the

right-wing paramilitary Se

cret Army Organization.

The Supreme Court ruling,

was announced by the

office of Dist. Atty. Edwin L

Miller, follows an Oct. 30,

1913, decision by the Fourth

District Court of Appeal.

reversing the conviction of

Hoover. The attorney gener-

al's office took the case to

the Supreme Court.

Hoover, formerly of:

Santee, was sentenced to

five years to life in state

prison in January. 1973, fol-

lowing his conviction in Su-

perior Court on charges of

•assault. with

a deadly.

pied dwelling and possession

of a billy club. "

Hoqver appealed the con-

viction through appellate

Defenders, Inc., questioning

the credibility of a key pro-

secution witness. The wit-

ness was Howard Barry Go-

direy, a former San Diego

fireman who was a paid FBI

informant assigned to infil-

trate extremist groups..

Hoover contended the Su-

serior Court fury should

It has been learned that Jack I. Du long attended

a meeting of the Greater Los Angeles Area Citizens

councils held on this date in the Sparton Room of

the Olympian motor Hotcl at 1903 West Olyapic BlUd.

in Los Angeles California. The meeting was set for

8pm and did start within a few minutes of 8pm. A

total of 19 or 20 people were on hand for the meeting.

Roderic Duff conducted the meeting. He is the GIAACC

leader. He announced that this was the first GInACU

meeting in a year and a hall. He indicated that GIdeo

had interested itself with local issues during this

time. He outlined work in monrovia involying the schools

and a local election. Duis stated he planned an

important meeting in two months, in late January 1913.

He did not state why there would be another meeting

so soon alter this gathering. It would be unusual

view of the fact that this meeting was the first

in eighteen months. Duff discussed the "blood program"

that was mentioned in their mail out report of last

week in which GLAAUC members would donate blood to

other GIACU members only when needed and then direct

from dosy to donor. in brief the plan is to prevent

a GINAui' member trow receiving blood from a black. It

appears ine neeting was called only to hear two speakers.

Report by DON CLARK

Meeting of Colonel WILLIAM GALE at

O'Neira Hall on the Evening of

March 28, 1974, San Diego, California

4/5/34

Approximately 75 persons were present at that

meeting. It included, among others, GEORGE UDVARY,

VICTOR B. WALTON, MICKEY WAKEFIELD,

AND SIRSON,

BULEN ADANS, BILL MILLERI

JONATHAN WESI, "JOE BRINKER,

HARRIET BRINKER, JANỆT BRINKER, Colonel WILLIAM GALE, ANN

NUTTER, and others who

and others who are very old and very indetive.

There were

number of individuals present who

are as yet

unknown to

me.

GEORGE UDVARY does not seem

i to have made his

move yet-permanent

movelo

of the area. He's still in

process, I believe

best I

can tell at this time. MICKEY

WAKEFIELD,

came down

from Escondido, was hoping to run

into someof his para-military friends, one or two of whom

did notjevidently arrive. He did runvinto VICTOR WALION

who he is close to. BILL MILLER was there and very involved--

on the surface at least. ELLEN ADAMS was distributing

literature. JOE and HARRIET BRINKER came in from Escondido

and of course are primarily responsible for putting on that

manthly meeting and so they were working with that.

There was security that night--more so than

would ordinarily be expected. A fellow by the name of

DENNIs was inside wiüh a 23-channet, ive

watt. Gitizens Band

walkie-talkie, Realistic brand

sola by Radio Shack.

Kept monitoring anothe individual whose

name I do not have

wno was outside.

He had a two of three channel Citizens

Baid walkie-talkie, Midland band, land they were checkins

to see lI anyone wouda give them any trouble.

This was

because of a publication that indicated where their meeting

would be held. They didn't indicate what they would do if

such trouble arrived...

Colonel GALE discussed an article on himself and

the identity movement as wiitten up in Volume V, Issue 14,

of a bi-monthly publication, called the San Diego Door.

I believe that's a March, 1974 issue. Colonel GALE read

directly from the article and made comments and corrections

as he went.

- He said, now I will read--follow this and read as

much

article:

as possible that seems relevat exe frontie

"But the public meetings are only part of the

paclasses

Whenever GAlE speaks, he recalts follivers anto

para-military part

Yot his organization

That part is

called defitity" and has so fax.

incorporated many old

Minutemen and secret army elements in Southern California."

To that, Colonel GALE indicated that "Identity"!

was-the name of his church publication--he thought it was

## Page 772

numorous that they thoushtit

aspsomething-else.

em is used to describe their philosophy.

Telegramil Gary part be beir operation is under

such titles as the

"Christian Posse'

Association

I will make another quote here from the publication:

"JERRY LYNN DAVIS, the ex-head of the SÀO in California,

has been reported at GALE's public meetings." According

LO MICKEY WAKEFIELD O BEATRE MORE LO TO GUERRET

meeting

DAVIS had not, as far as he knew, ever been to a

San Diego meeting.

Another quote Colonel GALE made: "Identity is

organized in similar fashion to other underground organizations-

• small cells conmunicate through a series of intermediaries

and blind post office boxes.'"

Colonel GALE did

not comment

further: hovere'

the mailing network for the rational tape

groups

the Christian Posse Association groups, and the -

amateur radio network

are the primary communication links

of GALER

group.

/ Another quote Colonel CAll made from thé article:

"In San Diego, GALE can be heard speaking to his congregation

on the fourth Thursday of every month at the O'Neira Club

on Holly Street" or something of that nature "between 34th

and 35th Streets, one block south of Adams Ayenue." The

street was incorrectly quoted--it's Hawley, and Colonel

GALE made an observation on that, indicating he thought

the information was transferred to the person at this publication

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523

Page

772

---

## Page 773

telephone and that he figured, he had that all figured

out that way because the person must have misunderstood

the name

and got it wrong.

The next quote from the publication:

According

to one law enforcement source, Identity has fabout 50 members

in the San Diego area, including members of the

San Diego

Sheriff's Department and reserve police ofe

Cotonel

GALE indicated support from

and

he has an assistant pastor

In Glendaie who has an important

position

the los Angeles County Sheriff's Office, and,

that!

claims suppost from

number of law enforcement

areas•

Another quote he

indicated:

"As for GALE, he

pretends to be a minister

Of his church and operates through

It as his front. CALl was one of the driving forces behind

the militant Christian Defense! League (CDL) in the 60's.

He had formed the small California Rangers in the late 50's.

The California State Attorney General's Office described

the Rangers as,

," then they put a quöte in here, in this article,

•: 'A secret underground guerrilla force, linked with other

non-military organizations by a common

ideology and leader-

ship.'

Colonel GALE indicated at this meeting the Rangers!

were

registered with the state and had support of Californial

law enforcement.

Another quote from the article that the Colonel

EW 55000_ DocId: 32989523 Page 773

---

## Page 774

made

"GALE's strategy to recruit members through veterans

organizations was thwarted in 1963 when the Long Beach Press

Telegram exposed his efforts to convert the American Legion

Post in Signal Hill into a Ranger front. It was after this

that one of the Rangers was arrested for, sellins

colonel GAlEk

indicated that

Monk wch this particular veterans group, that.

he transcend from the hollywond post.,

Also, he said

that

the Ranger's, that particular Ranger's

arrest was tan

entrapment and an unfortunate erroryon that Ranger's part.

Another quote he

"The CDL was quite an

organization

when GALE was

a part of it. It grew to

include the Klan, the National States' Rights Party, and

many other Right Wing groups." Colonel GALE admitted

connection with the Christian Defense League, indicating

that he was very active.

Another quote: GALE has ample experience to

found a para-military organization. In addition to more

than 20 years involvement in right wing circles, GALE is

a retired Lleutenant Colonel, U. So Aruy. He selved with

the NAC ARTHUR command after World War. II in the counter-

insurgency staff," and it goes on. But Colonel GALE corrected

this counter-insurgency information. He indicated that he

was on the staff of MAC ARTHUR in Japan, but previous to.

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523• Page 774

---

## Page 775

that was when he was involved in counter-insurgency and

that was with the guerrilla activities in the Philippines,.

which was also indicated in this article.

Then, another interesting thing, he quoted: "The

SAO was in large part organized by HOWARD B. GODFREY, an

FBI Agent." He didn't have anything notable to say about

GODFREY.

Actually, one of the things he indicated, toor

in this discussion of his was that there is a lot of diffi-

culty getting different right wing groups to cooperate in

a military fashion and that that is very necessary a

and I

get the impression that he israttempting:

hand wishes to whip

these groups into line in areally elffcient military namen

that will be very ete live and efficient. That

is the pri-

maryl

Problem. He also indicated his willingness to cooperate

Law enforcement,

of course onthis terms no doubt;

and he said he was

ready

and

they were ready to face those

Jews and their articles and their so-called exposes and

whateve

else they might happen to want to do; that they

are ready to communicate with their people and take care of

anyone who gives them any trouble. Helindicated that he

had communication links all over--that from his car he

could talk immediately with his link in Saugus--I don't

know what link he was referring to, but it wastin Saugus,

and in Glendale and other areas like that, which he mentioned,

NW 55000 DocId: 32989523 Page 775

---

## Page 776

That covers much of his comments at that particu

lar meeting. There was quite a lot of response--the people

enjoyed that immensely. It was a reaction similar to

grandstanding and I think he was

milking

for all he

could get.

is very quiet and doesn't have much to say".

Walton is very anxious to have Ron Eddy of Poway read Nature's

Etercal Religion. Walton is really making a determined effort to push

this book. Its author, Ben Klassen; seems to think Hitler was the best

thing that ever happened to the world and concludes his book by saying

that ultimately the white race will have to occupy all the usable lana

on Earth. That kind of tells you something without really saying it.

Walton says that Barry Godfrey once told him that his (walton's) telepho

was bugged.

That's it for now.

Vic Walton says that Barry Godfrey once gave him two cans of illegal

Ron Eddy of Poway states he has all of the coming week off and that

desires to accompany Wakefield and Knight to their scheduled trial

is disturbing the peace on Wednesday, November 21, 1973. Eddy also

reiterated his hope that bail on George Hoover will be lowered suffic-

jently to get him out. Eddy said he would be willing to borrow money

from his credit union and put up the equity in his house as collateral

to get Hoover out of jail. Eddy says that the only way to prevent people

from serving as informants for the FBI is to make examples of some of

them. Eddy believes that Hoover would murder Barry Godfrey if he could

find him and I think he is hoping something like that will happen.

When it becomes necessary for Godfrey to return to San Diego, I cannot

over-emphasize the importance of maintaining heavy security for him.

It he thought he had half a chance of getting away with it, I believe

Eddy himself would murder Godfrey just to "make an example".

That is about all that is known to have happened in the past couple

of days. I hope it is of use to you.

The man

convicted of wounding.

•former door staifer Paula Tharu while

shouting into former economics

professor Peter Pohmer's house, has

had his conviction leversed by the

Fourth District Colirt sí Appeais.

George Mitchell Hoover, Secret Army

Organization (SiO) member, was

• seritenced last February to trom five

years io life. His conviction was aimost

:. entirely due to the testimony of Howard

Barry Godfrey, former SAO leader who

• later surfaced as an FBI informer. God-

frey was the driver of the car used in the

shooting of Bohmer ard Tharp's Ocean

Beach home.

The Appeals Court ruled that Judge

Willian Low's jecision not to let the

jury determine Godfrey's credibility (as

both informer and accomplice) was in

error. In addition, the couri suggested

that Codirey's role in the shooting

should haie been grounds for prosecu-

tion. The fac that Godfrey was not

• charged ot the tinie left few peopie who

weren't at least a bit suspicious.

So George Hoover now goes back to

Superior Cour!, ivhere a jury vill decide

whether Godfrey's restimony was credi-

ble. And if they find it's not, a new trial,

mighi be ordered. ill this would meant

that Howard Barry Godfrey, who has;

hard times....

Has the news media blackout in San Diego got you down? Well, it's got u!

down tos. Last issue the DOOR ran a story about the activities of CREEP spy

Donald segretti in San Diego. The srory was important enough for the New

York Times (see below) to pick it up. In addition, it has been reprinted in the

Washington Post and a number of other places.

All week the DOOR has been

getting phone calls from around the

country about our story. It has all been very rewarding. — but also very

frustrating. Here we are sitting on a major news story and with the exception

of KGB — no San Diego news outlet has picked it up, or even caller us to

check the story out!!!

The DOOR will continue its investigation into San Diego's Watergate

connections. And we will print whatever we find out! We hope that the

other news media in San Diego will get off their asses and do some work.

We will be glad to take them under our wing and give them a lead or two. Im

any event, you can read all about it right here in the DOOR.

We are reprinting the article from the New York Times so our readers can!!

enjoy it along with us and so the sceptics can see that somebody takes us

seriously.

According to Davis, Godfrey hoped

do provotica rior and opssibly a counter-

riot by the pole. The purpose of such a

siot is unclearerror that it clearly

would have helped Nixon.

The DOOK in: essention has learned

that there was a condonirried effort by

CRLEP, the FBI, aridd oiner governmen-

tal agencies to more sure that riots

would disrupt thr Republican FIASCO.

It appears that these plans were drawn

up when it appeared that Senator id

Muskie a serious threat, Nixon clearly

would have

blamed

any violence on

Muskie supporters. When it became

apparent that MeGovern

had the

nomination locked un and that the ITT

scandal had forced the convention 10

move to Miami, the rior plans were

clearly toned down. It is our theory thai

Nixon and his stait felt that they could

Jeasily beat McGovern.

• Davis told us that he felt pretty much .

the same way and, in fact, was quick to

point out the provocateur role.Godfrey:

played. "Godfrey possessed explosives

for over 2 years," Davis said. Of cour

Godfrey was nover prosecured tor

inwthing. The DOOR has learned thai

Godliroy is now writing a book shout his

experiences.

We are continuing our investigation

into Watergate and the San Diego con-

nections. li anyone has anv iniormation

that might help us, give us a call. We will

protect the identity of our sources.

DATE: 1/13/72

On 1/12/72 Informant was contacted by writer at

which time he furnished the following information.

Recently the Secret Army Organization prepared and •

distributed a special bulletin regarding PETER GEORGE BOHMER.

Response from Right Wing sympathizers to this bulletin has

been very encouraging and consequently, on 1/5/72, source was

given an assignment by JERRY LYNIT DAVIS, leader of the SaO,

to conduct a surveillance of the residance of BOHMER at 5155

Vuir, Ocean Beach, for the purpose of obtaining additional

"Intelligence information, such as license plate numbers and

descriptions of occusants. W

this information was

to be used in the preparation of a future

Intelligence bulletin of the SAO.

In order to avoid going on this assignment alone,

source contacted GEORCE M. HOOVER, an associate of members of

the SAO, and requested that he accompany source:

the police.

Source has explained

that he was reluctant to discuss this matter in its entirety.

in previous telephonic centeots tith writer tient

- wife was present at the time

and he dia not wish to upset her unnecessarily. He statea

that the

incident had come as a complete surprise to him,

and that he had ho intention or desire to take any action

at BOHER's residence other than to obtain whatever information

was

available in as discreet a manner as possible.

He said

he is estremely upset and dismayed at the turn or events

and would like to end his association with these individuals,

but, as before, could see no practical way of doing so at this

time.

It is noted that Informant has been repeatealy

cautioned on previous occasions to avoid becoming directly

involved an any activities which might result in personal

injury or death for any individual.

Saurce has wholeheartedly

agreed with this and has consistently furnished all information

• in his possession regarding the possibility of such incidents

occuring.

Writer believes

that source was totally unaware

that hoover might shoot into the house before the incident

nappened.

mad: jource has been advised to avoid all

future contact with -JoVER, as much as possible, and has

agreed that this would appear

to be the best course of action.

Ee advised that to tie best of his knowlege, only he and

HOOVER are presently aware of the incident. He said it is

his understanding the gun involved has been permanently dis-

posed of.

source pointed out that the incident appears to

have caased HOOVER to become quite "fires up"

and to be ready

for a violent confrontation with the police if he should be

approached on the mitter. Source said he doubts HOOVER will

discuss the matter with

anyone else but cannot be sure of

this.

He said tha DOVER has never been interviewed before

by law enforcerent and would advised against such an inter-

SAC ROBERT W. EVANS (170-411)

SUBJECT: EXTREMIST INFORMANTS

EXTREMIST MATTERS

A recent article appearing in the Black Panther

Party (BPP) Cleaver Faction publication "Right On!" calls

for swift and unmerciful retaliation against current and

former extremist informants.

This article contains numerous

inflammatory statements and may well signal the initiation

of widespread retaliation against our informants.

Recently seized items from the Republic of New

Africa (RNA) included instructions to RNA members concerning

the indoctrination of those members suspected of being law

enforcement informants.

These instructions basically involve

the completion of a personal questionnaire form and background

investigation.

Each agent should recognize the continuing possibility

of infiltrators within our extremist informant ranks.

There

have been attempts in the past to penetrate informant ranks,

and we can logically expect there will be attempts in

the

future in this regard.

Therefore, all agents are reminded of

the importance of in-depth background investigation and personal

knowledge of each informant, as well as the necessity for

careful verification and evaluation of information furnished

by extremist informants.

Each agent handling an extremist informant,

including extremist ghetto informants, should be thoroughly

alert to the absolute necessity for handling these informants

under the most secure conditions in order to eliminate the

possibility of these informants being exposed. . All agents

should also bring to the attention of their informants the

Republic of New Africa's methods of disclosing infiltrators

in order that our informants will be. forewarned.

Dear Mr. Evans:

Thank you for your letter of July ¿6, 1971.

I advised all parties to our conference on July 23,

1971, that the Attorney General has beer given statutor sony

authority by Congress to provide witness protection

facilities if necessary.

The Attorney (eneral's statutory

authority in this matter is the Organized Crime Control Act

of 1970-

However, before any implementation of this act

takes place, the United States Attorney's Office must con-

sult with the

Criminal Division of the Department of Justice.

Should it become necessary that your informant testi-

fies in the ATFD case, the matter of this informant's safety

will be brought to the attention of the Department of Jus-

tice.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesi-

tate to contact me.

very truly yours,

has continued to give the matter of relocation considerable

thought.

He pointed that his parents have, for some time,

been

trying to convince him of

the desriability of moving

Hawali. He explained that his parents have resided and visited

In that state several times and are contemplating moving there

permanently in the near future for health and business. reasons.

He stated that he still feels that ratwithstanding

the foregoing, relocation at Boise, Idaho, woula be more

advantageous for him. He advised he woula appreciate assistance

from the Bureau in finding employment there.

Source further advised that on 7/27/,71 the points

• required for selling a house with an FHA loan on it rose from

2 to 8. He said that his original estimate of the amount re-

quired for his move would, accordingly, be a little low.

anna De sen Diego airtel to. the pureau date 7/28/71-

0n 7/28/71, Mir. and Mrs. CHARLES GODFREY, the

parents of SD 1155 telephonically advised that they had

discussed with their son their son's possible relocatior

to Boise, Idaho.

The parents stated that they were not satisfied

with the possibility of their son's relocation to Boise and

felt that in addition to the relocation, the FBI should secure

a job for SD I155R in Boise comparable

to the $12,000 a year

• Hawaii for health reasons in the near future and suggested

the possibility of relocating SD 1155-R to that state inas-

much

as they feel there is an abundance of U. S. Government

jobs in Honolulu, one of which the FBI could get for their

son without too much difficulty.

During this conversation, Mr. GODFRey mentioned

that he has many

"friends" in Washington whom he would be

glad to contact if it was felt it would help the FBI to help

his son. The inference of this remark was interpreted as

being that. If the FBI did not help Sy 1155-R, ME. GODFREY

might seek the assistance of his

"friends" in Washington.

It was pointed out to the parents that as of 7/26/71,

their son indicated that all he desired was relocation to

Boise, but that their feelings in this matter would be made

a matter of record.

No assurance of any sort was made to the parents

, and was to be aistributea on a

completely anonymous basis. About two days after publication

of the bulletin and before distribution had taken place, CLAY

contacted HAYWARD and others and indicated the paper should not

be distributed, although it was noted that one copy had already

been distributed to the front door of the Good Morning Teaspoon.

Informant subsequently determined that CLAY's reason for

removal of these bulletins was hat one of the names indicated

on the list was known only to CLAy and publication of this man's

name and background would have positively identified CLAY as the

source of information relative to this individual's activities.

Informant, on 12/6/68, indicated he had attended a

meeting of the lakeside Conservative Council held at the Weslian.

Church, Lakeside, on River Street, attended by approximate 26

Individuals.

was made available by the Patriotic Society. Informant icentified

some of those present as WALT HAYWARD, BILI CLAY, STAN MC DADE,

in the Patriotic Society, and described him as a white male,

approximately 45 to 50 years of age, 5' 9"

, 225 pounds, dark

hair, wears a goatee and mustache.

Informant furnished the address of WALTER HAYWARD aS

He indicated that at a

meeting on 12/6/68, HAYWARD, CLAY and

others present, discussed ways and means of agitating the Peace

and Freedom Party and the Black Panther Party to get them to

fight among themselves.

Informant said that the latest publication

of the Patriotic Party

- had been a survival bulletin which contained

direct quotations from

Staff Publication.

Informant said that since the gun control law has become

so common that numerous Individuals have been attempting to obtain

and hide as many weapons and as much ammunition as possible.

Informant said he had recently determined that JERRY GIVER in

addition to possessing many other weapons, has a .50 caliber Colt

machine gun, an anti-tank rifle, a line-throwing gun, and an

M-14 rifle.

meeting had taken place the previous Friday evening and

on

notIfying WALT HAYWARD of thi, HAYWARD made several telephone

calls, attempting to agitate the Black Panthers and to create

friction between the Panthers and the Peace and Freedom Party.

Informant said LYLE MANNING recently advised that an

Individual by the name of MARCUS from Phoenix, Arizona, has been

in San Diego, and is interested in selling weapons.

Informant

indicated it appears that MARCUS 1s well known as a weapons

distributor and has been known to sell weapons to the Israeli

Government. He indicated MARCUS had a recoilless rifle 106

millimeter, which he was asking $3000 for.

Informant said he

learned thai MARCUS was willing to stash a large number of weapons

in a cache in the San Diego area, If right wingers in this area

could prove to him that there were a sufficient number of

dangerous left wingers to create a need for such a weapons supply.

MANNING and FRANK YODUS, the local area representative for

Liberty Arms, co-owners of the Hanging Tree Swap Shoo, continue

In business.

Informant said he does not know the extent of their

success in this new business as yet.

MARCUS was further described

as a wholesale meat packer and an owner of at least one

department store in the Phoenix, Arizona area.

Informant said MIKE VEJVODA has someone who is assisting

him financially in printing numerous handbills which bills are

being passed out in left wing neighborhoods in an attemot to

agitate and create disturbances. VIJVODA is apparently very

interested in making an example

of some left winger and has

indicated he plans to burn someone's house down or possibly take

some individual out into the desert to kill them to make an

example out of them.

Informant said he advised BILL CLAY of this

Information and CLAY told VEIVODA that 1f he should do such a

thing, his life would be taken himself. Informant advised that

BETTIE HAUGHTON is completely inactive in Minutemen activities

at this time and no information has been received regarding the

by Minutemen.

They also discussed the possibility of obtaining

publicity for Minutemen Front Groups in an effort to build up

the morale of Minutemen. The group discussed the organization

of a phantom militia to be established as a front for the

Mnutemen and it was indicated that such names as "The fox"

"Secret American Militia"

" Blue Ox Society"

, and "Swamp.

Fox" were considered as names for this phanton militia.

Informant said the purpose for this phantom militia would be

to write letters and conduct other business in an anonymous

fashion to harass various individuals and organizations

without the identity of the Minutemen being disclosed.

Informant said that when CLAY learned he had received a

bulletin in the mail he (CLAY) told informant not to discuss

the details of the bulletin with anyone. Informant identi-

a white male, age approximately 35

years, height 6' 3", weight 260 pounds, has full beard

approximately li inches in lengh, dark

hair, and usually

wears a cowboy hat. He has served with U. S. Rangers in

Korea and his wife is believed to be a German citizen.

Informant discussed the possibility of an

•individual identified as lIkE O'HAVER, age about 30, a taxi-

dermist located on Fletcher Parkway, as a possible

source

of having material printed such as

the Minutemen Bulletin.

Informant said he is aware that O'HAVER has access to a

printing press and believes that he operates the printing

press for the Patriotic Society in San Diego. Printing

equipment includes offset and linotyye machines:

On November s, 1965, Informant advised BETTY

HOUGHTON is attempting

to sell two printing presses which

she has in her possession at an unknown location. Informant

had a partial nervous breakdown. SETTY has a house guest,

FRED HAVES, San Diego 100-14293, who is believed presently

separated from his wife who resides in Washington state.

Informant said he believes HAWES is paying rent to BETTY

HOUGHITON.

Informant said Peace and Freedom Party Headquarters

has

made space available to individuals who are organizing.

themselves under the name of "Friends of the Panthers"

He was unable to furnish names of any specific individuals

involved in this activity but indicated that the group

will possibly use Peace and Freedom Party Headquarters for

their activities.

On November I2, 1968, informant advised that recent

discussion with BiLL CLAY indicated a push toward the

phantom militia considering publication of black power

propaganda

to stir up local white groups. He said the

militia will come out with extreme suggestions directed

against such people as the John Birch Society and others

in an effort to cause right wingers to become indignant

against black organizations.

Informant said that the San Diego Mining Association

holds periodic meetings at Balboa Park.

PAUL RUPLINGER

has been invited to speak at the next meeting on November

18, 1968 by WALT HAYWARD, President of the Mining Association.

Informant said the Peace and Freedom Party is

making plans to establish a GI Coffee House in San Diego

to be used as a front for draft resisters groups and to

push anti-war propaganda. He advised that War Resisters

League was to meet on November 14, 1968 in front of the

federal Building for a demonstration. (Local authorities

notified).

Informant said the local Peace and Freedom Party

Message Center had recently been advertising for help and

he believed that MIKE VEJVODA was going to volunteer for

work to learn the activities of the group. He furnished

VEJVODA's telephone number as 149-0136 presently believed

to reside in Lakeside or El Cajon. Informant said that he

has recently met a DAVE STAFFORD connected with B. C.

35 to 10 years, height 5' 10", weight 210 pounds, resides

with wife and

several children on Darnell Street, near

Home Avenue and Highway 94.

On November 21, 1968, informant advised he had

been contacted at his residence

by JERRY LYNN DAVIS, also

known as SAM DAVIS,

the ammunition and explosives identified above are obtained

by DAVIS through some contact with military sources.

On November 22, 1968, informant advised that

he had been recontacted by SAN DAVIS and had placed an order

a by 1363

for some one pound and one third pound charges of TNT. He

said DAVIS told him that the one pound charges are shaped

in such a way that they are capable of cutting a hole through

one inch of solid steel. Informant said he also attempted

ammunition offered by DaVIS, however,

DAVIS advised that he had already disposed of most of it

and would have to wait till he obtained more. Informant

will furnish the material purchased by him in an effort to

determine origin of these materials ard to determine if they

are government property.

Informant said he has been invited to attend a

meeting of the B. C. Adventure Corporation this coming

Sunday night, November 24,

1968, at 7:30 P.M. at the home Dr.

of six months effective December 1, 1968.

in penetrating the Minutemin organization in the San Diego,

California,

In this capacity, informant has performed

an outstanding

service to the government and to the nation

in acquiring and making available a large volume of infor

mation regarding the

activities of the Minutenan organization

and related groups.

In addition, due to the nature of his

employment, infcrmant has been successfully targeted

against othes unrelated activities and has

proviced coverage

ona penetration of a number of New Left oriented groups and

demonstrations. The scope of information provided by the

source has often extended beyond the immediate San Diego

area to other parts of the nation. He also has been

instrumental in identitying and tollowing the activities of

many individuals who are of interest to the Federal Bureau

of Investigation. Informant has at all times been found

to be stable, trustworthy and reliable.

The Minutenen is a pacamilitant group

organized in June, 1960, by ROBERT B. DE

PUGH in Norborne, Missouri, as a resistance

to the spread of communism in the United

States by use of guerrilla tactics.

contact was made with a third party, EUGENE BRIA, a reporter

for the "¿naheim Bulletin" and an associate of menbers of the

Minutemon ocganization in the Los Angeles, California, area,

if not a member hinself.

During the show,

several arrests were made, some by

the incchol, Tobacco and firearms Division (ZITD) •

Because

of these arrests and long held attitudes on the part of

DAVIS and BROWN that, although Communism and Socialism pose

threats to their security, the government of this country is

their real enemy, a decision was reached by BrOWN and D.VIS

that retaliation

should be made against the government by

pomoing IrD and the Internal Revenue SELViCE (IRS) offices.

Plans were made tor the three to meet again the following

Sacurday evening at a motel in or near the City dE El Cajon,

California, the exact time and place not then specified.

At

this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing and

specific targets selected, one in the Los Angeles, California,

area which BROWy would handle, and one at san Diego, california,

which DAVIS would handle.

In apparent furtherance of this scheme, DAVIS

delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal

ammunition cans for storage and safekeeping. These cans

wEre

found to contain several pounds of INT explosives, 18 hand

grenade fuse assemblies, two rifle grenades, approximately

275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand

on July 20, 1971, subject DAVIS requested that the

hand illuminating grenade included in the explosives given by

him to the informant, be returned to him on the weekend of

but not elaborating further on the matter.

On July 23, 1971, following consultation with

issistant

Ettorney ROBERT

P. RISSO, newly appointed Chief of the

Criminal Complaint Section, and with representatives of the San

Diego ATFD office,

authorization was granted by RISSC and by

ATED for the hand illuminating grenade to be returned to DAVIS

through the informant. This was only to be done on the condition

that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

•àt this same time, RISSO stated he saw no possible

way to obtain successful pirsecution of DAVIS in this matter.

Furthermose, he acvised that he would in no way authorize

return of the remaining items of explosives to DaVIS.

On July 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out

that DiVIS' request that the hand illuminating grenade be

returned to him points up the fact that his request for other

parts or all of the items entrusted by him to the informant

is imminent.

Because of his asscciation with D. VIS, whom

the informant believes to be bordering on being mentally

irrational, informant is convinced that for whatever reason,

when it becomes necessary fns him in tell DaVIS he cannot return

these materials i. him it vill become obvious to DaVIS that the

informant is exactly that of has in some other way betrayed him.

and that DiVIS will then take reprisal of a violent nature

against the inforrant and his family.

Inasmuch as the explosives cannot be returned, the

informant has petitioned that he and his farily be rclocated

in some other part of the country out of DiVIS' reach. To

this end, informant is willing in leave his home and an

excellent employment but does not ask for another job.

Informant has stated a personal preference ic. relocation

at Boise, Idaho, which he feels would be a safe location

as it is not a place to which he would be expected to go.

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

San Diego, California

August 2, 1971

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our

communication dated July 27, 1971:

On July 26s

1971, the informant who has furnished

the previous information in this case, was approached on

the subject of relieving him of custody of certain explosive

materials previously furnished to him by subject DAVIS, by

the use of a search warrant for the explosives at his home.

The search warrant, it was felt, would serve the purpose of

explaining to DAVIS why this informant could not produce. the

explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant

declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to

problem.

informant is convinced that regardless of

the reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has

possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger will cause him to

become irrational to the point that he would comnit some act

or acts of violence against the informant or his family.

Informant continued to be of the opinion that due to the fact

the explosives could

I not be made available for return to DAVIS,

the only safe course of action for him and his family would

be relocation in an

area where the informant and his family

would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the informant's parents tele-

phonically contacted the San Diego Division of the FBI.

advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,

they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himself

and his family was completely justified. The parents advised

that they contemplated

moving to the state of Hawaii in the

near

future for reasons of health.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

In addition, the parents indicated they were not

satisfied solely with the possibility of the informant's

relocation to Boise, Idaho, and felt that in addition to

relocation, the rederal Bureau of Investigation

should secure

3 job for the Informant

at the place of relocation comparable

to the $12,000 a year job he presently holds at San Diego!

The parents advised they had

suggested to informant the

possibility of his relocation in Hawail, as they felt there

should be an abundance of employment opportunities with the

U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation should

be able to get one for their son without

too much diificulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father

advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and

that if it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining

authorization for relocation and the securing of employment

for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people

for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was

recontacted at

which time he stated

he had continued to give the matter of

relocation considerable thought.

He pointed out that his

for some time, been trying to convince him of

the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained

that his parents have resided and visited in that state several

times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the

near future for health and business reasons.

Informant

advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at

Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He stated

he would appreciate assistance from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that the home in which

he lives at San Diego is being purchased through

a federal

Housing Administration (FHA) loan and has a current market

value of approximately $20,000.

of relocating him to another place, the points required

He said that subsequent to

He said that this meant that while originally it would have

cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now faced

with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same

thing.

The

informant

feels that it will now cost him approximately

$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate

at Boise, Idaho.

EXTREMIST INFORMANT

TONY

This is to advise of information developed by captioned

of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization.

By menorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the

formation and accivities of the newly formed ultraconservative

white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza-.

tion (SAO) • SAO has targeted for harassment San Diego State

College Professor Peter Bohmer. Bohmer's residence is a well-known

New Left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer,

are planning

demonstrations at the Republican National Convention scheduled at

| San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated

since August, 1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the

extremist-oriented

SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was

requested by SAO leader to surveil. Bohmer's residence in order

obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on/

surveillance was SAO associate George M. Hoover. 'The surveillance?

held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after.

*the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied.

However, prior to

discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While

passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house.

The informant strongly protested

and

they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow.

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which

would not have been available through any other source, and

cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready

for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this

I matter. Identities of those involved in shooting not known to

San Diego police; however, witnesses did furnish description of

informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished

exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been

completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all

extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in

violent confrontations or activities.

He is the only Bureau

that pertinent information developed by informant will be

furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's

Godfrey wants to lay out the nation network of communication

He plans to recount as much detail as possible of his years

as a member of these extremist groups, explaining the recruiting,

training, assignment and some actual operations accomplished by

them.*

It would be of great assistance to us if you would authorize

me to interview Agent Peterson in San Diego. This would not constitute

an endorsement of our Book, but would help me to understand more

Brownfield to Jenkins Memo

RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

of the San Diego Office August 10, 1967, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and Telegraph

Company, San Diego, California.

A gun hobbyist, Army trained

in the use of explosives, he became associated with the top

echelon of the Minutemen

as well as the Secret Army Organization

(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

these and other extremists groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the

San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant.

Godfrey

had testified in San Diego County Superior Court in the trial

of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted

murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was

found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.

At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against

Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession

of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and

had been Godfrey's contacting Agent.

As a result of Godfrey's

appearances as a prosecutio

witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the

news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

Regarding Miller:

Our files

show that by letter dated November 30,

1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed

by juvenile females:

He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports

Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,

1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution,

including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries

and the Japanese.

Miller stated that some American servicemen

were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being

used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this

information while doing research in Japan.

He requested

information as to whethes the FBI knew of the "situation."

By airtel

August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office

was advised of Miller's August llth letter and was instructed

to interview him.

The Los Angeles Office further was instructed

to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained

in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of

the respective military services over their personnel.

forwarded to the Legal Attache, Tokyo.

Miller also furnished similar information directly

to the Japanese National Police Agency

'(NPA) , in August, 1972.

The NPA in October, 1972, advised. the Legal

Attache, tokyo,

that NPA's inquiry failed to substantiate Miller's allegations.

(62-115275)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

On March 6, 1973, ASAC Clark E. Brown, San Diego

Office, was telephonically advised of Miller's request to

interview SA Petersen in connection with the projected book.

ASAC Brown was advised that interview of SA Petersen would not

be authorized in view of regulations regarding revealing

information in Bureau files.

This matter has been coordinated with the Intelligence

Division and James I. Williamson of the Office of Legal Counsel.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached reply be sent to Miller.

thousand

that the

"Minutemen

planned to create trouble among

the

"hippies" so that as a result of this, the

"hippies"

would try to take over the town of Ramona, California.

Informant reported that the idea behind the

"Minutemen" participating in the activity was so the

people or ramona would. become alert to the fact chat

"It can happen in their town"

Informant advised that the "Minutemen"

planned to spread sugar cubes throughout the town

of Ramona to give the impression that thecubes con-

tained LSD. They intended to change highway signs

and road markers to create confusion and to direct

arriving "hippies" to local Indian Reservations thus

creating the possibility of clashes between local

Indians and the

"hippie groups "

Informant said the

"Minutemen" planned to collect bags of dog waste

material and distribute this throughout the city of

Ramona so that the

"hippies" would be blamed for this

act.

All information furnished by informant was fur-

nished to local law enforcement agencies.

On the first

day of the scheduled

"Iove in" the San Diego County

Sheriff's Office and California Highway Patrol es-

tablished a command post in the vicinity of Ramona

Oaks Ranch, Ramona, California following which ten

arrests were made of adults and juveniles for poss-

ession of marijuana and ISD. A road block was set

up in the vicinity by the California Highway Patrol

to check on the safety of vehicles traveling in the

vicinity. It was reported that this apparently dis-

a number of individuals from attending the

"Zove in" at Ramona Oaks Ranch as the attendance did

not exceed more than 300 or 400 participants.

The

informant reported following this activity that the

members of the "Minutemen"

group who attempted to cause

trouble in the area were dissuaded because of the law

enforcement officers being present in the community.

Also Known 'S Sam Davis;

EUGENE BRONET

The following is information in addition to our

For the past four and one-hali years, the san

Dierjo Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has

bee: operating

an informent who has been highly successful

in

enetrating the Minutenan organization in the san diego,

Calliscnia,

area.

an outstanding service to the government and to the nation

in acquiring and making available a large volume of infor-

mation

regarding the activities of the Minuteman organization

and reinted groups. In addition, due to the nature of his

employment, interman't has been successfully targeted.

against other unrelated activities and has

provided coverage

and penetration of a number of New Left oriented groups and

demonstrations. The scope of information provided by the

source has often extended beyond the immediate San Diego

area to other parts of the nation. He also has been

instrumental in identifying and following the activities of

rany individuals who are of interest to the rederal Bureau

of Investigation.

Informant has at all times been found

to be stable, trustworthy and reliable.

The linutemen is a paramilitant group

organized in June, 1960, by ROBERT B.

DE

PUGH in Norborne, Missouri, as a resistance

to the spread of communism

in the United

States by use of guerrilla

tactics. DE PUGH

is currently incarcerated in a Federal

penitentiary

fcr violation of the federal

Fircarms Aci.

On June 23, 1971, source advised that on the previous

JERRY LYNN DAVIS, MUSO INOWN AS

SIM D.VIS; EUGENE BROWN

WaS JERRY LYNII DiVIS, known to the informant for several years

as a member of the Minutenan organization.

At the show,

contact was made with a third party, EUGENE BROWN, a reporter

for the "anaheim Bulletin" and an associate of members of the

Minuteman organization in the los Angeles, California, area,

if not a member himself.

During the slow, several arrests were made, sore by

the Alcohol, Tobacco and fircarms Division (AIrD).

Because

of these arrests and long held attitudes on the part of

DAVIS and BROWN that, although Comrunism and Sccialism pose

threats to their security, the government of this country is

their real enemy, a decision was reached by BROWN and D.VIS

that setaliation

should be made against the government by

bombing ATFD and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) offices.

Plans were made for the three to meet again the following

Saturday evening at a motel in or near the City of El Cajon,

California, the exact time and place not then specified. At

this meeting, final plans would be made for the bombing and

specific cargets selected, one in the Los Angeles, California,

area which BROwy would handle, and one at San Diego, California,

which DAVIS would handle.

In apparent furtherance of this scheme, DAVIS

delivered to the informant on two occasions, two metal

ammunition cans for storage and safekeeping.

These cans were

found to contain several pounds of INT explosives, 18 hand

grenade fuse assemblies,

two rifle grenades, approximately

275 blasting caps of various sizes and types, a military hand

illuminating grenade, a number of parts for converting.Ml

and I-15 rifles to the corresponding M-2 and M-16 fully

automatic weapons and other miscellaneous items.

This

material was turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation

by the informant on June 25, 1971, and was in turn given to

NIED for possible use as evidence

by that agency.

Assistant U.S. Attorney STEPHEN G. NELSON, then

Chief of the Complaint Section,

evidence, such as photographs and tape recordings substantiating

the conspiratorial

meeting to take place on the evening of

June 26, 1971, would be necessary.

For as yet unexplained

reasons, subject BROll did not apyear for the meeting on the

evening of June 26, 1971, and has not subsequently been seen

or heard from by either the informant or subject DivIS.

Informant

has advised that to his knowledge no additirnal plans have been

made or work done toward carrying out the shove-described

bombings:

on July 20, 1971, subject DIVIS requested that the

hand illuminating grenade included in the explosives given by

him to the informant, be returned to him on the weekend of

July 24 - 25, 1971, indicating he had some use for the weapon

but not elaborating further on the matter.

On July 23, 1971, following consultation with Assistant

U.S. Attorney ROBERT

P. RISSO, newly appointed Chief of the

Criminal Complaint Section, and with sepresentatives of the San

Diego ATFD office, authorization was granted by RISSO and by

ATFD Eck the hand illuninating grenade to be returned to DiVIS

through the informant.

This was only to be done on the condition

that the illuminating grenade was effectively deactivated.

At this same time, RISSO stated he saw

no possible

way to öbtain successful prosecution of DiVIS in this matter.

Furthermore,

he advised that he would in no way authorize

return of the remaining items of explosives to DAVIS.

On July 23, and 26, 1971, the source pointed out

that DiVIsi request that the hand illuminating grenade be

returned to him points up the fact that his request Ecr other

parts or all of the items entrusted by him to the informant

is imminent. Because of his asscciation with DAVIS, whom

the informant believes to be bordering on being mentally

irrational, informant is convinced that for whatever reason,

when it becones necessary for him to tell D. VIS he cannot return

these materials to him it will becone obvious to DAVIS that the

informant is exactly that or has in some other way betrayed him,

and that D.VIS will then take reprisal of a violent nature

against the informant and his family.

Inasmuch as the explosives cannot be returned, the

informant has petitinned that he and his

farily be sclocated

in some other part of the country out cE DiVIS' reach.

To

this end, informant is willing to leave his home and an

excellent

employment but does not ask for another job.

Informant has stated

a personal preference for relocation

at Boise, Idaho, which he feels would be a safe location

as it is not a place to which he would be expected to go.

on July 27, 1971, Special Investigator STEVE

LOGAN, ATFD, San

• Diego, was contacted regarding the matter

of relocacing the informant. LOGAN stated that he was not

in a position to make a determination on a question of that

nature but stated he cid not believe that ATFD would accept

such a responsibility unless the informant had served as

a witness in an ATFD prosecution.

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

San Diego, California

August z, 1911

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

The following is information in addition to our

communication dated July 27, 1971:

On July 26,

1971, the informant who has furnished

the previous information in this case, was approached on

subject of relieving him of custody of certain explosive

materials previously furnished to him by subject DAVIS, by

the use of a search warrant for the explosives at his home.

The search warrant, it was

felt, would serve the purpose of

explaining to DAVIS why this informant could not produce the

explosives. After lengthy consideration, the informant

declined to accept this suggestion as a workable solution to

the problem.

The informant is convinced that regardless of

reason given, when he advises DAVIS he no longer has

possession of the explosives, DAVIS's anger will cause him to

become irrational to the point that he would commit some act

or acts of violence against the informant or his family.

Informant continued to be of the opinion that due to the

fact

the explosives could

I not be made available for return to DAVIS,

the only safe course of action for him and his family would

be relocation in an area where the informant and his family

would be out of DAVIS's reach.

On July 28, 1971, the informant's parents tele

phonically contacted the

San Diego Division of the FBI.

They

advised that based on their knowledge of JERRY LYNN DAVIS,

and other individuals with whom their son had been associating,

they felt his concern for the personal safety of both himself

and his family was completely justified. The parents advised

that they contemplated moving to the state of Hawaii in the

near

future for reasons of health.

JERRY LYNN DAVIS;

EUGENE BROWN

In addition, the parents indicated they were not

satisfied solely with the possibility of the informant's

relocation to Boise, Idaho, and felt that in

addition to

relocation, the Federal Bureau of Investigation

should secure

a job for

the informant at the place of relocation comparable

to the $12,000 a year job he presently holds at San Diego,

The parents advised they had suggested to informant the

possibility of his relocation in Hawaii, as they felt there

should be an abundance ot employment opportunities with the

U.S. Government in that state and that the Federal Bureau of

Investigation should

be able to get one for their son without

too much difficulty.

During this conversation, the informant's father

advised he (the father) has friends in Washington, D.C., and

that if it appeared help might be necessary in obtaining

authorization for relocation and the securing of employment

for the informant, he would be glad to contact these people

for any assistance they might be able to render.

On July 29, 1971, the informant was recontacted at

which time he stated

he had continued to give the matter of

relocation considerable thought. He pointed out that his

parents have,

for some time, been trying to convince him of

the desirability of moving to the state of Hawaii. He explained

that his parents have resided and visited in that state several

times, and are contemplating moving there permanently in the

near

future for health and business reasons.

Informant

advised he personally continues to feel that relocation at

Boise, Idaho, would be more advantageous to him. He statec

he would appreciate assistance from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation in finding employment there.

Informant further advised that the home in which

he lives at San Diego is being purchased through a federal

Housing Adninistration (FHA) loan and has a current market

value of approximately $20,000.

He said that subsequent to

making the original estimate of

$1,500. to $2,000, as

the cost

of relocating him to another place, the points required

for liquidating FHA loans have raised from 2 to 10.

He said that this meant that while originally it would have

cost him only $400 to pay off his FHA loan, he is now

faced

with the problem of paying $2,000 to do the same

thing.

The

informant

reels that it will now cost him approximately

$3,000 to $3,500 to relocate at Boise, Idaho.

This is to'advise of information developed by captioned

informant disclosing a shooting incident arising from activities

of the newly organized white extremist Secret Army Organization.

By memorandum dated 1/11/72, you were advised of the

formation and activities of the newly formed ultraconservative

white extremist paramilitary group known as Secret Army Organiza-

tion (SAO). SAO has targeted for harassment San Diego State

College Professor Peter Bohmer.

Bohmer's residence is a well-known

New Left commune, whose occupants, along with Bohmer, are planning

demonstrations at the Republican National Convention scheduled at

¡San Diego for August, 1972.

Captioned informant, a 28-year-old white male operated

since August,

1967, has been recently targeted to penetrate the

extremist-oriented SAO. On January 6, 1972, informant was

requested by SAO leader to surveil Bohmer's residence in order

obtain intelligence information. Accompanying informant on/

surveillance was SAl associate George M. Hoover. The surveillance:

held during the evening of January 6, 1972, was discontinued after

the Bohmer residence appeared unoccupied.

However, prior to

discontinuance, an SAO sticker was left at the front door. While

passing in front of the house in informant's automobile, Hoover,

without warning and to the complete dismay of informant, fired

two shots into the house. The informant strongly protested and

they sped away. A female occupant of the house reportedly

sustained minor gunshot wound in her elbow.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re* SD 1155-E

134-17222

Informant furnished details of the shooting, which

would not have been available through any other source, and

cautioned that Hoover is "fired up" over the incident and ready

for a violent confrontation should police approach him on this

matter. Identities of those involved in shooting not known to

San Diego police; however, witnesses did fumish description of

informant's automobile.

This informant, during his utilization, has furnished

exceptionally valuable information on the Minutemen and has been

completely reliable. He has been previously cautioned, as all

extremist informants are, not to become directly involved in

violent confrontations or activities.

He is the only Bureau

source covering the violence-prone SAO. San Diego has advised

that pertinent information developed by informant will be

furnished to the San Diego Police Department but informant's

identity withheld unless disclosure bacomes necessary.

There

appears to be no objection to this, and San Diego will be

instructed to closely follow this matter and promptly report

pertinent developments.

RECOMMENDATION:

That attached teletype

in accordance with above be

approved and sent.

gunmen for the Lod Airport massacre in Tel Aviv, Israel,

5/30/72.

According to information learned by MILLER there

was a strong

• indication of

a world-wide Communist conspiracy

dedicated to international revolution. Me. MILLER selated

some of the facts which he learned concerning the Red Army

group in Japan and

its ties to revolutionary groups throughout

the world.

On 8/23/72, Mr. MILLER was interviewed concerning

details of the information which he had related in his

letter to the Bureau.

After the interview MILLER produced/

several boois written in Japanese which he had had partially

cranslated and which were extremely revolutionary and. violent

in nature.

These books were forwarded to the Bureau for

complete translation.

Mr. MILIER seemed to be a reasonable man who was

very concerned about the dangers posed by terrorists

organizations throughout the worla.

I would like to assure you we intend to present the Federal

Our motive for writing this. book is to alert the general

public of a dangerous situation developing (and in" some cases well

established) in every major community in the nation.

Godfrey wants to lay out the nation network of communication

between extremist groups, both right and left wing.

He plans to recount as much detail as possible of his years

as a member of these extremist groups, explaining the recruiting,

training, assignment

and some actual operations accomplished by

them.

1973

It would be of great assistance to us if you would authorize

me to interview Agent Peterson in San Diego. This would not constitute

an endorsement of our Book, but would help me io understand more

about Godfrey, the general situation, and the position

RE: LAURITZ P. MILLER

an she dan Diego otice August 1o, 198%, Whine

of the San Diego Office August 10; 1957, while employed as

an equipment-checker for Pacific Telephone and Telegraph

Company, San Diego, California.

A gun hobbyist, Army trained

in the use of explosives, he became associated with the top

echelon of the Minutemen

as well as the Secret Army Organization

(SAO), furnishing excellent information to the FBI regarding

these

and other extremists groups.

By communication dated November 20, 1972, the

San Diego Office discontinued Godfrey as an informant. Godfrey

had testified in San Diego County Superior Court in the trial

of George Mitchell Hoover, SAO member charged with attempted

murder, and in the trial of William Francis Yakopec, who was

found guilty of the bombing of the Guild Theater in San Diego.

At that time, Godfrey also was scheduled to testify against

Jerry Lynn Davis, SAO leader charged with illegal possession

of explosives.

SA Petersen also testified in Hoover's trial and

had been Godfrey's contacting Agent.

As a result of Godfrey's appearances as a prosecution

witness, his identity as an FBI informant was publicized in the

news media. (137-17222, 157-17513-10)

Regarding Miller:

Our files show that by letter dated November 30,

1971, Miller requested information regarding crimes committed

by juvenile females.

He was furnished a Uniform Crime Reports

Bulletin.

Miller wrote to Acting Director Gray August 11,

1972, furnishing information regarding what he considered

to be a world-wide communist conspiracy for revolution,

including direct communication between U. S. revolutionaries

Miller stated that some American servicemen

were sympathetic with the world revolutionaries and were being

used as couriers. Miller explained he had developed this

information while doing research in Japan.

information as to whether the FBI knew of the "situation."

By airtel

August 21, 1972, the Los Angeles Office

was advised of Miller's August llth letter and was instructed

to interview him.

The Los Angeles Office further was instructed

to advise Miller of the confidential nature of information contained

in Bureau files and to alert him regarding the jurisdictions of

the respective military services over their personnel.

RE: LAURITI P. MILLER

Miller was subsequently advised by the Los Angeles

Office per instructions and the information

he furnished was

forwarded to the Legal Attache, Tokyo.

Miller also furnished similar information directly

to the Japanese National Police Agency (NPA), in August, 1972.

The NPA in October, 1972, advised the Legal

Attache, Tokyo,

that NPA's inquiry failed to substantiate Miller's allegations.

(62-115275)

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

On March 6, 1973, ASAC Clark F. Brown, San Diego

Office, was telephonically advised of Miller's request to

interview SA Petersen in connection with the projected book.

ASAC Brown was

advised that interview of SA Petersen would not

be authorized in view of regulations regarding revealing

information in Bureau files.

This matter has been coordinated with the Intelligence

Division and James L. Williamson of the Office of Legal Counsel.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached reply be sent to Miller.

Purpose of this memorandum is to advise that a San Diego

Division extremist informant furnished information resulting in

the solution of a bombing perpetrated by a member of the Secret

Arhy Organization (SAO), a white ultraconservative, paramilitary

group clandestinely formed in Arizona in 1971, and the confiscation

of explosives.

On 6/20/72, End advised that William Francis Yakopec,

a member of the SAO, El Cajon, California, said he personally,

without the knowledge of other SAO members, was responsible for the

6/19/72 bombing of the Guild, a movie

theater specializing in

pornographic films, 3827 Fifth Avenue, San Diego, and he identified

foux pornography-oriented establishments as potential future bombing

targets.

this information was turnished to the San Diego Police

Department (SDPD).

- On 6/25/72, Yakopec told the informant the location of

explosives he had concealed in a vacant lot behind his residence.

This information was also furnished to the SDPD and a search of the

lot resulted in the confiscation of one two-and-one-quarter-pound

block of C-4 military plastic explosives, two one-pound canisters

of primer charges, approximately 30 mechanical caps, andian unknown

quantity of safety

Re: Secret Army Organization

Yakopec and Hoover were arrested and charged with attempted

murder and improper storage of gunpowder in excess

of 20 pounds

without a license. Fleury and his wife, Genevieve, were arrested and

charged with improper storage of gunpowder in excess of 20 pounds.

All four subjects are currently incarcerated in the San Diego County

Jail.

The source has expressed willingness to testify in this

matter it necessary to secure prosecutive action. The SUPD has

stated should the source's testimony become necessary steps would be

taken by that Department to insure protection of the source and his

family and that they would be relocated and suitable employment

obtained for the source.

Inasmuch as the preliminary facts regarding the bombing of

the Guild Theater failed to indicate involvement of members of a

terrorist or revolutionary group, under existing guidelines the

incident was one within the primary jurisdiction of the Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Division and that agency was immediately

advised.

Pertinent portions of this information will be furnished

to the Internal Security Division of the Department of Justice and

to Secret Service.

On April 26, 1972, a confidential source, who has

provided relleble information on numerous occasions in the past,

advised no recent developments have been made in plans by jerry

Lynn Davis and the Secret Army Organization (SAO) for disruptions

during the Republican National Convention (RNC).

explained that due to the time interval until the advent of the

RNC, such plans had only reached a speculation or discussion stage.

Furthermore, actual plans and activities by the sAo would depen

greatly on the nature of conditions existing during the RNC 1.e.9

number of New Left demonstrators, riots, police retaliation, etc.

The Secret Army Organization (SAO) is a para-military

organization formed during the early part of

October, 1971, by former members and supporters

of the Minutemen Organization, for the purpose

of replacing that organization, now considered

defunct.

With its headquarters located at San

Diego, California,

the SAo intends to work towards

becoming a nationwide organization.

JErry Lynn

Davis, 2393 Weshington, Spring Valley, "California,

Is the leader of SAO in the San Diego area.

The Minutemen organization is a parp-military

group orgenized in June, 1960, by Rocert B.

DePugh in Norborne, Missouri,

to the spread of communism in the United States

by use of guerrilla tectics.

Incarcerated in a Federal penitentiary for violation

of the Federal Firearms Act. The Patriotic Party

has been the political arm of the Minutemen.

The source had previously received information to the

effect that four cannons of a type similar to those used in the

Civil War might be available for use by Davis and his associates.

On April 26, 1972, the source stated that two of these are

maintained, in the

Canyon Roadin San Diego County area.

Alden Edward Willis, not a member of

the SAO, however, he 1s

politically sympathetic and friendly with Davis.

Is not sure how readily available these weepons

might now be to

the SAO.

A third cannon,

previously referred to as being under

construction, is now complete and is located in the beckyerd of

SAO member Stanley Don McDade, 3220 Sweetweter Road, Lemon Grove,

The source advised he was only told of the existence

of the fourth cannon and does not know its owner or location.

The source said he understands these weapons are legal under

both State and Federal law.

The source stated to his knowledge, Davis is not

presently manufacturing or selling firearms or explosives In

violation of Federal or California law.

The source advised that

approximately six months ago he observed Davis in possession

of a fully automatic AR 18 rifle in..223 caliber which was

received earlier the same day by Davis from one Richard Miller,

7186 Glenroy, San Diego.

Miller's source of the Ar 18 i%. not

known but source said it Is rumored that he has contact with CALIf

a stockholder of the manufacturer, Armalite Company, and has

also had AR 180 rifles (legal civilian version of the AR 18

rifle for sale when no one else could get them.

Davis showed the source that the safety lever on his

AR 18 hed the third position for fully automatic fire. The

source could not obtain the serial number.

on or about Merch 20, 1972, the source observed

Davis take delivery of

a fully

automatic M-2 carbine in .30

caliber from Cy Anderson, 1948 Northeast 168 Plece, Bothell,

washington, who is knowr

to source as

a trafficker

in firearms

and other items of questionable legality. The source observed

the fully automatic fire control lever on the weapon but was not

In a position to obtain its serial number.

The source advised

he is sure Davis still possesses the AR 18 rifle but Davis

claims this weapon is now "stashed" and its location is not

known to the source.

The source said Devis maintains the

M-2 carbine in his bedroom at his

residence, 2393 Washington

Street, Spring Valley, Collfornia; however, Davis has essured

the source that certain parts have been removed from both rifles

so as to cause them to fire semi-automatic only.

_SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

epproximately the first of April, 1972.

On April 27, 1972, Special Agents of the FBI at

San Diego, using a suitable

pretext, observed two Civil War

style cannons on the premises oi the Gunsmoke Ranch.

One

cannon, obvicusly nond made or nome made, had a barrel

approximately two feet in length with about a two inch bore

and was mounted on a small four wheel carriage of an old Navy

style.

The second cannon appeared to be an original Civil War

piece with about a three foot barrel having about a three inch

bore.

A third cannon was observed by these special Agents

the same day in the backyard of the MoDade residence by driving

that e backyard

up a driveway commonly shared by three houses. This gun had a

barrel of approximately four feet with close to a four inch bore

and was mounted on a home made two wheel carriage.

On April 28, 1972, Donald Grossmeyer, Speclal

Investigetor, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Department (ATFD),

San Diego, advised neither he nor his office had ony knowledge

regarding

Richard Miller or his activities. Grossmeyer stated

that the three cannons are legal under Federal law but thought

they might possibly have to be registered to be legal under

California law.

on May 26, 1972, Special Agent James Berrian, California

Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Identification, Sen Diego,

made available copies of records maintained by his Bureau,

pertaining to transactions involving sales of handguns by

Individusls using the name Jerry I. Davis or Jerry Lynn Davis.

In excess of twenty such transactions were found which were

identifiable with Davis. In no two of these transactions wes

the second party to the sale the same individual. Special Agent

Berrian pointed out that due to the dates involved, many of

these weapons would appear to have been resold by Davis.

on June 7, 1972, the first source advised that with

the RNC heving been

changed to Miami, Floride, the activitles

of the SAO had entered Into a relatively quiet period and that

the organization would at least temporarily concentrate on

recruitment and propagandizing.

He stated he had not yet been

able to determine the location of any illegal explosives or

weapons.

the Bothell, Washington area carrying sidearms and wearing

camoflage clothing.

When investigated by his department,

it was determined that at that time ANDERSON was involved

in what was referred to as "simulated maneuvers" in the

woods. around the Bothell, Washington area which PLANCICH

described as being heavily populated by farms and related

businesses.

Also during the summer of 1969, a Bothell

Police Officer observed ANDERSON in the company of several

other white males who were once again conducting some sort

of maneuvers. At this time the officer observed a shotgun

in one of the vehicles, which when measured was just 1/2 inch

over the legal limit.

During the early fall of 1969,

ANDERSON approached an officer of the Bothell Police

Department

with a weapon to determine if it was legal and under the

current interpretations of both Federal and state law, it

was opined that the weapon ANDERSON had was legal, but no

record was maintained as to the type of weapon.

PLANCICH stated that ANDERSON, in the past, has

purchased old Bothell Police Department vehides and it was

PLANCICH's opinion that ANDERSON did this to satisfy some

unknown egomania that he felt ANDERSON had.

PLANCICH

stated that he knew of no violent acts committed by ANDERSON

at any time.

SECRET ARMY ORGANIZATION

PX T-1 advised on April 26, 1972, that during

his contact with members of the Secret Army Organization

(SAO) In february, 1972, Sam Davis, also known as derry

Davis, and one Cy

Anderson, posed the question to an SAO

as to what measures could be taken by the SAo to

counter disruptions by revolutionary groups at the

Republican National Convention.

This question was never

discussed at great length, but

in this connection, one

member suggested that old junk-type cars be parked at

in the event of confrontation

strategic locations where he SAO members could have access

with dissident elements,

to the necessary weapons hidden in the cars.

Since the

time of the above discussion, however, SAO leadership

appears to have had second thoughts on the matter because

the latter have been heard to say that they are going

to stay out of San Diego entirely during the Republican

National Convention in order to preclude any untoward

incident that could be attributed to the presence of

the SAO and redound to the discredit of the SAo.

Informant advised that he has not been present

when sources of weapons may have been discussed by the

but states that he is aware of the fact that leaders

st the sAd have attended gun shows at every opportunity,

notably at luma, Arizona, on October 15, 16, 1971, and

again at Yuma on February 25, 26, 1972, and

at Phoenix,

Arizona, on March 25, 26, 1972.

Source advises that the Secret Army Organization

is a new paramilitary group that has been

formed in California to replace the Minutemen:

organization.

It is composed of ex-Minutemen
