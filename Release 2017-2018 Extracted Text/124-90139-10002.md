Mrs. Potocki gave the following explanation

Tich led to

CIA's deduction.

S(u)

Messages emanating from Havana indicated that one of the

recipients was probably located in a small town in Colombia near the :

Venezuelan Border.

CIA developed a suspect and instituted coverage..

Recently, this individual transmitted a letter to Havana which

"communication was intercepted by CIA.. The person had apparently

violated instructions by including some sensitive data in the

communication.

Havana then transmitted a radio message lastigating

cuban Agent in Colombia

An examination of the radio message

nd the intercepted communication sent by the Agent has led CI

to believe that "Petronio"

Is identical with [pineiro](S)
