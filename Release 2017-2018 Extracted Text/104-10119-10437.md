2.

"Dan" provided the writer with a copy of the cable

in wead

(IN 944357, Cite

19536, dated 8 June 1976),

which is attached. In substance, the

cable reflects that

circa

8 June 1976 a Guatemalan source, with the knowledge of

Guatemalan President LAUGERUD, provided

Station 162

a written report, and a detailed briefing,

concerning a plot

to assassinate President LAUGERUD.

According to the informa-

tion the plot was to have been carried out on 15 September

of an attack upon his, ZIMERI's, life. ZIMERI has been living

in Miami since August 1975.

3. According to the report, the National Liberation

Movement was involved with ZIMERI

in the assassination plot

and ZIMERI in turn was involved with two Americans, brothers,

Robert and Gerald Patrick HEMMING. The HEMMING brothers

assisted ZIMERI in acquiring arms, among other things,

which

were flown to Guatemala in a small aircraft.

The report also

claims that ZIMERI has close relations with police officials

in Miami and New Orleans.

States

legally, deport him to Guatemala.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING is well known to this Agency,

Ta late Aerty arration when in ence there wen

none.

The most recent incident wherein HEMMING claimed such

an i dent"

affiliation was in May 1975 when he volunteered his services

to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Gerald Patrick HEMMING

is a long-time cohort of Frank Anthony STURGIS (SF#353 459),

Frank FIORINI, of Watergate notoriety who also has a

falsely claiming Agency affiliation.

the late 1950's HEMMING and STURGIS, both former U.S. Marines,

joined Fidel CASTRO in Cuba but returned shortly thereafter

claiming disillusionment with the CASTRO cause.

Soon thereafter,

STURGIS organized a group of mercenaries for Caribbean and

Central American activities which he named the International

Anti-Communist Brigade.

A reported sub-unit of this "Brigade"

(the backers of whom have never been fully established) was

named the Intercontinental Penetration Force, headed by Gerald

Patrick HEMMING.

For an appreciation of the possible ramifications of

a Guatemalan government expose of this assassination plot

involving HEMMING, you are referred to attachments to

memorandum, to wit:

1975 in the name of Frank STURGIS and Everett Howard HUNT, Jr.; *

i a suncis and

instant

a memorandum by the writer dated 10 June

and an extract from a book published

in early 1976 written by

Michael CANFIELD and Alan J. WEBERMAN.

The book Coup d'etat

in America--The CIA and the Assassination of John F. Kennedy

is a diatribe against the Agency and attempts to link the Agency

with the assassination of President KENNEDY. One of the major

links attempted by the authors is through Everett Howard HUNT,

Jr. to Frank STURGIS to Gerald Patrick HEMMING to Loran Eugene

HALL.

Loran Eugene HALL was a member of HEMMING's Interconti-

nental Penetration Force.

Loran Eugene HALL received nationwide

publicity in 1967 when New Orleans District Attorney "Jim"

GARRISON alleged that HALL (and the Intercontinental Penetration

Force) was involved in the assassination of President KENNEDY

and that members of this unit were connected with CIA.

shortly thereafter dropped his interest in HALL, but it is

interesting that he did so after Gerald Patrick

another cohort, Robert K. BROWN, joined GARRISON's investigation.
