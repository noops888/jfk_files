I.

Reference your request for a statement on subject officer for

the purpose of including such

statement in his security file, the

following is offered.

2. Conein has been known by the writer for a considerable period

of timo, for the past two years on a day-to-day basis, since he has.

been directly under the supervision of the writer.

It is the frank

opinion of the writer that Conein has definitely settled down and is

most anxious for a continued career with this organization. His desire

to continue his career is endorsed by me.

profited by the discussions he has had with me on this part of his

So He is completely loyal, well motivated, and honest.

6.. I do feel, honever, that he has found his niche with the

type of work he le doing and

would strongly reconnend that he be

retained on such an assignment

I say this for I feel there will

always be a need for a so-called Disposal Unit, and at this point

Conein is one of three who are completely trained and well versed

in the peculiarities of this worke
