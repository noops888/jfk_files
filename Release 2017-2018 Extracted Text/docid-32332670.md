any Federal violation.

Remarks (continued):

The Pittsburgh Office 1s looking for a great deal more,

far as specific oriminal intelligence information is concerned,

in relation to the GENOVESE-LA ROCCA organization. In my

opinion the position of prominence this phase of our activity

has attained. as well as the issuance of recent Bureau

Instructions In this regard, and the information received thus

far by the Pittsburgh Office justifles the continuation of this

installation.

The Bureau will be promptly advised of the extent of any

possible violations developed as a result of this technical

surveillance.

The LA ROCCA Investigation and this coverage in

particular is being given my personal attention on a continuing

basis and I will insure that constant efforts are made to

establish a Federal violation against this individual.

When

information of immediate interest or significance 1s received,

It will be promptly brought to the Bureau's attention in the

dally teletype being

submitted relative to LA ROCCA.

IN VIEW OF THE CONVICTION OF LA ROCCA FOR ASSAULT WITH INTENT

TO KILL AND HIS ARREST FOR CARRYING A CONCEALED WEAPON, HE MAY

BE: ARMED

AND SHOULD BE: CONSIDERED DANGEROUS.
