CIVELLO and CUNZALO, he would describe CUNZALO only as a

"casual" friend of CIVELLO and they have been observed

together by DL T-3 only at Italian funerals.

DL T-3 has

never heard CIVELLO, nor anyone acquainted with CIVELLO,

speak of any association to any degree between CIVELLO and

CUNZALO. Informant was asked if it would be proper for

CIVELLO Or CUNZALO to use the term "compadre" toward each

other. Informant stated that this is a term of respect

which is used between "equals" and is never used by a

person addressing someone he considers his superior or

his inferior.

He further stated it would be quite proper

for CIVELLO and CUNZALO to use this term when greeting each

other.

on March 28, 1966, each advised that they had no information
