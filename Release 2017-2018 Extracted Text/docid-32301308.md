Dear Comrade,

I was one of the fortunate group of individuals from

Canada who were afforded the privilege of visiting your country

in October, 1966.

Perhaps you will not remember me, but I had the

pleasure of meeting you in Peking during our visit when you

and other members of the Chinese People's Government greeted

and allowed us the opportunity to present questions regarding

your country.

At that time, I expressed some concern at, what

appeared to be, excesses of the Cultural Revolution

and wondered

whether some of the people who had suffered violence and

at the hands of the Red Guards might not in fact be innocent.

Your reply was that as a result of

over enthusiasm it was always

possible to make mistakes, however, they would be rectified

in time.

My púrpose in writing is to express my concern and

that conveyed to me by a friend from NY, SUE, a loyal Maoist, and

acquaintance of yours, over the fact that recent reports have

indicated that long time friends of the Chinese People's Government,

ISRAEL EPSTEIN and his wife and MICHAEL SHAPIRO had been arrested

for espionage; SIDNEY RITTENBERG had been purged from his job with

Radio Peking

and ANNA LOUISE STRING had been condemned as an

"imperialist agent." We are deeply concerned regarding the treat-

ment of these friends of the Chinese People's Government and

wonder whether the abuses which I previously mentioned are con-

tinuing in spite of your statement the mistakes would be rectifled.

If these rumors are true a serious mistake has been made and we

appeal to you as afriend to intercede on behalf of the friends

of the

Chinese People's Government.

You can well understand my reason for not signing the

letter or Identifying SUE, for to do so could conceivably disclose

our identities to the authorities.
