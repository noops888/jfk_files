The "Miami Herald"', Miami, Florida, under date August 22,

1959, in an article with the dateline at New York, UPI, set out.

that SANTO TRAFFICANTE had resumed gambling activities

in Cuba.

This article set out that in a dispatch from the Scripps-Howard

Newspaper Alliance in Washington, The World-Telegraph and Sun,

said a secret memorandum prepared by

government sources, disclosed

that SANTO TRAFFICANTE had "arranged" with Cuban authorities to

remain in Cuba. This article mentioned that the secret memorandum

said that SANTO TRAFFICANTE was released through an "understanding"

with the CASTRO government.

On August 20, 1959, HAROLD MILKS, Associated Press

Correspondent, Havana,

advised SANTO TRAFFICANTE and HENRY. SAAVEDRA,

who represents the subject's interest in the Hotel Capri, had

been provisionally released by Cuban Inmigration authorities from

Tiscornia Prison, where they had been incarcerated for the past

two months. MILKS stated that the Cuban government claimed that

insufficient evidence had been developed to warrant deportation

of subject and SAAVEDRA from Cuba, but that investigation

concerning this matter is being continued by the Cuban government:

+.

On August 10, 1959, MM T-1 informed that during his stay

in Tiscornia, TRAFFICANTE and SAAVEDRA had "lived like kings".

Source said that almost all the guards in the prison had been

bribed by subject in order to insure that the subject had the

most comfortable accommodations possible. Source said that subject's

food was brought in to him on a daily basis from outside the

prison and that he was allowed any number of visitors, as he

desired.

On July 13, 1959, MM T-4 advised he had attended wedding

of the subject's daughter, as an invited guest. Source noted most

of those in attendance at

the wedding were employees from various

casinos in Havana, and that the only outsiders were subject's

immediate family and one or two close friends from Tampa, Florida.

CRIMINAL RECORD

Inasmuch as an FBI Identification Record on the subject

had been furnished the Dalbs, Texas Police Department, following

investigation was conducted.

Officer, Dallas Police Department, Dallas, Texas, advised

SA MILTON L. NEWSOM that a search of his records failed to reflect

any information relative to the subject. Mr. VICKERY advised
