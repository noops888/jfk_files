A review of the files of the Miami Office re-

flected that by Bureau letter 4/28/61 to the New York™

Office, under the caption FPCC, the Bureau forwarded

letter dated 4/12/6.1 which was received from CIA. The

CIA letter was classified SECRET. The CIA letter stated

a fairly reliable source, not further identified, made

available a membership list of the FPCC. The CIA source

did not state where or how he obtained the list. A com-

parison of the CIA list and the one forwarded as an

attachment ta the referenced conunication, reflected (V)

they were identical.

The above referred to lists, however, are not

membership lists of the FPCC but rather a list of indi-

the sponsorshipe of the Pecuba in December, 1960 under XU)

the sponsorship of the FPCC.

On December 23, 1960 MANUEL ALVAREZ DE LA CAMPA,

Traffic Supervisor, Cubana Airlines, who at that time was

a PSI, made available a list containing 204 names. This

list comprised the individuals who were schediled to make

the Christmas trip to Cuba aboard Cubana Airlines, the

tour being sponsored by the FPCC.

*/U)

The names on the list furnished by the Traffic

Supervisor of Cubana Airlines were checked against the

list made available as an enclosure to the referenced

letter. It was determined that the two lists were iden-

tical.

Дu)

Information copies of this letter are designated.

for all offices which received copies of referenced letter
