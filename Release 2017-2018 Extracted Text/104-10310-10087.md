SELECT COMMITTEE TO

(MURILANT TO I. HER LI, NTH CONGRESS)

WASHINGTON, D.C 20510

February 25, 1976-

REVIEW STAFF

760-02004

Mr. Walter Elder

Review Staff

Central Intelligence Agency

Langley, Virginia

Dear Mi. Elder: : :

This is to confirm our discussion of February 20

regarding the deposition of certain requests of the Select

Comnittee:

(1) With regard to the Comnittee's letter of February 6,

and CIA's letter response 76-0200/1 of February 11, I asked

that a further attempt be made to identify the initials

"G.N.N.". Those initials follow handwritten comments on a

March 1965 document in the AMLASH file which proposed giving

the Cuban government information which might compromise

AMLASH.

(2) With regard to the Committee's letter of January

12 and CIA's letter response 76-0062/1 of February 11, I

asked that CIA review its files on Osvaldo Dorticos, Presi-

dent of Cuba, to determine if the message received by Dr.

Portell-Villa was placed in those files.

(3) Dan Dwyer and I reviewed the list of CIA person-

nel at the Mexico City station referenced in CIA's letter 76-

0083/3 of February 11 and

agreed the list should remain at

the Agency.

(4) I requested the Select Committee be provided the

current address and telephone number of Mr. John Whiten, the

Desk Chief for Mexico in 1963.

(5) With regard to the Committee's letter of January

29, requesting that two current Agency employees be made

available for interviews, we agreed the Agency should provide

the Committee a letter stating whether or not these eulayas,

were readily available for interviews.

Dan Layer and I reviewed Agency originated

documezes in CIA's 201 File on Gilberto Policarpo Lopez.

It is cur inderstanding you would reconsider CIA's decision to

deny the C-mittee's request for a copy of these documents.

(7) with regard to the Committee's letter of January 30,

we agreed:

{2)

He would for the time being narrow the request

in paragrap) 1 to include only contacts of Director McCone;

(5) We would not alter the requests in paragraphs

2 and 3.

I trust this summary accords with your understanding of

our discussion.. but please let me know if there is any

misunde=starding-

Sincerely,
