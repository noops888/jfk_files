On December 2, 1959, Captain LEE NAPIER of the

Miami, Florida Police Department advised SA J. C. STRICKLAND,

JR. that an informant has reported information concerning

the contemplated kidnaping of PEDRO DIAZ LANZ, former head

of the Cuban Air Force, who is presently residing in Miami,

Florida.

According to NAPIER, his informant was recently

in Havana, Cuba and was approached by Cuban officials con-

cerning the possibility of getting LANZ to Cuba.

The

informant is alleged to have related that he would not get

involved,

but informed the

'Cuban officials he knew a person

who would be interested and who could possibly accomplish

the mission. Informant advised a representative from Cuba

is scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 4, 1959, to

further discuss this matter.

NAPIER advised his informant is

Marine Broker, Miami, Florida.

FLA, CuBA

whose name should not be disclosed,

was interviewed December 3, 1959. He advised that about two

weeks ago he was in Havana, Cuba discussing business matters

with JOSE SALAZAR of the Tourist Bureau., He has known SALAZAR

for quite 'some time and SALAZAR introduced him to a Lieutenant

DELGADO who is second in command of construction at the Navy

the possibility of getting DIAZ LANZ out of the United States

into Cuba.

told them he would have nothing to do

with such

a matter but thought it could be done upon pay-

ment of a

sufficient sum of money and that he knows a person

who would be interested; he would put them in contact with

this individual. The individual referred to is JACK BROWN,

whose identity should not be disclosed, who is a deep sea

diver and operates an advertising business in Marathon,

Florida. BROWN owns a sea plane and a PT boat.

advised he discussed the matter with

• JACK BROWN and it was agreed between them that no effort

would be made to contact LANZ, but that an effort would be

made to have the Cuban government pay a large sum of money

in advance upon the belief that BROWN would undertake the

job.

He advised that under no circumstances should

BROWN be informed that the matter has been reported, as

BRow then probably would not endeavor to determine

the

complete plan from the Cuban officials.

he can control BROWN and, if necessary, he believes he

could induce BROWN to testify.

On December 2, 1959,

BROWN had a FLA,

tesephonic conversation with JOSEYSALAZAR and an agreement WRA

was made whereby a representative

would arrive at Key West,

Florida, on the first Cubana plane on the morning of Decem-

ber 4, 1959. BROWN was to meet the Cuban representative in

the airport manager's office, which upon reflection

believed to be not feasible as BROWN is well known to the

airport manager.

called SALAZAR on December 3, 1959, and

outlined the

danger of having such a meeting in Key West,

and suggested the representative come to Miami. This change

return to Cuba by plane and BROWN should follow in his own

would land.

plan and at the present time it is very difficult to leave

any airport for Cuba.

P.M. and returned to the Skyway Motel. YASELLS remained in

the room during the absence of McCRORY.

BROWN informed YASELLS that SALAZAR had stated

a card and

formed him YASELLS was returning to Cuba in possession of

He told SALAZAR he had previously

mentioned that the mission would cost a large sum of money

and BROWN was rather reluctant to discuss any plan with

YASELLS as YASELLS had no authority. SALAZAR advised he

would look into the matter further and contact

He also advised he has persuaded BROWN it would
