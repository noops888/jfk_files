ADMINISTRATIVE

The instant report is divided into three sections.

The first is a series of excerpts taken fron the file

reviewing ALEX's rise to pover:

This was done with the

purpose of attempting to identify a fresh approach on this

casc.. The second traces ALEX's current activities.

The

third section provides a thumbnail sketch of MEX's

reported employer, Apex Amusement, Deluxe Cigarettes, and

Ajax Phonographic.

Virtually all of ALFX's reported

income has been from this source.

one again, it is

speculated that if ALEX is to be brought to justice, that

it will be necessary to attack him through this source.

So long as this corporation insulates him from his

illegal activities/income, it vill be improbable to

develop a prosecutable case. Chicago, therefore, intends

to explore more the function and activities of the cor-

poration as a means of reading ALEX.
