It is noted that CUBELA is a Cuban Government

official whose desire to defect was made known by MM 761-S

in June, 1962. Thereafter, CIA apparently made contact

with CUBELA in Europe through CARLOS TEPEDINO, 9819 64th

Avenue, Rego Park, Queens, New York, a Cuban exile and

long-time friend of MM 761-S, who frequently travels it

TEPEDINO thereupon confided that he has been (

acting as the contact man between CIA and CUBELA. CUBELA

is also in contact with the Cuban Ambassador in Paris

named CARRILLO, who reportedly is anti-CASTRO. CARRILLO (S

has been assisting both CUBELA and [REPEDINO.](

According to TEPEDINO, CUBELA has been constantly

complaining to him that CIA refuses to furnish him with

certain necessary equipment with which he could take some

effective action in Cuba. According to TEPEDINO, CUBELA

desires some sort of coupact eguipment with which he can

possibly eliminate CASTRO, however, CIA keeps offering

him only large, bulky, unserviceable material.

According to rEPEDINO, there is now under discussio

some plan to kill FIDEL CASTRO, in which CUBELA will figure.

CIA allegedly was formerly in favor of such a plan; however,

inasmuch as Attorney General ROBERT KENNEDY would have no

part of it, it was shelved. Now the plan has allegedly been

again for consideration. President JOHNSON

allegedly is aware of it, and has not ruled against it.

If set in motion, it will be scheduled to occur sometime

before the elections in November.

TEPEDINO told the informant he has not been able

to learn much more concerning this plan, other than that

CUBELA is supposed to participate, that

it is to be

accomplished by men in Cuba, and

possibly someone from

Europe.

(U)

The informant advised TEPEDINO did not specifically

indicate how he had acquired this intormation; however, the

informant presumed from his manner of speaking that he had

obtained it from CUBELA.

The above is for the information of the Bureau,

and is not being submitted in form suitable for dissemination U)

since both[TEPEDINO]and CUBELA are apparently of operational (f)

interest to CIA.

Dissemination would also lead to the

disclosure of MM 761-S. Although questioned closely,

MM 761-S was not able to furnish any further details.
