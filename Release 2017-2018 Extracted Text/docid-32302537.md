SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka.,

on 6/6/61, former PCI L

advised SA THOMAS G.

FORSYTH, III as follows:

He has heard rumors recently among Pittsburgh area gamblers

to the effect that ARCHIE NELSON wants to sell the Phoenix

Motel, U. S. Route 22, Monroeville, Pa., for some unknown

NELSON's recent heart attack is believed to have

been phoney and staged to prepare a plausible reason for

him to sell a profitable business.

The same gamblers have

said they understand that "the boys from New Kensington"

are interested in buying the Phoenix Motel. To informant,

"the boys from New Kensington"

KELLY MANNARINO personally or someone

Pittsburgh will remain alert to the possible sale of this

motel and, if sold, the identities of the purchasers.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
