For the information of the Bureau, there are no-

in the PINAP file of Minneapolis which pertains to the

kidnapping of Mrs. VIRGINIA PIPER in 1972.

The references

generally relate to RAY and are contained in serials wherein

he was afforded a polygraph exam, and daily summary

teletypes wherein the test was discussed and general

serials where he is considered a possible suspect.

One reference to RAY was not in its file and

one volume containing a particular serial was not located.

these references were

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

Pursuant to the mandate under which the House

Select Committee on Assassinations operates, it is

incumbent upon us to ascertain not only the individual.

culpability of those individuals possibly involved in

the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but

also the direct or indirect responsibility of any organi-

zations so involved.

Inasmuch as this portion of our

mandate does not differentiate between governmental and

non-governmental entities, the FBI is one of those

organizations whose possible complicity in the assassi-

nation of Dr. King must be examined. Such an examination

must proceed

on

• some fundamental assumptions: if James

Earl Ray killed Dr. Martin Luther King, JI., and the FBI

were involved then such involvement could have been effec-

effec-

tuated only by direct FBI agent contact with James Earl

Ray or through indirect contact by means of an FBI operative,

informant or individual with whom the FBI had some tea

of source relationship t-124

62-112292-896

In order to analyze the question of possible freut 29 1978

contact it will be necessary to interview certain FBI r

пакістУнА

agents who either were stationed at the office serving

Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri

during 1960-1967 or were involved in the unlawful flight

A prior request by this committee has sought the

agents is not yet complete, it would be helpful if the

To analyze the question of indirect FBI involve-

ment through informants, it is requested that the FBI

advise whether the enclosed lists of persons contain

the names of any FBI informant, operative or source.

In the event of an affirmative

response, it is requested

that the FBI provide the House Select Committee on Ass-

assinations with the number of informants, operatives or

sources in each of the three lists and make an attempt to

ascertain whether any such individuals would consent to

an interview by the Committee.

It is also requested that

the files on any such individual be prepared for review

The enclosed lists represent an

effort to establish priorities in what is

recognized to

be a consuming process on the part of the FBI. It is re-

quested however that this review be completed by August

15, 1978.

House Select Committee on Assassinations

U. S. House of Representatives (HSCA)

NOTE: According to referenced request, the HSCA learned, through a

report of the Department of Justice Task Force which reviewed the FBI's

investigation of King, that a series of surreptitious entries were

conducted, designed, among other purposes, to obtain information about

King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) • (U)

The New York confidential files disclosed only a summary of

information obtained from each entry.

These summaries disclosed that

entries between 1959-1964 produced information concerning King or SCLC.

Several hundred items may have been photographed during an entry, ¿but

only a few were described in the memo reporting the entry. Entries were

made at Levison's office, Room 601, 6 East 39th Street, New York City. C

(S) /

Informant symbol number involved was NY 1300-S*. According to

Special Agent David Steckler, New York Office, none of the material

obtained through contact with NY 1300-s* is retained in that informant's

file in New York. Therefore, if utilized, it is presumed all information

obtained through entries was channelized to substantive files regarding

King, SCLC, and Levison. (F)$ (C)

Since authorization for these contacts, as shown in the

confidential files of the New York Office, is subject to interpretation,

the HSCA is being referred to the conclusion contained in report of the

Department of Justice Task Force. (U)

HSCA representative, William Webb, has telephonically advised

that an expeditious reply to this request is desired. Therefore, it is

believed that no review of any substantive files be undertaken at FBI

Headquarters or the New York Office at this time to obtain additional

details regarding any King or SCLC material. We should rely solely on

review of New York Office confidential files. Therefore, it is being

suggested that the HSCA review its copies of the King and SCLC file if

additional information is wanted. (U)

This note is classified "Secret" to protect information furnished

by confidential informant reporting on Levison,C)This matter was coordinated

with D. M. Griffin, Administrative Services Division. (U)

conducied between the years 1954 to 1964 All of these contacts occurred

With respect to authorization for the above contacts, the HSCA

is referred to the "Report of the Department of Justice Task Force to

Review the F.B.I. Martin Luther King, Jt., Security and Assassination

Investigations," page 138. This report states that rBI policy at the

time of these contacts required the approval of Fleld Office requests by

Director Hoover or Associate Director Tolson, (U)

Above confidential files of the New York Field Office contain

no information concerning the use contemplated for the material obtained

through the above contacts.

However, the routine policy of the FBI, at

that time, was to direct any pertinent information to the substantive

Investigative files involved.

Therefore, it is presumed that pertinent

Information from these contacts was channelized to the King or SCLC

files and subscquently furnished to FBIIQ, either by item or in summary

It would take an exhaustive roview to attempt to locate this

material, if such was actually channelized as described. Therefore, the

ISCA may desire to refer to the King and SCLC files during the appropriate

period of the above contacts to determine if additional data regarding

the material is available.

Based upon previous requests dated November 30,

1977; January 30, 1978; and undated letter received by the FBI In February,

1978, the FBIEQ King and SCLO security files were delivered to the FiSCA.

NOTE: See Director, FBI, letter to Assistant Attorney General, Criminal

BLACK NATIONALIST - HATE GROUPS

RACIAL INTELLIGENCE

Re Los Angeles letter, 4/3/68.

Since submission of the referenced letter concerning

this program, the following significant developments have

occurred among Black Nationalist hate type groups in the

Los Angeles area.

The United Front, a militant Black Nationalist

organization composed mainly of young teenage Negroes has

• disbanded due to internal dissension.

About mid-May 1968, Reverend THOMAS KILGORE, a

opened a Southern

Christian Leadershio Conference SCIC office in Los Angeles

It appears this office was opened on a temporary basis for.

the purpose of raising funds for the Poor People's Campaign.

This activity will be closely followed and the Bureau will

be advised in the event SCLC continues to operate in the

Los Angeles area.

Personnel handling the counterintelligence program,

"US" and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

organizations have been assigned to the MURKIN special for

extensive periods during the past As days. An intensilicatior

of the counterintelligence progra

has recently been initiated

and more effective counter meas

res are expected as a

result of this effort.

Re Bureau airtel dated 3/4/68.

1.

SA FRANCIS G. KAHL has been resignated coordinator

of the counterintelligence program against Black Nationalist -

Hate Groups for the los Angeles Division.

2. The following Black Nationalist Hate type groups

are active in the los Angeles area at this time. They are

given a priority listing

; based upon an evaluation oi their

size, aims, and propensity for violence.

It is believed

that counterintelligence action should be instituted first

against those organizations heading the list.

This

barges

evaluation is based upon the opinions of

le agents handling

these organizations as well as information fron informants

in contact with these groups.

US

00a.v

01/ 2/81 -

3д.

This organization is probably the fastest

growing group in the los Angeles area.

It

has about 200 members, of which approximately

20 are considered "hard core."

The group

claims to be culturally oriented, however, its

leaders make rabble rousing

speeches

designed

to appeal to the emotions of their listeners

with suggestions of revolution and violence.

It is rated as having a potential for violence.

STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING

COMMITTEE

(SNCC)

This is

a newly reorganized and reactivated

157-1751

group with an estimated 30 members.

It is

rated as having a potential for violence based

BLACK STUDENS UNION (BSU)

This is a coïlection of college campus black

militant organizations operating on several

local college campuses with a total member-

ship of about 150.

Based on several past

acts of violence in the State of Califania

It is felt this organization has a potential

for future violence.

MUHANMAD'S TEMPLE OF ISLAM # 27

This group is a militant black nationalist

branch of the followers of ELIJAH MUHAMMED.

It has an estimated 550 members of which

approximately 100 to 125 are considered hard

core.

BLACK CONGRESS

This is a coalition of Negro organizations,

both militant and non-militant. It has

sponsored little or no activity. It

publishes a newspaper featuring articles by

various Black Nationalist extremists.

UNITED FRONT

A black nationalist organization composed mostly

of young Negro teenagers. It teaches a pro-

Mao philosophy. It has a potential for violence,

however, it appears it is in the state of collapse

que to internal dissension. Membership Is

estimated at 25, with possibly 4 or 5 hard core

members.

BLACK ANTI-DRAFT UNION

This organization is engaged mainly in

organizing resistance by Negroes

to military

service and teaching racial hate. It appears

there may be some latent potential for violence.

A small collection of individuals, no formal

BOBBY RAYFIELD WILLIAMS

Male, Negro, age 32, included in the AI because of

3. It is recommended that the US organization and

RONIE MC KINLEY EVERETT be considered for current counter-

intelligence action.

As noted previously, US is the fastest

growing group in the los Angeles area.

The members wear

colorful costumes and many have. shaved heads, which is almost

a trademark of this group.

The costumes and dress of this

group constitute a fad, and as such are especially attractive

oi the younger fad-conscious negroes.

Iu prevent the long

range growth of militant black nationalist organizations among

youth, as well as the prevention of violence, which are bah

goals oï this program, suggestions for counterintelligence

action against this group and its leader are being submitted

by separate letter.

Recommendations are being submitted by separate

letter for counterintelligence action against the local SNCC

group and its leadership because of the nationwide program

against this organization, and because it appears it may become

a collecting point for various individuals wishing to agitate,

but not now affiliated with some other organization.

Suggestions for counterintelligence action are being

submitted by separate letter recommending counterintelligence

action against the local Nation of Islam group, as a part of the

national campaign against this organization.

Concerning overall counterintelligence action,

there appears to be no effective national coalition of Black

Nationalist groups. It appears that some of the leaders fear

they might be forced out of their power

positions by potential.

leaders both from within and from outside: their organizations.

• It is suggested that every effort be made during interviews of

black nationalists to build on these fears by rumor and innuendo,

and otherwise exploit minos frictions and cifferences.. For

example, a rank and file member of the Southern Christian

interview

if there was

anything to the rumcr that StOKELY

CARMICHAEL plans force MARTIN LUTHER KING OUt of the SCIC

and take it over; or even some more plausible type of rumor.

It is felt that such activity might be useful in preventing

the formation of a coalition.

Agents assigned to work racial matters have been

fully advised of the importance of the couüerintelligence

program.

Any suggestions or ideas

will be submitted to the

Bureau for approval, in accordance with Bureau instructions.

Bureau permission is requested to put the fol-

lowing plan into action as a counterintelligence measure

against Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in

Philadelphia:

ph 897-R furnished the information in referenced

letterhead menorandun which told of a fight over money that

could amount to $200,000.

Prior to the march in Washington, Rev. JAMES

ORANGE, leader of SCLC in Philadelphia, requested help from

United Veterans for Freedom (UVF), of which RUBEN BUTLER

is the national leader and founder.

BUTLER is from Phila-

BUTLER was promised a certain percentage of the

PH 157-2371

CUTLER has approached PH 897-R and

stated he felt UVF has been robbed by SCLC because SCLC

did not give UVF any money

• in connection with the march on

Washington.

BUTLER, according to the informant, is a "loud-

nouth" and everyone in the city who will listen to BUTLER

knows of the amount, $200,000, that

supposedly was taken in by

ScuC and that BUTLER and UVF have received nothing from scLe.

BUTLER was committed to the Veterans Administration

Mental Hospital in Coatesville in September 1968, but was

released on pass and never has returned.

He has

dropped from the rolls of the Coatesville Mental Hospital and

is no longer considered AWOL.

However, officials at Coatesville have stated that

if BURLER should

be arrested for any charge, he would be

committed to the Coatesville Mental

Hospital.

Philadelphia is of the opinion that if it can be

arranged

and it is felt ii can be arranged vithout too nuch

trouble,

a confrontation should take place between ORANGE and

RUBEN BUTLER.

PH 897 may be able to arrange this confronta-

tion but he will not be present during the confrontation.

It

is felt that if the confrontation occurs. at. SCLC headquarters

In Philadelphia,, BUlLER will lose his temper, start a fight,

and the Philadelphia police will be called in.

If this occurs, BUTLER will be arrested by the

police and committed to

Coatesville Mental Hospital. The

possible resultant publicity would be detrimental to SCLC

because it would

reflect that SCLC in Philadelphia received

$200,000 for the

march on Washington and gave none of this

money as promised to UVF. Instead, when the leader of UVF

protested, SCLC had them

arrested.

Bureau permission is requested to put the above

plan into effect

immediately.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE:

By memorandum from Mir. Ryan to Mr. Bassett dated

to review files

4/27/78, approval was granted for only Mr. Blakey

of five 11 phi

of five Memphis intormants who reportec

activities of the Invaders, a Memphis youth gang.

By meno-

randum from Mr. Ryan to Mir.

Bassett dated 5/19/78, results

of this review were recorded. The purpose of this review

was to resolve the issue as to whether or not our informants

acted as agent provocateurs in connection with violence in

Hemphis at the approximate time King was assassinated. In

response to Bureau teletype 4/20/78, Memphis provided the

identities of Agents who handled these informants.

It is

believed the

HSCA should review these identities to determine

which Agents it desires to interview.

The two informants mentioned in the attached

nemorandum as agreeing to cooperate with the HstA have been

interviewed by the HSCA.

The third, BH 418-R (former

NO 1289-R), declined to be interviewed.

Washington, D.C.

Attention: MI. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This letter serves to confirm the understanding reached

between this Committee and the FBI on April 12, 1978, concerning

1) the roles the FBI informants within the Invader organization

relative to the activities of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., and

2) the possible cooperative postures of the informants who havé

provided information concerning the relationship between Klan

members and Arthur Hanes, SI., in the course of the latter's

representation of James

Earl

• Ray.

As to the Invader situation, it is understood that the

FBI will locate and sanitize the informant files of all informants

within the Invaders during 1968 and provide the Committee with

access to these files. The sanitizing process will be undertaken

only to the extent necessary to protect the identity of the in-

formants. The FBI will also provide the Committee, for interview

purposes, with the control agent or agents for these Invader

informants. This Committee, however, reserves the right to

request production of the identity of all Invader informants

during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent interviews be

i the entered , es

inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by the Committee.

As to the informants who have provided information

relative to the Klan relationship with Arthur Hanes, SI., during

the course of Hanes'

representation of James Earl Ray, it is

understood that the FBI will contact the informants listed in

the serials listed below to determine if an interview with this

Committee can be arranged:

Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

NOTE: Delay in completing response to this request was a result of

negotiations with the HSCA on 3/13/78, and 5/3/78, to determine which

Sections of the Manual were pertinent to the HSCA's investigation and

The identification and assembly of revised pages

for each Section delivered was a lengthy process. This was followed by

the necessity to coordinate excisions with all the various substantive

Divisions responsible for each Section. The HSCA was advised telephonically

concerning the status of Manual preparation and its representatives did

not express any concern regarding the length of time necessary to complete

this response.

Regarding excisions in the material delivered, the Congressional

Inquiry Unit coordinated with the following FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ)

representatives: H. N. Helterhoff, Civil Rights Section, Criminal

Investigative Division (CID); R. Connolly, Fugitive Unit, CID; M. V.

Hale and J. J. Jamar, Top Eschelon and Criminal Informant Unit, CID;

G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, ISCA, dated February 15,

1973, which, in connection with the ESCA's investigation into the

assassination of Wartin Luther King, JIa, requested delivery of certain

material from the files of FBI Headquarters (TBIHQ) •

By FBI memorandum dated March 20, 1978, you were furnished a

partial response to referenced letter and advised that a response to the

item concerning "FBI Manuals of Instruction (MOI) in use during 1962-

1968" was being prepared.

On March 13, 1978, Mr. Blakey modified the above item requesting

FBI Manuals, stating the HSCA desired only those Sections pertaining to

security informants, extremist informants, civil rights, fugitives,

murder, and conspiracy for the years, 1962-1963 and 1967-1968. It was

also agreed to provide a table of contents for the entire tanual for

these years. On May 3, 1978, ISCA representative, Peter Beeson, requested

that the Section of the lanual concerning "Assaults and Threats Against

the President" also be furnished to the ESCA.

In response to the above request, Attachment I contains the

table of contents beginning on January 1, 1962, for the entire FBI 10I,

followed by revisions for each year through 1968.

Attachment 2 contains the Base Manual for the following

After the Base Manual

throughout any given year.

Therefore, by appropriately inserting

excised pages, the HSCA can redonstruct each Section of the Manual as it

would have existed for any month or year of the ISCA's Interest, The

#SCA should note that the MOl Section concerning murder was not added as

Section 146 until June 13, 1973, and 1s, therefore, outside the period

of HSCA's Interest. The ISCA should also note that Section 23, Conspiracy,

was changed in 1964, with Section 2u becoming the Civil Rights Act of

1964 and Section 29 becoming Conspiracy, There were no revised pages

for Section 29 for the years, 1965 to 1963.

PURPOSE: To advise that Mr. G. R. Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director,

HSCA, reviewed excised copies of five files of FBI informants who provided

coverage on the Invaders, a Memphis, Tennessee, youth gang active in

1968.

159

DETAILS: By memorandum from D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett dated 4-27-78, it

17

was approved that Mr. Blakey be given access to five files of five FBI

informants who provided coverage on the Invaders. This group was

involved in violence during the Sanitation Workers Strike in Memphis

during March-April, 1968. Mr. Blakey had advised that the HSCA is

trying to resolve

the issue as to whether or not the Invaders fomented

racial violence to get King to return from Atlanta to Memphis where he

was killed and that if any of our informants acted as "agent provocateurs."

It was decided it would be in the best interest of the Bureau to allow

Mr. Blakey access to these informant files in an effort to satisfy the

HSCA that our informants were not responsible in instigating any violence

which occurred.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations

U. S. House of Representatives (HSCA)

Follwing review, Mr. Blakey stated he found no evidence that

at FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ). If, at the time of the preparation of the

HSCA's final report, a paragraph regarding this review is necessary, he

will come to EBIHQ, review his notes, and construct a paragraph to the

effect that he found no evidence that any of these informants instigated

violence. He stated he would make this paragraph available for the

FBI's review prior to inclusion in the HSCA's report to insure that

these informants are not in any way compromised. Mr. Blakey advised the

notes were necessary to serve as verification of his file review.

Mr. Blakey expressed no objections to any excisions in these

files. Notes made by Mr. Blakey will be retained in the Congressional

Inquiry Unit.
