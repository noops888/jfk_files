RE: ANTI-COMMUNIST LEGIONNAIRES

MM T-I explained that both groups are without

funds, have no immediate plans, but are very anxious to

go to Cuba to fight against the Government of Prime Minister

FIDEL CASTRO.

MM T-I explained that a number of Cuban women are

holding a sit-down strike type of demonstration in Miami's

Bayfront Park, where they have signs and placards, asking

for United Stotes and Organization of American States (DAS)

intervention.

These Cuban women maintain around-the-clock

vigilance, and

five to ten Asericans sitting wich these women, and these

Americans are trying to reccult other Americans to go to the

training camp in the everglades outside of Minni. The Americans

Bayfront Paris are dressed in United States. Aruy fatigue

suits, wear combat boots, canteen cups, and cartridge belts.

One American is seen wearing a bayonet

tied to his leg in

coumando fashion. These Americans have become a problem for

the Cuban women maintaining this vigilance, and are considered

a nuisance to both the women, the police and visitors to Miami's

Fayfront Park.

MM I-I advised that JESSE SMITH and JOE, MURPHY,

owners of the Congress Inn Hotel,

Lejeune Road, Miami,

_ Florida, have donated three rooms

in the hotel for the use

of HErNING's group, and stated they will try to get political

and financial backing for this

group.

that operate exclusively against Communists.
