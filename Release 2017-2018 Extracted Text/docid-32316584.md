Rolando Masferrer Rojas is a former

Cuban senator from the time of the Batista

regime.

He is reportedly heading a Haition

invasion attempt, which he says will

inuolve some 300 Cubans.

He has told

fellow conspirators that the central

Intelligence Agency is backing the venture.

has steadfastly denied this allegation.

The Customs Bureau has Masferrer

We are

keeping the Department aduised of all

developments in the matter.

We are not conducting active investio

and reports current developments as they

occur within the conspiracy.
