MEMORANDUM FOR MR. BUNDY

SUBJEGT: Caribbean and Other

6(4)

Here are a few items which came up while you were away and which you may

want to know about.

14.

1. BG - Greenwood's New Look - Attached at Tab l is a cable from BG reporting

on Greenwood's recent trip to BG. It is a pleasant thing to read in that it tells

V about Greenwood's growing disenchantment with Cheddi and growing admiration

for Burnahm. Even divided by half, it sounds good.

2.

P - An order to help 3Gaget rid of its

Doriteneck which is causing serious difficulties for Burnham, we are

Done mode

of working out a deal whereby BC can sell some rice to Latin America? It 1s

going to cost us $200, 000 to break tho bottleneck - 1, c., to pay the difference

between what BG has gotten from Cuba in the past and what Latin America

willing to par now.

Needless to say, this is alli quite cover A

3. Cecil King - As of possible interest, attached at Tab 2 is a cable reporting

V Del Carlson's conversation with Cecil King. King mentions a talk with Bill

Tyler and you; he also makes a strong pitch in favor of a PPP/ PNC coalition.

4 Secretary Rusk and Policy - The Secretary recently told John Crimmins

/ that he wants no new initiatives on Cuba policy for the time being. Apparently,

he wants to keep the temperature low while we are sorting out our Vietnam

problem.

5. Cuban Deals with Spain and Morocco - Cuba recently concluded long-term

e sugar agreements with Spain and Morocco. The Spanish are willing to buy sugar

at a higher price than the Russians are willing to pay (so they can sell ships),

and this especially bugs us. Some details on these two deals are at Tab 3.

7. Communications Security Survey - The BOB study group has finished with

the Ranch and has completed about 2/3 of the Washington portion of its work.

The balance should go fairly quickly in view of the fact that we recently blasted

loose the information which the group needed on the telephone system at the

" White House and EOB. The group will probably not examine the emergency

locations. There is not much there that they can usefully do and it does not

seem worth the time and effort to override Ted Clifton's objections; besides,

this less urgent task can be done at some future date.

" The group is running behind schedule (report due on March 1). They asked for

another month, and I gave it to them; I'm fairly confident they will meet the

new deadline.
