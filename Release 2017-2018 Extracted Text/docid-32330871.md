The investigative period of this report overlaps

that of the previous report due to the fact that informant

information and lead information was not available for submission

in re report.

NO 1075-C advised he told PECORA he thought the

$5,000 CIACCIO wanted for fixing his zoning problem was

NTHONY oLoGNA,t he thought he should meation this to

father-in-law of CIACCIO. NO 1075-C said he

told PECORA that they should help an old friend a little.

Source said PECORA used a group of obscene phrases in

referring contemptuously to BOLOGNA, and

source thought

this was unusual since BOLOGNA furnished PECORA with the

money to buy the Tropical in the first place.
