He and others in New Kensington, Pa., have formed the Committee

for Good Government.

Their purpose,

as a factionalist group

city officials in the election primaries.

They feel that most

of the present office holders are, in varying degrees, corrupt

"rubber stamps" for the MANNARINOS. If they are successful,

they will start by trying to suppress

racket activities with

a view towards ultimate elimination of such activities.

He

is on the Publicity Committee of the group and it is theiry

task to locate, develop and utilize information concerning

the opposition slate members.

FBI cannot furnish any information to his group or assist

it in any way but he will be alert for the development of any

information concerning activities of the MANNARINOs and their

associates which might be of interest to the FBI or other

Federal agencies.
