CONTIWING EX-I TOKED SUBJECT WAS BROUGHT EMPEDTATELY

TO MEXICO CITY AND HELD ESSENTIALLY INCOMMUNICADO AT THE OFFICE

OF THE INSPECTION SERVICE OF MEXICAN IMMIGRATION• HIS DEPORTATION

WAS BASED NOT ONLY ON THE FACT THAT THERE HAD BEEN AN ORDER

ISSUED SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER PROKIBITING HIS LEGAL ENTRY INTO

THE COUNTRY BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE HAD NO CURRENT MEXICAN

DOCUMENTATION IN HIS POSSESSION. THIS SOURCE STATED THAT

HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO, SUBJECT®S

SUBJECT CAME DIRECILY FROM THE MEXICAN MINISTER OF GOVERNMENT,
