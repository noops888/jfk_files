GABRIEL MANNARINO, aka

SAMUEL MANNARINO, aka

AR

On 3/28/61, PG 615-C advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH, III as

follows:

Recently, JO JO MANNARINO brother of SAMUEL and GABRIEL

MANNARINO, was in New Kensington, Pa, where his brothers

control all gambling and have their legitimate enterprises

headquartered.

As has been pointed out in the past,

JO JO is considered an outcast by his brothers, and

he 1s

supposed to be paid to stay away from New Kensington.

His purpose in coming to town was to obtain money, and it

was indicated that he was "broke" because of a large,

expensive party he gave in the recent past at the

Shamrock Hotel, Houston, Texas, under the name JOSEPH

MANNERS- Rumor has it that JO JO has married a midate

aged woman who has large lumber interests in either

Georgia or Alabama.

Houston is requested

to ascertain from the catering

department, Shamrock Hotel, if they can furnish any information
