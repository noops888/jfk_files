ANCCNE-2 lugan his presentation by saying he lad been asked to pole lines

and follon tactics in his propaganda that here unacceptable to him:

lie had been asked to say "arod things" about Castru.

cuuld not do as it mould represent a

"Ichtist" line that would be a dejer-

ture fron his established public position and rould constitute an abaron-

ment of his policy against

identifying himself vith any ideological line

left, center, or right.

He questioned the hision of discussing events outside of Cuba

sirce he felt constrained by the presence of military governments in

Nicaragus, Peru, lanana and Argentina that would find applause for liberal

developments offensive. He said he had been tailoring his material for

gencral ill consumption rathor than for Cuban audiences because he felt

his present najor vehiclo, Radio Libertad, was not received in Cuba.

In response ZEFPlAT suggested that ANCOPF-2's 1958-59 efforts to raise

noncy

to buy

arns and planes

for Castro and his public support for fidel in

1959-60 helied his claim to being. neuter politically. In any event, the

matter of an idcological tag was semantic - the issue was his willingness to

espouse the sane sentiments and aspirations for reform and change that he stood

for ten j'cars ago.

MICORE-2 said this voull be no problem for lim and would

pormit hin to claim a consistency of position.

ZEEPIAT explained that his

target, as for ANSTRUT-2 and all of us,

is Cuba first and foremost.

The tar-

got is a selected rather

than n. wass one.

Becnuse of this, ANCORE-2's present

vehicles, l.e. his broadcasts on MOBA and his writing for Diario

group natch very carefully what is said by persers they consider to be unoffi-

clal spokesmen

in Pliani.

These aro good starting places while we look for

additional outlets should the product warrant them.

ANCORE-2 agreed to roncw

his treatment of the theno of the betrayed revolution, criticizing events in

Cuba only in the context of when and where they "fai!

of 1959; citing examples of positive achievchent clicwhere for comparison with

the absence of conditions pernitting similar progress in Cuba; and encouraging
