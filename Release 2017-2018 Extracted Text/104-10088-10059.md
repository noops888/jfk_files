these photographs are normally reviewed

for identi

LITÁMII-9, and LITAMIL? who are penetration agents working inside

the target.

They are subsequently forwarded to the CI section of WH/SA where they are shown

to PBRUMEN intelligence defectors| AMNIP-1 and AYMUG-1.

Of those assets to whom

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-9Jhas to date made the largest number of

identifications.

The photos have proven of great value.

Within hours of the

arrival of a new ambassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the

Station;

In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns of action

(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

Because of the presence of police patrol cars in

the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the

target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

LIONION 1 1S a YOU PERUMEN LavYer TiA file. He lest PARUMEN in 1960,

planning to continue balvia Mexico to the United States where he resided in

his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer

was recruited in 1961,

as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and

operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical operation aimed at the PBRUMEN

Embassy. At this same time LIONION-1 also phased into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and

the two worked together as a team.

In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked

together in processing the take of the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MKTRAP installation,

known as LIOMN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LILILY-i

2 to LIral 22 and 23, respectively.

In the latter part of 1962 the two agents

began the present photographic surveillance operation.

LIONION-2 acts as his assistant

such times as he is absent from the observation post. Both serve

principally as observers and photographers:

LIONION-1 also acts as & dispatcher

for the LIEMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmented. Dispatching

is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not

know LIONICN-1 or his precise location. LIONION-l also processes on the premises

all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping

and mounting.

Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of

the agents, that as PBRUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might

be brought upon them by KUBARK through the Mexican goverrment should they get out

of line. Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion

to, and determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMIHUG regime.. An

additional notivating factor 1s that both agents actually enjoy what for many would

be monotonous work. Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of wori.

Both agents realize that they are working for PBPRIME intelligence; LIONION-1

appears to be aware that he is working for KUBARK.

Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls. (calls

from LIONION 1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the

LIONION-I safe apartment. This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-]

love nest, is in another ares of town.

The Station KURIOT technician,

Hugh I. FRANCOITE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week.

The Case Officer,

Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently.

Whereas LIONION-1 knows

the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican

authorities as engaged in operations against the target, they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMAVE

area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering

their incoce. This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante

with the KuRTOT automatic pulse camera on the premises. This camera is of such

refinement aed complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican

president's office.

This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,

enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any

future difficulties with Mercan authorities.
