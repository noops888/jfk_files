RE: ANTI-CASTRO ACTIVITIES

GOVERNMENT IN EXILE

In June, 1961, General MANUEL BENITEZ VALDES,

former Chief of the Cuban National Police, said that

he was working with CARLOS PRIO SOCARRAS, former

President of Cuba, and a number

of other Cuban na-

tionals in Miami who are trying to establish a cubar

Government In Exile, with PRIO as Provisional Presi

BENITEL Said that VICTOR I. ANFUSO, U. S.

Congressman,

Democrat from New York,

held a meeting in

June, 1961,

ANFUSO and a number of other U.S. Congressmen concern-

establishment of a Cuban Government in Exile and uni-

In July, 1961, BENITEL said that he and

others planned a large public meeting to be held it

Miami, wherein

ANFUSO would be invited to address

Cuban retugees and urge for mification and a Gove

PRIO was in power in Cuba, he had a corrupt and weak

government,
