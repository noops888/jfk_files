upcoming years.

In order to facilitate and coordinate our efforts, I will be sending to you, from time-

to-time, requests for additional information and records to facilitate the completion of

the ARRB's responsibilities under the JFK Act. We will be numbering these requests,

as shown above, to help us track our queries and your responses. Please do not

hesitate to contact me or Jeremy Gunn if our requests are insufficiently clear or if

they are unduly burdensome.

For our first request, we ask that you make available the following items:

(a)

Comprehensive organizational charts (or the best available substitutes)

of the following entities for the years 1958-1968:1

First, the Directorate of Plans (DDP or DD/P) including:

- Special Affairs Staff (DDP/SAS)

Task Force W

NN 53217

'We are of course aware that the names, organizational structure, and reporting

relationships of the entities identified below have changed over time. We have listed some

divisions, offices, and staffs in order to facilitate the identification of organizational charts. If

the Agency refers or referred to these entities by any other names or acronyms, we would of

course intend our request to include those other names or acronyms.

6 June 1995

NOTE FOR: THE FILE

SUBJECT: JFK Board Requests

On 5. June I called David Marwell to clarify parts of the

Board's first three requests (CIA-1,2,and 3). The following

points were made:

- Marwell will arrange to have a Board staffer screen "

the package of several hundred items provided by the

DA in response to request no. 1 The items consist

largely of HNs and HRs that describe organizations

and appointments.

This would preclude the need to

send the entire package to the Board.

Regarding requests no. 2 and 3, the reason that the

Board has asked us to provide information as to the

the present whereabouts of individuals is to help the

Board determine which names should be released.

For

example, the Board may conclude that the name of

someone who retired overtly and is living in the US

could be released, as opposed to someone who retired

under cover and lives abroad.

- If the Board wants to interview someone, a specific

request will be sent to us.

- The background information that wÃ© provide on

individuals and crypts listed in the requests is

not considered part of the "assassination record."

The information is used to assist the Board in its

review

of documents.

- On 7 June the Board will hold a "formal" meeting

to review

redactions we have recommended.

Re:

Status of Assassination Records Review Board Requests to CIA for

Additional Information and Records

Dear Barry:

I am writing to memorialize our conversation of October 1 regarding the status of

Assassination Records Review Board requests for information and records from the

CIA.

We discussed the following formal requests:

CIA-1 (Organization materials)

CLA has made records available to the Review Board. The Review Board

staff will continue its review and make recommendations to the Board

and will request further information, if necessary, from CIA. CLA needs to

do nothing further at this time.

CIA-2-5 Complete

CIA-6 (Cables and dispatches)

CIA originally informed the Review Board staff that these materials could

be made available by December; 1995. CLA now agrees to make the

records available (or to have a response) by the first of November, 1996.

CIA-7 (Histories)

Mexico City. CLA has shown the Mexico City history to Gunn. CIA will

compile the portion of the history that was shown to G. Robert Blakey,

which will be processed as an assassination record. Gunn will then.

determine whether there are any additional portions of the history that

should be added to the Blakey version. CIA will compile the "Blakey

version" as soon as possible and Gunn will promptly thereafter review the

documents.

Index. CIA has made an index available to Review Board staff and the

staff has identified certain histories that may be appropriate for review.

CIA will make available those histories that are of obvious relevance, and

will raise with Review Board staff any questions regarding the requests

where the basis for the request is unclear. CIA will begin to make

histories available on a rolling basis. Review Board has agreed to review

histories promptly once they are made available. Although it was not

discussed at our meeting, we would very much appreciate it if you would,

within the next two weeks, identify which histories you are prepared to

make available and those that CIA believes should be subject to further

discussions.

Cram's multi-volume counterintelligence history. Although Cram's

history was not specifically discussed at our meeting, the Review Board

staff understands that the history has been located and the Review Board

staff awaits its being made available.

CIA-8 (Intelligence community staff)

CIA will provide a report to the Review Board staff within two weeks.

CIA-9 (Publications and analytical materials)

The Review Board staff provided CIA with a list of certain publications as

they appear in an LBJ Library finding aid. CIA will report back on

recommended action to the Review Board promptly.

CIA-10 (Interagency source register)

CIA has compiled information responsive to the request. CIA will make

records available within two weeks.

CLA-11 (Duran's original statement)

Mr. Barry Harrelson

CIA has been unable to identify to date Duran's original statement. CLA

will make some further attempts to locate it.

CIA-12 OMWAVE materials)

CIA will begin to make materials available on a rolling basis.

With respect to the informal requests, it is our understanding that:

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Spas Raikin. The Review Board staff will

discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is locating a cable number IN 24738 (7 July 62), which is identified in record

number 1993.07.20.10.18:29:650630 (Box 34, F 22), p. 2.

CIA is inquiring into matters related to Marilyn D. Murrett. The Review Board

staff will discuss issues with CIA once the pending research is completed.

CIA is continuing to search for HTLINGUAL records, particularly those

identified in Church Committee index that was provided to CIA by Review

Board staff. CIA is prepared to provide oral briefing on HTLINGUAL.

Please let me know if you have any supplements or corrections. We would very much

like to ensure that these matters are handled expeditiously.

As always, thanks for your cooperation and assistance.

CIA should now review the DO and DS&T organizational material and

re-examine some of the proposed redactions. Several documents have been

cleared by the directorate IRO's for either release in full or release with minor

redactions." The ARRB staff will consult with CIA to determine whether these

records should be designated "assassination records" or whether they could be

made available publicly in a manner similar to the material from the 1996 Boston

trip. HRG would like to discuss this issue before the materials are formally put

(U) DO Response to Formal Request CIA #1

(U) Informal meeting of 27 February 1998, with Jeremy Gunn,

Michelle Combs, Barry Harrelson, Gary Breneman and

Eileen Wukitch regarding a request for additional information relating

to CIA #1

1. (U) In response to a request from Jeremy Gunn and Michelle Combs, attached are two

organizational charts showing the structure of the Deputy Director for Plans (DDP) in 1961 and 1963. As

noted, CIA has released the DDP structure down to the division/staff level; however, we continue to protect

the release of the structure to the branch/desk level. The data used in recreating these charts were extracted

from an official classified history of CIA.

2. (U) Regarding the request for an organizational chart of the JMWAVE facility in the 1960-1963

time frame, after thorough review and due consideration, the Agency continues to protect this information

on the reasons stated in our original response.
