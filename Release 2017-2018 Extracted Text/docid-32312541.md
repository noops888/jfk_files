The confidential source who identified the subscriber

to Los Angeles telephone number HO 7-9853 was CSIA 4178-S.

This was in connection with the activities of STEVE MEIERS at

the University of Southern California.

Agent observing RICHARD GIBSON at the Third World

Peace Fair held

on 9/10/60 at Fallsington, Pa:, was SA JAMES

J. FINLAY.

The referenced Bu airtel, 10/17/60, instructed the

NYO to furnish with this report a detailed analysis of the

witnesses available totestify to the registration act aspects

and the subversive aspects of this case.

This is being set

forth under separate cover.

This report has been divided

into two sections, first part dealing with information furnished

by sources indicating an infiltration on the part of the

SWP and affiliated organizationof the FPCC and the Communist

Party infiltration of

the Committee;

also committee associations

with organizations or individuals with a history of prior sub-

versive activity.

The second part, the registration data, deals

with interest on

the part of the Cuban Government in the FPCC

and the interviews of CHARLES SANTOS BUCH which indicate that

the Cuban Government supplied $3500.00 to pay for the original

published by the Committee in the '" New York Times", 4/6/60.

Fleld divisions where FPCC activity has

taken place

are being furnished copies of this report. It will be noted

that the SWP in particular and the CP are making heated

efforts to infiltrate and control the FPCC and have been

quite successful to date especially in NY and Chicago.

They

are also extending their activities to various universities

throughout the country in an

attempt to capture sympathy on

the part of liberal thinking students for the Cuban Revolution.

The Bureau Instructed that this investigation must be given

vigorous and continued attention. All investigation associated
