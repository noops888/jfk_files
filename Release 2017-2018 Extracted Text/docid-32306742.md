NY 92-2300

Former NY 3936-C-TE has demonstrated that he can

prepare extensive, detailed write ups on specific loans or

deals if given the opportunity to review his records.

He has recently completed a write up on the Cashmere

loan, Bufile 156-249; NY file 156-73. This write up supported

by documents and checks establishes a conspiracy to violate

given by

Title 18 Local 10. New York,

Section 1954, in regard to a letter of commitment

New York,

as well as monies loaned

to Cashmere by FRANK ZULFERINO of Local 10 and SANFORD POLLACK

of Local 875, IBI.

The direct knowledge of former NY 3936-C-TE does not

extend into that phase of this case involving the loan being

obtained from a Teamsters Union Pension Fund, although he does

have hearsay information.

STEPHEN BIRNBAUM, who participated in the early phase

of this case, has been contacted through his attorney, former

AUSA in the EDNY, resulting in their contacting AUSA MORVILLO.

MORVILLO has discussed this matter, making an offer of immunity

for BIRNBAUM. Authorization has been received from the

Department of Justice authorizing immunity for BIRNBAUM as of

3/19/68.

With the testimony of former NY 3936-C-TE and BIRNBAUM,

it is felt that a conspiracy can be established which would

involve among others ZULFERINO, POLLACK, SHIAH M. ARSHAM, TRAVIS

S. LEVY, SAM BERGER and JAMES PLUMERI (influential member ir

notorious THOMAS LUCHESE "family" of LÃ’N).

It is anticipated that the Cashmere case will be the

first one developed by the NYo utilizing information furnished

oy former NY 3936-C-TE. It is noted, however, that utilizing

information furnished by him and approaching this troe of case

on the basis of conspiracies, the potential cases anticipated

to be developed will include

the following members and fringe

associates of ICN:
