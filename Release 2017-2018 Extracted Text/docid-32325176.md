Reference is made to the FBI Laboratory Transmittal Form

directed here under date of 10/12/59, wherein it is

suggested that "additional handwritten signatures preparec

by WEINHEIMER at an extremely rapid rate of speed" might

be of "some" value in identifying the questioned signatures

of interest in this matter.

Further reference is made to the report of SA IAN D.

MAC LENNAN dated 12/2/58 at New York reflecting that

WEINHEIMER refused to submit to further interview in

this matter upon contact.

In the light. of WEINHEIMER's attitude, efforts to obtain

rapidly written signatures from him will not be undertaken

unless directed by the Bureau.
