a potential criminal informant who is well

acquainted with many of Pittsburgh's top hoodlums and who is

being utilized for coverage of the GENOVESE-LA ROCCA interests.

PG 573-0, who is extremely friendly with the GENEVESE brothers, parti-

cularly FIORE, and who is being utilized for general coverage

of the Red Eagle Club and its visitors.

a potential criminal informant who is

invimately acquainted with many Pittsburgh top hoodlums

through association with them when they began their racket

careers and who is being utilized for coverage of the GENOVESE-

NELSON interests as

well

as LA ROCCA's travel plans.

AL BUCK, former Allegheny County Detective and present Vice

President of the Fidelity Trust Company, Loan Department,

Pittsburgh, Pa., who is being utilized for his knowledge

of the

Bankers! Exchange in Pittsburgh, whereby he can obtain information

regarding bank loans made to Pittsburgh top hoodlums..

BUCK

Is also familiar with the activities of several of Pittsburgh's

top hoodlums, particularly, those of LA ROCCA, from having

worked

on criminal matters

for many years in the city of

Pittsburgh.

In an effort to increase

criminal informant coverage, efforts

will be made to persuade

to again work as a

waitress in the Red Eagle Club, formerly known as

the Genovese

Cocktail Lounge, as soon as it becomes apparent that racket

operations are again under way at the club.

The aforementioned coverage will also be extended through the

contemplated interview of

PHIL GENOVESE, the older brother of MIKE GENOVESE who is

subject's protege.

This individual could be an invaluable

potential criminal informant if the fear ostensibly surrounding

her relationship with the GENOVESE family can be overcome.
