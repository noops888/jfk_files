The sources advised that none of the above groups

had any active membership, and did not conduct meetings or

other activities in the WDC area with the exception of special

events, such as the Grito Commemoration.

The various groups were used as sponsors of the

Grito to generate interest in the event, and to insure a large

turnout. The representatives of the groups are representatives

in name only, since the organizations represented are more or

WFO 134-4179

As indicated in relet, information was received

indicating the M.D.C. was believed to be reorganizing in the

WDC area, but based on the above information,it does not appear

it has been successful to date.

The national coordinator of

the M.D.C., LAUREANO BATISTA FALLA, recently moved to the WDC

area from Miami, and, although studying for a Ph. D. at a local

university, may take

steps to organize the M.D.C. in WIC.

WFO will follow developments in this matter.

In connection with the interview program in progress

in WFO, it is pointed out that 7 individuals, owner of various

businesses in the WDC Metropolitan area, have been interviewed

for the purpose of evaluating their potential as sounges or

informants.

Thusfar, one individual, L

AmericanaDriving School, Arlington,

Virginia, appears to have

potential as a PSI. The Bureau will be advised under separate

caption in this regard.

It is also noted that on 10/20/68, a group of about

25 anti-CASTRO Subans, including women and children, assembled

in a peaceful demonstration near the White House, in protest

of the recent arrest in Miami, Florida, of ORLANDO BOSCH AVILA,

MIRR leader. VALERIO CAPOTE MORENO, self identified as WDC

area delegate of MIRR, applied for the permit and acted as

spokesman for the group.

CAPOTE is to be contacted to ascertain

the current status of MIRR in WDC.
