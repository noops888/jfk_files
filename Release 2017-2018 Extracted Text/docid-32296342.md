Philadelphia Airtel to the Bureau dated 12/20/62 of the same

caption, all setting forth information furnished by PH-599-PC.

It is pointed out that PH-599-PC has been reported

by numerous informants and sources to have been a member of

"The Organization" for many years and to have been involved.

in Organization executions. It is recalled that this Infor-

mant was reported by some sources to be a member of the

Organization during the

"CAPGA" Investigation, which took

place shortly after the mid-1940's.

It is also pointed out

that this Informant was reported to have been involved as

one of the killers in an Organization execution which took

place during late 1940.

It is not known if he was a member

at that time; however, it is quite possible that if he was -

not a member, he was admitted possibly following this parti-

cular execution.

The Informant (as with other members

the Organization) considers "respect" to be highly signifi-

cant and desirable and definitely considers himself to be

above the average criminal, although he freely admits that

he has been involved in criminal activities throughout his

adult life.

The contacting Agent has been acquainted with the

Informant since approximately 1950, when he was first con-

tacted in connection with the

"TENUCA" investigation.

apparently has some personal respect for the contacting Agent,

having made that evident during the contacts by his conv√©rsa-

tion and, also, by the amount of information that he has

furnished to date. It is pointed out, however, that although

each contact appears to improve his relationship with the

Agent and his Inclination to talk more freely, nevertheless,

the interviews continue to be very carefully planned in order

to develop the information without asking direct questions.

It is considered vitally important to the ultimate develop-

ment of this Informant to,

at the present time, avoid asking

direct questions that would make it inescapable that he is

considered as an informant.

It is also pointed out that security of contact

with this individual must be considered most seriously.

He

is Incarcerated and it is not considered desirable to con-

tact him any more frequently than every three months.

Even

these contacts should be on more or less irregular intervals.

In an effort to avoid pinpointing the Informant during visits

to the prison, other hardened convicts who have been known to

the Agent for

a number of years are contacted and maintained

in general conversation, in order that they will discuss this

fact with other inmates

and reduce the significance of the

contacts.

It is important to impress upon the Informant that

consideration is given to his security, particularly since

associates in the Organization are exerting considerable poli-

tical pressure to cause him to be released on parole in the

near future. If he feels the contacting Agent is careless in

this regard, he may well refuse to make meetings after he is

released from prison.

In view of the above, it is not considered desirable

to recontact PH-599-PC at the present time, particularly when

it is considered that he was contacted on December 18, 1962,

as reflected by information in the last-mentioned reference

above.

If still desired by the Bureau, efforts will be made

to set up an appropriate interview in approximately one month

and efforts will be made by steering the conversation to de-

velop as much of the information as possible with regard to

the request in Bureau letter 1/8/63.

It is noted that some

information concerning present and past restrictions on mem-

bers joining the Organization is set forth in Philadelphia
