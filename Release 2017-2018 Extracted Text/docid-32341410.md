whether there an "anything new concerning the telegra te Washington,"

The guard cheeked and then told OSVALD that & request had been sent, but

nothing had as yet been received.

(MEXT 6453, 9 October 1963) The FBI 11aison

2. KOSTINOV as an identified KOB officer.

He was a case officer in eu

[.* BEKRINEV, in a top sceret lecture to a Coviet Military Intelligence course

at Mlitary-Diplontic Noadeny, 1960, said,

"Case officers who use as cover, let us sat, the Soviet Trade

Representation, TASS or Sovinforabaro, can une their cover

assigmento as bachetopping for non-clendestine meetinge with

certain agente those particuler activities officially associate

then with the previously mentioned Soviet Institutions.

However,

such non-clendentime meetings within a legal residency should be

restricted so a minimun both as to place ond time. Meetings of

this type should be carried out only in exceptional cases vith

tested and reliable agents in order to avoid provocation by the

local counterintelligence service againat the Soviet installation

being usad as cover:

Such metings are hold as a rule in the work

offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

It lo necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that

they do not attreet the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt

and transittal of intellicence matters, properly camouflaged, be

carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, mensures against

tapping nust be taken.

One wust bear in mind that a neeting vith

persons outalde official premises and during non-working hours usually

significa a relationship

beyond official matters,"

betwen the to parties that in above and

Also, such contact in offsetal installation may be caused by the agent's own

carolessness, Again Admiral BARRENDY speaka:

"Come agents,

becaune of inexperience or because of deliberate

violation of the rules of security through peculiar perconal

realness, approsched our case officers at places not stizulated

as operationel meeting sites, others telephoned the cose officer st

ALeo, such contact 1n official Intallationa nay be caused by the agent's own

"Somo agento, because of inexperience or because of deliberate
