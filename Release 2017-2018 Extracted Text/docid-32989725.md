Assistant Directors Wannall and Mintz and Section Chief Cregar

had with Attorney General (AG) Levi on 10/6/75.

As a result of telephonic instructions received

from AG Levi on the evening of 10/4/75, approximately 30

employees of the Intelligence and Files and Communications

Divisions worked all day Sunday, 10/5/75, in an effort to

develop a list of all electronic surveillances conducted by

the FBI from 1/1/70 through 6/30/75, as well as recovering)

all supportive documents underlying requests for these

electronic surveillances. The list and supportive document.

were to be delivered to the AG's office at 9:00 a.m., on

10/6/75.

At approximately 9:00 a.m., 10/6/75, Messrs. Wannall,

Mintz and Cregar met with the AG and

provided him with the

list he requested, as well as approximately 30 percent of the

supportive documents we were able to uncover during a 10-hour

meeting at the White House for 10:00 a.m., that morning and

planned to take the list provided to him by the FBI with him.

He did indicate that it was not his intention at this time

to give the White House or Congressman Pike, Chairman of the

House Select Committee (HSC). who was to be

Memorandum to Mr. W. R: Wannall

Re: Houstudy 75

62-116395

11604664

The AG confirmed that he had not given either the

White House or Congressman Pike copies of the list prepared

by the Bureau. He did say, however, that as a result of the

White House meeting he desired the Bureau to do the following:

1. Arrange for a briefing of selected members of

the HSC on electronic surveillances and break-ins.

We have already briefed the Church Committee

on this same subject and are prepared to provide

such a briefing to the HSC as soon as á date

can be set.

2. Prepare a chart reflecting the number of

electronic surveillances conducted by the Bureau during the

period 1/1/70 through 6/30/75. broken down into various

categories previously established by the AG.

This project is already underway and we

anticipate the chart will be ready for

delivery to the AG by 10/9/75.

3. The Intelligence Division continue to recover

all supportive documents underlying the request for electronic

surveillances and excise them in order that they can be

delivered to the House Select Committee.

This is an extremely time-consuming job.

On Sunday, 10/5/75, we had 10 Agents searching,

reviewing and Xeroxing the supportive documents

that the AG had requested. We have completed

approximately 30 percent of that project. We

are currently in the process of locating anc

Xeroxino all remaining supportive documents

The Attorney General stated he arranged for the

demands made by Congressman Pike for information immediately

and that he felt it was necessary to follow up the briefing

with

material as soon as possible and, if necessary, on a piece-

we are proceeding as rapidly as possible to comply with the

It should be noted, however, that in complying

to wide furnishing to the ISC more information and/or

material than has been furnished to the Senate Select Committee (SSC)

with respect to these specific areas.

ACTION:

(1) It is recommended that in the day-to-day liaison

between our Office of Legal Counsel and Mr. Shaheen of the

Department efforts be continued to establish working rules

for the HSC similar to those established for the SSC.

We will continue in this effort;

nowever, the Committee has been

unusilling to agree to such rules

(2) We will proceed with the briefing of select

members of the HSC and with the compilation of the material

which the Attorney General has instructed be turned over to

the HSC. The chart which we have been asked to develop

will be submitted for the Director's approval and the excised

supportive documents will be forwarded to the HSC in accordance

with previously approved procedures.

The Bureau has been receiving numerous requests from

the House and Senate Select Committees.

As an indication of

the number of requests being received, on September. 3, 1975,

we received four requests from the. House Committee alone.

Many of the requests involve complex research and review of

sureau materials, etc.

We have recently experienced continu

ing pressure by both Committees to comply with their requests

as quickly as possible. Additionally,

we have received In

dividual telephonic requests from Staff personnel of the

Committees to expedite one particular request ahead of another;

and in many instances,

the request for expeditious handling of

a particular item conflicts with the request of some other Staff

mittee that it is not possible to comply with their requests

within the stated deadlines.

While every effort is being made

to abide by the guidelines adopted by the Department and the

the shear volume of the material requested and the

work involved makes compliance with these

guidelines not

possible.

In a subsequent conversation with Staff Member Mark

requests.

He indicated that he would take steps to make

sure individual Staff Members do not on their own initiative

attempt to place their request ahead of any other particular

request without coordinating it with him.

Additionally, he

stated it was his intention to bring this to the attention of

John Elliff,

Task Force Director of the Domestic Task Force of

the Senate Select Committee, and suggest a meeting be held with

Bureau representatives on Monday, 9/8/75, in an effort to solve

this particular problem.

If a meeting is held on that date, it

is expected that a representative of the Intelligence Division,

Legal Counsel Division and the Department will be in attendance.

The Attorney

General, according to information furnished

SA Paul V. Daly

of this Division the evening of 9/29/75, desired to know the

accuracy of the House Select Committee document alleging non-

comp-lance with written requests.

Blackhurst and Shaheen

informed the Attorney General and Marsh that the Bureau was

in compliance with requests with the exception that at the A

instructions of the Department classified material was being

withheld from the Committee.

Blackhurst requested on 9/29/75

that the Bureau review the

attached House Select Committee

document and determine whether in fact the Bureau is in re-

ceipt of any requests that are outstanding pertaining to

these six numbered items listed on that document.

In conjunction with the Intelligence DivIsion, a

review was made of the six items listed on the House Select

Committee document entitled "Noncompliance with Written Re-

The Départment,

as is set forth in my memorandum of 8/22/75, instructed that

the Committee was not to be

given delivery of material relating

to Martin Luther King, JI., or the 1964 Democratic National Con-

vention nor were they

the Committee requesting delivery of all documents which have

. been furnished the Senate Select Committee to be interpreted

so as to not make available those documents furnished the

Senate Select Committee after the date of their letter.

respect to the Huston Plan documents, these documents were not

delivered to the Senate Select Committee until 8/5/75 and thus

were after the July 22nd date and, therefore, have not been fur-

nished the House Select Committee.

With respect to the remaining four items. listed in the

House Select Committee document, we can find no record of the

House Select Committee having made such a request nor can the De-

partment in their records.

Blackhurst was advised of the aforementioned information

'concerning the Bureau's review of House Select Committee requests.

He stated that Marsh advised the Attorney General that the Depart-

dated 9/15/13

wherein it was stated that Steven Blackhurst,

Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination in the

Department, telephonically advised on 9/15/75, that the Depart

ment had been instructed by James Wilderotter,

Counsel to the President, not to furnish any classitied

material to the House Select Committee on Intelligence (HSCY

On 10/3/75, Mr. Blackhurst advised SAs Elmer W.

Larson, Jr., and Andrew J. Duffin that The White House has

subsequently advised the Department that the instructions

given on 9/15/75 are no longer valid and the HSC is now to

receive classified material.

He noted that certain material

that the Department was withholding from the HSC which had

previously been furnished by the Bureau, has now been passed

to the HSC.

In addition, on 10/3/75, Mr. Blackhurst conferred

with sAs Larson and Duffin concerning the lack of ground

rules existing with the HSC, as are in ettect with the soc.

Due to the absence of basic ground rules with the

HSC, It was agreed upon that any materials prepared by the

Bureau for either access or delivery to the HSC should have

all sources excised therefrom including the identities of any

persons where implied confidentialit might exist.

Should

the HSC request the identity of a specific individual subsequent

to reviewing or receiving any material,

will be followed:

the following proce

REC-43.

1) If the individual is a confidentialbarinarticular

sensitive source, either current or former, whose identity

would require concealment, the HSC will be advisedthrough

the Department that the identity cannot be revealed.

2) Should the person be an individual who has

previously requested confidentiality or where there is an

implied confidential arrangement, this individual will be

contacted and advised that the HSC has requested his specific

identity. Subsequent to this, if the individual has indicated

he desires to remain confidential, the HSC will be advised

through Department that his identity cannot be revealed. On

the other hand, if the individual advised that his identity

may be furnished to the HSC, same will be done.

It is noted that this is the position previously

taken by the Attorney General and agreed to by Director Kelley

in connection with a prior confrontation in this area involving

Ithe Senate Select Committee.

Mr. Blackhurst advised that he does not anticipate

the HSC requesting the identities of many excised sources.

please prepare an appropriate response.

The HSC staff is apparently trying to determine whether

all persons on the ADEX are properly on that list in light of

ADEX with which to work and also to show the members of the

Committee.

If it would be harmful for the ADEX to be delivered

to the HSC, please have someone call me immediately to discuss

the reasons for not providing it.

this Bureau's operation of proprietaries.

DETAILS:

By letter dated 8/19/75, HSC requested a list of

all proprietaries maintained by the FBI, as well as infor-

mation concerning their operation. By letter to the Attorney

General dated 9/10/75, with enclosed letter to Congressman

* oph ariosed

Pike, HSC Chairman, the Director pointed out the sensitive

nature of such operations and oftered to fife with Congressman

Pike and discuss with him the operation of

(two deal with national security and four in the organized

crime field) currently being operated by this Bureau.*

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

62-116464

Congressman Pike because of the restriction imposed about

that time concerning the furnishing of classified information

to the HSC. Upon removal of this restriction, the letter

was

not "forwarded by the Department in view of Congressman

Pike's expressed opposition to being the sole recipient of

information furnished by the intelligencé community in response

to HSC inquiries. '

The purpose of this meeting, therefore,

was to arrive at some arrangement by which the HSC inquiry

into this sensitive field could be satisfied while at the same

time protecting this Bureau's interests.

At the meeting, Mr. Hughes proposed that he be

briefed in general terms concerning this Bureau's operation

of proprietaries.

He stated at this time the HSC is not

interested in specifics but is interested in ascertaining

Ithe field of this Bureau's operations maintaining proprietaries.

Concerning each proprietary, he would like to learn the

general area of the country

in which it is located, its

purpose, how it is operated with regard to personnel and

organizational set up, initial cost factor, handling of

profits resulting therefrom and reporting of financial aspects

of such operations to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

In response to questions from Bureau redresentatives,

Mr. Hughes advised that, upon receiving such infosmation, he

would, in turn, similarly brief House Committee Members.

This information would also be made available to HSC Staff

Members having a need to know. He also advised

that the HSC

"reserves the right anytime after the briefing to make specific

inquiries concerning any of these operations should it be

decided by the HSC that such a need exists. Mr. Hughes was

advised by Bureau representatives that approval would be sought

to furnish him with the requested briefing but the Bureau views

the operation of proprietaries in the same light as it views

the identity of informants and it is felt that this Bureau

would resist the furnishing of any specific information which

could in any way prejudice these sensitive operations.

Mr. Blackhurst advised that he saw no objection to the

briefing under guidelines set forth above, and should additional

specific inquiries be forthcoming, that problem could be

addressed at

that time. Mr. Hughes concluded by stating he

would appreciate ascertaining by 10/9//5 whether or not he

would be afforded the briefing as requested and, if affirma-

the baten by

tive, that the briefing be arranged for early in the week of

10/13/75.

OBSERVATIONS:

From the comments made by Mr. Hughes, it is apparent

that the primary HSC interest in proprietaries is the financial

aspects principally as it pertains to funds received from the

disposal of goods or services offered and the manner in which

reports are being made, if any, to ... IRS concerning such

operations. It can be fully expected after the briefing

that additional specific inquiries will be forthcoming

concerning at least some of these proprietaries so that HSC

can verify the information provided. It is felt that the

Bureau at this time should comply with the HSC request for a

briefing in general terms (using a code or acronym to identify

each proprietary) to display to the HSC a cooperative attitude

as long as current Bureau operations are not adversely affected.

Should additional requests be forthcoming for specific infor-

mation which would tend to identify or prejudice any of these

operations, it is felt that the Director should assume the

same posture as he did concerning his refusal to disclose

the identity of current sources and the matter then be referred

to the Attorney General for adjudication.

NOTE:

SUCHE

A survey of Section Chiefs by SA James.F. Johnson,

Intelligence Division indicated two proprietaries (businesses)

are maintained; code name cases Korsaj and Toolup are maintained

in conjunction with the Orkid case. Orkid is code name for

our program to technically penetrate the new Soviet

Highview Towers, 2700 Wisconsin Avenue, Northwest, Washington,

D. C. Toolup is code name for the rented test facilities for

equipment and techniques being developed under the Orkid program.

The facilities are located at 2301 and 2361 South Jefferson Davis

Highway, Arlington, Virginia.

Senstudy Representative SA J. William Hines, General

Investigative Division advised no proprietaries are currently

being maintained.

A survey by Senstudy Representative John E. McHale

indicates the Special Investigative Division is currently

conducting four proprietary operations in the field of organized

crime, which, to date, have cost a total of $44,000 in building

,and equipment rental, utility and freight employees, the pu chase

oi difice supplies,

property inventory, etc. (some of which will

be recoverable at the conclusion of the investigations).

These are active ongoing cases, the disclosure of such

information could result in physical harm to individuals involved.

A briefing in general terminology on these

operations is being

prepared.

The FBI has also assisted a number of state and local

agencies utilizing their own funds and/or grants from the Law

Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA) •

The only such proprietary currently in operation has

been called to the attention of the Department in the cover letter.

This operation is primarily funded by LEAA,

Appropriate briefing material will be prepared by

representatives of interested Divisions, upon notification this

procedure is acceptable to uSC.

this Bureau's response to requests contalned in HSC letter dated

September 2, 1975.

The subject matter of this particular request concerns,

this Bureau's investigacion into an interception of communication

violacion which allegedly occurred at the Spencer, West Virginia,

Post Office. House Resolution 591, Which created the H5C,

apparently restricts its authority

insofar as an inguiry is

concerned to intelligence operations.

In view of this, it would

not appeaz appropriate for this Committee co inquire into

criminal investigations conducted by this Bureau, such as the

investigation into the matter contained in the enclosed letterhead

memorandum. We request that the Department make a determination

as to whether the enclosed letterhead memorandum should be

disseminated to the HSC.

This Information concerning the tape recorder.

ot HAMILTON's extension phone was brought to PROFIT's atten

tionly the Post Office janitor, DENVER GANDEE, who resides

in the Cemetery Hill area of Spencer, W. Vai

This listening device or tape recorder, which was

connected to HAMILION's excension phone in the Post Office

by HAMILTON,, enabled HAMILTON to overhear or tape corversa

tions between employees of the Post Office and individuals: who

night call

these post office employees during their schedled:

employment periods,

PROFIT gave little thought to thismatter

at first but then realized that if Me. HAMILTON were in a

position to intercept telehone conversations between employees

of te Post Office and other persons calling these employeess

this type of activity could prove embarrassing to the Post

Office employee involved and also embarrassing to the other

person calling., He also realized that some of the conversa-

tIons might be of a contidential nature and reasoned that ME.

HAMILTON would be interfering with a person*s privacy if

this interception of telephone: calls at the Spencer Post.

Office was allowed to contime.

PROFITT first realized the serionaness of the

sizuation when another employee of the Spencer Post Office,

TINY 26A 19445cr

discussed this matter with PROFITT on Friday,

RAY mentioned to PROFITT that he had received

two telephone calls, which RAY considered extremely confidential;

the other from RAY's wife's doctor, at which time, the dis

cussion was concerning the possibility that RAY's wife was on

the verge of a nervous breakdown, which was indicated as a

reason for her present hospital confinement.

PROFITT decided to complain to authorities regarding

HAMILTON's activity of intercepting telephone calls made to the

Spencer Post Office as PROFITT considers himself to be the

-*

"activist" of the "group.

PROFITT observed HAMILTON's extension telephone,

located in HAMILTON's office on his desk approximately a dozen

times over a pariod of approximately one and a halt weeks. this

period being during the "20's" of July, 1974.

On each occasion,

he observed

that the phone box,

locaied on the floor beside

HAMILTON's- desk, was opened and connected to this phone appa

ratus was a tape machine described as real-to reel and compact.:

PROFITT was not able to furnish the model name of the tape

recorder. He recalls observing four screws exposed on the

telephone apparatus and recalls that the tape machine was

connected to these screws.

He recalls that there appeared to

be a magnet of some sort used on the receiver.

¿ROFITI

remarked that he had determined HAMILTON had rigged this

machine to this telephone extension box by himself, and that

he had done so previously.

PROFITI remarked that the other telephone extension

to this one talephone line into the post office is located in

the Post Office Workroom on the desk of the Assistant. Post

Master®

Mr. PROFITT continued his remarks by stating, that.

HAMILTON had never informed PROFITT or the other employees:

of the Post Office that this tape recorder had been installed

On HAMILTON's extension phone.

PROFITT does not recall that

PROFITT further advised that ME. HAMILTON disconnected

the tape recorder from his extension phone box on August 7, 1974,

as it was on this date that HAMILTON received a telephone call

from the Charleston, We Vass

"Gazette" newspaper, concerning

; this

matter.

When HAMILTON disconnected the apparatus; Assistant Post

Master WILLIAM P, WELLS waS in HAMILTON'S office and obsezred

HAMILTON disconnecting the tape recorder.

PROFITI remarked that he had complained concerning

HAMILTON's activity of intercepting phone calls at the:

Spencer Post Office to the telophone company at Spencer and was

advised that this type of activity on the part of HAMILTON was:

1llegal and that the apparatus placed by HAMILTON on bas exten-

sion phone should be removed.

lesser position at tbe Post Diflee

PROFITI stated that. he had

been a vindow teller

but was renoved iron this position by

'HAMILION whEn PROFITT's cash drawer checked over in the amount

of approximately $39. PROFITT accuses HANISTON of "padding"

his cash drawer so that HAMILTON could remove PROFITT Erom the

window teller's position.

PROFITI also admits that there is.

a personality conflict between him and HAMILTON, but stated

this in no way detracis from the fact that HAMILTON is in vio

On August 9, 1974, U.S. Attorney JON A: FIELD, III,

Charleston, advised that he

anticipated he will decline

prosecution in this matter; however, he indicated that

an interview with Postmaster HAMILTON wight be in order

before he renders a final opinion.

In August 7, 1974, an article appeared in the

"Charleston Gazette, "

A maiz clerk, HERBERT PROFITT, Spencer, V. Va.,

contacted the "Charleston Gazette" concerning his

boss taping.

telephone conversations out of the U.S, Post Office at

spencer.

Postmaster FREDERICK "RICK" HAMILTON acknowledged

he had tape recorder installed on the single line into the •

Post Office, but said he did so as a defense mechanism.

HAMILTON said he did monitor some calls but has since

dismantled the system.

He said he established the nonitoring

system because of some internal problems in the postal system

which involved hinself and Postmaster of another Post office

in Northern West Virginia, indicating, "There was a lot

animosity involved and I expected to get a lot of 11ak.,,0%.

HAMILTON said the only time a call was taped was when

he was in his office and as soon as he discovered it wasn't

the one he wanted, FAMILTON shut the recorder off. HAMILION

explained that PROFITT had been a troublesome employee who

doesn't get along with the other staff members, as PROFITT

had been disgruntled since he

(HAMILTON) was chosen..

Postmaster two years ago rather than PROFITI..

UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING

5.

The presentation of basic crime dats to the public helps get the very

necessary public support needed for successiul law enforcement work.

A comparison of crime increases with population increases may be of

in supporting requests for increased appropriatiors.

Similarly, if the police strength is below

the average, this can be shown

in requesting more personiel.

Such averages are available only through

the cooperation of law enforcement agencies in the uniforn crime reporting

9.

The sheriff and the

chief of police in facing re-election or reappoint-

ment each needs facts to show that his administration has been efficient.

Contributing crime data to a national clearing house is a mark of an up-

to-date progressive organization.

If the chief or sherill says

that he has no crime or few crimes to. report,

he should be proud

‚to have such a record on filé."

If there is no one

on duty at headquarters to record complaints or no

office is maintained, encourage members of the agency to make

to later record their

notes in an office record, such as "Register of

Offenses Known."

In the absence of other data the Bureau needs the number

of offenses (column 4 of Return A) and a very minimum procedure would be

for notes to

be kept on a tally sheet during the month.

Under such

ircumstances, the adency will not average one offense daily.

It is customary fur most offenses of the types on' Return A to be prosecuted

in the courts of the county and so persons arrested by police are often

turned over

to the sheriff.

Also, in small towns or oities the sheriff

or state police may assist in or handle entirely the investigation of

certain crimes and the police may limit their activities almost to traffic

matters.

In either situation, we need a report from the police.

The

police will or can know about

a crime in their town even though

they "don't

handle it."

The reports of sheriffs or

state police are linited to crimes

in rural areas outside of urban places (incorporated places with 2,500 or

more inhabitants).

So, we need a report from the urban police or their

community will not be represented in our coverage.

&S

C. POLICY

1.

Obstruction of justice and criminal investigations.

Fall details of complaints must be furnished the Bureau expeditiously to-

gether with action being taken or recommended.

Although USA ordinarily

advised of all complaints,

if,

in sound judgement of sAl, circumstances of

complaint or lacts developed through investigation make it inadvisable to

consult USA or to follow course desired by him, advise Bureau and

take no further action pending Bureau instructions.

ano

SAC may authorize investigation on request of USA or Federal judge in

following situations:

(1)

If obstruction

arose from case investigated by FBI.

Add Obstruc-

tion of Justice

to character of case and do not open separate

file.

(2)

If obstruction arose from criminal case within jurisdiction of

any federal agency other than Secret Service

Internal Revenue

Inmigration and Naturalization Service, lU. S. Customs

Service, IDrug Inforcement Administration, Bureau of Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms, and U. S. Postal Service.

(3)

If obstruction involves either actual. bodily harm or threat

thereof to a Federal judge or Federal juror, regardless of case

out of which allegation arose.

(4)

If obstruction arose from civil case in Federal court in which

neither U. S. Government nor any agency thereof is involved.

b.

Prior Bureau authority is required where offense arose from:

Trial in which original investigation conducted by one of above

mentioned agencies.

Proceedings before

departments, agencies, and committees.

controversy or other matter affecting national security.

If obstruction arose from case within jurisdiction of seven agencies men-

tioned

above, it is position of Bureau

and Department of Justice that

obstruction investigation

should be conducted by the other agency although

coverage of leads in a distant area to assist the other agency may be

•authorized by Bureau upon full justification.

2.

Before instituting authorized investigation related to trial in progress

or about to begin, the USA must assure that the judge has been informed

and is agreeable to investigation.

Authority of USA and judge is necessary

•for intertiews with witnesses or

view

jurors in a pending trial.

It

an inter-

with a

juror in a pending trial is requested,

attention of the judde

and USA should be directed to Supreme Court decisions in Remmer v. U

347 U. S. 227, 350 U. S. 377; and Gold T. U. S., 352 U. S. 985 (1957) 5.,

Tactfully inform them

that in light of the Supreme Court's opinion in

above cases, USA may desire to discuss

the matter with

the Criminal Divi-

sion of the

Department for clearance of investigation.

Obstruction of court orders

Obstruction of court order complaints or requests for investigation

should be referred to the Bureau by telephone,

teletype, airtel, or AMSD

letter, depending upon the urgency of the particular situation.

Department has instructed USAs not

to request FBI investigation or initiate

prosecution of obstruction of court örders without departmental authority.

Immediately advise the Bureau of any request for investigation with your

recommendation as to whether investigation should be conducted. Conduct

no investigation without Bureau authority.

D. • INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURE

1.

Statutes treated in this chapter are designed to protect the dignity of

courts and prevent corruption and obstruotion in the administration of

justice.

Prosecutions in such cases generally result in widespread public

notice and editorial comment. Intestigation and testimony of Agents

must be of such caliber that credit will be reflected on the Bureau.

2.

Status of

an individual as

a person covered by the

statutes may be

through

introduction by competent witnesses of letters

of appointment, official records of the court, subpoenas,

summonses,

jury panels,

and similar documents.

Such records can generally be

located in the offices of Government agencies,

clerks of court, U.S.

[Magistrates, land U. S. Marshals.

The exact time when a person received

appointment

or was served with a subpoena or summons should be reported.

If investigations involving witnesses or jurors indicate

perjury,

violations should be fully developed.

Question victims closely for complete details.

Threats or use of

force may

been preceded by other acts by

subject, such as

conversations, gratuities, and advice extended to victim in a disguised

effort to curry his favor.

Obtain signed statements where possible

from victim

and witnesses, and USA should be advised of any reluctance

testify.

ha's no statutory authority to afford "protection" to persons

affected by these

statutes.

When such persons

request protection,

they should be referred to

These persons frequently appear at

Bureau offices to gain "moral support" and should be treated with

consideration.

When victim fears physical harm, appropriate local

enforcement agency should be informed unless facts of case

indicate this action undesirable.

Trace threatening letters or other communications to the accused by

examinations of handwriting, typewriting, checks of hotel records, and

such other means as are available.

In event the communication is

directed to or received by a person other than the intended victim,

the relationship of the recipient to the victim should be shown,

since under statute a violation may exist even if victim is not direct

recipient of communication. Determine exact language of communication

and all attending circumstances as it may be necessary to introduce

evidence that a

communication,

although veiled, actually implies a

threat.

Follow instructions relative to transmittal. of extortion

letters to FBI Laboratory in the transmittal of letters constituting

possible violations of obstruction of justice statutes.

Determine the particular interest of subject in the outcome of a trial

or other proceeding.

subject's relationship by blood or marriage to

parties to a suit,

his membership in an interested organization,

monetary considerations may

explain his actions.

Determination

identities of persons who stand to gain from the particular outcome of.

PERIOD OF MARTIAL LAW

It is further agreed that when a state of martial law has been de-

clared by the President, the arned forces commander will assume respon-

His authority to diract

and control the subscribing agencies of the armed forces will be limited

only by such instructions as he may receive fron the Secretary of Defense.

He will have authority to coordinate the intelligence activities of the

subscribing agencies in his area of responsibility, within the linits of

their available personnel and facilities, by the assignment of missions,

the designation of objectives, and the exercise of such coordinating control

as he deems necessary. He is not authorised to control the administration

or discipline of the subscribing agencies in the area of his responsibility,

nor to issue instructions to them beyond those necessary for the purposes

stated above.

"APPENDIX B

PERIODS OF PREDOMINANT MILITARY'

INTERESTS, NOT INVOLVING MARTIAI LAW

In time of war certain areas will come into prominence as potential

theaters of operation. When an armed forces commander of such a potential

theater is designated, he definitely has interest in, though not control of,

the civilian life within the area.

In order that the armed forces conmander

may prepare himself for the discharge of the possible responsibility which

may affix to hin, the following procedure is agreed upon:

"I. Agents of the FBI; of ONI; ID, Army; and the OSI, IG, U.S. Air

Force will continue to function in accordance with the provisions of Sections

II, III, IV, and V.

12. In addition thereto, the arned forces commander may take steps

to analyze the facilities existing and to explore the manner in which com-

plete coverage will be obtained if martial law is declared. Adequate liaison

with the other subscribing agencies will insure that the armed forces commander

will have the benefit of the experience, judgment and knowledge of the repre-

sentatives of the other agencies.

13. The armed forces commander is authorized to request and receive

such information from the other three agencies as he may desire and they. may

be able to furnigh.

"II.

The analysis and exploration referred to above will show the coverage

furnished by each of the subscribing agencies and any additional coverage each

subscribing agency can undertake.

When the commander feels that more complete

coverage is required, it is recognized that he is authorized to augment the

coverage with such elements of the subscribing agencies as are under his

jurisdiction. Prior to any invasion of the spheres normally coming under

the cognizance of the other subscribing agencies, the armed forces commander

should obtain the necessary authority from the Secretary of Defense.

"III. Irrespective of the fact that the preceding recommendations have

placed the initiative in the hands of the armed forces commander, whenever

any of the other services feel that such a survey to determine adequacy of

coverage should be undertaken, it should be so recommended."

(1) Instructions

The major differences between the foregoing Delimitations Agreement

and previous versions are as follows:

The Director, OSI, USAF, is a party thereto.

The Bureau has jurisdiction over all civilians insofar as espionage,

counterespionage, subversion and sabotage are concerned, regardless of em-

ployment.

INVESTIGATION OF FEDERAL GAMBLING VIOLATIONS

for investigative jurisdiction for FBI and Internal Revenue

Service (IRS)

• In order to eliminate, where possible, a duplication of investigative

effort and to insure

greater exchange of information between

FBI and IRS, the Department has drawn up a set of guidelines regarding

investigative jurisdiction of

Federal gambling violations; namely,

the interstate transmission of wagering information, interstate transpor-

tation in aid of racketeering, and interstate transportation of wagering

paraphernalia statutes.

In the majority of cases that we investigate

under these statutes, IRS,

from the nature of the wagering tax laws,

have an interest also.

The following guidelines are to be utilized

both agencies in such

these guidelines by the Department.

"Guidelines Regarding Investigative Jurisdiction

"In order to minimize any duplication in investigative effort between

IRS and FBI field offices investigating potential violations of the

wagering tax laws and the new

appear appropriate.

The FBI and the IRS will continue to exchange current information

regarding gambling operations which have come to the attention of each

agency.

volation of the anti-gambling statutes or wagering tax laws, the FBI and

the IRs will notify each other prior to commencing an investigation

involving such statutes within their respective jurisdictions.

investigations involve

a taxpayer who is a subject of interest to the

Organized

Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division, the

responsible Department of Justice attorney will also be notified.

If such notification reveals an apparent duplication of investigative

appropriate representatives of the FBI and the IRS in the field

will meet to assign responsibility for the investigation intolved to the

agency whose investigation has the best potential for prosecution, depending

the Federal statutes apparently involved and all the relevant inves-

tigative circumstances.

Where it is deemed mutually desirable by the

agencies, preliminary investigation might be appropriately conducted prior

to any assignment of responsibility for the investigation to a single

assignment of responsibility for a particular investigation,

the matter

should be resolved after discussion with

the responsible United States

Attorney or Department of Justice attorney.

Where statutory violations within the jurisdiction of the other

agency become apparent in the middle or later stages

of an investigation

being conducted by either the IRS or the FBI,

the agency conducting the

investigation will immediately notify the other agency of the relevant

facts.

Responsibility for further investigation of the individual

will be determined after discussion between repre-

sentatives of the two agencies.

If the agencies are unable to agree as

to the assignment of responsibility for further investigation,

the matter

should be resolved after discussion with

the responsible United States

Attorney or Department attorney.

Depending on the circunstances, it'

may be preferable for such further investigation of all statutory vio-

lations

to be conducted by a single agency.

In such event it is

expected.

the other agency would cooperate

render such assistance as is

deemed within its competence and capacity."

'The Bureau will continue to make available to IRS current information

of interest to that agency which is developed in the course of our

b.

investigations.

With regard to

item two of the guidelines as it pertains to notifying

IRS when there

is indication of a potential violation of wagering

tax laws, such notification should be made after sufficient facts are

developed

to determine the logical procedures to follow and at a time

when same would be more meaningful.

With reference to investigations

involving a taxpayer, referred to in the same item, this pertains to

individuals whose names are included on a list of active gamblers

maintained by the Department's Criminal Division.

Inasmuch as copies

of all reports involving the three statutes named above are furnished

the Department by the Bureau, such should tend to serve notice to the

Department that we are investigating an individual on that list. It

is anticipated that when

the Department receives our reports and

checks its files it will thus be on notice that one of these individuals

is currently being investigated.

c. Items three and four of the guidelines are self-explanatory in that

the USA should be consulted where there appears

to be a duplication

of investigative effort and such cannot be resolved by field represent-

atives of both agencies.

In connection with item five, regarding

the assignment of

investigation to a single agency, responsibility for

an investigation should be definitely fixed in one

agency insofar

as

an individual violation is concerned.

In this way

each agency would

retain its own jurisdiction and the one whose case had the best

potential for prosecution would continue its

investigation.

Furthermore,

with regard to one agency proceeding with an investigation and the

other rendering such assistance as is deemed within its competence

and capacity,

the agency proceeding with its investigation should be

furnished with all pertinent information of assistance by the other

agency.

This will preclude the necessity for any joint investigation

d.

and result in each agency handling its own violation completely.

Each office should make every effort to avoid overlapping of jurisdiction

which these guidelines are intended to minimize.

It is recognized

that

at least preliminary investigation is necessary before any of

these matters can be logically discussed by both agencies. It is the

Bureau's feeling that the matter of jurisdiction in the majority of

instances can be resolved on a field level by the two agencies and

that the necessity for contacting the USA or Department attorney

would be rare.

e.

The Bureau should be kept advised in advance of any matters in this

regard that are discussed with

the USA, and also you should advise the

Bureau of any intestigative action withheld through agreement with

IRS or on recommendation of the USA.]

In addition, the very

• nature of such criminal

acts may and almost always does

safety of passengers and crew members.

It is imperative, therefore,

that the authority and responsibilities of each Department be precisely de-

iined in order that maximum effectiveness is achieved in the prevention, control,

and the maximum guar-

antee of the safety of passengers and cree achieved on the other hend, wate

the clear acknowledgement of the primary interest in favor of the safety

passengers and crew.

To this end the following designation of authority and

delegation of responsibilities and duties are agreed upon.

II. DESIGNATION OF AUTHORITY

A. While Aircraft is in Flight

I. When an aircraft is in flight, when it is moving on the take-

off runway

for the purpose of becoming airborne,

and when it is

moving on

the runway to accomplish a landing, the pilot in command of the aircraft

shall be in control.

2.

If a recommendation is to be made by officials of the Depart-

ment of Transportation and the Department of Justice to the pilot in command

for a course of action to be pursued by him, the recommendation of the

official of the Department of Transportation shall prevail over that of the

official of the Department of Justice in the event of a conflicting dis-

agreement between such officials.

B. While Aircraft is not in Flight

1. An aircraft is deemed to be not in flight unless it is actually

airborne, or unless it is moving on the take-off runway for the purpose of

becoming airborne, or when it is moving on the runway to accomplish a landing..

2. The designated representative of the Department of Justice will

make the decision,

where appropriate, to interrupt, or take other positive

action with respect to, a hijacking while the aircraft is not in flight.

III. INFORMATION AND COOPERATION

A.

The Department of Transportation shall take all possible steps to

develop a comprehensive intelligence system.

This will include techniques

to permit as extensive as possible the monitoring on the ground of conver-

sation and speaking in the cockpit of the aircraft.

To achieve this ob-

jective,

the fullest cooperation of the commercial airlines and their

pilots will be solicited.

The Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice agree

to cooperate fully with each other in order that each may discharge its

responsibilities hereunder.

This shall include the full exchange of infor-

mation and intelligence."

From this experience, we were able to develop a

felt was illegal agent mail. This, coupled with our knowledge

of known Soviet nail drops on this side of the Iron Curtain,

permitted efiective sorcenins of the mail and selection o1

letters on a knowledgeable basis.

This method was proved successful when we uncovered

three such illogals and successfully neutralizod thoir

U. S. HOUSE SCLUCI COMITTEE ON TNTELLIGENCE ACITVITTES (USC)

RE: REQUESTS FOR INFORMATION CONCORNING THIS PUREAU'S OPPRATION

OF INFORMANIS

As indicated in this Bureau's response to Iten

Itumber 1 above, Bureau informants can gencrally be classifica

into throe catogories: securlty, crininal and escronist.

In

an attempi o be responsive to Item lumber 6, appropriate

supervisory porsonnel at FBI Headquarters, Inowledgeable

concerning informant matters, vere contacted in this regard.

Fersonnel handling security- and extremisi-type

informents advise that they can recall instances in which FBI

informants operating in the security and entremist flelds

were arrested and/or convicied on the basis of criminal

activity in no vay related to their informant status vich

this Bureau.

These personnel, however, have no recollection

of this Bureau ever interceding for a sccurity or extrenisi

informent in judicial proceedings. These personnel also

advise that it is established Bureau procedure that then a

Eurcau security or extremist informant becones involved in

prosecutive matters as a result of criminal activicy, his

services as an informant are discontinued.

FBI Headquarters personnel handling criminal

informants advise that this Bureau is curcenily operating

more than 18,000 informants in the criminal field.

The

ovorhelming preponderanco of these informants had been

arrested and/or convicted in local and/or l'ederal court at

one time or another on a vide varicty of charges. This

Burent has made known to a judge that a defendant convicted

in his couct has been cooperative with the Government in

the past--which may os may noi be taken into account then

the judge passes sentence. This Burcau, however, makes o

point of notifying all informants at the time they are

activated that this bureau vill not overlook criminal violacions

on their part or protcet then in the event they become

subjects of criminal proccedings.

By letter 9/9/75 (copy attached), the House Select

Committee (HSC) requested that John J. McDermott, Assistant

Director, Files and Communications Division, afford members

of the HSC a briefing concerning "the files and classification

systems of the FBI."

Above communication was forwarded to this Bureau

by Department cover letter (copy attached), dated 9/15/75,

with the request that appropriate arrangements for this briefing

be effected.

By phone call to HSC offices 9/16/75, SA Paul V.

Daly was able to ascertain that HSC Staff Member, Ellen Miller,

made the request and would be among those receiving the

briefing. Miller stated she expected the briefing to deal

generally with the procedural aspects of mail processing,

indexing and filing.

OBSERVATIONS:

REG- 102

62-116464-

Since this request refers to a briefing regarding

the files and classification systems of this Bureau, it does

not appear that a release from Mr. McDermott's employment

agreement is necessary in this instance. Briefing such as

that described above would not involve classified information.

ECOMMENDATION:

If requested briefing is approved, it is recommended

that Mr. McDermott contact Mr. William O. Cregar of the

Senstudy-Houstudy Coordinating Unit, Extension 4636, advising

Intelligence Coordination

NOTE:

Items 3 and 4 of referenced HSC letter request a

listing of all national and internal security wiretaps or

electronic surveillances conducted by this Bureau from 1/1/70

to 6/30/75, accompanied by all documents provided the Attorney

General to support such operations. At a White House briefing

9/3/75 dealing with sensitive matters such as electronic

interceptions, it was decided by those in attendance that

members of the intelligence community should be most circumspect

in providing HSC with information in this sensitive area.

During the above-mentioned contact on 9/4/75 with Mr. Shaheen,

the latter advised that he would contact appropriate individuals

at the Hhite House to determine how inquiries relating to this

sensitive area will be handled by members of the intelligence

community.

ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCI BY FBI AGENTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS

By menorandum Gated 1/1/75, Laurence i. Silberman,

Deputy Attorney General, advised that during the past year

FBI Agents in Houston,

Texas, have engaged in an investigation

of alleged illegal electronic surveillance activity by the

•Houston Police Department (HOPD). As an outgrowth of that

investigation, the Department has recently received informa

tion alleging

(1) that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous

investigation of this matter; (2) that sore Bureau Agents have

in the past, been aware of specific instances of illegal electronic

surveillances by the HODD and have been receptive to information

derived

therefrom; and (3) that the Houston Field Office may

itself have engaged in illegal surveillances.

Attached to Mr. Silberman's letter were copies of

transcripts of tape recorded telephone conversations between

Chief of Police Carol M. Lynn, 'HOPD, and current and former

members of HOPD; a letter from Chief Lynn to U. s. Attorney

(USA) J. P. Farris dated 12/13/74, and a memorandun to Chief

Lynn from B. G. Bond, Captain, Narcotics Division, dated 12/13/74.

Realizing that we night not have all of the material in the

Department's possession, Mr. Adams contacted Acting Assistant

Attorney General John Keeney on 1/16/75, at which time Keeney

made available copies of additional transcripts; a copy of a

letter dated 12/17/74, from USA Farris to Attorney General Saxbe;

copy of excerpts from.

the transcript in U. S. v. Dudley Cllfford

Bell, JI.; copy of a letter dated 11/20/73, from Carol S.

Vance, District Attorney, Harris County, Texas, to USA Farris;

and copies of five letters fror: AUSA Ronald J.

Washa to SAC;

Houston, covering the period 4/2910/31/74. All of the ahove

documents are attached.

Mr. Silkerman requested a memorandum detailing what

Information the Bureau has on this matter.

Attached for arrroval

is a proposed memorandum to Silbernan setting forth the results

of our inquiry into this matter.

Memorandun to Mr. Callahan

Re:

ALLIGATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

Willie C. Law and Inspector's Aide Ernest J. Landreville

proceeded to the Houston Office on 1/12/75. Immediately upon

arrival at the Houston Office, SAC Robert Russ Franck was

telephonically contacted and thereafter appeared at the office

at which time he was advised as to the nature of our inquiry.

Houston files pertaining to one of the cases in

question captioned "Jerry L. Slaughter; et al.; IDC" llouston

file 139-189, Dufile 139-4467, were thoroughly reviewed.

Following review of these files, personnel who might possess

knowledge of the allegations contained in Silberman's memorandum

and the attachments thereto, were interviewed.

Each person

interviewed was furnished a memorandum prepared by the Inspector

which set forth the allegations and where pertinent, the

employee interviewed furnished a sworn, signed statement.

Following is a sunmary of the interviews conducted

• and the results of file reviews concerning each of the allega-

tlong which could be construed as pertaining to the FBI as

contained in Mr. Silberman's memorandum and the attachments

thereto.

That Bureau Agents Have Eschewed A Vigorous Investigation Of This

Matter

All personnel interviewed stated that Bureau Agents

have not eschewed a vigorous investigation in this matter.

case Agent, Haclan Q. Coffman and Supervisor William J. Schmidt

feel that a vigorous and exhaustive investigation has been con-

ducted. The files pertaining to this case indicate that it was

opened

on 12/7/73, based on a complaint that the voice of an

individual had been recorded on tape allegedly made from an

illegal wiretap by the Narcotics Division, HOPD.

Investigation

was conducted and on 2/28/74, the case was closed because AUSA

Ronald J. Waska stated no evidence was

available to support the

allegation.

The case was reopened on 3/8/74, based on a news

release by UPI which was furnished to the

Houston Office by

the Bureau indicating that nine llouston police officers had been

indicted by a rederal grand jury (IGJ) for various crimes,

including filing false tax returns and conspiracy to place

Illegal wiretaps. MUSA Waska was contacted 3/11/74, anüfeivised

no charges involving Interception of Communications had been made due

to lacis oi proof, and evidence maintained in the USA's Office was found

solely in an aftidavit of se

makes, whom waska described as an

undercover informant. In April and October, 1974, Wasta indicated there

was no need to interview Casset. On 3/11/74, Waska said he planned to

maise the rattidavit available to the case Agent within two weeks.

When this aifidavit was not forthcoming, the case was closed on 4/1/74.

The affidavit was finally made available on 5/1/71 (approximately seven

weeks later) and indicates tengwas awaiting sentencing for maling false

declarations to the FGJ. The case was reopened on 5/1/74. On the same

date, four reels of magnetic tape were received irom Wasisa and in his

letter dated 4/29/74 he indicated that he had received two of these reels

of tape on 11/21/73 and two reels of tape on 11/26/73 from the brother

he had previously indicated that the tages were

appronimately ten

years ola and ol no use in building a prosecutabie

case.

"INFORMANT

The Frien

Ca affidavit, which is dated 1/29/74 sets forth sis

instances of alleged illegal wiretapping by the BOPD. Of these, the

Statute of Limitations had run on all but two instances. Casalso

included in his affidavit that all logs and transcripts were destroyed and

the tapes were erased; thus there was no physical evidence available.

There was no investigative activity in the case from 5/1 -

5/14/74, except one contact with AUSA Waska. Of the ten work days

during this period, the case Agent was un sick leave three days and

three hours.

Investigation was conducted on various dates between

5/1'7 and 6/7/7, and on the latter date, AUSA Wassa was apprised of

the investigation conducted up to that time. SA Cofiman contacted Waska

011 6/27/74, at which time asia requested a list of employees of the

Communications Division of F.OPD. The list was obtained on 7/3/74

and is included in a report submitted by on Coifrian on 7/59/74. Prior

to the submission of this repori, s^ Coifman contacted aska on

7/20/74 advising him of all investigation conducted to date at which

time tassa requested a report prior to rendoring a prosecutive opinion.

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

There is no indication in the files of any outside investigative

activity between 7/26 and 9/26/74; however, in his report dated 10/22/74,

SA Coffman indicates a contact with wassa on 9/23/74, at which time

Waska stated he had not had suiticient time to review Cofiman's report

017/30/74, due to his burdened work load, and had not desired any inves-

tigation between 7/30 and 9/23/74. Waska, in a letter to the Houston

Office dated 10/31/74, stated he had never requested that this investiga-

tion be delayed, but had requested an exhaustive and diligent investigation

since the inception of the case, the only exception being that the iDi

should not interview Houston police officers under indictment. However;

during Coftman's contact with Waska on 9/23/74, the only investigation

requested by viaska was that Assistant District Attorney Robert C. Bennett

be interviewed. Bennett was interviewed on 10/3/7. During this inter-

view, Pennett advised that he and two other attorneys from his eifice had

met with former SAC Thomas Jordan in Jordan's Office on 7/3/73,

regarding allegations of wiretapping by the HOPD but that he could furnish

no specilics at that time.

On 10/23/74, SA Coffman contacted AUSA Wasia regarding

any further investigation desired and waska informed him that he cesired

to review Coffman's 10/22271 report first.

A substantial amount of investigation was conducted during

October and November, 197s, and the latest report was submitted on

In the sworn, signed statement, SA Coffman categorically

denied that he had advised Officer Bell that Cas was a thief.

He said he did inform Bell during the interview that he was aware

of detailed information concerning the Garza case; that he under-

stood Bell placed a tap on Garza and he was aware of the location

where bell placed the tap. SA Coffman denied furnishing Bell

the date of June, 1968, relative to the Garza case.

Chief of Police C. M. Lynn's Letter to USA Farris Containing

Allegations o1 Inadequate Investigation By FBI to Determine If

Chief Lynn's telepnones and nose of His Stail were rapped.

Inquiry into this matter determined that a thorough

and comprehensive check of all telephone lines at all substations

was made.

This check included tracing the conduit which con-

tained the lines and each appearance at various switching centers.

These checks were made by SAs Richard W. Suter and Donald C.

Steinmeyer with the assistance of telephone security personnel

a telephone employee at each substation as they were checked.

A check of the lines cormenced the same day the telephone numbers

were furnished

and was concluded approximately ten

days later,

with Chief Lynn's lines being the last to be checked. There was

no indication of tampering or any illegal attachments on any of

the lines checked.

Sworn, signed statements concerning the above were

obtained from SAs Suter and Steinmeyer.

SA Suter stated he was

particularly painstaking in these checks since he suspected that

equipment might be "planted" on the lines by J. I. Patterson, who

had advised Chief Lynn that his telephone line was "bugged."

During conference with USA Edward B. McDonough, JI.,

and members of his staff on 1/17/75, he advised he was not

Interested in discussing in detail allegations of misconduct by

Houston FBI Agents as contained in the transcripts and documents

furnished to the Department by formur USA Farris. He considered

this an internal matter within the FbI which he felt would be

handled properly.

from which the transcripts were made were now in the hands of the local

news media; that he has been instructed by the Department to proceed via

the FG& route in this case; that some of the witnesses may be granted

immunity and that if indictments are returned against veteran police

officers, their defense attorneys will use any means to obscure the real

issues, including publicizing the contents of the tapes. Ee foresees the

possibility of FBI agents being subpoenaed to testily before the grand jury.

He indicated that any allegation can be refuted, but the damage is already

done.

He said the way the IOC case pertaining to alleged illegal

electronic surveillance activity by the HOPD was handled was not

representative of the caliber of work he expected of the FBI. He felt

that the case should have received an imaginative rather than a routine

approach; for example, the Chief of Police was alerted and some time

later interviews were conducted with his personnel, thus allowing the

police to gt together and agree on what should be said when interviewed.

He also said he was not interested in obtaining a volume of ID - 502s

reflecting negative interviews. He was reminded that when knowledgeable

individuals are interviewed regarding matters which could be sell-

incriminating quite often the results will be negative. Also, he did not

feel it was proper, as alleged, for an Agent to advise possible subjects

that the Statute of Limitations had run on many of the allegations that

were the basis for the investigation. SA Coifman advised that when

sitting in Captain Bond's Office, an officer asked what case the allegations

Involved, and Colfman mentioned the Fanda and Wimpy Week's case.

This officer asked what the Federal Statute of Limitations was and he was

told five years. This officer and other oificers said the case identified

was over five years old and the officers appeared to be happy about this.

McDonough stated at the present time all investigation has

been completed, but he expects the case to become very active alter

testimony is taken before the EGJ (Convened 1/20/75). I this occurs,

he will require FBI assistance so long as we are prepared to refute any

allegations should they arise either in court or in the press. Le was of

the opinion that the case should be assiged to personnel who have no

close contacts or personal association with members of LOID. Inopector

instructed SAC, Houston, to personally supervise this ase and to reassig

it to a mature and thoroughly experienced Agent in keeping with the above;

that any investigation requested be handled in a prompt and vigorous

manner and in such a way that no criticism can be leveled against the

Bureau or personnel of the Houston Office. Inspector advised USA

McDonough that the case would be reassigned and would be under the

personal supervision of the SAC.

That Some Eureau Agents Have, In the Past, Been Aware of Specific

Instances of illegal flectronic Surveillance Sy the ROPD and Have

Been Receptive to Information Derived Theretrom

Among the transcripts of Chief Lym's conversations are state-

ments by Joe Singleton, former head of the HOPD Criminal Intelligence

Division, to the effect that an FBI Agent, "Swede Johnson" and another

Agent participated in and were receptive to information obtained from an

illegal HOPD wiretap.

SA William O. Johnson, Ban's Robbery Coordinator of the

Houston Cifice, was interviewed at length during our inquiry. He stated

that to the best of his recollection, he has handled only one case wherein

• doe singleton, a former office of hiO?D, was involved and that this case

occurred several years ago. The case in question is captioned "William

Neil Lee - Fugitive; et al.; Colonial Savings Association, 10121 South

Post Oax Road, Houston, Texas, Bank Robbery, ITSMY" Houston file

81-1832.

A review of the files in this case revealed that Lee was

identified on 2/14/66, as one of the individuals who robbed the above

establishment on 2/9/66. The FBI, Chicago, advised FBI, Houston, on

2/14/66, that a Houston bank bag and a telegram addressed to Lee at a

Houston residence had been recovered from a stolen car in Chicago. Lee's

photograph was identified by employees of two recently robbed Houston

banks as one of the bank robbers.

SA Johnson was assigned the cases involving Lee and was

assisted by SA Joe P. Patty (now retired). The HOFD was also seeking

Iree, who was wanted for a number of local robberies, and their inves-

tigation was directed by Captain L. C. Colley.

RE: ALLECATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

On 2/17/66 SA Johnson advised our Chicago Office and FBIHQ

via teletype that an HOPD surveillance had been established on the residence

of Lee's girl friend and that Lee had been in telephonic contact with her

twice and was believed to be planning to meet her on 2/18/66. The Houston

Office copy of this teletype had the word "technical" typed in preceding

the word surveillance. The teletype was sent at 10:18 p.mn., on 2/17/66.

Sa Johnson stated that he personally typed the oftice copy of the teletype

and made certain corrections in ink. He also initialed the office copy for

former SAC Frank V. Hitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted

that the word "technical" had been lined through with a pencil and Johnson

has no idea who did this. He said it was SAC Hitt's policy to read or have

read to him all teletypes prior to their being sent; therefore, he assumes

that either he or the night clerk read the teletype to Hitt due to the time

the teletype was sent and the word "technical" was lined through on Hitt's

orders. He said the lining through of the word "technical" would have

been logical since he had no first-hand knowledge that the information

came from a technical surveillance, but could have come from a police

informant. He stated as best he can recall, he was furnished information

about the telephone calls orally by Captain Colley. During interview,

SA Johnson stated he typed the word "technical" on the teletype as it was

bor captain talley,

apparent to him that the information furnished pertained to telephone

conversations. On 2/18/06, after police showed Lee's photograph to an

apartment manager who advised Lee was residing in the building, Houston

police officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Joe Singleton, apprehended

Lee at 11:55 A.M. No FBI Agents participated in the arrest. johnson

believes he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereaiter he and

Patty proceeded to the police bepartment where wee, Who was in poiice

custody, was interviewed.

Both Johnson and Fatty denied ever being present at any location

at any time where an electronic surveillance was being conductod by per-

sonnel of the HCPD. SA Johnson stated he sent the teletype on 2/17/65, not

knowing whether the information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come

from a police informant or a police technical surveillance. He included

information in his report dated 3/10/00, which stated that Captain Colley

had advised him on 2/18/86, that Lee was located and arrested through

surveillance and other investigation conducted by the HOPD.

• Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

SA Johnson was asked if he was aware that a technical surveillance

by the HOPD could be a violation of the Federal Unlawful Publication or Use

of Communications Statute in force at that time. He replied that he was not

aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal inowledge that the

information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come from a technical

surveillance. There was no information developed during our inquiry that

any FBI personnel had any association with or personal knowledge of illegal

electronic surveillances.

On 1/7/58 former Director Hoover issued instructions that there

was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of wiretapping laws until

the. FBI was directed to do so by the Criminal Division of the Department.

All SACs were advised on 1/8/58 to institute no investigation of any violation

of this type without prior Bureau approval. Similar instructions, in conjunction

with those of the FBI, were issued to all USAs by the Department. These

instructions were in force at the time of the alleged HOPD wiretap.

Inasmuch as SA Johnson received no complaint of illegal wiretapping,

and had no personal knowledge of such, his handling of the information in his

possession was appropriate.

That the Houston Field Office May Itself Have Engaged in Illegal Electronic

Surveiliance

All personnel who would be in a position to have knowledge of such

activity denied that the Houston Field Office had engaged in illegal electronic

surveillance. The files of the Houston Office indicate that from 1964 to date,

two national security technical surveillances, one Title Ill surveillance, and

one Pen Register surveillance have been conducted. The national security

surveillances were authorized by the Bureau. The Pen Register and Title IDI

surveillances were approved by Court Order. Another national security

surveillance was authorized by the Bureau and equipment was installed but

never activated because the subject was identified as an 88 fugitive.

In conference with USA McDonough, he was asked if the basis for

the allegation in USA Farris' letter that the FBI was involved in illegal electronic

surveillance had emanated from a statement made in open Federal Court on

11/13/73, in the case entitled "Dudley Clufford Bell, Jr.; et al.; ICC" by

defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that "Larry Shaefer, who liliewise is a witness

in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equipment to Don Steinmeyer,

an FBI Agent, who is also a witness in this case." McDonough said he

assumed this was what Farris was alluding to. McDonough had said earlier

"how can we proceed with prosecution in the event indictments are returned

when the FbI may momentarily be accused or publicized as being of having

been engaged in illegal wiretaps."

NicDonough was advised that DeGuerin's statement was completely

false; that former AUSA Joe Doucette, who was representing the Government,

knew it was false, but talled to relute it; and that AUsA Doucette was aware

that Larry schaeter as a cooperating witness, had iurnished items of evidence

to SA Steinmeyer relating to the manufacture and sale of electronic surveillance

equipment to Dudley Bell. This material was to be used as evidence at the

trial. It had been submitted to the FBI Laboratory for comparison with other

evidence in the case and reports setting forth the results of the FBI Laboratory

examination had been furnished to the USA's Office. in addition, DeGuerin

and Dudley Bell had viewed this evidence in the Houston FBI Office prior to

the trial. All witnesses were excluded irom the courtroom except during the

time of their own testimony; therefore,. De Guerin's statement stayed in the

record unchallenged. SA Steinmeyer testified at the trial but the matter never

came up during his testimony. It was several months after the trial when SA

Steinnieyer had his firet opportunity to read the unrefuted statement made by

DeGuerin®

The above information was also available to former USA Farris

because copies of the reports and the transcript were available to him. When

asked on 1/17/75, why former AUSA Doucette did not refute the statement

of DeGuerin, USA McDonough's only response was that some Federal judges

do not give Federal prosecutors the opportunity.

Additlonal information concerning this matter is contained in

administrative write-ups which were prepared as a result of the inquiry

conducied both at FBid and the Rouston Office. Recommendations relativa

to any administrative action concerning personnel involved will be handled

separately.

DESERVATIONS: During this inquiry there were indications of a "vandetta"

between the LoA's Office and the OPD. This may have hau its roots when,

during the early days of the US.'s inquiry into the alleged illegal wiretapsig

by the LCD, former AUSA James I. Farier was forced to resign and stand

Parker is currently carried

as the victim of a pending Civil Rights investigation, Houston file 44-4504.

The basis of this investigation is that a convicted narcotics violator planted

marijuana and LSD in Farker's apariment in November, 1971, at the

direction of the Narcoties Squad, HOPD, in order to "make a case" on

Parker.

Two other AUSAs, one of whom was AUSA Waska, were accused

by narcotics officers of the HOPD of smoking marijuana at "pot" parties.

Administrative Inquiries into these accusations were conducted at the request

of the Department. AUSA Waska vehemently denied ever using any narcotics.

Former AUSA Theo W. Pinson, III, declined to discuss his personal life.

At about the same time these events were transpiring, former USA Farris

expressed concern that his and three of his assistants' telephones had been

tapped by the Narcotics Bureau, HOPD.

ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE MISCONDUCT

BY F'BI AGENTS, HOUSTON, TEXAS

This is in response to your memorandum dated January 7, 1975,

captioned as above, with attachments, requesting information in the

possession of the FBi relative to the allegations. As a result, inquirles

have been conducted both at FBI Headquarters and our Houston Cifice to

resolve each allegation. It should be noted, that due to numerous gaps in

the transcrints furnished by former United States Attorney Farris. Southern

District of Teras, there is a loss of continuity in some of the pertinent

conversations. This problem was discussed with United States Attorney

Edward B. McDonough, Jr., Southern District of Texas, who advised

that although he had in his possesion a complete transcript, the Depart-

ment had furnished the FBI only those portions he deemed to be significant.

The first allegation is that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous

Investigation of the alleged illegal electronic surveillance activity by the

Rouston Police Department. In this connection, a thorough review has been

conducted of the case captioned, "Jerry L. Slaughter, also known as, et al,

Interception of Communications," Explanations and sworn statements bave

been obtained from appropriate FBl personnel.

This inguiry has failed to reveal anything which could be considered

substantial delay or lack of willingness on the part of FBI personnel to

pursue all logical investigative avenues available. United States Attorney

McDonough adrised at the time of interview on January 17, 1975, that no

investigation remained to be conducted; however, he expected considerable

investigation to result from testimony to be given by witnesses who were to

start appearing before the Federal Grand Jury convening on January 20, 1975,

and he was assured full cooperation in this regard.

receptive to iniormation derived the reirom.

Our inquiry in Houston disclosed that through the press the püblic

has been deluged with publicity concerning "bugging' activitles by the Fouston

Police Department. Television stations are said to be in possession of tape

recordings made by Chief Lynn, as he inquired into illegal wiretaps which

allegecily took piace under the aegis of his predecessor.

The recorded

conversations were with present and former members of the Houston Folice

Department. Allegations of illegal wiretapping and other abuses of police powers

have been leveled chiefly at the Narcotics and Criminal Intelligence Divisions

of the Houston Folice i'epartment. Charges of information concerning personal

misconduct by houston public citicials has fanned the flames os public curiosity

concerning police wiretapping. In the midst of the furor, a Federal Grand Jury

has been convered to gather information by the granting of immunity to witnesses,

relative to any illegal wiretapping conducted by the kouston Folice Department.

Among the transcrints of Chief Lym'a conversations furnished to thie

FBI, are statements by Joa Singleton, former bead of the Criminal intelligence

Division, liouston l'olice leparinent, to the effect that an FBI Agent, "swede

Johnson," and another Agent participated la and were raceptive to information

obtained from an illegal viretap.

Special Avert William O, Jcenson, Banis Robbery Coordinator of tha

Houstos, Texas, IEl Oflice, was interviewed at lenoth during our inquiry. Fie

stated that to the best of his recollection he had handied only one casa a number

of years ago that aigo invelved Joe Singletca, & former officer of the Liouston

Police Department. The case in question is captioned, "Wulliam Neil Lee - rugitive,

Et Al. Colonial Savinga Association, 10441 South Pest Oak Foad, Ecuston, Jezas,

Bank Robbery; IISMV."

A review of the files revealed that Lee was identified on February 14,

1966, as one of the individuala who robbed the above establishment on february 9,

1966. The FB1, Chicago, advised FBI, Houston, on February 14, 1906, tat a

Houston bars bag and a telegram addressed to Les at a Houston residence had

been recovered from a stolen car icund in Chicago. Lea's protograph was

identitieday employeea a two recenily sobbed Houston banks an one of tho

bank robbers.

Special Agent Johnson was assimned the cases and was assisted by

Special Agent Joe P. Patty (now retired). The Houston Police Department

was also seeking Lee who was wanted for a number of local ronberies.,

Their

Investigations were directed by Captain I. C. Colley.

On February 17, 1965, Special Agent Johnson adrised FBI, Chicano,

and FBI Headquarters via teletype that a custon Police Department surveillaace

had been established on the residence of Lee's girl friend and that Lee bad been

in telephonic contace with her and was believad to be planning to meet her on

February 18, 1966. The Houston KBI Ollice copy di this teletype had the word

"Technical" typed in preceaing the word surveillance. "The teletype was sent

at 10:18 p.m., on February 11, 1060. Special Agent Johnson stated khat he

parsonally typed the pitica copy ot the teletype and made certain corrections in

inks. Be also initialed the citice copy ior former special Agent in Charge Franks V.

been lined through with a pencil and Johnson has no idea who did this. De said

it was titt's solicy to read or have read to him all teletypes prior to their being

sent; therefore, he assumes tuat either he or the nigat ciers read the teletype

to Hitt due to the time the teletype was sent and the word "technical" was lined

through on hitt's orders. he said the lining through of the word "tachnical" sould

have been logical since he had no first-hand knowledge that the information

came trom a technical surveillance, but couid have come from a police iniorm-

ant. lie stated as best he can recall, he was furnished information about the

telephone cails orally by Castain Colley. During interview Special Agent Johnson

stated ha typed the word "technical" on the teletype as it was apparent to him that

the information furnished pertained to telephone conversatione. On February la,

1986, alter police showed Lee's photograph to an apartment manager who advised

was residing in the building, Bouston pollce officers, one oi whom was ileutenans

Joe Singleton, apprehended Lee at 11:55 A.M. No FBI Agents participated in the

arrest. Johason believes he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereatter

he and Fatty proteeded to the folice Department where lee, who was in police

custody, was interviewed.

Both Johnson and Latty denied ever listening to, participating in or being

present at any location at any time where an electronic survelllance was being

conducted by the bouston Police Depariment. Special Agent Johnson stated be sent

the teletype on February i7, 1066, not knowing whether the information furnished

to him by Captain Collay had come from a police informant or a police technical

surveillance. he Included information in his report dated March I0, 1000, which

stated that Captain Colley had advised him on Fcbruary ls, 1966, that Lee was

located and arrested through surveillance and other investigation conducted by the

Houston Folica Department.

Special Agent Johason was asked if he was aware that a technical

surveillance by the Houston Police Department could be a violation of the federal

Unlavul Publication or Use of Communications statute in force at that time. He

replied that he was not aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal

snowledge that the information furnished to him by Captain Colley hed come from a

technical surveillance. There was no intormation developed during our inquiry that

any FBI personal had say association with or personal knowledge of illegal

electronic surveillances,

On January 7, 1958, former FBI Director J. Lagar Hoover lesued

instructioas that there ras to be no investigadon os auy alleged violation of

wiretapping laws until the FBI was directed to do so by the Criminal Divia on

of the Lepartient. All Special Agents in Charge were advised on January 8,

1958, to dastitute no investigation of any violation of this type without prior

Bareau approval. Similar instructions in conjunction with those of the Bl

were issued to all United States Attorneys by the Department. Thase instrue

lions were in force at the time of the alleged Houston Follce Department

wiretap.

Tha Depaty Attorney General

Inasmuch as Special Agent Johasa received no complaints of illegal

wiretapping and had no personal inowledge of such, his handling of the taior-

matica in his possession was appropriaie.

The final allegation mentioned in your communication has to do with

the possibility that the Houston FBI Office may itsall have engaged in illegal

electronic surveillance. from a review oi the information turnished, dig

cussiona with United states Attornay lcDonough, and interviews of fBi ser-

sonnel, the only basis for such an allegation would appear to be contained in

statements made in open Federal court by Defense Attorney Dick LeGueria

@& November 1s, 1973, in the casa captioned 'Dudley Clulford Eell, Jr.;

wanny Gooiman, Jr. - Victim; Et Al; Intercaption of Communications."

DeGueria stated that "Larry Shaefer, who lizewise is a witness for the Goverx-

ment in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equigment to Don

Steinmeyer, an FBI Agent, who is also a witness in this case."

• This statement by DeGusrin is completely false. Former Assistant

United states Attorney Joe Doucatte, who was representing the Govemment

knew the statement was taise but falled to reite it. He was aware that Larry

Shaefer, as a cooperating zitness, had furnisned items of evidence relating to

the manuiacture and saie of electrosie surveillance equipment to Dudley Bell.

This material was to be evidence in the trial. It had been submitted to the

FBI Laboratory for comparisonarposes. Laboratory reports concerning it

had been furnished to the United states Attorney, to be introxiuced in the trial,

and DaGuerin and Dudley Bell had viewed this evidence prior to the trial, in

the Houstos IBI Oilice. All witnesses were excluded from the triad except

during their own testimony and DeGuorin never breached the subject during

Special Agent Steinmeyer's testimony. It was several moats after the trial

When Steinmeyer had his first opportunity to read the transcript costaining

the faiscious unreiuted stätement by LeGuerin. All of the above information

was available to former United states Attorney Farris since copies oi the

reports and court transcripts had been furnished to bim. United States

Attorney Licionough was apprised of this in our conterence on january 17,

1975, and was assed why Louceite did not retute DeGuerin's alleration.

McDonagh'a oniy expianation was that some federal judges do noi give

Federal prosecutors the opportunity.

All other allegations of possible misconduct contained in the material

furnished by the Department, which could be construed as referring to the

I'3l, have been thorcughly explored and no basis was found as to their validity.

The Deputy Attorney General

The FBI will continue every effort to assure that all investigation requested

by United States Attorney McDonough is handled expeditiously and in a thorough

manner.

On January 24, 1975, FBI Deputy Assoclate Director J. B. Adams

was contacted by John Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal

Division of the Department, who advised he had been in contact with United States

Atterney McDonough who was under the impression that the Department was going to

insist that FBI Agents from outside the Houston Division be utilized in conducting

the investigation concerning allegations of illegal wiretapping on the part of the

Houston Police Department. Mr. Keeney advised McDonough that such was not

the agreement and that the FBI was going to remain on the investigation utilizing

personnel of the FBI's choice. At that time Mr. Keeney was advised that we were

reassigning the case to an Agent who has no extensive contacts with the Pouston

Police Department, the same practice we follow in Clvil Rights investigations

which would insure that we would be free from allegations of bias in favor of the

police department. Mir. Keeney was assured that in the event additional

personnel were needed in the Houston Field Division in order to ageressively

investigate these allegations the Bureau would send personnel from other FET

Field Divisions but at that point we had not received any such request from the

Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Olfice. Mr. Keeney asked Mr. Adams

to contact the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cifice to insure that he

was aware of the fact that if he needed additional personnel to investigate this

matter the Bureau would give him full support.

Shortly thereafter Mr. Adams contacted the Special Agent in Charge

of the Houston Office who stated he had advised United States Attorney McDonough

that a Resident Agent in Galveston, Texas, was proceeding to Houston to assume

investigative responsibility for this case. Also, if necessary, he will bring

in additional Agents from Resident Agencies to assist in the investigation.

On January 31, 1976, Mr. Keeney contacted Mr. Adams stating that

United States Attorney McDonough still desires that FBI Agents from outside the

Houston Division be assigned to investigate this case. Mr. Reenay informed

Mir. Adams that he did not concur with United States Attorney McDonough, that

the FBI was alert to the problem in this case and in the event additional FBI persenrel

were needed to investigate this matter, they would be made available. As previously

indicated the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cifice was directed to

personally suparvise this case. On February 4, 1975, he advised that this

case is being personally supervised by him.

HOUSTON, TEXAS

By memorandum dated 1/7/75, Laurence H. Silberman,

Deputy Attorney General, advised that during the past year

FBI Agents in Houston, Texas, have engaged in an

investigation

of alleged illegal electronic surveillance activity by the

Houston Police Department (HOPD). As an outgrowth of that

investigation, the Department has recently received informa-

tion alleging

(1) that Bureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous

investigation of this matter; (2) that some. Bureau Agents have

in the past, been aware of specific Instances of illegal electronic

surveillances by the HOPD and have been receptive to information

derived therefrom; and

(3) that the Houston Field Office may

itself have engaged in illegal surveillances.

Attached to Mr. Silberman's letter were copies of

transcripts of tape recorded telephone conversations between

Chief of Police Carol M. Lynn, HOPD, and current and former

(USA) J. P. Farris dated 12/13/74, and a memorandum to Chief

Lynn from B. G. Bond, Captain, Narcotics Division, dated 12/13/74.

Realizing that we might not have all of the material in the

Department's possession, Mr. Adams contacted Acting Assistant

Attorney General John Keeney on 1/16/75, at which time Keeney

made available copies of additional transcripts; a copy of a

letter dated 12/17/74, from USA Farris to Attorney General Saxbe;

copy of excerpts from

the transcript in U.S. V. Dudley Cliffora

Bell, JI.; copy of a letter dated 11/20/73, from Carol S.

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

At the instructions of Mr. Callahan, Inspector

Willle C. Law and Inspector's Aide Ernest J. Landreville

proceeded to the Houston Office on 1/12/75.

Immediately upon

arrival at. the Houston Office, SAC Robert Russ Franck was

telephonically contacted and thereafter appeared at the office

at which time he was advised as to the nature of our inguiry.

Houston files pertaining to one of the cases in

question captioned "Jerry I. Slaughter, et al.; IDC" Houston

file 139-189, Bufile 139-4467, were thoroughly reviewed.

Following review of these files, personnel who might possess

knowledge of the allegations contained in Silberman's memorandum

and the attachments thereto, were interviewed.

Each person

interviewed was furnished a memorandum prepared by the Inspector

which set forth the allegations and where pertinent, the

employee interviewed furnished a sworn, signed statement.

Following is a summary of the interviews conducted

and the results or file revlews concerning each of the allega

clong which could be construed as pertaining to the ral as

contained in Mr. Silberman's memorandum and the attachments

thereto.

That Bureau Agents Have Eschewed A Vigorous Investigation Of This

Matter

All personnel interviewed stated that Bureau Agents

have not eschewed a vigorous investigation in this matter. The

case Agent, Harlan Q. Coffnan and Supervisor William J. Schmidt

feel that a vigorous and exhaustive investigation has

ducted. The files pertaining to this case indicate

that it was

opened

on 12/7/73, based on a complaint that the voice of an

individual had been recorded on tape allegedly made from an

illegal wiretap by the Narcotics Division, HOPD.

Investigation

was conducted and on 2/28/74, the case was closed because AUSA

Ronald J. Maska stated no evidence was available to support the

allegation.

The case was reopened on 3/8/74, based on a news

release by UPI which was furnished to the Houston Office by

the Bureau indicating that nine llouston police officers had been

Indicted by a Federal grand jury (IGJ) for various

crimes,

including filing false tax returns and conspiracy to place

Illegal wiretaps. AUSA taska was contacted 3/11/74, and/fuvised

no charges involving Interception of Communications had been made due

to lack of proof, and evidence maintained in the USA's Office was found

solely in an affidavit of1

whom Waska described as an

undercover informant. In April and October, 197, Waska indicated there

was no need to interview Chavez. On 3/11/24, Waska said be planned to

make the (Chavez affidavit available to the case Agent within two weeks.

When this affidavit was not forthcoming, the case was closed on 4/1/74.

The affidavit was finally made available on 5/3/74 (approximately seven

weeks later) and indicates Chavez was awaiting sentencing for making false

declarations to the FGJ. The case was reopened on 5/1/74. On the sarae

date, four reels of magnetic tape were received frem Waska and in his

letter dated 4/29/74 he indicated that he had received two of these reels

of tape on 11/21/73 and two reels of tape en 11/26/73 from the brother

of Michael Chavez. Be had previously indicated that the tapes were

approximately ten years old and of no use in building a prosecutable

CASE.

The (Chavez affidavit, which is dated 1/29/74 sets forth six

instances of alleged illegal wiretapping by the HOPD. Of these, the

Statute of Limitations had run on all but two instances. Chavezalso

included in his affidavit that all logs and transcripts were destroyed and

the tapes were erased; thus there was no physical evidence available.

There was no investigative activity in the case from 5/1 -

5/14/74, except one contact with AUSA Waska. Of the ten work days

during this period, the case Agent was on sick leave three days and

three hours. Investigation was conducted on various dates between

5/17 and 6/7/7, and on the latter date, AUDA Wasia was apprised of

the investigation conducted up to that time. SA Coffman contacted Waska

on 6/27/74, at which time ivaska requested a list of employees of the

Communications Division of FOPD. The list was obtained on 7/3/74

and is included in a report submitted by & Cofinan on 7/30/74. Prior

to the submission of this report, SA Colfman contacted Waska on

7/26/74 advising him of all investigation concucted to date at which

time taska requested a report prior to rendering a prosecutive opinion.

There is no indication in the files of any outside investigative

activity between 7/26 and 9/26/74; however, in his report dated 10/22/74,

SA Coffman indicates a contact with waska on 9/23/74, at which time

Waska stated he had not had sutficient time to review Coffman's report

01 1/39/14, que to his burdened work load, and had not desired any inves-

tigation between 7/30 and 9/23/74. Waska, in a letter to the Fiouston

Office dated 10/31/74, stated he had never requested that this investiga-

tion be delayed, but had requested an exhaustive and diligent investigation

since the inception of the case, the only exception being that the 1'51

should not interview Houston police officers under indictment. However,

during Coffman's contact with Waska on 9/23/74, the only investigation

requested by Waska was that Assistant District Attorney Robert C. Bennett

be interviewed. Bennett was interviewed on 10/8/74. During this inter-

view, Bennett advised that he and two other attorneys from his office had

met with former SAC Thomas Jordan in Jordan's Office on 7/3/73,

regarding allegations of wiretapping by the HOPD but that he could furnish

no specifics at that time.

On 10/23/74, SA Coffman contacted AUSA Waska regarding

any further investigation desired and Waska informed him that he desired

to review Coffman's 10/22/74 report first.

A substantial amount of investigation was conducted during

October and November, 1974, and the latest report was submitted on

11/12/74.

Since that time, the Houston Office has been serving subpoenas

on various individuals who are to appear before the FGJ, at the request

of the USA's Offica.

Captain B. G. Bond's letter d 12/13/74, to Chief Lynn con-

tains allegations that SA Coitman advised Officer T. A. Bell tha Mire

Chief of Police C. M. Lynn's Letter to USA Farris Containing

Allegations of Inadequate Investigation By FBI to Determine If

Chief Lynn's Telephones and Those of His Staff Were Tapped

Inquiry into this matter determined that a thorough

and comprehensive check of all telephone lines at all substationg

was made.

This check included tracing the conduit which con-

tained the lines and

each appearance at various switching centers.

These checks were made by SAs Richard W. Suter and Donald C.

. Steinmeyer with the assistance of telephone security personnel

and a telephone employee at each substation as they were checked.

A check of the lines commenced the same day the telephone numbers

were furnished

and was concluded approximately ten days later,

with Chief Lynn's lines being the last to be checked. There was

no indication of tampering or any illegal attachments on any of

the lines checked.

Sworn, signed statements concerning the above were

obtained from SAs Suter and Steinmeyer. SA Suter stated he was

particularly painstaking in these checks since he suspected that

equipment might be "planted" on the lines by J. I. Patterson, who

had advised Chief Lynn that his telephone line was "bugged."

During conference with USA Edward B. McDonough, JI.,

and members of his staff on 1/17/75, he advised he was not

Interested in discussing in detail allegations of misconduct by

Issues, including publicizing the contents of the tapes. e foresees the

possibility of FBI agents being subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury.

He indicated that any allegation can be refuted, but the damage is already

done.

He said the way the lOC case pertaining to alleged illegal

electronic surveillance activity by the HOPD was handled was not

representative of the caliber of work he expected of the FBi. He felt

that the case should have received an imaginative rather than a routine

approach; for example, the Chief of Police was alerted and some time

later interviews were conducted with his personnel, thus allowing the

police to gi together and agree on what should be said when interviewed.

He also said he was not interested in obtaining a volume of FD -302s

reflecting negative interviews. He was reminded that when knowledgeable

individuals are interviewed regarding matters which could be self-

incriminating quite often the results will be negative. Also, he did not

feel it was proper, as alleged, for an Agent to advise possible subjects

that the Statute of Limitations had run on many of the allegations that

were the basis for the investigation. SA Coitman advised that when

sitting in Captain Bond's Office, an officer asked what case the allegations

involved, and Coffman mentioned the Panda and Wimpy Week's case.

This officer asked what the Federal Statute of Limitations was and he was

told five years. This officer and other officers said the case identified

was over five years old and the officers appeared to be happy about this.

McDonough stated at the present time all Investigation has

been completed, but he expects the case to become very active after

testimony is talen beforo the FOJ (Convened 1/20/75). If this occurs,

he will require FBI assistance so long as we are prepared to refule any

allegations should thoy arise either in court or in the press. Ee was of

the opinion that the case should be assigned to personnel who have no

close contacts or parsoaal association with members of LOID. Inoractor

that any investigation requested be handled in a prompt and vigorous

manner and in such a way that no criticism can be leveled against the

Bureau or personnel of the Houston Office. Inspector advised USA

McDonough that the case would be reassigned and would be under the

personal supervision of the SAC.

That Some Bureau Agents Have, In the Past, Been Aware of Specific

Instances of Ileral Mectronic Survelllance By the HOPD and have

Been Feceptive to Information Derived Theretrom

Among the transcripts of Chief Lynn's conversations are state-

ments by Joe Singleton, former head of the ROPD Criminal Intelligence

Division, to the effect that an FBI Agent, "Swede Johnson" and another

Agent participated in and were receptive to information obtained from an

illegal HOPD wiretap.

SA William O. Johnson, Bank Robbery Coordinator of the

Houston Office, was interviewed at length during our inquiry. lie stated

that to the best of his recollection, he has handled only one ease wherein

Joe Singleton, a former officer oi HOPD,, was involved and that this case

occurred several years ago. The case in question is captioned "William

Neil Lee - Fugitive; et al.; Colonial Savings Association, 10$21 South

Post Qai Road, Houston, Texas, Bank Robbery, ITSMV," Houston file

91-1832.

A review of the files in this case revealed that Lee was

identified on 2/14/65, as one of the individuals who robbed the above

establishment on 2/8/66. The EBl, Chicago, advised FBI, Houston, on

• 2/14/06, that a Houston bank bag and a telegram addressed to Lee at a

Houston residence had been recovered from a stolen car in Chicago. Lee's

photograph was identified by employees of two recently robbed Houston

banks as one of the bank robbers.

SA Johnson was assigned the cases involving Lee and was

assisted by SA Joe P. Putty (now retired). The BOFD was also seeking

Lee, who was wanted for a number of local robberies, and their inves-

tigation was directed by Captain L. C. Colley.

On 2/17/66 SA Johnson advised our Chicago Office and FBIBQ

via teletype that an HOPD surveillance had been established on the residence

of Lee's girl friend and that lee had been in telephonic contact with her

twice and was believed to be planning to meet her on 2/18/68. The Houston

Office copy of this teletype had the word "technical" typed in preceding

the word surveillance. The teletype was sent at 10:18 p.m., on 2/17/66.

SA Johnson stated that he personally typed the office copy of the teletype

and made certain corrections in ink. He also initialed the office copy for

former SAC Frank V. Hitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted

that the word "technical" had been lined through with a pencil and Johnson

has no idea who did this. lie said it was SAC Hitt's policy to read or have

read to him all teletypes prior to their being sent; therefore, he assúmes

that either he or the night clerk read the teletype to Flitt due to the time

the teletype was sent and the word "technical" was lined through on Hitt's

orders. Le said the lining through of the word 'technical would have

been logical since he had no first-hand knowledge that the intormation

came from a technical surveillance, but could have come from a police

informant. He stated as best he can recall, he was turnished information

about the telephone calls orally by Captain Colley. During interview;

SA Johnson stated he typed the word "technical" on the teletype as it was

apparent to him that the information furnished pertained to telephone

conversations. On 2/18/66, after police showed Lee's photograph to an

apartment manager who advised Lee was residing in the building, Houston

police officers, one of whom was Lieutenant Joe Singleton, apprehended

Lee at 11:55 A.M. No FBI Agents participated in the arrest. Johnson

believes he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereatter he and

Patty proceeded to the Police Department where Lee, who was in police

custody, was interviewed.

Both Johnson and Patty denied ever being present at any location

at any time where an electronic surveillance was being conducted by per-

sonnel of the HOPD. SA Johnson stated he sent the teletype on 2/17/66, not

knowing whether the information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come

from a police informant or a police technical surveillance. He included

information in his report dated 3/10/60, which stated that Captain Colley

had advised him on 2/18/66, that Lee was located and arrested through

surveillance and other investigation conducted by the EOPD.

Memorandum to Mr. Callahan

Re: ALLEGATIONS OF POSSIBLE

MISCONDUCT BY FBI AGENTS

SA Johnson was asked if he was aware that a technical surveillance

by the HOPD could be a violation of the Federal Unlawful Publication or Use

of Communications Statute in force at that time. He replied that he was not

aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal knowledge that the

information furnished to him by Captain Colley had come from a technical

surveillance. There was no information developed during our inquiry that

any FBI personnel had any association with or personal knowledge of illegal

electronic surveillances.

On 1/7/58 former Director Hoover issued instructions that there

was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of wiretapping laws until

the FBI was directed to do so by the Criminal Division of the Department.

All SACs were advised on 1/8/58 to institute no investigation of any violation

of this type without prior Bureau approval. Similar instructions, in conjunction

with those of the FBI, were issued to all USAs by the Department. These

instructions were in force at the time of the alleged HOPD wiretap.

Inasmuch as SA Johnson received no complaint of illegal wiretapping,

and had no personal knowledge of such, his handling of the information in his

possession was appropriate.

That the Houston Field Office May Itself Have Engaged in Illegal Electronic

Surveillance

All personnel who would be in a position to have knowledge of such

activity denied that the Houston Field Office had engaged in illegal electronic

surveillance. The files of the Houston Office indicate that from 1954 to date,

two national security technical surveillances, one Title IlI surveillance, and

one Pen Register surveillance have been conducted. The national security

surveillances were authorized by the Bureau. The Pen Register and Title III

surveillances were approved by Court Order. Another national security

surveillance was authorized by the Bureau and equipment was installed but

never activated because the subject was identified as an 88 fugitive.

In conference with USA McDonough, he was asked if the basis for

the allegation in USA Farris' letter that the FBI was involved in illegal electronic

surveillance had emanated from a statement made in open Federal Court on

11/13/73, In the case entitled "Dudley Clifford Bell, Jr.; et al.; ICC" by

defense attorney Dick DeGuerin that "Larry Shaefer, who lilewise is a witness

in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equipment to Don Steinmeyer,

an FBI Agent, who is also a witness in this case." McDonough said he

assumed this was what Farris was alluding to. McDonough had said earlier

"how can we proceed with prosecution in the event indictments are returned

when the FBI may momentarily be accused or publicized as being or having

been engaged in illegal wiretaps.".

McDonough was advised that DeGuerin's statement was completely

false; that former AUSA Joe Doucette, who was representing the Government,

knew it was faise, but failed to refute it; and that AUSA Doucette was aware

that Larry Schaefer as a cooperating witness, bad furnished items of evidence

to SA Steinmeyer relating to the manufacture and sale of electronic surveillance

equipment to Dudley Bell. This material was to be used as evidence at the

trial. It had been submitted to the FBI Laboratory for comparison with other

evidence in the case and reports setting forth the resuits of the FBI laboratory

examination had been furnished to the USA's Office. In addition, De Guerin

and Dudley Bell had viewed this evidence in the Fiouston FBI Office prlor to

the trial. All witnesses were excluded from the courtroom except during the

time of their own testimony; therefore,. DeGuerin's statement stayed in the

record unchallenged. SA Steinmeyer testified at the trial but the matter never

came up during his testimony. It was several months aiter the trial when sA

Steinmeyer had his first opportunity to read the unrefuted statement made by

De Guerin.

The above information was also available to former USA Farris

because copies of the reports and the transcript were available to him. When

asked on 1/17/75, why former AUSA Doucette did not refute the statement

of DeGuerin, USA McDonough's only response was that some Federal judges

do not give Federal prosecutors the opportunity.

Additlonal Information concerning this matter is contained in

administrative write-ups which were prepared as a result of the inquiry

conducted both at EBLiQ and the Fouston Office. Recommendations relative

to any administrative action concerning personnel involved will be handled

separately.

OESERVATIONS: During this inquiry there were indications of a "vendetta"

between the Lia's Oifice and the TOPD. This may have hau its roots wen,

during the early days of the OSA's inquiry into the alleged illogal wiretersing

by the licio, former AlSA James F. Farier was forced to resign and stand

trial on charges of possession of narcotics. Parier is currently carried

as the victim of a ponding Civil Rights investigation, Houston file 44-4504.

The basis of this investigation is that a convicted narcotics violator planted

marijuana and ISD in Farter's apartment in November, 1971, at the

direction of the Narcotics Squad, HOPD, in order to "mase a case" on

Parker.

Two other AUSAs, one of whom was AUSA Wasia, were accused

by narcotics officers of the HOPD of smoking marijuana at "'pot"' parties.

Administrative Inquiries into these accusations were conducted at the request

of the Department. AUSA Waska vehemently, denied ever using any narcotics.

Former AUSA Theo W. Pinson, Ill, declined to discuss his personal life.

At about the same time these events were transyiring, former USA Farris

expressed concern that his and three of his assistants' telephones had been

tapped by the Narcoties Bureau, BOPD.

RECOMMENDATION: That the proposed memorandum setting forth the

results of our inquiry be approved and forwarded to Deputy Attorney General

Silber man.

ALLEGATIONS OF FOSSIBLE MISCONDUCT

BY FBI AGENTS, HOUSTON, TEXAS

This is in response to your memorandum dated January 7, 1975,

captioned as above, with attachments, requesting information in the

possession oi the FBi relative to the allegations. As a result, inquiries

have been conducted both at FBI Headquarters and our Houston Citice to

resolve each allegation. It should be noted, that due to numerous gaps in

the transcrints furnished by iormer United States Attorney Farris, Southern

District of Texas, there is a loss of continuity in some of the pertinent

conversations. This problem was discussed with United States Attorney

Edward B. MeDonough, Jr., Southern District of Texas, who advised

that although he had in his possesion a complete transcript, the Depart-

mert had furnished the FBI oniy those portions he deemed to be significant.

The first allegation is that Pureau Agents have eschewed a vigorous

Investigation of the alleged illegal electrenic surveillance aétivity by the

Houston Folice Department. In this connection, a thorouch review has been

conducted of the case captioned, "Jerry L. Slaughter, also known as, et al,

Interception of Communications," Explanations and sworn statements bave

been obtained from appropriate FBI personnel.

This inquiry has failed to reveal anything which could be considered

substantial delay or lacis of willingness on the part of FBI personnel io

pursue all logical investigative avenues available. United States Attorney

MCDonough arised at the time oi interview on January 17, 1975, that 20

investigation remained to be conducied; however, he expected considerable

investigaiion to resuit irom testimony to be given by witnesses who were to

start appearing before the Federal Grand Jury Convening Of January 20, 1875,

and he was assured full cooperation in this regard.

This case was opened in the custon Office on December 7, 1973, by

former Special Agent in Chazge Thomas J. Jordan and assigned to Special Agent

Richard W. Suter based on a complaint made December 3, 1573, to Special

Agent Suter and Billy D. Bubbard, security Supervisor, Southwestern Bell

Telephone Company, to the effect that Attorney Philip Greene had a tape recording

di Jacis Storz's voice allegedly made from an illegal wiretap by the Narcotics

Division of the Houston Police Department. On December 18, 1973, the case was

reassigned to Special Agent Harlan @. Coffman by Supervisor William J. Schmidt

and the case has been under Supervisor Schmidt's supervision and assigned to

Spacial Agent Cofiman since that time. The case was reassigned from Special

Agent Suter who had annual leave scheduled in December, 1973, followed by a

commitment to attend a training, school at the FBl Academy, Guantico, Virginia,

early in January: This reassignment was made to preclude any delay in

investigation.

Investigation was conducted regariing the original allegation and on

February 28, 1974, the case was closed after Assistant United States Attorney

Ronald J. Waska, Southern District of Texas, rendered an opinion that no

evidence was available to support the allegatione.

The case was reopened by Supervisor Schmidt on March 8, 1974, and

assigned to Special Agent Colman based on a United Press International news

release on February 28, 1974, furnished to the Houston Cifice by FBI Feadquarters

which indicated that nine lousion Police Department officers had been inuicted

by a Federal Grand Jury for various crimes including conspiracy to place illegal

wiretaps, stealing money and heroin from prisoners and narcotics traffickers,

selling stolen heroin and filing faise tax returns.

The case was discussed with Assistant United States Attorney Waska

by Special Ayert Coliman on March 11, 1574. Wasia advised that no clarges

Involving Interception of Communications had been made due to lack of prooi,

however, wiretapping was included in charges against the defendants and the

evidence of this was in the possession of the United States Attorney's otilce,

Southern District of Texas. This evluence consisted solely of an aifidavit of

one Michael Chavez, whom Wasia described as an undercover informant who

desired that his name not be made public. Tasia said he planned to furnish

"Chavez's affidavit to the Houston FBI Citice within two weess.

By letter dated April 23, 1974, received in the Houston Cifice May 1, 1974

(approximately seven weess aiter the discussion with Waska on Narch 11, 1974),

54960 DocId: 32989725

The Deputy Attorney General

Waska furnished a copy of Chavez's aifidavit, which was dated January 29, 1974.

Inis affleavit was taken by Jack C. follenshead, Jr., Special Agent, Toternal

Revenue Service, and witnessed by two other Internal Revenue Service Agents.

Due to Waska's delay in submitting the Chavez affidavit, the case was

placed in a closed status on April 1, 1974. It was reopened on May 1, 1974,

and again assigned to Special Agent Coffman. In l'assa's letter of April 29, 1974,

he stated that in the event investigation was not in progress he desired that a

comprehensive investigation commence immediately.

The Chavez affidavit on which the investigation was to be based, was obtainei

at the Harris County) Jail where he was awaiting sentencing for masing false state-

ments before a Federal Grand Jury. He had plead guilty to one count of a three

count indictment and furnished in his alfidavit, a "portion" of his knowledge of

illegal wiretaps conducted by officers of the Narcotles Division, #custon Police

Department against alleged narcotics traitickers.

Along with the Chavez affidavit, Wassa enclosed with his letter of

'April 29, 1974, four reela of magretic recording tape, two of which had been

in his custody since November 21, 1973, and two since November 26, 1973. Ee

advised Special Agent Cofiman that the tapes were approximately ten years old

and of no presecutive value. Le requested that they be maintained in the FBI

office.

Of the six different Houston Police Department cases mentioned by

Chavez as having been "made" with illegal wiretaps, the Federal Statute of

Limitations bai run on four at the time Waska furnished the atfidavit to the

FBl. All pertinent logs and transcripts had been destroyed and all tapes

erased according to the Chavez adfidavit.

On May 14, 1974, Waska advised the original indictments had been

dismissed and new ones were being sougist.

With regard to this case, a situation prevailed in which: (1) the only

evidence was an affidavit of B convicted purjure awaiting sentencing; (2) the

FBI was precluded from intervlewing Chavez and any individuals unuer indictment;

and (3) other inowleugeable parties are or were veteran police officers who

could incriminate themselves by furnishing information.

Captain B. G. Bond's memorandum to Chief of Police C. M. Lyon

dated December 13, 1974, inferred that Special Agent Coitrian told Officer

I. A. Eell on iMay 28, 197%, that like Chavez was a thiel; that ke had quite a

bit of informatica in Bell's case; that he inew the apariments Bell bad "set up

In' and that Special Agent Coffman knew that Bell "furnished the bug and hung it."

Further, that Social Agent Coifman told Ball that the case involved tomboza

Garza and occurred in June, 1008. Special Agent Colman has auvised tat

when intervlewing Beil be informed Bell that he was aware of detailed intorma-

tion concerning the Pompoza Garza case and it was his understanding tol

had placed the tao. Special Agent Coilman denias tiling Eell that the Garza

case occurred in june, lios, as alleged or that tire Chaveawas a thial. H3l

records reveal that the interview with Bell lasted approsimately three minutes

and the information furnished to Bell by Speciad Agent Coitman was intended

to elicit pertinent information relative to alleged lllegal activitias on toe part

of Bell.

Carol S. Vance, District Attorney, Harris County, Texas, in a letter

to United States Attorney Farris ch November 20, 1973, indicates that Carlos

Avila and Tony Zavain, two former Houston police ofticers under irdiciment

for conspiracy to seil marijuana, alleged through their attorneys that the

Narcotics Division, Houston Police Lepartment, had engaged in illezal elecironic

euryaillance. This letter States that Bob Bennett, Office oi the Districe Attorney,

Harris County, Texas, brought these allegaticas to the attention ci former

Special Agent in Charma Tom Jordan. It is true that Eennett and two of his

assistants did mast with Jordan and our inquiry indicates that Jordan asited

that specific facts ba furnished and that he would have a secretary come in

and record them. At that time Bennett ended the conversation and leit. Upe

interview with Phil Greene, one at the attorneys rogresenting Avila and Zavala

he could furnish no specifics o illegal wirstapping by the Houston Police Depari

ment. He cifered to provide a witness it the rederal Government woud grant

the witness immunity. The resuits of this interviaw were iumished to tha

United States Attorney's Oftice, Southern District of Tezas, in a report dated

February 28, 1974.

Bennett was also interviewed at which time he indicated he had discussed

allegations made by the attorneys for Avila and Zavala with jordan. Eo said he

had no spacitics at that time and was "taking everything with a grain of sait?

due to his past relationships with these attorneys.

contains allegations oi an inadequate investigation by the FBI to determine l Chief

Lynn's telephones and those of his staft wera tapped. Inquiry into this ratter has

determined that a thorough and comprehensive check of all telephone lines at all

Babstatlona was made. This check included tracing the conduit which contained

the lines and each appearance at various switching centers. These checks were

made by I BI Agents sath the assistance of telephone security personnel and a tele -

phone employee at each supstation as they wes checked. A check oi the lines

commenced the same date the telepaone numbers were furnished and was

concluded approximately 10 days later with Chlet Lyna's Lines being the last to

be checked. There was no incication of lampering or any illegal attachments

ou any of the lines checked.

Concerning the above it appears there has been no impropriety on the

part of FBI personnel in louston, l'ezas. All Investigation appears to have

been conducted in a proper manner with all logical leads promptly covered.

The caly delay, other than that by Wasta in furnishing Chavez Sallidavit,

was a delay from july 26, 1974, to September 26, 1974. During this ceriod

Special Agent Coitman stated in a report cated October 22, 1974, kbat Assistant

Ualted States Attorney haaka had advised him on september 23, 1974, that he bad

not had time lo completel y review special Agent Colman's report of July 30,

1974, and that Waska had not desired any investigation curing this period. In

a letter dated October 5i, 1974, cores of which were sent to the Depariment,

Waska took exception to chis.

He advised be had not requested any delay oi

investigation, it should be noted that the only cuistanding lead in the July 30,.

197%, report was to monintain contact with Waska for a prosecutive ovinion and

any further investization. This would indicate Special Agent Cotiman believed there

was no pending investigation to be conducted.

Discussions were held during this inquiry with United States Attorney

McDonagh and members of his stall. Complete FBI cooperation was oliered.

Efforts were made to provide point-by-poini informa ion concerning te allegations

I appears there has been an increasing paucity of communication

and confidence between the investigative and prosecutive arms of the Department

in the Fouston, Texas, area. This could wors to the disadvantage of our

mutual responsibilities. Every effort was made during our inquiry to dispel

any lack of confidance in our personnel which might exist in the minds of the

United States Attorney and his stati. McDonough was advised that Special

Agent in Charge Robert Fuss Franck of the Houston FBI Office has been

directed to personally supervise this case. Fe was also advised that Francs

had been instructed to reassign the matter to a mature and thoroughly experienced

investigator having no close associations either projessionally or personally

with members of the Houston Police Department. McDonough stated that he now

believed the fBI could conduct the investigation in a proper manner if further

Investigation is aesired as a result oi Federal Grand Jury hearings, so long as we are

prepared to refute any allegations of misconduct arising from publicity of the

recordings made by Chief Lynn and other allegations in documents urnished

by Lynn.

-Your memorandum also furnished other allegations of misconduct on

the part of Houston, Texas, FBI personnel. One of these alleges that some

FBI Agents have, in the past, been aware of specific instances of illegal

electronic surveillance by the Houston Police Department and have been

receptive to information derived therefrom.

Our inquiry in Houston disclosed that through the press the püblic

has been deluged with publicity concerning "tugging' activities by the Houston

Police Department. Television stations are said to be in gossession of tane

recordings made by Chief Lynn, as ke inquired into illegal wiretaps whic

allegedly took piace under the aegis of his predecessor.

The recorded

conversations were with present and former members of the houston Folice

Department. Ailegations of illegal wiretapping and other abuses of police powers

have been leveled chiefly at the Narcotics and Criminal intelligence Divisions

of the Lousica Folice jepartment. Charges of information concerning personal

misconduct by Ziouston public citicials bas fanned the ilames oi public curiosity

concerning police wiretapping. In the midst of the furor, a Federal Grand Jury

has been convened to gather information by the granting of immunity to witnesses,

relative to any illegal wiretapping conducted by the Louston Folice Department.

Amn ong the transcripts of Chiel Lynn's conversations furnished to the

FBI, are statements by Joe singieton, former head of the Criminal Intalligence

Division, Liouston l'olice Depariment, to the effect that an FBI Agent, "swede

Johnson, " and another Agent participated in and were receptive to intormation

obtained from an illegal wiretap.

Special Agent William O. Johnson, Bank Robbery Coordinator of tha

Houston, Texas, FBI Office, was

interviewed at lenth during our inquiry. te

stated that to the best of his recollection he had handled only one case a number

of years ago that also involved Joe Singleton, a former citicer of the kiouston

Police Department. The case in question is captioned, "William Neil Lee - rugitive,

Et Al. Colonial Savings Association, 1042) South Pest Oals Foad, Houston, Texas,

Bank Robbery; IISMV.'

A review of the files revealed that Lee was identified on February 14,

1986, as one of the individuals who robbed the above establishment on february e,

1966. The FBI, Chicago, advised FBI, Houston, on Fabruary 14, 1006, that a

Houston bank bag and a telegram acüressed to Leg at a Houston residence had

been recovered from a stolen car found in Chicago. Lee's photograph vas

identified by employees of two recenily robbed douston banza an one of tha

bank robbers.

Special Agent Johnson was assigned the cases and was agsisted by

Special Agent doe L. Patty (now retired). The Ecuston Police Department

was also seeking Lee who was wanted for a numher of local rosberies., Their

investigations were directed by Captatu L. C. Colley.

On February 17, 1966, Special Ageut Jahnson adriged FBI, Chicaro,

and FBI Headquarters via teletype that a Houston Police Department surveillance

had been established on the residence of Lee's girl friend and that Lea had been

in telephonic contact with bes and was believed to be planning to meet her ca

February 18, 1966. The Houston FBI Ofitce copy of this teictype had the word

"technical" typed in preceding, the word surveillance. The teletypa was sent

at 10:18 p.w., on February 17, 1920. Special Agent Johnson stated that he

parsonally typed the ollica copy oi the teletype and made cartain corrections in

ink. He also initialed the cifice copy for former Special Agent in Charge Frank V.

Bitt with his own initials underneath. It was noted that the word "technical" had

been lined through with & pencil and Johnson has no idea who did this. Le said

it was titt's solicy to read or have read to him all teletypes prior to their being

sent; therefore, he assumes that either he or the nigat clerk read the teletype

to Hitt dus to the time the teletype was sent and the word 'technical" was lined

have beer logical'since he had no first-hand knowledge that the information

came irom a technical surveillance, but could have come from a police informa

ant.

he stated as best he can recall, he was furnished intormation about the

telephone calls orally by Captain Colley. During interview Special Agent Johnson

stated he typed the word "technical" on the teletype as it was apparent to him that

the information turnished pertained to telephone conversatione. Un February 18,

1986, after police showed Lee's photograph to an apartment manager who advised Lee

was residing in the bulling, Houston police oificers, one of whom was ideutenant

Joe Singleton, apprehended Lee at Il:55 A.hi. NO FBI Agents participated in the

arrest.

Johnson balk eves he was telephonically advised of the arrest and thereaiter

he and Fatty proceeded to the Police Department where Lee, who was in police

custody, was Interviewed.

Both Johnson and Iatty denied ever listening to, participating in or being

present at any location at any time where an electronic surveillance was being

conducted by the bouston Police Department. Special Agent Johnach stated he sent

the teletype on February 17, 1966, not knowing whether the information furnished

to hire by Captain Colley had come from a police informant or a police technical

surveillance. Be included information in his report dated liarch 30, 1960, which

stated that Captain Colley had advised him on February 18, 1966, that lee was

located and arrested through surveillance and other investigation conducted by the

Houston Folica Department.

Special Agent Johason was asted if he was aware that a technical

surveillance by the Houston Police Department could be a violation of the Federal

Unlamêul Fublication or Use of Communications Statute in force at that time. He

replied that he was not aware it was a violation inasmuch as he had no personal

anowledge that the intormation furnished to him by Captain Colley bad come from a

technical surveillance. There was no intormation developed during our inquiry that

any FBI persoonel had sny association with or personal knowledge of illegal

electronic surveillances,

On January 7, 1958, former FBI Director J. Ldgar Hoover Issued

instructions that there

was to be no investigation of any alleged violation of

wiretapping laws until the FBi was directed to do so by the Criininal Divid on

of the hepartment. All Special Agents in Charge were advised on January 3,

1958, to iustitate no investigation of any violation of this type without prior

Bureau approval. Similar instructions in conjuncion with those of te t Bl

were Issued to all United States Attorneys by the Department. These Instrue

tions were in force at the time oi the alleged Houston Police Department

wiretap.

The Deputy Attorney General

Inasmuch as Special Agent Johason received no complaints of illegal

wiretapolng and had no personal kowledge of such, his handling of the intor-

mation in his possession was appropriate.

The final allegation mentioned in your communication has to do with

the possibility that the Houstoa Bl Office may itsall have engaged in illegal

electronic surveillance. From a review oi the information furnished, dis

cassions with United states Attornay licIonough, and interviews of FBi per-

sonnal, the only basis for such an allegation wouid appear to be contained in

statements made in open Federal court by Defense Attorney Dick DeGuerin

i Wyomber 12, 3073, vaticase Store a Come all sta

DeGuerin stated that "Larry Shaefer, who lixewise is a witness for the Govern-

ment in this case, has sold electronic eavesdropping equinment to Don

Steinmeyer, an FBI Agent, who is aiso a witness in this case."

This statement by DeGusrin is completely false. Former Assistant

United States Attorney Joe Doucatte, who was representing the Government

knew the statement was taise but failed io reiute it. He was aware that Larry

Shaefer, as a cooperating witness, had furnished items i evidence relating to

tha maniactura and saie of electronie surveillance equipment to Dudley Bell.

This material was to be evidence in the trial. It had been submitted to tha

FIl Laboratory for comparisonparposes. Laboratory reports concerning it

had been furnished to the United States Attorney, to be introduced in the trial,

and DaGuerin and Ludley Bell had viewed this evidance prior to the trial, in

the Houston FBI Oifice. All witnesses were excluded from the trial except

during their own testimony and DeGuerin never broached the sublect during

Special Agent Steinmeyer's testimony. It was several months after the trial

when Steinmeyer had his first opportunity to read the transcript containing

the falacious unreiuted statement by DeGuerin. All of the above information

was available to former United States Attorney Farris since copies oi tha

reports and court transcripts had been turnished to him. United states

Attorney licDonough was apprised of this in our conterence on january 17,

1975, and was asted why Loucette did not relute DeGuerin's allegation.

McDonough's oniy expianation was that some Federal judges do not give

Federal prosecutors the opportunity.

All other allegations of possible misconduct contained in the material

furnished by the Department, which could be construed as referring to the

FBI, have been thoroughly explored and no basis was found as to their validity.

The Deputy Attorney General

The FBI will continue every effort to assure that all investigation requested

by United States Attorney McDonough is handled expeditlously and in a thorough

manner.

On January 24, 1975, FBI Deputy Associate Director J. B. Adams

was contacted by John Keeney, Acting Assietant Attorney General of the Criminal

Division of the Department, who advised he had been in contact with United States

Attorney McDonough who was under the impression that the Department was going to

insist that FBI Agents from outside the Houston Division be utilized in conducting

the investigation concerning allegations of illegal wiretapping on the part of the

Houston Police Department. Mix. Keeney advised McDonough that such was net

the agreement and that the FBI was going to remain on the investigation utilizing

personnel of the FEI's choice. At that time Mi'. Feeney was advised that we were

reassigning the case to an Agent who has no extensive contacts with the Rouston

Police Department, the same practice we follow in Clvil Rights investigations

which would insure that we would be free from allegations of bias in favor of the

police department. Mir. Keeney was assured that in the event additional

personnel were needed in the Houston Field Division in order to aggressively

investigate these allegations the Bureau would send personnel from other FeI

Field Divisions but at that potni we had not received any such request from the

Special Agent i Charge of the Houston Office. Mr. Keeney asked Mr. Adams

to contact the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Office to insure that he

was aware of the fact that if he needed additional personnel to investigate this

matter the Bureau would give him full support.

Shortly thereafter Mr. Adams contacted the Special Agent in Charge

of the Houston Office who stated he had advised United States Attorney McDonough

that a Resident Agent in Galveston, Texas, was proceeding to Houston to assume

investigative responsibility for this case. Also, if necessary, he will bring

in additional Agents from Resident Agencies to assiat in the investigation.

On January 31, 1975, Mr. Keeney contacted Mr. Adams stating that

United States Attorney McDoncugh still desires that FBI Agents from cutside the

Houston Division be assigned to investigate this case. Mr. Keeney informed

Mr. Adams that he dis not concur with United States Attorney NicDonough, that

the FBI was alert to the problem in this case and in the event auditional FBI personnel

were needed to investigate this matter, they would be nade available.

As previously

indicated the Special Agent in Charge of the Houston Cifice was directed to

personally supervise this case. On February 4, 1075, he advised that this

case is being personally supervised by him.

ing to the Black Axtremist Cointelpro were

made available for access to HSC Staff

Members, including Mr. Nermiere, in Room

+204, JEH, on 9/22/75 Included in this

group of documents were three serials relat-

but only with regard to his position as

principal of a high school and there was

no indication/ in the serial that he desirec

On September 25, 1975, Mr. Joseph

Recording Company, telephone number 488-3900, telephonically

i, advised me that he has been requested by the House Committee to

appear for an interview at 10:00 a.m. on September 26, 1975, the

subject of which was not specified.

Mr. Tait was advised that should the subject of the interview

concern FBI purchases of equipment from his company relating to Bureau

needs pursuant to Title III, we would have no objection to him discussing

such matters with Committee representatives. However, should the inquiry

concern other matters, it would be appropriate for him to suggest to the

Committee representatives that their inquiry should be addressed to the.

Bureau. I furnished him my name and telephone number as a point of

contact in the event he desired to raise any questions during the course

of the interview.

RE: REQUEST FOR, INFOTMATION CONCENNING IDENTITY AND PAYIENTS

TO FBI INFORMAVTS AS VELI AS TAX RECORDS FILED REGARDING

SUCH PAYMENTS

and as pertinent information pertaining to all such decuctions

became available, this Bureau tould subnit to Internal Revenue

Service (IRS) a coded list of informants vith tar deductions

withheld for each, along vith a bank cheek made out to IRS

for the total amount withheld. At no time did this Bureau

file any individual tax returns for informants.

It should be noted that because IRS rccords are

nov computerized, making it impossible for IRS to provide

proper security for continuance of the above procedure, and

to effect, for this Bureau, a considerable nonetary savings

in clerical and Agent salaries required to maintain extensive

records in this regard, this Bureau, effective August 19, 1975,

discontinued the practice of withholding tax deductions made

from informant payments.

In response to request Number 2 above, there are

enclosed tax reports filed by this Bureau with the IRS

reflecting tar deductions mode from informant paynents

covering the calendar years 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1973,

By letter dated 8/27/75, we received

al request for

the interviews of four Agents by the House Select Committee.

Some of the Agents who were requested to be made available for

testimony are defendants in a civil proceeding arising out of

Simultaneous with this request, by

letter dated 8/27/75 from the House Select Committee, we

also

received a request for material pertaining to the investigation

out of which the aforementioned civil action arose.

. Upon re-

ceipt of this request, SA Paul V. Daly of this Division ex-

pressed his concern to Michael E. Shaheen, JI., Special Counsel

Ior Intelligence Coordination in the Department, and his Deputy,

Steven Blackhurst, pointing out that the avenue of inquiry by

the House Select Committee could have an adverse impact on the

pending civil litigation and that careful consideration should

be given as to the Department's and Bureau's response to these

requests.

He was also advised that the Agents themselves were

being sued in both an individual and official capacity; and,

course,

an adverse judicial finding could financially affect

the Agents involved.

At the Department's

request on 9/9/15, SA Daly attended

a meeting in the Department with Sally Whittaker of the Civil

Division, Jim Reynolds of the Criminal Division, Michael E.

Shaheen, Jr., and Steven Blackhurst to discuss the House Select

Committee requests concerning the aforementioned matter.

Whittaker who was handling the civil litigation involving Bureau

personnel in the Bureau and Reynolds who is in the process of

presenting to a Federal Grand Jury a criminal violation con-

nected to the law suit stated they felt that the Committee's

requests would not have an adverse impact on either of these

matters. Reynolds did request that certain material be with-

held from the Committee which he had intended to use as re-

buttal material in the event the criminal matter went to trial.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams

RE: HOUSTUDY

SA Daly expressed concern at the request for interview by the

House Select Committee and stated it would appear in the in-

terests of the Department and the Government that if such

interviews were allowed, the Department furnish the Agents

legal representation.

The Department agreed that they would

provide legal representation to the Agents if they were in-

terviewed by the House Select Committee.

Subsequently, a meeting was held on the same date

with Richard Vermeire and Tim Oliphant, House Select Committee

Staff Members, and they agreed orally to special procedures

concerning this particular matter relating to the productior

and handling of documents.

They indicated that they would

have to secure approval

from their superiors and would con-

firm their approval in writing. As of 9/10/75, the Committee

has not furnished the Department a written agreement pertaining

to their requests.
