Tuesday - 15 March 1977

4. (Unclassified - GLC) LIAISON During the course of the

day, I spoke twice to Richard Sprague, Counsel. House Select

with Admiral Turner his question about access to information on

Santos Trafficante but I wanted him to know that certain information

relating to the John F. Kennedy assassination had been released by

our Freedom of Information people in response to several Freedom

of Information requests and that I was sending copies of that material

to him today. I also mentioned that the Senate Select Committee on

Intelligence and the Church Committee had had access to the type of

information he was desirous of seeing and the results of their inquiry

into this matter had been contained in the Church Committee's interim

report on assassinations. Sprague said he was aware of that report.

Later in the day, I called Sprague to tell him that I had talked with the

Director. The Director felt that in view of the President's serious

concern about the proliferation of sensitive intelligence information

he (Turner) did not feel that he could grant the Committee staff access

to any of the material in Agency files until suitable clearances had

been obtained and secrecy agreements had been executed. Sprague

did not quarrel with this decision and thanked me "for my efforts."
