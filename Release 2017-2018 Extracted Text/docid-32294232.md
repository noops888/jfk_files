CHICAGO

At Chicago, Illinois:

Will maintain contact with PCI

CG6656-PC-TE as well as any other informants or sources

who know of ALDERISIO's activity for indications of

reaction on his part since he apparently suspects the

Investigation is under way and also for any indicationg

of his method of interstate travel to or from Miami about

states appears to be considerably more relaxed

now that he feels confident he will not be indicted on

this matter. However, because of EGAN's severe heart con-

dition, he should not be interviewed extensively, and all

reasonable consideration should be given him since it appears

he is now cooperative, and, therefore, anything that might

oy anything that

excite him of tax his health should be avoided. EGAN should

be interviewed for all data he might possess to establish

the date of the meeting in KAY's office at Miami Beach,

which meeting BRAY indicated was probably in late May, 1962,

or sometime in early June, 1962.

In the

event EGAN was a

guest at the Nautilus Hotel on any dates later than those

listed in this report, the approximate dates should be

ascertained. If EGAN is able to recall the hotel where he

was staying when he met ALDERISIO 1n KAY's office, it might

be possible to establish the date of this meeting. Also,

EGAN mentioned he would search his records at home since

he might have check stubs or travel coupons to show the date

of his travel to Miami Beach about late May or early June,

1962. Since BRAY has apparently been in contact with EGAN

since EGAN returned from the Miami Grand Jury, EGAN should

be interviewed to determine what data he learned from BRAY.

2. Will maintain close contact with Depart-

the results of their interviews with BRAY in New Orleans

and other places.

At North Miami, Florida:

Will re-interview HARRY BROOK and exhibit

seeing EGAN in KAY's office when ALDERISIO was there.

ADMINISTRATIVE

When Departmental Attorney HARRINGTON tele-

phonically advised SA LENIHAN on 7/26/63 of the fact

that he and PELOQUIN had interviewed BRAY, SA LENIHAN

was engaged full time in a lengthy trial on case cap-

tioned

"MICHAEL ROSA, aka. et al, ITSP; CONSPIRACY,

Bureau file No. 87-69249.

Therefore, there was no

opportunity to immediately interview

HARRINGTON to

determine the results of his interview with BRAY.

INFORMANTS

On 7/8/03, former MM 722-C advised SA PRUE C.

CLINKSCALES he had

just learned of a severe fire at the

Fireside Restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, In which

that restaurant was completely burned.

Source advised that

he had been in Chicago during the period from mid June to

July 2, 1903, and while there was

in almost dally contact

with Bureau Agents of the Chicago Office.

He said that he

learned of an Intensified investigation being made by the

Chicago FBI Office believed to be at the specific request

of the Department of Justice, concerning the fires at

several large restaurants in

the Chicago area in which

arson was suspected. Such restaurants in Chicago are

reportedly owned by numerous "syndicate" or "outfit"

boys who are suspected of burning such restaurants

because of business failure.

Source advised that as best he can learn

"Milwaukee Phil," whose correct name he could not furnish

Immediately but

who is well-known to various FBI Offices,

reportedly had a financial interest in one or more of the

restaurants in Chicago which had burned and acording to

Information he had received, "Milwaukee Phil" also had

a financial interest in the Fireside Restaurant, at

Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which burned either the night

of 7/6 or 7/7/63.

Source continued that it is entirely

possible that

"Milwaukee Phil" is not the owner or partner

'of record" but is merely a

the

silent or hidden partner in

Fireside Restaurant which burned.

PCI

and CG6656-PC-TE both advised

that they are

familiar with ALDERISIO's current activities.

Both of these individuals stated that it is Impossible

to determine as to whether ALDERISIO was In Miami, Florida,

In March or April, 1962, because in dealing with ALDERISIO

no one asks him any questions or delves into his business.

On July 11, 1963, a discussion was had

with the Departmental Attorneys ROBERT D. PELOQUIN and

EDWARD HARRINGTON in their office in Room 1604 In the Congress

Building.

Mr. PELOQUIN stated that he was havine the

transcript of the Grand Jury proceedings on

Jury that the transcript would be available to the

Federal Bureau of Investigation since he desired additional

investigation conducted on this matter. Mr. PELOQUIN

against either or both.

out to Mr. PELOQUIN that the record of Central

BRAY made this trip to Chicago and back could be determined,

Mr. PELOQUIN stated that an Interstate Transporta-

tion in Aid of Racketeering violation against ALDERISIO

and TRAFFICANtE would require considerably more work and,

therefore, he did not expect to be able to have an indictment

returned against either or both of these individuals in the

next session of this Grand Jury. : Mr. PELOQUIN pointed out

that it would be necessary to prove the interstate travel

on the part of ALDERISIO and/or TRAFFICANTE in connection

with the threats ALDERISIO made to EGAN. Mr. PELOQUIN

stated since the exact dates of these threats have not

yet been ascertained it is his hope, through recontact

with EGAN and BRAY, contact with the Fontainebleau Hotel

and possibly a check of ALDERISIO's travels about June of

1962, to be able to show ALDERISIO making interstate travel

prior to the time he threatened EGAN.

EGAN seemed quite confident that on the morning

he went to Miami International Airport to meet BRAY on

Associates firm in Glenview, Illinois. EGAN's recollection

was that MELVIN BOLDT stated he had been in Miami to attend

a convention of Zenith dealers and EGAN understood from

BOLDT that he had been staying at the Diplomat Hotel in

Hallandale, Florida.

he related to EGAN that he had some trouble getting into

Contra case a hat a dog one you

the Central Casualty Company office when he tried to get

in there about midnight.

EGAN's recollection is that BRAY

mentioned that either CELESTE RUDDY or some other Central

Casualty Company employee was contacted by BRAY and in some

way assisted BRAY to get into the company office. EGAN

presumed BRAY was talking about getting into the main

Office of Central Casualty Company, which he believed was

then located at 208 South Lasalle Street, Chicago, Illinois.

EGAN added that at the time he met ALDERISIO in

KAY's office he estimated it was probably in the spring of

1962 and although he could not recall the date, he believed

at the time he was

staying at the Nautilus Hotel on Miami

Beach. EGAN added that just about all the travel and hotel

expenses EGAN as well as BRAY incurred during the period

when Central Casualty Company was operating were charged

to the central Casualty Company. EGAN stated he might have

some records at his residence in Denver that would show

the dates of his travel to Miami after Central Casualty

went out of business since his recollection is he paid for

these trips himself.

MM 87-16480

On July 26, 1963, Departmental Attorney EDWARD

HARRINGTON advised that he and Mr. PELOQUIN had recently

been in contact with BRAY who related that his best

estimate is that EGAN's meeting with ALDERISIO In KAY'&

Miami Beach office probably occurred about the first week

in June, 1962.

Mr. HARRINGTON also advised that ALDERISIO

sometimes uses the name Mr. PHILLIPS when he travels.

On July 30, 1963, the Greater Miami, Florida,

Numerical Telephone Directories dated September, 1960,

September, 1961, and September, 1962, were checked to

determine who had service at the phone numbers called

from the room that BRAY and EGAN had at the Airport Hotel

in May, 1901. It appears that FRanklin 3-0441 was ser-

vice

for Delta Air Lines, NEwton 4-3511 was

service for Eastern Air

lines, NEwton 3-6411 was service for Northeast Air Lines,

and

NEwton 3-6501 was service for Northwest Air Lines.

HIghland 8-1771 was apparently service for Traurig

Insurance Agency of 3031 Coral Way, Miami. Through a

check of these directories It was not possible to

determine who had phone service at HIghland 4-0781 in

May, 1961.

On August 1, 1963, Departmental Attorney EDWARD

HARRINCTON advised that when

JFK Law 10(a)2

Grand Jury,

he indicated he

was in periodic contact with BRAY. EGAN Indicated that

BRAY might be agreeable to talking to Government repre-

sentatives since he apparently was not too closely asso-

ciated with ALDERISIO and some of ALDERISIO's cronies.

Mr. HARRINGTON stated several days after EGAN returned

to Denver, he phoned their office to say that BRAY might

contact them, and some several days. later BRAY did phone

them and an appointment was made to meet them at a Miami

motel during the week of July 22, 1963. BRAY indicated

that he did not desire to discuss the Pan American Bank

$125,000 loan but that he would be willing to discuss

some

parts of his dealings with ALDERISIO and others.

BRAY related that soon after EGAN was threatened

by ALDERISIO in KAY's office on Miami Beach about late May

or early June, 1962, EGAN phoned BRAY to tell him about

recollection 1s that ALDERISIO had contacted

him about two weeks earlier and asked BRAY if he wanted

ALDERISIO to go to Miami Beach to try to collect on the

deal BRAY had with KAY.
