declared "we must be cautious

Fidel Castro's two-hour

speech on 23 November, which

he

termed an "objective analysis"

of the implications of the

assassination, warned Cubans

that the President's death was

"serious and

bad news."

It

The Communist World

SOVIET STANDDOWN ON BERLIN AUTOBAHN HARASSMENT

Moscow apparently has de-

cided to refrain from harass-

ing Allied convoys on the Berlin

autobahn, at least for the time

being.

On 21 November the USSR

replied to the Western notes of

6 November which protested te

detention of the Us convoy on

45 November.

The main purpose

of the reply was

to restate for

the public record the Soviet

claim that the June 1945 agree

ment between the Soviet and

Western commanders in Germany

gave the USSR the right to ex-

ercise "protection, maintenance

supervision,

and control"

on

highways used by the Western

garrisons in Berlin.

The Soviet note sought to

strengthen this claim by stating

that the "harmonized procedures"

conveyed by the Western powers

on 29 October "are in no degree

valid for Soviet military au-

thorities."

Moscow denied

that American authorities have

any right to establish the ob

ligations and "manner of opera

tion" of Soviet checkpoint of-

ficials.

The note reflected Moscow's

sensitivity to the point made

in the Western notes contrast-

ing the detention of the US

convoy with the normal process-

ing accorded closely similar

British and French convoys on

5 November which also refused

to dismount.

Moscow took ref-

uge

in the pretense that

these latter convoys were not

challenged because they observed

existing procedures

and

"presented neir personnel for

checking," whereas the US con-

voy was detained until it agreed

to "go through the same check."

The passage since the 4-5

November incident of five con

voys of a size which are non

dismountable under Allied pro-

cedures, the 16 November Soviet

statement on access procedures,

and Moscow's 21 November note

all suggest that Moscow has

decided to accept a standoff

in the autobahn dispute for the

present.

The Soviet procedures

marked a clear retreat from

earlier extreme demands that all

personnel in convoys of more

than five vehicles are obliged

to dismount. Although the Soviet

procedures are not identical to

the Western

"harmonized proce

dures," the differences are not

great

enough

in themselves

to

give rise to curther incidents.

The Soviet rules seem to pro-

vide Moscow with

a practical

working arrangement not incon-

sistent with normal Western

convoy practices.

In light of the failure

to divide the Allies on the

access issue and the reper-

cussions of the Barghoorn case,

Soviet leaders probably de-

cided

ations.

Their efforts to es-

tablish an exclusive right to

control autobahn traffic, how

revive this issue whenever

theyfeel the situation is ripe

for another attempt to bring

the West into a new round of

Berlin negotiations.

The Communist World

EASTERN EUROPE PREPARES FOR HARD WINTER

Eastern Europe is making plans

to prevent a recurrence of the

widespread discontent and the se-

rious dislocations in some sectors

of the economy which resulted from

last year's severe

winter.

The

fuel, power, and construction in

dustries and the railroads were

the hardest hit, and although a

repetition of last year's weather

conditions would be unusual, it

is primarily in these sectors that

preparations are being made. While

there are signs that the other

Communist regimes are making sim

the most detailed in=

tormation is available on East

Germany's preparations.

The East German regime has

already warned that electric pro-

duction capacity again this winter

will be inadequate to meet demands

of all consumers.

The shortfall

results from growing industrial

use of electricity, delays in com-

pletion of new generating capacity,

and the low water level available

for power generation.

The regime

on 30 September published an ur-

gent appeal to save electricity.

It was followed a month later by

announcement of a "competition"

for "power thrift."

Throughout

industry power consumption norms

are being established.

Production

during night shifts is being in-

creased to make more efficient use

of the hours when power consumption

is normally at a minimum:

In the coal industry, the East

Germans have made an exceptional

effort to increase production and

have succeeded in raising coal re-

serves in industry by 5 percent

since last autumn. Measures also

have been taken to prevent freezing

of coal loaded in open rail cars

and of rail switches at the mines,

which posed major problems last

winter.

East Germany is easing the

burdens on its railroads by con-

tinued transferal of short-distance

hauling from the railroads to

trucks.

New schedules for contin

uous loading and unloading of

trains and trucks were instituted

on 1 October.

Production in high-fuel-con-

sumption industries such as steel

and ceramics reportedly will be

curtailed or halted as required.

About 60,000 workers would be af-

fected by such drastic measures.

Czechoslovakia also has warned

that electric power output will be

insufficient to meet all needs this

winter, largely for the same rea

sons as in last Germany.

The Czechs

began instituting measures to save

power as early as mid-August, and

preparations at power plants

were

to be completed by the end of

October.

Both Poland and Hungary appar-

ently are concerned with ensuring

adequate coal supplies for the do-

mestic market. The chief of Po-

land's coal exporting agency has

said that the country this year

will export to nonbloc countries

one million tons less than last

year. This move, along with greater

coal production,

will increase sup-

plies for the domestic market.

Hungary has announced that

coal production will exceed the

planned level by one million tons

as a result of overtime work, and

that imports of coal will be

million tons above plan.

The Communist World

PEIPING'S ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH NON-COMMUNIST ASIA

Communist China's economic

activities in the countries of

non-Communist Asia now are re-

covering from the setback they

suffered in 1960 following the

failure of the "leap forward."

Peiping's 1963 trade with

most of these countries appears

to be above last year's, so the

Chinese probably will earn more

from their Asian trade this

year than they have in the re-

cent past.

These earnings will

again be used chiefly to finance

imports of Western grain--which

presumably will continue at

about last year's level.

China's net export earnings

from

trade

with Hong Kong,

its

largest source of free world

currency, are up about 25 per-

cent over 1962 and are running

at an annual rate of about $250

million.

China's favorable

trade balance with Malaysia may

reach about $80 million this

year

about 10 percent over the

level

achieved last year with

the members of the new federa

tion.

Sino-Japanese trade is

currently at an annual rate of

slightly over $100 million--up

from $84 million last year.

China's economic aid proj-

ects in the non-Communist

Far

East have been implemented

slowly in the last few years.

Such

activities are expected

to

remain at a moderate level as

long as China's attention is

riveted on earning foreign ex-

change to buy grain.

The Chinese may, however,

be willing to provide additional

economic assistance to Cambodia,

which so far has utilized about

60 percent of a total of $50

million in Chinese grants.

Peiping responded favorably al-

though cautiously to overtures

from Prince Sihanouk after his

announcement of Cambodia's de-

cision to end the US aid program.

Earlier good-will gestures in-

cluded Liu Shao-chi's visit to

Cambodia last May, followed by

a trip to China by a Cambodian

bank delegation.

Recently

Chinese technicians arrived in

Cambodia to survey prospects for

construction of a glass factory

to be financed under a 1960 grant.

A Chinese delegation this

month

â€¢ arrived in Djakarta to

discuss implementation of a $30-

million credit extended in 1961

for a textile plant.

Peiping

recently agreed to provide Cey-

lon with textile plants and

equipment under their $16-mil

lion aid pact signed in 1957.

Peiping's largest single

economic aid pact-an $84-mil-

lion credit extended to Burma

in 1961--has been drawn down

by only about $2 million.

Burma, however, has recently

accepted a Chinese offer t

build two bridges in northern

Burma, and there are indications

that formal approval of other

Chinese aid projects will be

forthcoming in the near future.

JAPANESE ELECTION OUTCOME

The Japanese

general elec-

tion on 21 November was charac

terized by a paucity of real

issues and a low voter turnout.

It brought no significant shift

in the balance between the ruling

Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)

and the leftist opposition.

The LDP won 283 seats and

is expected to pick up most of

the 12 conservative "independ-

ents."

Adherence by all of these

nevertheless would leave the LDP

still seven seats short of the

position it held after the 1960

elections.

of assuring Ikeda a third term

as party president or of strength

ening his position within the

party.

Intensification of

internal rivalries for position

within the party is certain

until precedences among the fac

tion leaders can be hammered

out. Actual damage to the

party and to Ikeda's position

nevertheless will probably be

offset by the fact that the lost

seats for the most part went

to the DSP, while the JSP, the

real enemy, was defeated.

On the left, the important

feature was the

failure of the

Japan Socialist Party (JSP) to

gain, while the more moderate

Democratic Socialist Party (DSP)

obtained six more seats than it

won in 1960.

The Japan Comnu-

nist Party (JCP) now holds five

seats, a gain of two over its

1960 performance.

The voter's support of the

LDP suggests that the electorate

is generally satisfied with con

Ikeda government.

The LDP's

victory falls short, however,

A period of critical self-

examination and possible changes

of leadership clearly are in

store for the JSP.

Its net

loss of one seat in the face

of gains by its DSP and JCP

rivals may have seriously

damaged its carefully self-con-

trived image as the

leftist

"wave of the future," destined

to control the government by

1970.

Loss of extreme left

wing

support to the JCP may be

attributed to the confrontation

of the JSP and JCP over the nu

clear test ban treaty and to

the JCP's pro-Chinese stand.

The JSP's failure to reform

internally may have influenced

some voters to shift to the DSP.

staff reportedly had departed by

23 November.

The premier charged that the

captured documents proved "unques-

viet Embassy with the leftist "com

mittee of national liberation" in

Brazzaville. He did not however,

break diplomatic relations with

the Soviet Union and has stated

a ton waver

that he will consider the appoint-

ment of a new ambassador. Although

Moscow has bitterly protested the

expulsion of its officials, it has

them rather than retaliate against

No action has been taken

against the Leopoldville missions

MALAISE IN MALI

Mali's leftist government

is facing increasingly urgent

economic and political problems

at a time when President Modibo

Keita's efforts to mediate the

Moroccan-Algerian dispute have

raised his standing to a new high

elsewbere in Africa.

In the

face of mounting criticism from

politicians with strong local

power bases and from young gov

is devoting major attention to

defending his party's hegemony.

He must also contend with dissi

dence among nomadic tribesmen

and with a desperate foreign ex-

change shortage.

The key problem probably

is that of foreign exchange.

The government brought most of

its troubles on itself a year

and a half ago when, in a fit

of excessive Marxist-flavored

anticolonialism, it in effect

cut itself off from automatic

access to the French foreign

exchange reserves and set up a.

Malian currency.

Since then a

steady

adverse trade balance

has cut into the country's own

meager reserves, and by mid-

November they had fallen to an

estimated $1 million.

The gov-

ernment's budget deficit is

running about $14 million an-

ually.

France reluctantly

bailed the Malians out once be

fore with a stopgap dole, but

it may be unwilling to do so

The bloc has consistent

ly refused to extend budgetary

assistance, although it has pro-

vidid development credits

amounting to $67.5 million.

Doctrinaire rigidity bas

helped to make ineffective the

government's efforts to alleviate

this situation. Whereas Guinea's

Sekou Tour has recently retreated

from "African socialism" when

faced with an even worse situa

tion, Keita and his associates

have

been reluctant

to curtail

the activities of such consistent

money-losers as the state trading

company and the state airline.

This evidence of ineffective

ness has brought to the surface

dissatisfaction among local pol-

iticians whom Keita has never

succeeded in bringing under

close control of his Soudanese

Union Party. These local figures,

who generally occupy the conserv-

ative end of the spectrum, seem

to control the National Assembly.

They also have at least some in-

fluential spokesmen both in the

party's political bureau and in

the executive branch of the gov-

ernment,

especially among elements

desiring a pragmatic approach to

Mali's problems.

At the same time, Keita

is faced with active defiance

of the regime's authority on the

part of Tuareg nomads in the

country's northern deserts.

Half of the army reportedly

now is deployed in an effort,

so far unsuccessful, to halt

raids by these tribesmen. Keita

himself has spent most of this

month in outlying areas, trying

to re-establish party control

over potential and actual

centers of dissidence. (CON
