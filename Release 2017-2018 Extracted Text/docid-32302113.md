Re:

Ejercito Secreto de Cuba

(Secret Army of Cuba) - U.S.A.

Recently several Canadian establishments, public and

private,

at home and abroad have received letters post marked

Miami, Florida, U.S.A. The letters contain the words EUERCITC

SECRETO DE CUBA written near a red triangle with a white star in

the centre.

It is felt that this is the work of an Anti-Castro

Cuban Exile (ACE) terrorist or terrorist group and is meant as a

warning to those who receive it.

2.

We have had the writing analysed by our handwriting

expert, Sgt. Robert FAWCET, from the R.C.M.P. Crime Detection

Laboratory and he states that the addresses on the front of the

R.C.M-P. Crime Detect the

three envelopes we have at this headquarters were written by the

same person.

We would appreciate any data you may have regarding a

group calling itself the Secret Army of Cuba (SAC) presumed to be

operating out of Miami.

We are attaching photocopies of each

letter and its contents for your perusal and information.

Yours truly,

This is further to my Headquarters' letter

dated August 25, 1976 directed to you concerning the

captioned organization. At that time we asked you for

any data you might have concerning the ESC because of the

fact that warning letters had been sent to several

Canadian establishments, public and private, at home and

abroad.

Recently ESC has come to our attention again

and we are speculating that it may be tied in with the

Re:

• EJERCITO SECRETO DE CUBA (ESC)

The Ejercito Secreto De Cuba is believed to be an

anti-Castro Cuban exile (ACE) terrorist group operating out

cs of Miami, Florida, and affiliated with the United Revolu-

tionary Organization (URO).

The URO is an umbrella organi-

zation based in Latin America which came into being

five ACE terrorist groups met in Santo Domingo,

Dominican

Republic, on 11-12 June 1976.

Since its formation under

the leadership of Orlando Bosch Avila, the URO has claimed

responsibility for several acts of terrorism in the Caribbean

and Meso America.

• In July 1976, the ESC began sending a logograph

(photocopy attached) to several Canadian facilities and

businesses in Canada and abroad which appeared to be a

warning of some sort. They have also sent the same logo-

graph to the Cuban and Czech Consulates in Montreal.

The

bulk of the mail sent by the ESC was post-marked Miami,

As of late September, there had been a total

of

eight such warnings of which we are aware. They were sent

Four to Pickford and Black, Halifax, Nova Scotia

(shipping agents)

One to the Canadian Consulate General, New York, NY

One to the Canadian Consulate General, Boston, Mass.

One to the Cuban Consulate, Montreal, Canada

One to the Czech Consulate, Montreal, Canada
