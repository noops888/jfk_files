SUMMARY

MIKE LATZO, 1730 Monroe Avenue, Dunmore, Pa.,

a boxing

trainer and gambler, advised that the subject

controls boxer JOSEPH SALCI, Wilkes-Barre, Pa. LATZO

said that some time ago, date not given,

he had an

opportunity to set up a

fight in Australia for SALCI.

Through inquiry among his associates connected with

gambling activities and in the fight game he determined

that subject controls SALCI and he met with BUFALINO

concerning arrangements

for the fight.

However, BUFALINO

was not satisfied with the deal offered and no agreement

was made to conduct the boxing match in Australia because

BUFALINO refused to consider the offer made.

PCI, contacted but reported no

new information developed
