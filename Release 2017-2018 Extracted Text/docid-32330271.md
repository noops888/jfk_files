Mr. if:

Internal Security Division

.. KIRCT: ANTI-FIDEL CASTRO ACTIVITIES

INTERNAL, SECURITY - CUBA

Reference is made to your memorandum dated June 5, 1959, in

the data furnished this Division concerning subject points to a

possible violation, if the facts were proved, of a law within the

co

Jurisdiction of the Bureau.

The information furnished in a memorandum dated June 5, 1959 at

Washington, D.C, and captioned Anti-Fidel Castro Activities points to

a possible violation, if the allegations contained therein were proved

by competent and legally sufficient evidence.

It appears from your memorandum that Rolando Arcadio Masferrer

Rojas, Justo Luis Pozo del Puerto, and Pedro Diaz have entered into

an agreement which could constitute a conspiracy to violate section

956, Title 18, United States Code, in that they appear to have agreed

to injure or destroy specific property situated in Cuba. It will,

of course, be necessary to establish that the property to be destroyed

belones to the Cuban Government or a political subrivision thereof,

or that it is a public utility.

However, for the present, it is

assumed that such proof can be adduced because of the targets dis-

cussed, vize, telegraph office, microwave station and teletype office.

It would also be necessary to estahlish an overt act by one of

the conspirators to effect the object of the conspiracy.

Such an

overt act could be the purchasing or acouiring of plares to carry out

the conspiracy.

If it can be proved that Richard Jatfee, Robert Daut, haysca

Jones, Arthur Vining Davis, William Jonason, Cestor leiar, Conoral

Jose Pedraza and Erle Peacock have knowingly joino. in the 1ll00e1

It is further noted that the apresment of Masterrer and fos

co-conspirators could be considered as a conspiracy 8o vágiate riggtion

960, Title 18, United States Code, as well as Section 956.

The sond-

Cuba could a considered as an expedition, or military enterprise

i thin the meaning of Seekir 160.

Again, it would be necessary in

establiah an over set en

of the conspiracy.

It does not appear that there is sufficient evidence to link

Salvador Diaz Verson, Jose Luis Pujol, and Ray Molan to the Masferrer

conspiracy.

However, it does appear they have agreed to attack Cuba,

from the United States. If this is established and if an overt act

to effect the object of the conspiracy is committed, such as the

gathering together of individuals under such circumstances as to

make clear that they were about to engage in an expedition against

Cuba from the United States, there could be a conspiracy to violate

Section 960.

We are reviewing other information furnished by the Bureau and

will review future information concerning subject and if any such

information points to a possible violation of law, we will advise you.
