DENIONSTRATION, WASHINGTON, D. Co

FEBRUARY 5-6, 1968

Father Robert Drinan, Dean, Boston College Law

School, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, stated that the

violence of the war has silenced the

conscience of those

who engage in it and

those who are witnesses.

He said

that if the war could not be von without violating the rules

of warfare, the American poople. have the right to know

this and to repudiate the pattern of lawlessness in the

Vietnam struggle.

Dr". Seymour Helman,

Professor of Industrial

Ingineering, Columbia University, New York, New York, and

the Director of Research for the

book "In The Name of

America," stated that the root principle at stake is

whether American officials must obey the law or whether they

are above the law.

He said that in a free society sone may

be guilty, but all are responsible. Helman claimed that the

recent Viet Cong infiltration into

Saigon, proved that the

people of South Vietnam do not suppart their Government.

The opening session ended at approximately 12:30 p.m.

and participants were urged to attend "state-by-state"

strategy sessions at various local churches from 1 p.n. until

2:15 p.I.

During the afternoon of february 5, 1968,

participants were encouraged to visit their Congressmen for

the purpose of presenting their views on Vietnan.

During the opening session, a group of approxinately

100 counterdenonstrators representing the American Council

of Christian Churches, a conservative fundamentalist

organization, conducted a picket line in front of the New York

Avenue Presbyterian Church.

These individuals carried

placards reading, "No Substitute for Victory," "Let's Have

Victory in Vietnam," "Clergynen, Stop Helping the Reds,"

"God and the Devil Do Not Coexist," "Will the Sacrifice of

Cur Boys Be in Vain," and "We Detest War Too, But Tyranny

Reverend Donald A. Waite, who acted as a spokes-ca

for the American Council of Christian Churches, stated it

his group was in Washington, D. C., to demonstrate in favc=

of United States policy in Vietnam and in opposition to the

activities of the Clergy and Laymen Concerned About Vietnam.

He said his group would peacefully picket all the activity

of this latter group.
