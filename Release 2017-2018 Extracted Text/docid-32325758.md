Enclosed herewith are eight copies of a letterhead

memorandum reflecting background data and summarizing captioned

subject's subversive activities for appropriate dissemination

by the Bureau.

ADMINISTRATIVE

The confidential sources enumerated in the letterhead

memorandum, in the order of use, are:

AL 2859-S

AL 2869-S

Former NY 1535-S

On 4/11/61, Miss MARY LYNCH, Clerk, Scandinavian

Airlines, 138-02 Queens Boulevard, Jamaica,

a review of the manifest for Scandinavian Airlines flights

from 10/1/60 to 1/31/61, failed to reflect a flight record

identifiable with the subject.

The enclosed memorandum is classified "Confidential"

since data reported from AL 2859-s, AL 2869-S and former

NY 1535-S could reasonably result in identification of confi-

sources of continuing value and compromise future

effectiveness thereot, which

, would be injurious to the National

Defense.
