Please refer to your 13978 dated 9th August, 1962.

Extensive enquiries in Bermuda have failed to reveal-any

trace of a visit by TOURINE and NESLINE to Bermuda in July, 1962.

We understand that the present government in Bermuda is

extremely unlikely to agree to the establishment of a casino there.
