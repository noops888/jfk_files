capable at throwing a stiletto. MM T-9 said that SCALIA was made

manager of the "popular" casino, an adjunct to the main

casino in the Sans Souci, shortly after his

arrival and

thereafter became manager of the gambling casino in the

Hotel Comodoro.

MM T-9 said that SCALIA obviously was not

qualified for either position and that this was his "reward."

MM T-9 noted that he, himself, was sentenced to

prison in Havana in the late spring of 1958 and was in

prison at the time SCALIA was arrested in November,

1958.

SCALIA's arrest was based on the shooting of SCALIA's

mistress. MM T-9 said that he shared a cell with SCALIA

for the short time SCALIA was detained in prison and that

SCALIA indicated his bail had been set at $20,000.00.

SCALIA told MM I-9 that if TRAFFICANTE "knew what was

good

for him," he would put up the bail and get SCALIA off.

MM T-9 stated that SCALIA was released from jail with his

bail paid by TRAFFICANTE within four days after his

imprisonment.
