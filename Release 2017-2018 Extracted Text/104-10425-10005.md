We don't have to do research and

create a document for this requester.

Is such a "list" in existence?

I questioned Scott Breckinridge

about it. He said that the IG

Staff did not have a list, and

he doubted whether CI Ops did.

(FYI: D'Unger has requested

Warren Commission documents from

NARS. NARS has steered him toward

the Agency re a couple of classified

Items, so we can expect other re-

quests.

In Randall

I have

attached a copy of Mr

Crooks' speed letter, which

provides an informative and

responsive answer to Mr. D'Ungor.

We should hold the line on the

proper classification of the

documents.

This should then be

extended to the list of docu-

ments, since the subject

entries were deliberately made

as informative as possible

Thus we cite exemptions (bi(i)

(properly classified) and

(b) (3) (sources

and methods).
