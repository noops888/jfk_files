condition of Boss TOM LUCHESE.

In regard to JOE BONNANO, informant claimea his

• Informant

stated he has received no official word through ICN circles

that BONNANO has been received back into the ICN in good

standing.

Informant talked in a way to indicate a distinct

relationship between the Los Angeles ICN Family and the Family

did not want anything to do with narcotics. Stated DRAGNA

was opposed to narcotics and his main argument was that the

LON hoodlums had children of their own who might become

DRAGNA and informant apparently were

upset over the use of the Baja California, Mexico, Border by

ICN narcotic activity. He described how he and DRAGNA

personally went back to New York to present their ideas to

The way the

with the LUCHESE family.

The informant reminisced about past ICN activities

in the New York area.

Described how DUTCH SCHULTZ was going

to kill THOMAS DEWEY years ago when DEWEY was an Assistant

District Attorney and that LUCKY LUCIANO stopped SCHULTZ and

DEWEY knew about it. Informant indicated SCHULTZ was killed

over this and that DEWEY knew he owed his life to LUCIANO and

that this was the main reason LUCIANO was freed and deported

when DEWEY became Governor.

He claimed he has forgotten his name, but that

when he next meets with FRATIANNO, he will bring

up the

that the New York representative was a very old man and has

long been out of politics.

VIII. SAN FRANCISCO

Stated he is in frequent contact with JIMMY FRATIANNO

of Sacramento. FRATIANNO has rented his home in Las Vegas for

$130 with the agreement that he can use a bedroom there whenever

he is in Las Vegas.

States FRATIANNO still has ten or eleven

trucks' working on whatever jobs he can pick up. That LA PORTE's

trucks have been repossessed and they are attempting to sell

them for $7,500 each. States FRATIANNO incurred a $10,000 lawyer's

fee with attorney JAMES CANTILLION of Los Angeles who represented

him at El Centro, California.

He has paid several thousand to

CANTILLION at this time. States FRATIANNO was paying his own

attorney fees and was not subsidized by the ICN.

FRATIANNO and stated that in about 1960 just after FRATIANNO

was released from Folsom, the Los Angeles ICN Family discussed

putting out a contract on FRATIANNO, and it was only after

the informant's strong objections the contract was not issued.

IX. LOS ANGELES FAMILY

Informant stated he has had three meetings with his

Capo, JOE ADAMO, in San Diego, attempting to arrange a meeting

with

Los Angeles LCN Boss, FRANK DESIMONE, but that to date

DESIMONE has avoided the meeting. He still intends to "cut

into" NICK SIMPONIS' gambling operations on the outskirts of

Palm Springs, but that he cannot do it without first clearing

with his boss.

Does not expect to get clearance from DES IMONE

and will use this as another example to show DESIMONE's lack

of leadership.

Stated that he has recently been advised that the

Los Angeles ICN leadership is considering issuing a contract

calling for the death of someone.

The victim apparently lives

in the Los Angeles area. Two men have already been designated

as the ones who will do the killing and upon successful

completion of the job, they apparently will be considered for

LCN membership.

The meeting has been under consideration for

three or four months.

to insure it is done successfully.

Informant indicated that if the decision is made to

issue the contract and it involves him, he will demand a

sit down meeting with DESIMONE and Underboss NICK LICATA and

possibly Capo JOE DIPPOLITO to get the full details.

If it

could be worked out, he would very much be interested in having

the hit men caught in the act before the killing and then use

them against DESIMONE and LICATA in order to depose them from

their ICN positions of leadership. He stated that all developments

in this regard will be immediately furnished to the interviewing

agents.

Informant also indicated an intention of meeting

with JOHN ROSELLI sometime during the end of the week around

June 9-10, 1967, in Los Angeles.

Informant admits recent contacts with Cleveland

hoodlum FRANK VELOTTA.

VELOTTA drove to San Diego from

Los Angeles by himself on June 5, 1967, to consult with the

informant about the extradition charge he faces in Florida.

Stated VELOTTA is one of the best burglars operating. Referred

to him as a "bug man" who can turn off ADI alarm systems.

States he is now living in North Hollywood, California, and

that he claims to own a ten unit apartment house in North Hollywood

in which he has a $23,000 equity.

VELOTTA claims he is trying

to sell his apartment house now and that if he can raise the

money, he would still like informant to go to Florida and attempt

to arrange through ICN BOSs SANTO TRAFFICANTE to have the Florida

Florade and attende

charge dropped.

Informant stated he is agreeable to this trip only

1F VELOTTA can come up with his plane fare and a little expense

money so that he will not arouse anyone's suspicions as they

all know he is broke.

Informant again spoke of HAPPY MELIZER in Los Angeles

being successfully engaged in shylocking and bookmaking.

LAS VEGAS

Informant agreed to tell interviewing agents his

present financial plans after expressing deep concern about

not letting anyone

"foul him up"

as he is very anxious to make

a financial comeback.

Stated that he is now working on a

"deal" with ABE BENJAMIN of Las Vegas.

some young Italian who was working in Las Vegas as a shill,

but who is apparently some kind of a homemade engineering

genius. He is an Inventor and has put together a gambling

machine which they hope to manufacture and place in Nevada

casinos. Apparently the machine utilizes old horse racing

movies.

The horse racing movies are projected on a screen.

The players insert their coin, pick the horse they think

will win, and then the machine Is started and the one who

has picked the winning horse will be paid off like a winner

at a jackpot machine.

They have one machine manufactured

now and it cost approximately $20,000.

ABE BENJAMIN has

invested $14,000 to date and someone referred to by the

informant as DAN WIISON of Los Angeles has invested $18,000.

WILSON, (believed to be an Italian with another true name),

apparently is the west coast representative for some well

known garbage disposal manufacturer in St. Louis.

Informant

indicated he was well known in the garbage disposal manufacturing

line.

Informant stated that he as well as FRATIANNO are also

among the investors although neither have put up any cash,

but have apparently promised to arrange for necessary financing

if the machine is successful. The machine will be manufactured

in Chicago and informant indicated the Chicago ICN Family

would provide the financing.

(If the Las Vegas Division can discreetly verify

the above without compromising the identity of the informant

in any way or incurring his displeasure for hurting him financially

by inquiry, it is requested that any pertinent information along

these lines be furnished to the San Diego Office.)
