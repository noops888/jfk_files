Re Miami teletype to the Bureau 4/27/67.

MM 1124-PC has advised that GIANCANA has not been

observed at the Fontainebleau Hotel or on the set of "Tony

, being filmed at Miami.

SINATRA is still a guest

at the Fontainebleau Hotel and is expected to remain in

Miami area until approximately 5/17/67 when filming will

probably be completed. Y

DOMINIC "BUTCH" BLASI, former chauffeur of GIANCANA,

was a guest of the Thunderbird Motel, Miami Beach, from

3/21/67 until 4/3/67 and CHARLE'S "CHUCKIE" ENGLISH, former

golfing buddy of subject, was guest at the Thunderbird Motel

from 3/19/67 until 4/2/67, when both presumably returned

to Chicago. No information received that GIANCANA visited

the Thunderbird Motel. 4

Miami will remain alert for presence of GIANCANA in

the Miami area and will advise office of origin and interested

offices of SINATRA's departure and itinerary. 4
