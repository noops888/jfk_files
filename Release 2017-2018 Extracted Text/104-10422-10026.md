Paragraph 9: Subj saw tall Cuban join

This unidentified

Cuban anparently came out of AZCUE

Described as tall,

solidly built mulatto, curly hair,

about 37

years old.

Subj never saw this man

after 18 Sep.

There is no place in either cable that

indicates that the person described in

the same.

Nor is it clear that the per-

son seated at AZCUE's desk was the one

who handed a large amount of currency to
