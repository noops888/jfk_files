COMMENT:

IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE FIRST PHASE WILL SUFFICE TO

RELEASE ALL THE BUILI-UP TENSIONS AND PRESSURES IN EL SALVADOR.

THIS COUPLED WITH IMMEDIATE DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION BY THE U.S•,

CENTRAL AMERICAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES WILL PROBABLY SUFFICE TO CANCEL

THE PLANNED SECOND PHASE. ›

2. THE ATTACK AGAINSI NUEVA OCOTEPEQUE HAS BEEN HELD IN

ABEYANCE PENDING WORD FROM A SPECIAL GROUP WHICH HAS RAISED

MONEY IN PRIVATE AND GOVERNMENI CIRCLES AND GONE TO MIAMI, FLORIDA

. Cubit

TO: PURCHASE MILITARY EQUIPMENI. MANUEL ARTIME, WELL-KNOWN CUBAN

EXILE LEADER IS REPORTEDLY ASSISTING THIS GROUP• MEMBERS OF THE

MISSION ARE ROBERTO DAGLIO, WEALTHY BUSINESSMAN; 'ALFONSO CARBONEL

WEALTHY COFFEE GROWER; COL- MARIO GUERRERO, FORMER CANDIDATE FOR

PRESIDENT; MARIOSMONIALVO, PRIVATE PILOI; AND VICENFE SANCHEZ,

BROTHER OF PRESIDENT FIDELASANCHEZ HERNANDEZ.

THIS GROUP IS ESPEC-

IALLY INTERESTED IN PLANES, ANTI-ANTICRAFT WEAPONS AND SMALL ARMS AND

MUNITIONS. (SOURCE: COMMENT: EVEN IF THIS GROUP FAILS TO BRING

BACK ARMS, IT WILL BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP A MILITARY ACIION

FROM TAKING PLACE. THE BEST HOPE FOR DELAY IS FOR THE GROUP TO

RETURN WITH PROMISES OF ARMS WHICH WILL BE DELIVERED LATER.. IN

THIS WAY PRESIDENT SANCHEZ CAN CÓUNSEL DELAY UNTIL THE PROMISED ARMS.

ARRIVE.)
