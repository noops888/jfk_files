MM 45-1175

JORGE GUTIERREZ resides with his parents, Mr.

and Mrs. PAULINO M. GUTIERREL at 1029 S.W. First Ave.,

Apt. #4, telephone # 373-2495. PAULINO is also a subject

in this case.

JORGE GUTIERREZ is a member of the Xiglop Corporation,

290 S.W. 8th St., Suites #313-314 and information has been

received reflecting that BOSCH has used this office for.

Cuban Power purposes prior to his recent establishment of

an office in the same building.

The telephone numbers of

the Xiglop Corporation are 379-9555 and 379-9556.

JORGE GUTIERREZ has a girlfriend who is the daughter

Of ROLANDO PEREZ, 6350 SoW. 19th Terr., telephone #667-7683

and he frequently drives an automobile registered to PEREL.

It is therefore believed that long distance tele-

phone calls charged to the above-mentioned numbers may

reveal significant evidence concerning the whereabouts of

GUTIERREZ and other defendants in this case at the time the

bomb was placed on the "Lancastrian Prince" and at the time

the explosion occurred on the "Coromoto".

It has recently been established through information

provided by OSCAR ANGULO REYES, PSI-UD, that the hooded

'Ernesto" conference held in Miami on 9/19/68, was at the

home of EDUARDO MAURI, 3949 S.W. 75th Ave., telephone #226-

9928.

It has also been ascertained that MAURI is in close

association with BOSCH and shares his confidence.

It is

believed that MAURI's telephone could very likely be used

in communications by the BOSCH group on bombing projects ces(4)

UACB, Miami, will obtain a subpoena for the toll

records on the above named telephone numbers to be served on

the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company to cover
