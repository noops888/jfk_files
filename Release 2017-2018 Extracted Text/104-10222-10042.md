: Recommendation for Promotion to GS-14

Charlotte Bustos-Videla

It is recommended that Charlotte Bustos-Videla be promoted

from GS-13 to GS-11-

2. The performance of this officer has been characterized for

many years by all of her supervisors as consistently strong to out

standing. She has been able to establish herself as indispensable it. .......

each Headquarters Branch or Field Station ass giment, usually

functioning as the backbone of the unit to which assigned. Since return

to Headquarters in September 1972 from her field assignment in Mexico,

her performance has been entirely congruent with the thrust of the

Field Station's enthusiasm over her ability, performance, attitude und

growth potential.

She is currently chief of the Cuban and CA Section

of her branch, and has established once again her mastery over her

assigner dutles.

She Is the kind of sound, dependable, yet

imaginative ofticer greatly appreciated by her supervisors. In

short, she is a true professional who pertorms beyond her grade level.

3. In regard to her potential, she has served in the Agency

since 195l, starting as a secretary/stenographer, and advancing

brilliantly with each new challenge offered.

She achieved professional

status in 1953 and has spent the bulk of her time since then speclalizing

In Latin Amertcan affairs, demonstrating total flexibility in assiguments,

a voraclous appetite for wak and a penchant for exceptionally precise

and thorough production. A review of hor career to date can lead to the

conclusion that she has always risen successtully to each new

professional challenge, and is still far from reaching her madmun

capacities. While she has bad little supervisory experience in the

field, her supervisor was of the onion that she is a "natural leader".

This has been borne out in her performance in her current capacity

as & Branch Section Chief, in which she has demonstrated exemplary

supervisory ability. Notwithstanding her drive, aggressiveness aud

professional aplomb, she is a popular co-worker, Is receptive to guidance

and sensitive and responsive to the needs of her subordinates.

4,. This employee has utilized her fluency in the Spanish language

to martmum advantage in her work. Formal lesting recently confirmed

her high proficiency in that language.

training recurd and her Invaluable experiences over a twenty year

pertod, she has become particularly effective in Latin American

operations and operational support, demonstrating excellence in each

5. The officer's adaptability, high intelligence and mastery over

her trade was of inestimable value to Mexico City Station, and over a

five year period from 1967 to 1972, she functioned as the Station's

Internal troubleshooter. Her duties Included the maintenance of

target analysis, reports writing, operational support,

handling of

Training to administer speciallzed training, and she was chosen

recently to attend the Mid-Career Course ending In December 1972.

Meanwhile, her absence from her new job in felt sorely by the

His expected that her current assigmment will last about

two years,

been performing at the level of a GS-14 for some years; it is now

time to promote her to that grade commensurate with her performance

and which she so justly deserves.

In the 8 months during which she was under my supervision, Mrs. Bustos has

performed in that same hard-working, highly-productive style which has become

her trademark over the years.

She understands the intelligence process from

start to finish and is personally experienced with each step along the way, save the

agent handling aspects. She excels in each phase of the work.

As chief of the Branch SA and Cuban activities section; she has once again

demonstrated her mastery over her assigned duties.

She is a sound, dependable,

yet imaginative and energetic operations officer, whose performance leaves little

to,be desired. While she had had little previous supervisory experience, she has

In this assignment demonstrated exemplary supervisory ability. Notwithstanding

her drive, tenacity and attention to detail, she is a popular co-worker, is receptive

dally duties her broad expertence, high hitolligence and good operatlonal sense.

Her

work has always shown excellent judgement and

A self-starter

with tremendous drive and discipline, the amount of work she has produced

has been prodigious. An excellent team worker, she has never shirked iheh-

as so often happens she is asked to take on additional work or work on

a matter outside of her regular field.

While forceful, she is diplomatic

and tactful and is able to present suggestions and criticisms in a plea

sant manner.

She is one of the most dedicated porsons I have met in the

Organization, and exceptionally dependable.

Tile, as a' woman and

Spectalist,

she has had little opportunity

to handle arents she bas done

very well with those we have given her to handle.

She has showed great

ability in the training of two

transcribers and in the debriefing of two

female agents and their husbands. This is in

lnrge part due to her in

depth-knowledge of the trrgets this section is working on.

The past fêa

Sectiön and the ternination of

the majority of

our assets. Under this

stress,

she has performed in her usual outstanding amanner.

She

tries to do everything

The complicated and

never-ending tasks of project proccusing,

noblems are there to be solved

cornera are cut and no principles are campromised.

Never at a loss for an answer, this officer never shrinks fran any

assignment and instinctively wants to take over any vexing problem which is

balding up progress. She is complete mistress of file and record resources

and answers all queries within minutes.

The most complex budgetary and

planning projects are handled by her with deceptive esse.

These qualitles of rare efficiency and speed are coupled with an even

rarer degree of amiability and cooperativeness.

The work which proceeds

under her at such a break-neck pace nonetheless goes on in an air of placidity

The large office staff is run without a trace of tinsion,

jealousy, or friction. All of this is traceable to this officer's fine

example and catalytic effect on her colleagues.

Finely-educated, handling the Spanish language with fluency, and keeping

up with current events in her area, this officer 15 a unique asset to
