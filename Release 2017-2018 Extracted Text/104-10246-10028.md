SESIORANDUM FOR: WH/EKO

SUBJECT

: LIONION Project

1.

LIONION is a new project which is submitted in the

amount of $10,478.

This is a photographic surveillance opera-

tion targetted against the Cuban Embassy in Mexico City.

agents are involved; LIONION-1, a young Cuban

exile,

and LIONION-2, |

The agents act as observers and

photographers.

LIONION-I is also used as a dispatcher for the

LIEMBRACE surveillance team,

from which he is compartmented,

to cover individuals associated with this target.. These agents

were previously used in connection with the

phone tap operation against the Cuban Embassy. The current

photographic operation began in the latter part of 1962,

and was previously funded under Cuban FI funds.

has provided valuable data for the identification of Cuban

Embassy personnel and visitors, and on their patterns of

action and personal associations.

2.

The security of this operation, particularly the

agent's cover for status and the communications arrangements,

appear reasonably sound.

Both agents know that they are

working for AIS, and LIONION-1 was successfully_ FLUTTERED

in October 1963.

However, LITAMIL-7 and LITAMIL-9, who are

penetrations of the Cuban

Embassy, are aware of this

activity, as they are used to help identify individuals

photographed.

Approval for the LIONION Project is recomnended.

It is requested that, in order to assist Headquarters'

evaluation, project reporting include details of CI/CE data

furnished, and examples of leads developed from such information.

This is a technical (primarily photographie) surveillance

operation against the PBRUMEN Embassy in Mexico City.

B.

Objectives.

target, and (3) keep in readiness a listening post for the monitoring and

recording of eventual technical penetration operations of the target.

The target Installation is the PEFUMEN Embassy compound (including

Consulate) In Mexico City.

The above-listed objectives are accomplished by

two trained, full-time surveillance agents who live across the street from

the target.

The project is in consonance with Priority A, Objective 1, of the

current Related Mission Directive for Mexico.

c.

Background. This project, herewith presented for approval for the first time,

does not represent a new operation. LIONION activity has been going on since

1962 and costs have heretofore been charged to PERUMEN FI funds.

The

operation produces photographs of persons associated with the PBRUMEN Embassy,

both staff and visitors.

These photographs are normally reviewed for identi-

fications by the PBRUMEN section at the Station,

then shown separately to

LITAMIL-2, and LITAMIL-, who are penetration agents working inside the target.

They are subsequently forwarded to the CI section of VH/SA where they are shown

to PBRUMEN intelligence defectors AMNIP-1 and AMMUG-1.

Of those assets to whom

they are routinely shown, LITAMIL-2' has to date made the largest number of

Identifications.

The photos have proven of great value.

Within hours of the

arrival of a new Embassy staff member his photograph is in the hands of the

Station;. In addition to the identification of staff and visitors, the photos

(accompanied by a log kept by the LIONION agents) reveal patterns

of action

(arrivals and departures) and details of personal associations (who associates

with whom) which are of great value to the Station in mounting operations against

the target.

In addition to photography,

LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 are often called upon

to do visual surveillance of the target installation and LIONION-1 is essential

to the dispatching of the LIEMBRACE surveillance team against individuals

associated with the target.. Because of the preseuce of police patrol cars in

the vicinity, the Station's mobile surveillance assets cannot come close to the

target, hence the need for LIONION-l's dispatching services.

The presence of LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 also insures continued occupancy of

a valued piece of real estate which will be used as a listening post when the

Station succeeds in installing additional technical surveillance devices in che

target in the form of concealed radio transmitters.

D. Operational Assets (Personnel).

in exile. He left PERUMEN In 1960,

planning to continue on via Mexico to the United States where he resided in

his early years. His two brothers are American citizens, one a desk officer

in Washington, the other a police official in

Florida. While in Mexico LIONION 1 was recruited, as LILILY-1, to

perform PBRUMEN operational support services for the Station and, once having

LIONION 2,

was recruited (2 196k, as LILILY-2, as a basehouse occupant and

operator in the LIFEAT/LIERODE technical, operation aimed at the PERUMEN

Embassy. At this same time LIONIQN-1 also phased Into LIFEAT/LIERODE work and

the two worked together as a tean.

In 1962 LIONION-1 and LIONION-2 worked

together in processing the take of, the LIFEAT/LIERODE/MKTRAP Installation, now

known as LIOMEN. At this time their cryptonyms were changed from LIIILY-1 and

2 to LIFEUD-22 and 23, respectively. In the latter part of 1962 the two agents

began the present photographic surveillance operation.

ITONION-1 was granted an OA on 18 May 1962 by HMMW-10664. He was

ICFLUTTERED on 8 October 1963, HMMH-12064.

LIONION-2 was granted an OA on 16 May 1962 by HMMH-10660.

LIONION-I 1s the mainstay of the operation. LIONION-2 acts as his assistant

and fill-in at such times as he is absent from the observation post. Both serve

principally as observers and photographers. LIONION-1 also acts as a dispatcher

or the LTEMBRACE surveillance team from which he is compartmented. Dispatchin

Is done by radio using pre-arranged innocuous code terminology; the team does not

know IIONION-] or his precise location. LIONION-1 also processes on the premises

all photographic coverage of the main Embassy gate through final printing, cropping

and mounting.

Photographic coverage of the Consulate gate is processed through

the

negative development stage.

Control is primarily financial buttressed by the knowledge, on the part of

the agents, that as PERUMEN refugees they are vulnerable to pressure which might

be brought upon them by KUBARK through the lexican goverrment should they get out

of line.

Motivation is a combination of financial necessity and violent aversion

determination to bring about the downfall of, the AMPHUG regime. An

additional motivating factor is that both agents actually enjoy what for many would

be monotonous work.

Psychologically, they are ideally suited to this sort of work.

The cover utilized by LIONION-2

LIONION-1 passes as a would-bel

to dabble without notable

success because of family Landholdings in

who can afford

_Florida (inherited from his deceased father), which enable him to live as

a "rentista," one who lives on income from sources other than gainful employment.

His rentista status is registered with the Mexican government.

In October 1964

this cover successfully withstood intensive Investigation by Mexican authorities

checking on persons of questionable status for tax collection purposes.

Communication is primarily with LIONION-l; with LIONTON-2 only in his

absence.

Meetings, pre-arranged or signalled by innocuous phone calls (calls

from LIONION-1 go through a telephone cut-out), are usually held at the

LIONION-1 safe apartment.

This apartment, which would appear to be a LIONION-I

love nest, is in another area of town. The Station KURIO technician,

Fugh T. FRANCOITE, meets with LIONION-1 at least once a week.

The Case Officer,

Lawrence F. BARKER, meets with him less frequently.

Whereas LIONION-I KnoWS

the true name of the Case Officer, he does not know FRANCOITE's true identity.

Security Evaluation. If either of the LIONION agents are uncovered by Mexican

authorities as engaged in operations against the target,

they have been briefed

to indicate that they are working for an exile organization based in the JMWAVE

area on a voluntary, non-paid, patriotic basis and to stick to the story covering

their incone.

This would probably hold up unless they were caught in flagrante

with the KURIOT automatic pulse camera on the premises.

This camera is of such

refinement and complexity as to be difficult to ascribe to an exile organization.

In any event, LIONION-1 has a close relationship with an official of the Mexican

president's

office. This connection, developed by LIONION-1 for his own protection,

enabled him to weather the tax investigation and can be used by him to overcome any

future difficulties with Mexican authorities.

Under Mexican law, the principal (photographic) activity of the project is

not illegal, therefore uncovering of the photographic operation would not of

itself result in arrest or prosecution.

It is usually possible to stave off

investigation or house search for a period of time sufficient to remove compromis

ing material from the premises.

The LIONION base house was once cleaned completely

in one evening and could again be cleaned, probably in less time, if circumstances

should warrant.

The target installation is aware that photo surveillance is a probability.

On one occasion AMKNOB-1, a JMHAVE asset, was shown a nearby building

observed him in the neighborhood. Presumably they believe he is a Mexican. To

avoid operational compromise, he

PBRUMEN Consulate. For this reason the Station will request

Security measures employed in this operation are designed to make it virtually

impossible for any opposition service to link LIONION personnel with the Station.

Coordination. Coordination with other PBPRIME elements or the Mexican government

is not necessary at this time and none is envisaged.
