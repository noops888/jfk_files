31 July 1978

Chief Counsel and Director

Dear Mr. Blakey:

Along with other requests, your letter of

6 July 1978 seeks access to the Office of Personnel

files of certain employees.

We have some reservations

about making

available everything contained in these

employees' files.

First,

there is a variety of personal information,

the revelation of

which would intrude unnecessarily on

the employee's privacy. Further

• an Agency officer's

file is more

than

just

a compendium of his career: there

is much detail on

assignments, including the countries

where he served, the cover used, a rather detailed de-

scription of duties, and information on a wide variety

of operations which

are outside our understanding of

the scope of your investigation.

Perhaps it would be

possible for

a member of my

staff to discuss the specific

area (s) of HSCA interest with your representative.

A

mutually agreeable solution should be available. .

Since your investigator/researchers have had the

opportunity to interview or depose employees of interest,

it would appear that the above course

of action would

supplement whatever narrow areas the personal interview

left uncovered.

Sincerely,

S. D. Breckinridge

Principal Coordinator,

HSCA

:

Deputy Director for Operations

Deputy Director for Administration

Inspector General

Special Assistant, Deputy Director

of Central Intelligence

S. D. Breckinridge

Draft Letter to HSCA on Request for

0/Personnel File of Operations Officers

The attached draft letter is prepared as a

result of a decision of the DCI at the Morning Meeting

on Friday, 28 July, concerning general requests by the

HSCA for access to

the Official Personnel Folders of

Agency employees. Some of the reasons advanced in the

letter for not providing blanket access refer to classi-

fied considerations; however, these statements do not,

in themselves, seem classified:

If you differ, the

letter can be

assigned a classification.

2. Your comments would be appreciated. As this

issue dates back to 6 July, your prompt attention would

be helpful.
