NOTES

This is the Scott Breckinridge task force study which was prepared

last sina tonespopy on the church to tae kons he Kennedy to me

assassination.

now with a suggestion from the IG that we send

a copy to the SSCI and

HPSCI.

I don't believe we should send it because it is extremely critical

of the Church Committee report (see page 9 of the introduction for a

sample). The Committee has not asked for this paper.

Indeed I am not

nstein recently.

sure they even know y concern ho th apbriet mention was made to Mike

'report will fan the flames and

cause them to resurrect these old questions for a new look.

I certainly

don't mind letting them know when they do a poor job, but not when the

cost is another examination of the same questions.

I have explained my

point of view to Scott Breckinridge who said his concern was that we were

providing a report to the Assassinations Committee which was not being

provided to oversight committees, but the: this was a question for OLC.

He says he doesn't care if it is sent o the oversight committees or not.

agrees with my viewi

..a this.
