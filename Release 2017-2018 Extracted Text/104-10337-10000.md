Meeting with Jack Tunheim

I went into DC today to meet with Jack and look at the space on Indiana Ave. Two GSA reps, 3 FBI people, Jack and I walked through

the area. Looks like the modifications will be fairly easy and I am going to work up some options for Jack and his board to review. The

FBI says a few of their documents are TS. Do you have any idea if there are TS/SCI documents involved from our side (or any other

agency's side)?

CIA SPECIAL COLLECTIONS

RELEASE IN FULL

Drat t

21 October 1996

ARRB Proposals to Expedite Review of Assassination Records

I. Re-location of Seguestered Collection to ARRB site will

allow ARRB staff on-site access to identify relevant/key

files and documents, and review Agency designated non-

related material.

Comment:

It is not feasible to transfer the entire collection

and continue CIA's review.

Parts of the collection can be

transterred on temporary basis without impeding HRG's review

provided

security and DO concerns are satisfied.

Security Requirements/Issues:

1) Agency Controlled Secure Area -- construction cost/who

pays?

[ARRB should pick up this cost.]

2) Document Access Control:

a) During work-day -- detailed CIA reviewers or

designated ARRB staffer?

b) after hours -- CIA guard or existing guard force?

DO Concerns:

Provided security requirements are met, DO has no

objections to portions of the JFK sequestered collection

being temporarily housed at ARRB site as needed for review.

[Note: Fred W. is checking with DO security re requirements

for storing records off-site.]

HRG Requirements:

1) Office/ workspace for HRG project officer and two or

three reviewers.

[Depending on

security requirements, 2 HRG reviewers could

either be assigned to ARRB on a regular basis or report

there as needed -- project officer will be visiting ARRB

site on reqular basis.

2) Secure phone and FAX (STU IIIs) is a necessity; video

Conference capability would enhance communications.

3) Computer support -- PC/Word Processing is a necessity;

direct link to HRG index would enhance capability to handle

ARRB Staff questions and expedite review.

4) Priority Courier Service from IP at

ARRB

---

## Page 6

13-00000

Expedite the review of the Sequestered Collection by

focusing on most relevant files/documents and not sending

duplicates to the Board for action.

Comment:

HRG has already implemented a review focusing on

documents that have not been acted on by the Board;

duplicates are flagged and will be prepared for NARA later.

• Due

to the duplicate

search, the amount of time for an HRG

reviewer to review a box has increased, but the number of

documents per box for action has decreased.

A targeted /subject approach (identify and review most

relevant material first) will be difficult to implement

given current state of HRG index.

Additional review and computer support will be need to

meet the Board's request.

Requirements:

1) Increase HRG re-review team to 4 or 5 reviewers.

2) Begin separate review of HSCA material including

documents held by the ARRB - 2 reviewers.

[Note: HSCA material is a high priority of the Board;

however, since most HSCA documents are releasable in

full,

the review generate few documents for Board action.]

3) Enhancements to the HRG index/data base will be required

to facilitate searching and identifying duplicates (work

already under way) .

4) Communications and computer support -- same as Request I

III.

## Page 7

13-00000

Resource Requirements/ impact

Note: Detailing two or three CIA reviewers to ARRB will

offset much of the negative impact of the move to IP. In

addition to controlling access to CIA records, these

reviewers would:

1) perform quality control review of documents prepared

tor the Board at IP Iprocessing mistakes have been a

continuing problem in the reviewl

2) handle questions from the ARRB staff consulting with

project officer and IP HRG/DO reviewers as necessary

3) Review HSCA material being held by ARRB and 3rd

Agency documents [a DO reviewer would join the HRG

reviewers when documents were ready for DO review]

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Executive Director

THROUGH :

Deputy Director for Operations

General Counsel

Director, Center for the Study

of Intelligence

FROM:

John F. Pereira

Chief,

Historical Review Group, CSI

SUBJECT:

JFK Board Request for Transfer

of CIA Documents

(U) This memorandum is for your information. It

summarizes

arrangements between CIA and the JFK

Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB) to transfer

certain CIA records to the Board's offices.

(FOUO) Background: During a meeting with you on 16

October, ARRB Chairman John Tunheim requested that the

Agency transfer a

large quantity of records related to the

JFK assassination.

The request was based on the Board's

need to have the documents--totaling approximately 190,000

pages--reviewed by the Board's staff.

Judge Tunheim and

other Board members consider it unworkable for their staff

to review the documents in the l

Building,

to which the records would be moved when the Center for the

Study of Intelligence moves there in mid-November.

(C) The principal issue raised by the request is one of

control over and protection of the sensitive CIA (mainly DO)

records once they are transferred to the Board's offices in

the District at 600 E Street, N.W.

The Board has agreed to

construct a dedicated secure facility (SCIF); access to

which would be controlled by Agency personnel.

_ DCI Area Security Officer, has conducted a

preliminary survey of the space where the SCIF would be

located, and concludes that the proposed security

arrangements would be acceptable.

I for open

Shelf Strange

(FOUO) A second issue concerns funding for the

construction of the

SCIF. There would also be additional

costs for installation of a secure telephone and a secure

fax, which are needed to allow secure communications with

We are proposing that the Agency and

ARRE share the costs, but it is possible that the Agency

will be asked to reimburse the Board for whatever funds they

expend. In any event, we do not believe that the costs will

be great.

---

## Page 9

13-00000

(FOUO) Conclusion: Our judgement is that the Agency

should comply with the JFK Board's request to transfer the reDatien

records, but that the tranetes should clearly be documented

as temporary. The documents would be provided in

increments.

Once the Board's staff has reviewed a group of

records, they would be returned to the Agency for final

review and sanitization, before they are released to the

National Archives.

We plan to detail to the Board a small

number of reviewers from the Historical Review Group who

would control access to the documents and also assist in

coordinating the records review.

(FOUO) Unless you have objections, we plan to transfer

to the JFK Board the records requested by the Board's

Chairman.

The tranpfer will be contingent on the

installation of an approved security facility and'an

agreement on funding.

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

FROM:

John H. Hedley

Chair, CIA Publications Review Board

SUBJECT:

Classification Review Process for Non-official

Publications

1. I presently serve as the Chair of the Publications

Review Board (PRB) for the United States Central Intelligence

Agency ("CIA or. "Agency") and have held this position since

January 1996. I also hold the position Chief of the Publications

Review Division, the entity which coordinates and otherwise

supports the review process of the Publications Review Board. I

have served as an intelligence officer for the CIA for 33 years

and have held a variety of senior positions of management and

analytical responsibility including serving as managing editor of

the Agency's daily national intelligence publication and as

editor of the President's Daily Brief. I have also served as

Deputy Director for Public Relations in the CIA's Office of

Public Affairs.

I hold a doctorate degree from the University of

Missouri, a

masters from the University of Tulsa and an

undergraduate degree from the University of Kansas. I have

served as CIA Officer in Residence at the Institute for the Study

of Diplomacy in Georgetown University's School of Foreign

Service, and currently teach a seminar entitled "CIA and the

Changing Role of U.S. Intelligence" at Georgetown.

2: The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the

Assassination Records Review Board with an understanding of the

classification review activities undertaken by the CIA's

Publications Review Board vis-à-vis the personal writings of CIA

employees, former employees or other associates who, by virtue of

their secrecy agreement have an obligation to protect classified

information and submit personal writings for review pursuant to

that obligation.

3.

The PRB deals primarily with the manuscripts of former

employees who are writing as private citizens; the information

they propose to publish is private property and proprietary in

---

## Page 26

13-00000

nature.

Current employees normally submit material intended for

nonofficial publication through their supervisory chain of

command to their Deputy Director or Head of Independent Office.

However, any supervisory official in the author's chain of

command may submit the material to the Board for a decision.

This may be done when the corporate process of a Board review is

deemed more appropriate because the proposed publication involves

the equities or expertise of more than one Directorate or

Independent Office or has Agency-wide implications.

It is for

these reasons that the Center for the study of Intelligence has

routinely sent manuscripts, written by both current and former

employees and under consideration for publication in Studies in

Intelligence, to the Publications Review Board.

4. All submissions deemed by the author as not containing

classified information and any submissions having questions as to

proper classification have been reviewed - pursuant to the

personal manuscript standards - to ensure the unclassified

nature of the article or to identify classified information and

suggest changes to eliminate classification concerns.

When an

article has been deemed to contain classified information, and it

has been subsequently requested to be published in unclassified

-form or otherwise made available to the public, it has been

reviewed by the same process discussed previously to allow

declassification or the creation of a redacted (i.e., modified)

and hence unclassified version.

5. By deeming or marking a given article as classified, the

PRB represents only that this personal writing contains some

information of

a classified nature by the US Government; in our

view, that fact has not altered the nature of this private work.

or converted it into an official federal record containing

official government information.

Indeed, this practice of

marking has been followed (as required) whether the personal

writing is intended for publication in a classified version of

Studies or by a private publisher.

I Pursuant to Agency regulations, practice, and available resources, this

review may be conducted by the Historical Review Program, the concerned

Publications Review Board (PRB).

responsible for reviews of private writings proposed for publication; all

writings by former Agency employees (which constitute the vast majority of

private writings) are conducted by PRB.

February 1998

MEMORANDUM FOR:

Executive Director

Assassination Records Review Board

FROM:

SUBJECT:

Brian S. Latell

Chairman, Editorial Board

Studies in Intelligence

Mission, Character, and Publication Practices

of studies in Intelligence

1. I am the Director of the Center for the Study of

Intelligence ("CSI"') for the US Central Intelligence Agency ("CIA":

or "Agency") and have held this position since September 1994. I

am also the Chairman of the Editorial Board ("Board") for Studies

in Intelligence ("Studies"), a publication of CSI. I have served

as a foreign intelligence officer for the United

States

Government for nearly 36 years and, at CIA, have held a

variety

of senior positions of management and analytical responsibility

including serving as a member of the National Intelligence

Council from 1980 to 1994 and as National Intelligence Officer

• (NIO) for Latin America for four of those years.

I hold

doctorate, masters and undergraduate degrees from Georgetown

University, have served as a Visiting Scholar at the Hoover

Institution at Stanford University, and for the last twenty years

have held an appointment to the faculty of Georgetown

University's School of Foreign Service as an Adjunct Professor.

2.

The purpose of this memorandum is to provide the

Assassination Records Review Board with my view of the historical

mission, character, and publication practices of Studies as a

classified publication disseminated within the Intelligence

Community and in other versions as an unclassified publication

available to the public.

3.

The mission of Studies has been to promote scholarship

and reflection in intelligence literature and better the

understanding of the intelligence profession. Articles published

by Studies are intended for educational, and professional purposes

and present the personal, academic and professional views of

individual authors. The responsibility for accepting or

7:34 AM 2/17/98

## Page 28

13-00000

rejecting articles that are submitted rests with the Board. A

key criterion for publication has been whether articles make a

contribution to the literature of intelligence; other criteria

include the originality, quality, and importance of the material.

Articles submitted have not been required to be coordinated

through official channels and, indeed, have not been routinely

vetted through management by either the Board or individual

authors. In addition to senior Agency officers, the Board also

has members who serve in senior positions in other agencies of

the Intelligence Community or who have in the past served in such

capacities.

4. In earlier years of the more than 40-year history of

Studies, articles were primarily written by then-current CIA

employees.

In the past decade, however, Studies has been

enriched by an increasing number of submissions by authors from

other components of the Intelligence Community, from members of

the academic community in the United States and abroad,

and from

private citizens, most of whom have had some past intelligence

connection.

5.

Once articles, intended either as classified or

unclassified, are submitted for consideration in studies, they

are circulated to the members of the Board for

their review.

The

Board then decides whether an article meets the criteria for

publication and, if it does, begins the publication process. All

submissions deemed by the CIA author to be unclassified have been

submitted to CIA's Publications Review Board (PRB) for

verification.

If the Board is concerned about the level of

sensitivity of a classified article, it has sought opinions of

relevant experts as to whether the article, or portions of it,

,should be published or redacted.

Such reviews historically have

been pursuant to the PRB's standards for personal manuscripts and

not the more stringent standards for official CIA records.

Subsequently, articles are edited and published in one of the

quarterly classified issues of Studies. Most of the unclassified

this version are subsequently selected by '

the Board to also be published in one of the two annual

unclassified issues of studies.

6. The independence and integrity of the Board, and its

historical commitment to professional traditions, has never to my

knowledge been questioned by Agency management.

several of my predecessors, can recall no cases of interference

by Agency management with the publication decisions of the Board,

no matter how controversial the subject matter or how critical an

author might be of CIA management.

Indeed, Studies articles

historically embody the personal, professional research, and

reflections of their authors. The very intent of the journal is

- 2-

## Page 29

professional and scholarly and this has been so from the founding

by the pre-eminent intelligence officer Sherman Kent in 1955.

In sum, while Studies in Intelligence is published under

the auspices of the United States Government, articles

historically were neither intended to express official or

officially-sanctioned information nor have they been considered

to be an official release of official Executive Branch

information.

Studies have been regarded as a forum for

personal, professional, and scholarly expressions of the authors.
