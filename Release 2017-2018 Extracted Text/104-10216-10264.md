1. PROBABLY THE MAJOR CHANGE THAT HAS OCCURRED IN CUBA DURISG

THE PAST YEAR, TOGETHER WITH THE DECLINING ECONOVIC SITUATION, HAS

BEEN THE CENTRALIZATION OF DECISION-MAKING POWERS IS ONE MAS, PREMIER

FIDEL CASTRO RUZ. CASTRO REFUSES TO LISTEN TO ADVICE AND IS FOREVER

BYPASSING HIS MINISTERS. CASTRO GETS AN IDEA AND WITHOLT CONSELTINS

ANYONE NILI CALL A TRUSTED OFFICER, ASSIG HIM THE TASK, AND ORDER

HIM TO REPORT DIRECTLY TO CASTRO. THIS CALSES TOTAL COSTUSION IY

CRITICAL, AND HE IS STARTING TO MANEUVER TO REGAIN

GROUND.

2. CASTRO'S INVESTIGATION OF JOAQUIN ORDOQUI MESA WAS THE

AFTERKATH OF AND DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE MARCH 1964 TRIAL OF MARCOS

ARICANDO RODRIGUEZ ALFOSSO, ORDOQUI WAS VERY UNHAPPY WITH THE PRO-

CEEDINGS AND HE REFUSED TO LET MATTERS REST. ORDOQUI CONTINUED TO

EXPRESS IRRITATION ABOUT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE TRIAL HAD BEEN

HAXDLED, AND HIS CRITICAL ATTITUDE CONTRIBUTED TO CASTRO'S BRINGING

MATTERS TO A HEAD.

3. CASTRO'S PRIMARY CONCERN REGARDING THE "OLD GUARD" COSEUN-

ISTS IS THAT THEY ARE SO DISLIKED BY THE MASSES. BY KEEPING THES,

HOMEVER, CASTRO GIVES HIMSELF MANEUVERING GROUND. CASTRO REALIZES

HE MUST ACT AGAINST THE "OLD GUARD" CONMUNISTS WITH RESTRAINT IN

ORDER NOT TO CREATE SERIOUS PROBLESS WITH THE SOVIETS. THE LAST

THING CASTRO WANTS IS AN UNCONTROLLED CRISIS EITHER WITH THE SOVIETS

OR WITHIN THE REGIME.

4. CASTRO'S MAJOR PROBLEMS ARE ECONONIC, CONVERCIAL, AND LABOR.

LAZARO PEÑA GONZALEZ, SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE CENTRAL DE TRABAJA-

DORES DE CUBA REVOLECIONARIA (REVOLUTIONARY CUBAN WORKERS' ORCANIZA-

TION, CTC-B) IS SLATED TO BE REYOVED, BUT ONLY CASTRO WILL SAY WHEN.

CARLOS RAFAEL RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ, DIRECTOR OF THE INSTITUTO NACIONAL

DE LA REFORMA AGRARIA (NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF AGRARIAN REFORM, INRA)

HAS ALSO HAD HIS PROBLEMS WITE CASTRO. THE INRA IS A "SIESS" BUT IT

IS DOUBTFUL, THAT ANTONE CAN SUCCEED IN THE JOB, AND IT IS UNLIKELS

THAT CASTRO WILL ESCALATE THE CRISIS BY A MOVE AGAINST RODRIGUEZ AT

THIS TIME, (SOURCE COMMENT: CASTRO ONCE SAID THAT HE WILL NOT

PERMIT HINSELF TO BE PRESSURED BY ANYONE AND MILI, REPLACE OFFICIALS

ONLY WHEN HE DESIRES TO DO SO. AS EARLY AS DECEMBER 1963 CASTRO

WAS PLANNING TO REMOVE AUGUSTO MARTINEZ SANCHEZ AS MINISTER OF LABOR

AT A CONVENIENT TIME, THUS HIS RECENT ACTION AGAINST MARTINEZ HAY

REPRESENT THE REALIZATION OF A YEAR-OLD INTENTION.) CASTRO'S

PROBLEMS WITH THE MILITARY HAVE BEEN LESS SERIOUS. ACTION TAKEN

AGAINST MILITARY OFFICERS HAS BEEN ON DISCIPLINARY, NOT POLITICAL

GROUNDS, AS IN THE CASE OF THE DISMISSAL OF CAPTAIN JOSE AGUSTIN

"TINTIN" DIAZ-ARGUELLES.
