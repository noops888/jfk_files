Dear Mike:

Regarding the Select Committee's investigation

of the Secret Army Organization activities

in relation

to the FBI in the San Diego area, the Committee requests

that a member of its staff be given access to the original

materials maintained at the San Diego field office of the

FBI.

Such access should be initially to copies at FBI

headquarters, as previously arranged, and subsequently to

the originals at the field office.

In addition, I thought that the Justice Depart-

ment and the FBI might be interested in the attached copy

of a letter from Committee counsel Michael J. Madigan to

the editor of the san Diego Union.

Sincerely,

John T. Elliff

. DATE 012/00 BY SP2AMKP

Dear Mr. Warren:

I was surprised to read the article entitled "Report Due on

FBI Probe" which appeared on the front page of the San Diego Union

of January 27, 1976. The article contained statements attributed

to me which were false. I regret to say that I feel this inaccu-

rate reporting was done intentionally by your reporter, Mr. Dillon,

in a brazen attempt to buttress his earlier articles about the SAO.

Specifically, Dillon's article

states:

"Madigan said his four-day visit to California has

confirmed most news reports about FBI involvement

with the SAO's guerrilla war against political

dissidents in San Diego during the early 1970's."

His article goes on to say:

"The FBI was 'very much involved' with the Secret Army

Organization, a Senate investigator said here yesterday

after interviewing the SAo co-founder and former FBI

informant Howard Berry Godfrey.

Both of these statements attributed to me are false. I never made

such statements to Dillon or anyone else. To the contrary, what

few things I did say to Dillon were almost the opposite. More

particularly, I asked him where the evidence was for the statement

reported in his January 11, 1976 article which claimed that the FBI

"created a group known as the Secret Army Organization . ..." I

told Dillon that our investigation had uncovered no such evidence.

With a sheepish smile, Dillon implied that he knew of no evidence

AH 55143 DocId:32989575 Page 5

for that statement and had overstated the case. While the record

of the FBI's involvement with its informer Godfrey does not present

a pleasant picture, I now feel compelled to state publicly that,

in my opinion, the San Diego Union articles by Mr. Dillon have

presented an exaggerated picture of what really happened.

As I indicated in my telephone conversation on January 30,

1976 with Mr. McArthur of your newspaper, I am requesting that

you print this letter as testimony of your newspaper's sense of

fair play, honesty and accurate reporting; a sense which your

reporter lacked. The people of San Diego are entitled to no less.

is reason to believe that an

individual has committed or is about to commit a specified

crime.

Exceptions would then be written into the legis-

lation to permit Bure othestigations in such areas as

organized crime, back investigations and counterespionage/

foreign counterintelligence investigations. Recognizing

a possible need for investigations of a domestic intelligence

nature, including threats of civil disorder, the agenda then

requests Bureau input as to need for investigations falling

within this category and an assessment as to how effective

the Bureau can be in preventing acts of violence through

use of intelligence techniques. Additional areas for

Bureau input, according to this agenda, include. (1) the

necessity for investigation of groups calling for the

illegal overthrow of the Government at some future date

but where violence is not imminent and (2) the question of

"preventive action" whereby the Bureau would be permitted

to engage in deterrent-type actions against a group or

individual where violence is imminent and arrest impractical.

Gitenstein and Epstein both emphasized that the criteria

for any exceptions, added to the basic "Stone" language,

will be 'Why can't

the exception be handled by tradional

law enforcement?"

Realizing the short deadline to properly prepare

for the Executive Session, then scheduled for 2/2/76, an

agreement was reached whereby the Executive Session would

be rescheduled from 2/2/76 to 10:00 a.M., 2/6/76. It is

Mignosa and Shackelford, supra.

On the morning of 2/2/76, the above-named Bureau

personnel, with the exception of Assistant Director Wannall,

held a conference to prepare for the forthcoming Executive

Session. It was agreed by all that the mandate for Bureau

investigations in the domestic intelligence field, as proposed

above by SSC Staff Members, was entirely too narrow and

it was agreed that Bureau representatives at the hearing

would recommend a legislative approach following, in

general terms, the proposed Attorney General guidelines

which would afford this Bureau a broader mandate in protecting

Governmental interests. Assignmentsfor areas of responsibility

were made as follows:

Inspector Hotis - Various proposed

guidelines affecting Bureau operations, court decisions

recognizing right of executive branch to protect Governmental

interests and distinction between criminal and intelligence

investigations; Section Chief Deegan - Effectiveness of

FBI in preventing acts of violence as a result of information

received from intelligence investigations and Bureau

assessment of threats of civil disorder and techniques

necessary to collect such information; Section Chief Mignosa -

Extent of terrorist activity in this country citing specific

instances of known activity, as well as necessity for

sources to garner such information; Section Chief Shackelford -

Necessity for investigation of groups which believe they

will, at the propitious time, engage in violence for the

forcible overthrow of Government, but believe for the

immediate future violence is either not necessary or

From: John Elliff and Mark Gitenstein

• ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIED

DATE 11 30 00. BYSP2AMKP

On Monday morning, February 2, FBI officials from

the Internal Security Branch of the Domestic Intelligence Divi-.

sion will appear before the Committee in executive session.

The primary purpose of their appearance is to discuss with the

Committee the future role of the FBI in traditional domestic

intelligence operations -- that is, intelligence investigations

of American citizens who are not agents of foreign powers.

The

primary witnesses will include Raymond Wannall, Assistant

Director for the Intelligence Division; Hunter Helgeson, Branch

Chief for the Internal Security Branch; Joseph Deegan, Section

Chief for Extremist Investigations (investigations of terror-

ists, Black Panthers, ard the Klan) ; Robert Shackleford, Section

Chief for Subversive Irvestigations (investigations of the Com-

munist Party, the Weathermen, and other "radical groups"); and,

finally, John Hotis, the FBI's representative to the Attorney

General's guidelines drafting committee.

The primari question which should be discussed on

Monday is the scope domestic intelligence investigations

HH. 55143 DocId:32989575

Page 18

ENCLOS 62-111-393=1355

---

## Page 19

which the Congress should permit in any legislative charter

it nacts. In what circumstances should the FBI be permitted

to sjo

beyond the standard which former Attorney General Harlan

Fiske Stone imposed upon the Bureau in 1924 -- that the EBI

- only conduct traditional criminal investigations? For the

purposes of Monday's discussion we might assume that the

Congress were to enact the Stone standard via the following

language:

The Attorney General may authorize offi-

cials of the Department of Justice to inves-

tigate violations of federal criminal law

only where there are specific and articulable

facts which, taken together with rational

inferences from those facts, give rise to a

reasonable suspicion that an individual has

committed or is about to commit a specific

violation of federal criminal law.

Now, obviously, Congress would also have to draft

exceptions to that standard for organized crime investigations,

narcotics investigations, background investigations, and FBI

counterespionage/foreign counterintelligence investigations.

The primary question for Monday's witnesses is - what addi-

tional exceptions do they believe the Congress should consider?

If so, how would they ¿fine each of these exceptions?

What

type of techniques would they authorize to be used in those

circumstances? What threshhold or predicate would they require

for an investigation E activities defined in the exception?

In our exeritive sessions thus far, we have heard

testimony from the General Accounting Office experts on domestic

HH 55143 DooId:32989575 Page 19

## Page 20

intelligence, local law enforcement officials, 'and federal

law enforcement officials, all of whom seem to agree that

pe: laps there should be an exception to this general rule for

F3. assistance in the assessment by other federal officials of

the threat of civil disorder and the necessity for federal

troops. We have also heard from GAO and other experts that

perhaps we should also be considering an exception for intel-

ligence investigations of avowed terrorist groups like the

Weathermen, or the Panthers.

In evaluating the necessity for this last exception,

there are two basic questions which must be asked of these

witnesses. First, what are the sources and extent of organiz-

ed terrorist activity currently affecting the United States?

Second, how effective can the FBI be in preventing specific

acts of violence by these groups through the use of intelligence

techniques?

On January 15 we wrote. to the Bureau requesting

materials on the FBI's assessment of the potential of terrorist

violence in connection with this year's Bicentennial celebra-

tion. This material, which has not been delivered to the Com-

mittee, will be supplirt at the briefing and should help the

Committee understand how the Bureau assesses the threat of

terrorist violence, whether that assessment is realistic, and,

finally, whether that potential for violence is sufficiently

serious to justify an exception to the so-called Stone standara.

1N 55143 DocId:32989575 Page 20

---

## Page 21

On the second question, the FBI was requested on

December 18 to provide examples of instances in which the

Bureau has actually prevented violence through an intelligence

investigation. As of the middle of this week, the Bureau had

provided ten such examples with underlying documents.

We are

attempting to summarize at least five of these cases, which

involve hundreds of documents, by Monday. The actual facts in

these five cases will be read into the record and would serve

as the basis for questioning the Bureau on whether intelli-

gence techniques can actually prevent violence by terrorist

groups and, secondly, how the wording of various formulations

of the

threshhold for such investigations, e.g., in the

Attorney General's guidelines, in the Bureau!s revised Manual

sections, or in a proposed legislative charter, would affect

their ability to prevent violence.

Finally, there are two.other areas

that should be

discussed on Monday. First, some of the witnesses on Monday,

in particular Robert Shackleford, have expressed concern about

whether the guidelines and proposals we are.considering do not

in effect eliminate so-called subversive investigations in

that neither the Attorney General nor the Committee are con-

sidering authorizing Bureau intelligence investigations where

the likelihood of violence is remote.

For example, he contends

that in most subversive investigations, that:'is of the Commu-

nist Party, the Socialist Workers Party, and other Marxist-

H# 55143 DocId: 32989575 Page 21

---

## Page 22

- 5

Leninist groups, the potential for violence is real but remote.

In other words, these groups believe that when the time is

ripe they Will engage in violence for the forcible overthrow

of the government, but that for the moment violence is not

necessary. Therefore, he would contend that an additional

exception is necessary for such investigations.

First Amend-

ment and other constitutional problems with such an exception

are obvious.

• The final area which should be discussed on Monday.

is the question of "preventive action". The Attorney General's

draft guidelines in Part IV would authorize the FBI to engage

in certain preventive action/COINTELPRO-type actions against.

intelligence targets. In essence, the Bureau would be per-

mitted to take action against a group or individual, above and

beyond arrest, where violence is imminent and arrest is imprac-

tical. The Bureau has provided us with examples of situations

in which they feel they should be authorized to engage in pre-

ventive action. Those examples, which are included as Attach-

mentlA, should be discussed

with the witnesses. It is inter-

esting to note that some, of these examples would not even be

permitted under the

Attorney General's guidelines.

We are aiso including, as Ättachment B,. a copy of

the Attorney General's draft guidelines for your review and will

have further materials, including summaries of the five cases

where violence was prevented, available on Monday morning.

Hon. Warren Magnuson

U.S. Senate

Washington, D. C.

Dear Senator Magnuson:

I have just read in the Seattle Times of 26 November 1975, an

article in which Mr. Clarence M. Kelley is reported to have said "there

might be some justification for firing or reprimanding agents involved

if they knew their acts might be illegal"! I am so outraged by the

incredible brass of that statement that I cannot wait to type this letter to

you.

Since when, I'd like to know, has being unaware of the illegality

of any act, been an adequate defence? I have always heard, since I was

a child, that in the U.S. "ignorance of the law is no excuse." And now,

Mr. Kelley is telling us that officers of the law, especially and vigorously

trained - not ordinary cops - might not know that their acts were illegal.

That's incredible? Mr. Kelley is obviously, in his own words, condemned

as being unfit to head the most potent police force in the nation.

I'd like to know what your thinking is on this matter.

Sincerely yours

Ernst I Gayden

On 1/30/76 W. Mark Felt, retired Bureau official, telephoned for Mr. Bassett

and in his absence out of town he talked with Inspector J. A. Conley. Mr. Felt advised

that he has been called to testify in Executive Session before the SSC on Tuesday,

2/3/76. He indicated that he had already had a discussion with staff members,

including Mr. Elliff, concerning his testimony, and thought that it would pertain to

the Bureau's Inspection Division's operations and why the Inspection Division over

the years had not known of certain activities engaged in by the Bureau. Mr. Felt

pointed out that in his preliminary discussion he was informed that the FBI had 16 different

wiretaps on Martin Luther King.

Felt said that he knew nothing about such wiretaps

occurring at that time. Mr. Felt offered his opinion that he believed that the testimony

would go along similar lines concerning the Inspection Division's functions in

the

past.

Mr. Felt stated that he was aware that Mr. Bassett was also scheduled to testify

on 2/3/76 and was calling merely to offer any assistance that he could concerning such

testimony and, in fact, thought that possibly we could be of some assistance to him.

It was pointed out to Mr. Felt that while Mr. Bassett had been scheduled to appear

before the SSC on two different days this current week, both of these appointments

had been cancelled by the committee and as Mr. Bassett had to go out of town next week,

the committee had been so informed that he would not be available to appear until on

for after 2/9/76, and the committee was aware of this fact.

During the conversation Mr.

Felt stated he thought he had been designatea

Assistant Director of the Inspection Division in October, 1964, and it was pointed

out to him that actually he took over this position from Mr. Gale on 114/ 64 and,

according to our records, remained as Assistant Director of the Inspection Division

until 7/9/71 when he went to Mr. Tolson's Office. Mr. Felt expressed appreciation

for the exact dates and he said he did not have these specific dates in mind but only

the general time frame, and he was also remined that prior to assuming the position

of Assistant Director in the Inspection Division he had-served as Number One Man

in the Training Division. Whether Mr. Felt remembered his position prior to

assuming the position of Assistant Director was not known, but he seemed appreciative

of this reminder.

The Attorney General

"A crime scene search and

processing of the crine scene by-the

Metropolitan POlice Departnent produced

negative results. No forcible entry

was noted and ir. Kraft advised Investigative

officers of the Metropolitan Police

Department that he had probably left

the front door ajar when he departed

the residence.

"On the morning of Septenber

4, 1969, the Metropolitan Police Department

vas advised by the Washington National

Airport Police that sono silverware -

had been found near one of the entrances

to the terminal at the Washington

National Airport. The silverware

was racovered by the lietropolitan

Police Department and processed for

latent fingerprints without success

and the itens were returned to llis.

Kraft upon her identification of the

silverware. Ho suspocts were developed

by either the FBI or the Metropolitan

Polico Department in the investigation

of the matter."

Mr. Raft did not recall having spoken to the

rBI about the burglary. Your letter noted the incident is

curious in that the only reference to it comes in the

nemorandun of July 13, 1973, discussing a press report

about the activities of John D. Bhrlichyan.

Two questions raised by you in your letter are:

1) "what other documents in FBI files say about

the Septenber 3, 1969, burglary?"

2) "that files of the Bureau or its

Washington Field Office (WFO) indicate about how the

conversation concerning the burglary took place?"

Headquarters (TBINQ) file 87-107157 and serials numbered two,

four, five and sis fron NFO file 87-17564. The enclosed

serials contain all information (excluding the July 18,

1973, memorandum, supra) which could be located in the

files of WFO and FBIIlQ regarding the Kraft burglary.

Xeroxes of serials one and three of TO file 87-17564 have

In response to question two, regarding FBIHQ or

took place, we refer you to the Xeroxas of the serials

this letter.

These serials, as noted above, contain all

and FBIHQ regarding the Kraft matter with the exception,

of course,.of the July 18, 1973, menorandun in question..

It is, noted that enclosad vro serial four,

A search of the

NOTE :

Per FBIHQ instructions 1/23/76, WFO reviewed

files for pertinent material regarding the AG inquiry as

2, 4, 5 and 6 from its file and advised newspaper review was

negative regarding Kraft burglary.

By way of further explanation it would appear

that retired SA James R. Wagoner, the author of the questioned

July 18, 1973, Bureau memorandum, may have deduced from

available FBIHQ serials that Kraft actually advised WEO

of the burglary, when in fact the serials do not state

that although serial 1 (enclosed) strongly suggests it.

We have not included this hypothesis in the letter to the

AG since it is speculation and the AG's request referred to

documentary-type information in our files.

Check with WFO

made by Supervisor I. E. Burns, INTD, with SA John P. Loonis,

The SSC caption has been utilized in responding

to this request since the matter at hand is related to

our response to an earlier ssc inquiry.

The following investigation was conducted by

SA RICHARD HO BLAY.

On September 10, 1969, Officer FREDERICK E. SUTTH,

Washington National Airpost Police Departinent advised he had

no knowledge regarding the recovery of the captioned item

other than the fact they were recovered by a Mr. PONDER KAME

of the rAl. He stated his only involvement in the matter

was to go to the Grounds Department at Washington National

Airport and bring the recovered silver to the Police

Office.

He stated he was aware of the theft of silver and

contacted the Metropolitan Police Depariment and advised

them of the findings of various silver items. Officon SMiTil

continued he had no krowledge it was in fact the missing

itenso

Officer SilITIl concluded by stating he has no knowledge

regarding the actual recovery of the stolen items.

On October 5, 1959, Mir. PONDER KAMP, 103 Ashby

Street, Aloxandriù, Virginia, advised he has been employed

by the Federal Aviation Administration since 1961 and is

presently assigned to the Building and Grounds Department

at Washington National Airport. Mr. KAMP said he did find

some items of silver in early September, 1969. He stated

he had been advised.by his boss, M.. MeCULLEN, to mow the grass

adjacent to the Maintenance Office Building located on the

"the buildings are occupied by Federal Aviatión Assoc. parsonnel

Mr: KAMP stated he had been mowing the lawn on the opposite

side of the building and came around to mow the other sido

at approximately 11:00 a.M..

He noticed this brown colored

cardboard box on the lawn. He described the box as being

approximataly 36" long by 18" deep and 18" wide.

Mr. KAMP

noticed the box as soon as he came around that side of the

building as it was not hidden in any respect as the grass

is mowed short and it was merely placed in this location

adjacent to a parking lot.

Mr. KAMP explained he went over

to remove the box fron the grass as it would be in his way

when moving the lawn. When he picked up the box, the bottom

fell out of it and he. noticed the box was soaked. Mr. KAM?

is of the opinion that the box had been placed there the

night before,

as to the best of his recollection it had

rained that night, but was not raining on the day he found

it. Mr. KAiP recalled picking up the several pieces of

silver and bringing it into his immediate supervisors

office, Mr. MCCULLEN. Mr. KAMP said that was the last

time he saw the silver. He said at the time he observed

the silver he had no idea it was worth very much as it did

not appear to him to be anything of value.

Mr. KAMP said the box fell apart when he picked

it up, and therefore he placed it in the dumpster. Mr.

KAMP explained that the dumpster is picked up daily and

the trash brought to the incinerator. Mr. KAMP concluded

by saying 'he has no knowledge as to who

could have placed

the box there nor has he any idea how long it was there

other then that which was previously stated concerning it

being there since the night before.

Dear Sir:

SANDINANCISTASHNUS

Your lotter of Tanuary 20, 1976 to Mr. Tin Kelso In Kansas City regarding

my speaking engagement in that city on January 24 has been reviewed.

I agree there is no truth in fact to the contention that my cover as a top

aide in A.I.M. "was blown in March of 1975, apparently by a leak within

the F.B.I." It is regretful that some printed material has related this

obvious misinformation.

H

To date, I have made approximately 70 speeches to audiences that numbered

approximately 21,000. I have also made numerous television appearances

with an estimated 18,000,000 viewing audience, 31 newspaper interviews

and 54 radio interviews with unknown circulation or audience size. At

all of the appearances, I have strongly stated that it has been proved t

my satisfaction that I was not exposed by a leak in the F.B.I. I have

also mentioned during many of these appearances and interviews the fact

that Senator Church's committee staff personally told me on May 8, 1975,

that they would "do anything we can to nail the F.B.I. to the cross" and

that they related they had associates who would be delighted to "dig up

some dirt, any kind of dirt, on the F.B.I." At present it appears I am not

even half doné with my tour and I'm going to continue carrying this message.

-953

I have never even had it suggested to me by an agent, employee or associate

of the F.B.I. that I should engage in any activity that would in any way be

illegal, immoral or unethical. This letter has not been solicited nor have

I had any communication with any agent, associate or employee of the

F.B.I. regarding this letter or the possibility of writing such correspondence.

I would willingly submit to a polygraph examination regarding all statements

contained in this letter.

Your leter of January 20, 1976 to Mr. Jim Kelso in Kansas City regarding

my speaking engagement in that city on January 24 has been reviewed.

I agree there is no truth in fact to the contention that my cover as a top

aide in A.I.M. "was blown in March of 1975, apparently by a leak within

the F.B.I." It is regretful that some printed material has related this

obvious misinformation.

To date, I have made approximately 70 speeches

to audiences that numbered

approximately 21,000. I have also made numerous television appearances

with an estimated 18,000,000 viewing audience, 31 newspaper interviews

and 54 radio interviews with unknown circulation or audience size. At

all of the appearances, I have strongly stated that it has been proved to

my satisfaction that I was not exposed by a leak in the F.B.I. I have

also mentioned during many of these appearances and interviews the fact

that Senator Church's committee staff personally told me on May 8, 1975,

that they would "do anything we can to nail the F.B.I. io the cross" and

that they related they had associates who would ba delighted to "dig up

some dirt, any kind of dirt, on the F.B.I," At present it appears I am not

even half done with my tour and I'm going to continue carrying this message.

I have never even had it suggested to me by an agent, employee or associate

of the F.B.I. that I should engage in any activity that would in any way be

illegal, immoral or unechical. This letter has not been solicited nor have

I had any communication with any agent, associate or employee of the

F.B.I. regarding this letter or the possibility of writing such correspondence.

I would willingly submit to a

3 polygraph examination regarding all statements

contained in this letter.

If you are confronted by the claim of any individual or group with information

that would seem to disagree with the contents of this communication, the

contents should, if you so desire, provide you with a reply. A reply to

this letter is neither expected nor anticipated.

Very sincerely YOUEs

enclosed for your records is a copy of the memorandum

It will be noted in respect to Itens 4 and 5

Of the request that it has been necessary to repeat to

the SS, through the enclosed memorandum, information

previously furnished to the SSC concerning original

recordings of documentation pertaining to Stanley David

Levison. It seems to us that the SSC's repetitive requests

for same material is counterproduetive to our abilities

no pitsare

to propare prompt responses for the SSG. This is

highlighted by the extremely short deadlines frequently

set by the SSC in its requests.

In short,

it unecessarily

adds to the ork burdens of the staffs of both the

Regarding Item 1, consideration was given to

furnishing the SSC the report which served as a basis

for including Levison on the SI. However, since the

special briefing provided to Senator Church and SSC Staff

Levison, it would unnecessarily jeopardize our highly

sensitive Communist Party sources to make this report

The New York Office by teletype dated August 10,

1956, requested authority for the installation of a microphone

surveillance on the office of stanley Levison, Room 601,

6 East 39th Street, New York City.

New York aduised that the

this installation was jeasible and could be

conducted with full security if space now available in Room 203

of this building is obtained for monitoring purposes.

The cost

of the installation is as follows: Monthly rental of monitoring

plant space $135 per month.

$150 as an initial payment to defray

redecorating expenses already incurred. Installation and monthly

charge for private telephone to be used in the plant operation.

orego the one-year lease requirement and-the

BY SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE STAFF MEMBERS

ALL INFORMATION COATAINED

IEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIEL

ATE 11 29,00

_ BY SPLALMKP

On January 22, 1976, Special Agent (SA) C. Jordan

Naylor was interviewed by Michael Madigan and Lester Seidel,

who introduced themselves as investigators for the Senate

Select Committee.

The interview was conducted at the

Federal Bureau of Investigation Office at San Diego,

California, and lasted approximately ninety minutes.

SA Naylor was not advised of his rights nor was he advised

that he could

have an attorney present during the interview.

It was mutually agreed that the interview would

be recorded on tape, and Mr. Madigan stated that a transcript

of the interview would be furnished to SA Naylor. SA Naylor

requested that the tape not be destroyed until after a

review of the transcript had been approved, to which Mr.

Madigan agreed.

The interview was conducted in a very

informal manner, beginning with the interviewers indicating

they had previously been Assistant U. S. Attorneys.

Adding

to the informality, neither investigator was dressed in a

business suit or necktie, and Mr. Seidel frequently placed

his feet on the table of

the interview room.

At the outset of the interview, Mr. Madigan

indicated the interview would center around activities of

Investigation (FBI) informant Howard Barry Godfrey.

Mr. Madigan began the interrogation by asking

how SA Naylor became acquainted with Mr. Godfrey.

SA Naylor recalled that he first met Howard

Barry Godfrey in 1966 in the company of former SA Eugene F.

O1sen.

It was recalled that on that occasion, Mr. Godfrey

appeared at the San Diego Office of the FBI on the recom-

mendation of a friend and was anxious to report information

regarding an attempt to recruit Godfrey into the Minutemen

organization.

Naylor recalled that Godfrey did not desire

to participate in this group but felt that due to the illegal

activities of the group, it should be reported to the FBI.

The illegal activities referred

specifically to the fact

that the group was gathering and storing arms, ammunition

and explosives to be used against the communists in their

attempts to take over the United States Government. The

specific results of that particular interview were not

recalled. In December, 1966, former SA Olsen retired

from the

FBI, and it was reported that Godfrey subsequently

contacted SA Naylor during the early part of 1967 regarding

additional activities of members of the Minutemen ôrganization.

From that time until laté in 1968, Mr. Godfrey was in

frequent contact with SA Naylor and was developed as a

criminal informant in an attempt to determine it the

materials being stockpiled by the Minutemen organization

in a ration.

were being stolen, with particular concern that the items

It was further reported

that toward the end of

1968, when Mr. Godfrey began furnishing information of a

security nature regarding the Minutemen Organization, that

Godfrey's direction was turned over to former SA Steven

Christensen, who was working in the field of internal

security.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Mr. Madigan asked at what period of time Godfrey

began furnishing information regarding the SAO.

SA Naylor advised that at no time did Godfrey

ever mention the SAO to SA Naylor, and the SAO was not

believed to be in existence during the time Godfrey was

under SA Naylor's supervision.

Mr. Madigan asked about any financial arrangements

between the FBI and Mr. Godfrey, with specific interest

in the exact amount of

money paid to Godfrey.

SA Naylor advised that to the best of his recol-

lection, Godfrey received only a small amount of remunera-

tion for his services, generally limited to expenses

incurred by Godfrey while participating in activities

with the Minutemen Organization.

It was indicated that the

entire amount of money paid to Godfrey by SA Naylor was

less than $400.00 during a one-and-a-half year period.

Mr. Madigan asked if the FBI ever financed Godfrey

in the purchase of arms and ammunition to be used by the

Minutemen Organization.

SA Naylor advised that he could not recall a

single instance in which funds were given to Mr. Godfrey

to be used in the purchase of any arms, ammunition or explo-

sives for use of the Minutemen organization.

It was indi-

cated that there may have been one or two limited occasions

when Godfrey reported that a large amount of ammunition

was in the possession of a Minutemen member, and on those

occasions, Godfrey was authorized to purchase one box of

ammunition Irom a large supply in an effort to trace that

ammunition

as to its origin in determining whether or not

it might be stolen Government property.

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Both Madigan andSeidel asked questions regarding

Godfrey's personal motives and his purposes for parti-

cipating in the

activities of the Minutemen Organization.

SA Naylor advised that it was his personal feeling

that Mr. Godfrey is a patriotic, loyal American citizen

and that through the entire period in which he served as

an FBI informant was anxious

attempt to put a stop to the illegal activities of members

of the Minutemen organization by making these illegal

activities known to proper law enforcement authorities.

The investigators were advised that any information fur-

nished by Godfrey was always properly disseminated to the

police department, sheriff's offbe or agents of the Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Agency as appropriate.

Madigan andSeidel asked questions relative to

the stability and dependability of Godfrey and were particu-

larly interested in determining whether or not his original

motives in following the activities of Minutemen members

might have ever changed with particular concern that he

may have developed an attitude of participating in Minutemen

activities in furtherance of his own personal desires.

SA Naylor stated that to his knowledge, the informant

was never anxious to participate in activities required of

him and frequently indicated a desire to disassociate

himself from the Minutemen Organization, fearing for his

It was

reported that Mr. Godfrey never changed his feelings or

initial purpose for reporting on activities of members of

the Minutemen Organization and never willingly served his

own purposes in participating in any activities carried

out by members of that group.

Investigators were advised

that Mr. Godfrey always reported activities of the group

in advance when

their plans were known; however, on frequent

RE: INTERVIEW OF FEDERAL BUREAU

an attorney present during the interview.

SA Petersen agreed that he had no objection to

having the interview taped, and was advised that a transcript

of the interview would be furnished to the San Diego Office of

the FBI by the interviewers.

SA Petersen was advised that the interview would

consist of information concerning Howard Barry Godfrey, a

Most of the questions were asked by Mr. Madigan.

Mr. Madigan indicated that the SAO was one and the

as to when the SAO originated.

Minutemen organization interested in it. Both organizations

The SAO first started with a

meeting held somewhere In Arizona in about february, 1969.

sA Petersen stated that he was of the opinion that godtrey

did not attend this meeting, but pointed out that there were

others who felt that he did. Godfrey had been an informant

prior to this time and was a member of the SAO from its

inception.

Mr. Madigan inquired whether Godfrey was one of

those informants who gets into an organization feeling opposed

and then alter getting into it, turns and becomes a working

and active member of the organization.

He asked if Godfrey

liked being in the organization. SA Petersen advised that

Godfrey did not like being in the organization,

and that

SA Petersen had been with former SA Steven Christensen when

Godfrey had strongly requested to be allowed to get off the

hook and no longer be an informant. SA Petersen pointed out

that Godfrey was a gun enthusiast and liked guns and associated

items, and therefore, enjoyed being with and associating with

other

persons who were interested in guns, such as members of

right wing organizations, but it was reiterated that Godfrey

did not like to be an informant; that he did not ask to become

an intormant in the tirst place, and that he would gladly have

ceased being an informant during the period of time that the

SAO was in existence. SA Petersen advised that he has the highest

regard for Howard Barry Godfrey and feels that he is an

individual who is pro-law enforcement and pro-FBI, and did his

best to do a good job as an informant for the FBI.

Questions were asked whether money was ever furnished

to Godirey to purchase explosives or weapons for the SAo.

SA Petersen replied that never was money furnished to Godfrey

for purchase of explosives or weapons for the SAO. It was

pointed out that Godfrey had in the past

purchased explosives

or weapons: however, they were purchased to be turned over to

the fBl to get them out of the hands of people who had them.

A discussion was also had concerning explosives, weapons and

material placed in Godfrey's possession to hold

for an individual

which were obtained by the FBI and turned over to Alcohol,

Tobacco and Firearms Division of the Treasury Department.

Some of the material was lost by Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms

to furnish money

pointed out that on at least one occasion, officials of

AT&I had come to San Diego from Los Angeles to personally

talk to Godfrey, who was known to them as

of the fBI, concerning a threatened bombing of their head-

quarters.

The question of whether Godfrey might have given

William Francis Yakopec any explosives came up, and it was

explained that Godfrey and Yakopec were next door neighbors

and friends, and that it was possible that explosives had

been passed

back and forth between them, but that Godfrey

not give him explosives to use in bombing the Guild Theater.

Regarding Yakopec, the staff members were advised that Yakopec

was inspired to bomb the Guild Theater because he was excited

by pornography and was tempted to view such movies and purchase

such material, and because of this, which was strongly opposed

by his religious feelings, he felt

that if he could destroy

places which showed pornographic movies or sold pornographic

material, he could remove the temptation from himself.

time that he bombed the Guild Theater, Yakopec would probably

not have been prosecuted, because all local law enforcements,

including the san Diego Police Department, the San Diego

County Sheriff's Office,

the California Bureau

of Investigation,

and the EBl thought that Godirey was of such value within the

that he should not be exposed merely to prosecute someone

like Yakopec.

When Yakopec decided to throw a bomb into the

Genie Massage Parlor, wherein he was going to throw a bomb

over a stone fence into a swimming pool, Agents of the FBI

felt that this could possibly kill or injurpeople in the pool,

and it was decided that Godfrey's status as informant could no

longer be protected to allow such an incident to occur.

that time, he was turned over to the police department

source for testimony against Yakopec, as well as Hoover and

other Secret Army individuals who had violated the law.

Questions were asked regarding why Steve Christensen

had kept the pistal used by George Mitchell Hoover to shoot

Paula Tharp in the elbow.

The staff investigators were advised

that at the time the shot was fired into Peter Bohmer's home

- 3 -

DocId: 32989575

SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

Godirey and Hoover were riding in Godirey's car, when Hoover

took a gun from under the front seat and after

looking at 1t,

suddenly fired at a lighted window in Bohmer's house. At

the time he shot at the window, Hoover remarked this gun

shoots low, indicating that he

intended to shoot at the top

of the window and not to shoot through the window at such a

level that he could hit someone inside the house.

Shortly

thereafter, Godfrey advised former SA Steven Christensen that

Hoover had fired the shot which struck Paula Tharp.

Godfrey

also turned over the gun to Steven Christensen.

Christensen

probably felt that if he turned over the gun to the police

department,

that they would immediately prosecute Hoover, and

n to theoover, and

would reveal Godfrey's status as an informant.

Former

SA Steven Christensen and SA Petersen went to the San Diego

Police Department and advised Captain Kenneth O'Brien that

Hoover had been the individual who fired the pistol striking

Paula Tharp in the elbow.

This information was kept at a high

level in the police department, as they agreed that informant

Godfrey was very

important to law enforcement to determine what

was going on inside the SAO. It was asked whether Christensen

had advised any superior in the FBI that he had the gun,

SA Petersen replied that he had not, inasmuch as he would then

have been immediately ordered to turn the gun over to the

police department for use as evidence in the Hoover trial.

Christensen, instead, took the gun home, wrapped it in cloth,

and placed it under a couch in his living room.

Later, when

Godfrey was being interviewed by Deputy District Attorney

Paula Tharp.

In reply to this question, Godfrey answered that

he did not wish to answer the question.

Christensen who had the gun.

aid not wish to discuss or answer this question. It became

clearly obvious that Huffman had determined Steven Christensen

had the gun and that Godfrey, because he would answer all'of

the

other questions, and no questions pertaining to the gun,

was

shielding Christensen. At that point, SA Petersen advised

- 4 -

HH 55143

DocId:32989575

Page 110

---

## Page 111

SENATE SELECT COMMITTE ON

INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS

that he would contact Christensen and ask him if he had

•the gun.

This was done, and Christensen advised in answered

questions that he did have the gun, that he was willing to

turn it over to the san Diego Police Department, that

SA Petersen should accompany Detectives to his home to turn

over the gun, and that the key to the house could be obtained

from a woman

and company bototy

taking care of the house. SA Petersen and

Detective Brandon went to Christensen's house and Detective

Brandon recovered the pistol for evidence in the trial of

Hoover.

SA Petersen advised that in his opinion, Christensen

kept the gun for evidence in any future trial involving the

shooting of Paula Tharp, and that he kept it at home in order

to protect his informant from appearing as a witness, and

therefore destroying his further activity as an informant.

Questions were asked

concerning the amount of

money paid to Godfrey for services and expenses.

SA Petersen

remarked that probably the highest payments to Godfrey were

made after SA Petersen became the primary Agent handling

Godfrey on July 10, 1972.

After that time, Godirey was in

a position of being a witness in upcoming Grand Juries and

trials, and he was paid $250 for services in a month, and at

one time, was given

• $200 for expenses in connection with

bond money for Secret Army members that had been arrested.

At that time, Godfrey's status as an informant was still

secure. It

was pointed out that Godfrey was paid very little

for his services. over a long period of time, with payments

as

small as $40 with $12 for expenses. At the

time he became

Involved in the secret Army, his payments increased because

his activity increased considerably and his expenses increased

somewhat because he was driving his car more.

Questions were

asked concerning money actually paid as expenses to the SAO,

and it was pointed out to the Senate Investigators that if

Godfrey paid dues to an organization or bought a ream of

paper

for them, he would be compensated for this expense.

And that

in this sense he had paid some of the expenses of the SAO.

It was pointed out that this would be true of any informant

in any organization.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

MEREIN I6 UNGLASSIFIED

10OBY 572A

On January 22, 1976, at the Office of the Federal

Bureau of Investigation (FBI), San Diego, California, the

writer

was interviewed by Michael Madigan and Lester Seidel,

Counsel for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,

(202) 224-1700, G-308 D50B, Washington, D. C. 20510, con-

cerning the captioned matter and specifically for any

knowledge the writer might have concerning the "recruitment

of Howard Barry Godfrey as an informant for the FBI."

The writer advised Mr. Madigan and Mr. Seidel

that several months before the retirement of the writer

from the FBI on December 31, 1966, he was contacted by

the above Howard Barry Godfrey, who furnished the writer

with information to the effect that he had learned that one

Jerry Dikus, then living in the La Mesa or El Cajon,

California, area, had a quantity of firearms and ammunition

in his possession, that he had indicated to Godfrey that

he had firearms in the trunk of his car, and to the best

of the writer's knowledge, he had firearms concealed either

in his house or garage, or both.

Godfrey indicated that he had furnished this

information to Mr.'J. Clifford Wallace, then an attorney

in San Diego and now a Federal juäge in San Diego, who at

that time was serving as Stake President of the then San

Diego East Stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter

Day Saints, which then comprised the La Mesa and El Cajon

area, and Mr. Wallace suggested he contact the writer at

the FBI Office in San Diego to report this information,

which he did.

informed Godfrey that the above information appeared to

be of interest to the FBI both from the possibility that

it might involve a theft of firearms and ammunition or

the interstate transportation of stolen firearms and ammuni-

tion and

also with regard to the internal security of the

nation and the possibility of illegal and subversive ac-

tivities on the part of Dikus and others. It is the recol-

lection of the writer that he asked Godfrey to furnish

promptly to the FBI any additional information which he

might obtain concerning these activities of Dikus and/or

others.

To the best of the writer's knowledge, he had

never known or seen Godfrey prior to the above interview,

and to the best of his recollection, he has not seen him

since, as it is the writer's recollection that he introduced

Godfrey to Special Agent (SA) C. Jordan Naylor and perhaps

other Agents to whom Godfrey was to report any additional

pertinent information that might come to his attention.

The writer was asked whether he considered the

potential of Godfrey as an informant for the Bureau at the

time of the above interview with him in 1966.

no sureau at the

replied that in this case,

as

in all other similar cases of

any

such information of value to the Bureau furnished by

any person whatever, the writer would certainly have been

alert to the possibility of utilizing the services of any

person who might be in a position to serve as an informant

or source of information by reason of his acquaintance or

association with subjects of an FBI investigation for the

purpose of obtaining valuable information of interest to

the Bureau.

It was pointed out by the writer, however, that

inasmuch

as the writer retired from the Bureau in December,

1966, he has no personal knowledge as to the activities of

Godfrey either as an FBI informant or otherwise.

information which came to the attention of the writer, however,

was in a completely correct manner and was handled in a

completely correct manner and made a matter of record.

The writer pointed out that he considers that Mr. Wallace

did exactly the right thing, both as an attorney and as a

church official, in recommending to Godfrey that he contact

the FBI to furnish to them information in his possession

which might be of interest to the Bureau and that Godfrey

himself did

exactly the right thing in so doing. The writer

further stated that so far as his knowledge is concerned,

everything in this matter was handled in a completely

correct manner.

He pointed out, further, that any information

concerning the actual development of Godfrey as an intormant,

if any, or concerning his activities as an informant, if

any, would have to be obtained from Agents having later

contact with him,

as the writer's contact with him was

limited to the

initial contact referred to above or possibly

a second contact with him but did not extend further in the

matter.

Iwo main alternatives were developed for where the materials

should be stored.

These were the National Security Agency (NSA)

Reference is made to your letter dated

January 21, 1976, Captioned as above, In which

you requested our views coneerning proposals loI

a warrant requirement for informants in domestic

intelligence cases.

This Bureau's responses to

the list oi the five questions submitted in the

enclosure to referenced letter are set forth in

numerical order.

I. The Attorney General's proposed

guidolines are under extensive consideration and

the guidelines have not yet been finalized.

As

the guidelines are not as yot implemented in a

tinal form, it is not possible to determine at

this time how they will be administered or

whether their implementation will substantially

reduce the number of cases and the related use

of informants.

This, norever,

in Do way would

• affect the TBI's position that such a

requirement

, Is overly burdensome and unnecessary as informants

haxo been used since time immemorial and such

usa-is clearly logal.

2. The number of warrants required for

approxinately 1,000 intolligence informants would number

much more than 1,000. for example, one intelligonce

Informant may be targeted against a number of organizations

and individuals of investigative interest and it is assumed

a Waxrant would be required in each instance.

It is not

unconnon for an intelligonce informant to be in position

to furnish information on approximately 100 persous and

many oxganizations of investigative interest.

Accordingly,

it is not difficult to see that one active intolligence.

informant could require a large number of warrants.

The workload of the judicial system would be faced vith

a great many more warrant requirements than the numerical

size of intelligence informants. It is believed that such

warrant requirements would number well into the thousands

which obviously would place an additional strain on an

already overloaded judicial syste

requircuent would greatly be reduced if judicial approval

was required, not for each individual intormant, but for the

use of a particular nunber oi iniormants asainst a eroup

that is the subject of a domestic intelligence investigation.

The number of warrants undor this procedure would be reduced;

however, this in no way would alter the impracticalities of

obtaining a warrant.

Reasons why this should not be done

are set out hereinalter.

As you know, the Keith decision addressed the

constitutional standards required for electronic surveillances

of domestic organizations.

The court suggested that greater

latitude nighi be given in such matters because os the

special polloy and practical considerations involved.

liven i1 such allowances are made, we do not believe it is

fcasible to regulate the use of informants by judicial

warrants. If the warrants are to be meaningful, it would be

necessary for the courts to supervise and monitor the

activities of the informant on a continuing basis. These

procedures would delay the investigative process and

impose onormous administrative burdons on the courts

and agencies involved. In addition, judgments would be

required about the role of the informant and the relevance

of information that we feel are best made by the executive

branch. As the Attorney General pointed out, extension of

the warrant requirement in this way "would be a step toward

the inquisitorinl systen of justice," Moreover, it would

undormine the independence and "neutrality of the judiciary,

a neutrality wich our system takes pains to protect."

5. Approval by the Attorney General or his

designce of the usa of informants in domestic intelligence

investigationa would not bo practical. As you aro aware,

the guidelines that aro being proposod would alco affect

the use oi our intornants.

The enforcing of these

guidelines should be an adequate sateguard. Any poLicy

which would requiro the individual approval of each Bureau

informant outside this Bureau should be considered as a

questionable and irregular practice.

In view of the above, this Bureau is of the

opinion that the neod for a warrant roquirement is

impractical, unecossary and, in substance, totally

unworkable,

not only from an

intolligence viewpoint,

but also fron a logislative and judicial vievpoint as so

many intricato facots are involved.

The mandatory use

of warrants in our informant operations in connection with

intolligence investigations night well upair our

national dolense,

The Senate Select Committee requested of the

Department the Bureau's views concerning the utilization

oi warrants involving informants in domestic intelligence

investigations.

The Senate specifically asked five questions

of the Department and the Department in turn requested

our viewpoints in each of the five questions.

questions involve the following: (1) what effect the new

guidelines would have on the utilization and number of warrant

applications involving informants, (2) an assescent of the

workload on the judicial systen if warrants were utilized,

(3) an assessment of the practicality of a warrant

requirement, it applied,

not to each individual informant

but for the

use of a particular number of informants against

a group under investigation, (4) what standard would the

Bureau suggest for a warrant requirement for intelligence

Informants, and (5) an opinion on the proposal that the

Attorney General or his designee approve informant use as

opposed to a judicial warrant requirement. This matter

was coordinated with SA Tony J. Seabaugh, Ixtremist

ITE LI 24/00 BY SPEAMK

Dear Mir. Attorney General:

During your appearance before the Select Committee

on December 11, 1975, there was considerable discussion

concerning proposals for a warrant requirement for the

use of paid

and controlled informants to infiltrate

political groups in domestic intelligence investigations.

You expressed concern that a warrant requirement in such

cases would be impractical and would unduly burden the

courts.:

: Second, you indicated the Justice Department would

be developing guidelines for the use of informants.

eresumably, their provisions might so limit. the manner and

credicate for use of informants as

to make a warrant

requirement unnecessary.

To explore this matter in greater detail before the

Committee drafts its recommendations, we seek your comment

on the enclosed set of questions which are designed to

focus on some of the practical aspects of a warrant

requirement.

In addition, please feel free to comment on

other aspects of a warrant requirement for infoimants and

to state. the case against warrants, including what provi-

sions might be included in the prospective guidelines which

would tend to make a warrant requirement less useful.

Sincerely yours,

Fired A O Schiving 7

ATTACIIMENT

If the effect of new guidelines on the opening of

domestic intelligence investigations is to sub-

stantially reduce the number of such investigations,

would there not be a corresponding reduction in the

number of intelligence informants? If so, would this

not greatly reduce the number of warrant applications

that would have to be submitted to the courts or to

an administrative review body? Would this affect

your view that such a requirement is overly burdensome?

According to figures submitted to the Select Committee

by the FBI; as of June 30, 1975, there were 1,040

domestic intelligence informants.

How would you assess

the impact on the work load of the judicial system if

a warrant application were applied to an informant

program of this approximate size?

Would not the alleged impracticality of an informant

warrant requirement be greatly reduced if judicial

approval was required, not for each individual informant,

but for the use of a particular number of informants

against a group that is the subject of a domestic

intelligence investigation? What are the reasons why

this could not be done?

In United States v. United States District Court, 407

U.S. 297 (1972), the Supreme Court stated that differ-

ent standards for a warrant application may be appro-

priate as between criminal surveillances and those

involving domestic security. 407 U.S. 322-323. What

standard would you suggest for a warrant requirement

for intelligence informants?

What is your view with respect to the proposal that,

rather than a judicial

warrant requirement, the Attorney

General or his designee approve the use of informants

in domestic intelligence investigations?

Dear General Levi:

We have been asked to chair a special suicommittee

of the Select Committee on Intelligence which will con-

centrate on matters relating to domestic intelligence

activities of the Federal

government.

Our mandate is to

prepare for the full committee's consideration a draft

report of findings of fact on alleged abuses or excesses

by the FBI and other domestic intelligence agencies; the

causes of such

alleged abuses or excesses and recommendations

wich the Committee might make to remedy the problems we

have uncovered.

We are

aware of the fine work in which your staff has

been engaged in these areas and hope that they will be

available to work with the Committee staff on

these matters.

However, the Subcommittee finds the Committee record needs

to be supplemented in several important respects and

there-

fore finds it necessary to direct a number of requests to

the FBI for further information which we hope will be

treated on a priority basis so that the Subconmittee can

set by the full committce.

These and

future requests which will be handled between the two

committee counsel or Mr. Elliff, Domestic Tasl: Force Leader,

and Mr. Shaheen, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coor-

dination, will pertain to both information necessary for

us to formulate meaningful recommendations and to pursue

matters on certain specific alleged abuses which remain

unsettled. Among the future requests will be questions

pertaining to your guidelines on "Domestic Security Inves-

tigations"

and on mansover and budget statistics for the

FEI's domestic intelligence program.

For us to meet the deadline set by the full committee,

it is essential that the information requested below be

RE: INTERVIEW OF SPECIAL AGENT DAVID RYAN

OF THE INTELLIGENCE DIVISION, FBI HEAD-

QUARTERS, BY SSC STAFF MEMBERS

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

DATE

On October 13, 1975, Miss Barbara Banoff, staff member,

Senate Select Committee (SSC), telephonically contacted Special Agent

(SA) David Ryan and requested he furnish, on October 14, 1975, an

informal briefing to staff members of the SSC. This briefing was

allorded to the stait members on October 14, 19%5, from 10 a.m.

until 1:30 p.m. Participating as representatives of the fBl were

Mr. Hunter E. Helgeson, Inspector-Deputy Assistant Director,

Intelligence Division, and SA David Ryan, Unit Chief, Analytical

Research Unit, Intelligence Division. Miss Banoff, Ms. Mary DeOreo,

and Messrs. Mark Gitenstein, Arthur Jefferson and Sam Bouschard

represented the SSC staff. This informal briefing generally encom-

passed all areas of the discontinued Counterintelligence Programs

(Cointelpros). All questions put forth by the SSC staff were forth-

rightly answered.

Subsequently on the morning of October 15, 1975,

Miss Banoff telephonically requested SA Ryan to depose under oath

before the SSC on the morning of October 16, 1975. Thereafter,

on the late afternoon of December 15, 1975, Banoff caused to be

delivered to SA Ryan a 14-page document entitled "Cointelpro -

Assoc. Dir.

J. S. Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect

To Intelligence Activities (SSC)

On October 16, 1975, SA Ryan was interviewed from

10 a.m. to 6 p.m., excluding approximately one hour for lunch, by

SSE staff members at SSC offices in the former Carroll Arms Hotel,

Washington, D. C. Participating in the questioning were Miss Banoff,

Vis. DeOreo, Mr. Gitenstein, and Mr. Frederick A. O. Schwarz, JT.,

Chief Counsel of the SSC. Also present was Ms. Rosemary Tacione,

Court Reporter.

Miss Banoff stated that no member of the Committee

(Senator) was available and thus Kyan would not be placed under oath.

She stated that upon completion and transcription of the deposition

Ryan would be asked to affirm under oath to its accuracy at which

time his afirmation would be administered by a Senator. Ryan

questioned as to whether this deposition would be classified, the level

of classification, and the identity of the classifying officer.

Banoff

stated she was not sure of the correct answer to this question but

indicated because the deposition would encompass FBI documents

which were classified up to and including "Top Secret" the entire

deposition would be so classified by the SSC. She added that the SSC

had agreed with the FBI that no information received during this

deposition would be publicized without the agreement of the FBI or

Department of Justice. Based upon this commitment, the interview

was commenced.

During the deposition, a number of internal FBI documents

which had previously been furnished the SSC through established

liaison with the Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of the

Department, after being identified by Ryan, were entered as exhibits

Into the testimony. A number of these documents were classified up

to "Top Secret," However, at the request of the SSC, these docu-

ments were subsequently reviewed by FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ),

appropriate deletions were specified, and the documents with the

deletions were declassified for use by the SSC in public hearings.

This notice of declassification appears in FBIHQ memorandum dated

November 14, 1975, which has been referred to the SSC..

To Intelligence Activities (SSC)

At the request of Miss Banoff, Fyan signed an "Advice

of Rights" and "Walver of Rights" statement, a copy of which is

attached.

Ryan requested and received permission of the SSC staff

members to make an opening statement. In this statement and in

subsequent portions of the interview, he outlined he had been assigned

supervision at FBIHQ for FBI Cointelpros for the approximate period

1963-1967. He said his supervision primarily related to the program

directed against the Communist Party, USA (CPUSA), although he had

been instrumenta. in preparing initiating documents relating to the

programe directed against White Hate Groups, Black Extremists,

Soviet-bloc Intelligence and the Special Operations, noting that the

latter was in the nature of a control file utilized for consideration of

a variety of intelligence-type operations primarily in the foreign or

counterintelligence areas. He indicated he had been knowledgeable

of the Cointelpro while serving in an FBI field office and since the

fall of 1974 he had been assigned responsibility at FBIHQ for coordi-

nating all matters relating to the discontinued Cointelpro operations.

The latter included matters relating to Freedom of Information Act

requests; press inquiries, and other publicity afforded the programs;

civil suits, and inquiries of various congressional committees.

Ryan advised it was his view the FBI, during the period

1956 to 1971, reasonably, and within the perimeters of existing law,

utilized Cointelpro activities for the sole purpose of limiting the

capability of those practicing massive violence and subversion to the

detriment of the American people and our constitutional form of

government. He advised his review of these programs and his experi-

ence with the CPUSA Program convinced him that they had an impact

on the crises of the time, helped bring about favorable change, and

that the FBI personnel involved acted with a reasonable, good faith

beliet they were doing what was necessary and lawiul.. He advised

the Department of Justice had conducted a thorough review of the

programs and had concluded none of the actions taken constituted a

prosecutable violation of Federal statutes and only a small minority

posed problems of civil liability. Ryan cited the so-called Petersen

Report on FBI Cointelpros, a sanitized copy of which was released

by then Attorney General William B. Saxbe on November 18, 1974,

which stated, "The overwhelming bulk of these activities were clearly

legitimate and proper undertakings, within the scope of the FBI's on-

going responsibilities. "

Ryan also advised that in addition to the Petersen

Committee review of the FBI Cointelpros, a review had also been

conducted in late 1974 by Assistant Attorney General J. Stanley

Pottinger of the Civil Rights Division. As a result of this latter

review, it was announced by the Civil Rights Division on January 3,

1075, that it had "found no basis for criminal charges against any

particular individual involving particular incidents. "

Thereafter, the questioning commenced in accordance

with the general "Cointelpro - Deposition Outline, " Although

Miss Banotf endeavored to confine her questioning to the outline,

Ms. DeOreo requested extensive elaboration and constantly questioned

whether Cointelpro activities were conducted in substantive files other

than those captioned Cointelpro, This latter question was repeated on

a number of occasions with Ryan responding that all matters relating

to the rules and administration of the Cointelpros were handled ordi-

narily in the Cointelpro files.

u. S. Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect

To Intelligence Activities (SSC)

During the discussion of the origin, implementation,

supervision, and controls afforded to the Cointelpro targeted against

the Communist Party, USA, Ryan outlined in detail the rationale for

institution of this program which became the model for other subse-

quent Cointelpro efforts. He advised the FBI was concerned regarding

the impunity with which the CPUSA and its members violated the laws

of the United States and this was one strong reason for the initiation

of the program.

He cited the fact that there was documented informa-

tion that the CPUSA had served as a puppet of the Soviet Union in this

country since its founding in 1919 and that it had been a front for

intelligence as well as political activities of the Soviet Government.

He commented in some detail regarding evidence of the use of the

Party as a vehicle for intelligence and indicated that there was still

strong evidence of the Soviet domination and control of the CPUSA.

When the program against the CPUSA was initiated, one of the initial

tasks was to alert the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the identities

of over a hundred Communist Party members who had assumed false

identities and were operating in an underground status with false

identification and through filing false Federal income tax information,

Ryan commented regarding the Smith Act of 1940 which, at great

expense in terms of FBI resources and informant coverage, was

unsuccessfully utilized to contain communism. He indicated that the

Internal Security Act of 1950 and the Communtet Control Act of 1954

similarly had been rendered ineffective as a result of Supreme Court

decisions. Congress had clearly indicated its intention to contain the

Communist Party through this legislation, and there was a general

attitude in the country that the communist problem should be "left to

the FBI." The initiation of the program against the CPUSA was a

collective decision motivated by FBI field offices and Headquarters

supervision in response to the conditions cited above.

During the entire deposition, Ryan on two instances

touched upon sensitive areas possibly subject to classification, These

were in his comments relating to the foreign influence of the Communist

Party and in his comment that one specific Cointelpro action directed

- 5-

against the Party had possibly rendered the Party then and now ineffec-

tive. He was asked by SSC stati members to elaborate on these areas,

and specifically by Chief Counsel Schwarz, but he refused to go into

details based on the sensitivity and classified nature of the subject

matter. The deposition furnished by Ryan, with review and possible

excisions in these two areas of discussion, could be readily

declassitied.

During the deposition, Ryan was repeatedly queried for

his opinion regarding the motivation and intentions of individuals

involved with the Cointelpro. On a number of occasions Ryan

refused to furnish his opinion stating as an FSI Agent for over 24

years he felt uneasy when discussing other than factual situations.

SSC staff members and particularly Chief Counsel Schwarz stated

that it was vital to their inquiry that the opinions of knowledgeable

personnel in the intelligence community be provided to the SSC.

Each of the five basic Cointelpros was discussed in some

detail. Ryan indicated he was not personally involved with the

Cointelpro directed against black extremists or New Left revolu-

tionaries and that his knowledge of these programs primarily was

hearsay or based upon his review of documentation in FBIHQ files.

He pointed out on numerous occasions in response to questioning

that the programs were tightly supervised at FBIHQ, that there was

no: intent to harass, that each recommended technique was considered

based on a counterintelligence objective, and that to his knowledge no

violence resulted from any authorized Cointelpro action. He pointed

out in a number of instances Cointelpro proposals were denied because

of the possibility of physical harm and cited as an example the instance

in 1968 when FBIHQ had instructed a West Coast field office to alert

local police and two members of an extremist organization that a

competing black militant group had plans to murder them.

Without citing specific examples, Ryan advised that the

Cointelpro directed against the Communist Party had developed a

number of sophisticated intelligence gathering techniques which were

and continue to be productively utilized by the FBI in meeting its

foreign counterintelligence responsibilities.

A major portion of the deposition on October 16, 1975,

was consumed with questioning and the introduction of FBI documents

regarding notification furnished by the FBI to the Executive and

Legislative Branches regarding the Cointelpros and Cointelpro activity.

In this regard, Ryan commented in some detail regarding the follow~

ing matters and documents which he cited as constituting notification

to responsible authorities of the existence of the programs:

1. The late Director J. Edgar Hoover briefed

President Lisenhower and members of the Cabinet regarding the

Cointelpro directed against the Communist Party on November 6, 1958,

2. Letters relating to Cointelpros were directed to

Attorneys General William Rogers on May 8, 1958, Robert Kennedy

on January 10, 1961, Nicholas DeB. Katzenbach on September 2,

1965, Ramsey Clark on December 19, 1967, and John Mitchell on

September 17, 1969. The first two letters related to Cointelpro

activities directed against the CPUSA and the latter three related to

Cointelpro actions directed against the Ku Klux Klan and related

groups. Additionally, a copy of the letter dated May 8, 1958, was

sent to Presidential Aide Robert Cutler at the White House. A copy

of the letter dated January 10, 1961, was sent to Secretary of State

Dean Rusk, and a copy of the letter dated September 2, 1965, was

sent to Presidential Aide Marvin Watson at the White House.

It was

noted that by letter dated September 3, 1965, Attorney General

Katzenbach congratulated the late Director Hoover for efforts against

the Klan, indicating it was unfortunate that these activities could not

be afforded publicity so the Bureau could receive its due credit.

3, Detailed information relating to the FBI Cointelpros

had been prepared by former Director Hoover for "off-the record"

testimony before the House Subcommittee on Appropriations for six

appearances before the Subcommittee between 1958 and 1966.

4.

It was indicated that former Assistant to the Director

Cartha DeLoach advised in November, 1974, he specifically recalled

briefing Attorney General Clark and President Lyndon Johnson

regarding Cointelpro activities. Former Assistant to the Director

John Mohr advised in November, 1974, he recalled the Director, on

several occasions, had furnished detailed information relating to the

Cointelpros to the House Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Mr. Nicholas P, Callahan, current Associate Director of the FBI,

also recalled in November, 1974, that in the past Director Hoover

had furnished information to the House Subcommittee on Appropriations

relating to our Cointelpros.

Ryan stated he personally recalled on numerous occasions

during the period 1963-1967 he prepared write-ups and summaries

relating to the Cointelpro directed against the Communist Party and

relating to Cointelpro actions. It was his understanding these write-

ups would be routed to Director Hoover for his use in briefing

appropriate Government officials regarding FBI Cointelpro efforts.

At the conclusion of the deposition on October 16, 1975,

Mr. Schwarz advised Ryan it was contemplated by the SSC that three

days of publicly televised testimony would be afforded to FBI

Cointelpro activities. He said Ryan would be the principal witness

on these days.

At the request of the SSC, Ryan appeared at SSC offices

in the Carroll Arms Hotel on October 21, 1975, and deposed from

2 p.m. until 5 p.m. SSC staff members present included Miss Banoff,

Ms. DeOreo and Mr. Bouschard. Mr. Frank Shelbourne was present

as Court Reporter.

At the beginning of this session, Ryan advised he desired

to make an opening statement. He advised he had reflected upon some

of the questions asked by Miss Banoff which appeared to overempha-

size actions involving sex or immorality utilized in the Cointelpros.

Ryan expressed concern that Banoff's interest was for headline

purposes and not to seriously study the problem and to develop

appropriate legislation to enable the FBI to meet Ite responsibilities

in combating revolutionary extremist and subversive activities. He

pointed out that he was concerned that Banoff appeared to be empha-

sizing a relatively few documents that dealt in the area of immorality

on the part of Cointelpro targets, to the exclusion of the abundance of

material she had been permitted to review which described legitimate,

proper and effective actions calculated to curtail violence, subversion

and extremism. He indicated he had determined through Banoff her-

self that she planned to question former SA Russell Horner, who had

been responsible for Headquarters supervision of the New Left

Cointelpro, extensively regarding Cointelpro actions involving

immorality, and that she would question SA Thomas J. Deakin, who

had been responsible for Headquarters supervision of the Black

Extremist Colntelpro, in these areas. Ryan stated that Banoff'e

preoccupation in this area of sensationalism precluded objective

discussion looking towards effective legislation and he therefore

questioned the desirability of continuing his deposition to the SSC.

To support his contention, he quoted from Category 12,

"Informing Family or Others of Fadical or Immoral Activity, "

in the Petersen Report on FBI Cointelpros, which indicated,

U. S. Senate Select Committee to Study

Governmental Operations with Respect

To Intelligence Activities (SSC)

"These activities represent a little more than one percent of all

Cointelpro activities--a total of some 30 instances in all domestic-

based programs. This type of activity was reported to have been

used infrequently in connection with the Communist Party, USA,

Program, and was not used in connection with the Socialist Workers

Party Program. It was reported to have been used in 12 instances

in connection with the Black Extremists Program, in two instances

in connection with the White Hate Groups, and in 16 instances in

connection with the New Left." Banoff advised in response to this

citation that the SSC would make its own determination as to what

areas of FBI abuse it would explore and that the SSC did not neces-

sarily agree with the accuracy or conclusions of the Petersen Report.

At this point Ryan indicated an intention to discontinue his participa-

tion in the interview.

Following a lengthy off-the-record discussion, Banoff

agreed that she would express the concern of Ryan, as set forth

above, to both the Chief Counsel and Minority Counsel of the

Committee with the request that if they saw fit they would communi-

cate Ryan's concern to the SSC members (Senators). Banoff agreed

that she would advise Fyan in writing when this action had been taken.

Based on the above consideration, which Ryan requested

be read into the testimony, he agreed to continue with the deposition.

The balance of the deposition was extremely general in

nature, discussing such matters as the administration, supervision

and coordination of the programs, and relationship to other FBI intel-

ligence and investigative efforts and the bases for their termination.

During the period November 11-13, 1975, Ryan presented

himself at SSC offices to review the transcript of his deposition.

This transcript, which was classified "Top Secret, " consisted of two

volumes of 174 pages and 165 pages, respectively, and 27 exhibits.

Although it is believed the transcript accurately indicated the true

character of the Cointelpro effort and substantiated the contention

that the programs had an impact on the crises of the time, helped

bring about favorable change, and that FBI personnel acted with a

reasonable, good belief they were doing what was necessary and

lawful, there were numerous inaccuracies and errors in the transcrip-

tion which generally distorted the testimony. These included highly

significant errors such as use of the word "frequent" where

"infrequent'' should have been used, and a reference to the "Flith

Amendment'' instead of the "First Amendment. " Seventeen pages of

handwritten corrections were presented to Miss Banoff. She indi-

cated it was the practice of the SSC to insert these handwritten

corrections behind the testimony as an appendix to the transcript. .

Ryan objected to this suggestion and insisted the document itself be

corrected to accurately indicate the true testimony. Ryan requested

this action be taken before the transcript was furnished, as Banoff

previously indicated would be done, to members of the Committee

(Senators).

It is noted that on November 18, 1975, the SSC held a

publicly televised hearing at which time the SSC members and the

public were furnished a briefing on numerous alleged FBI abuses,

including those in the area of the Cointelpros. On November 19,

1975, Assistant to the Director-Deputy Associate Director James B.

Adams testified in a publicly televised hearing beiore the SSC regard-

ing alleged FBI abuses, including those relating to the Cointelpros.

The SSC has indicated there will be no additional public hearings

regarding FBI Cointelpros.

Barbara Banoff of the SSC staff, on several occasions

during the above deposition, indicated the deposition would be referred

to the SSC members (Senators) for their review prior to public testi-

mony relating to the Cointelpros so they would have a full understanding

of the programs. She indicated this was one reason why it was desired

that Ryan affirm under oath to his testimony.

On November 13, 1975, Ryan advised Banoff he was con-

cerned that he had not received the letter promised by her indicating

SSC members had been alerted as promised above. Banoff indicated

she had not got around to taking care of this action. On December 1,

1975, Banoff and SSC member Michael Epstein were again reminded

of Banoff's promise to furnish Ryan the letter described above.

Banoff again indicated she had not found time to take this action. At

this time she also indicated (1) that she had caused Ryan's correc-

tions to be inserted into the text of the transcript of his testimony

but that her action in this instance had been unique as this was not

done in the instance of other depositions, and (2) that Ryan's testi-

mony (deposition) had not been furnished to the members of the SSC

(Senators) and that it was contemplated that certain portions of the

testimony would be furnished to the Senators in the future in "digest"

form. Banoff indicated if Ryan desired and if a Senator could be

located to administer the oath, he could affirm to his deposition at

any time he desired.

On January 8, 1976, Vir. Mark Gitenstein of the SSC staff

was advised that viiss Banoft had failed to alert Ryan by letter as

promised and he was requested to so alert appropriate SSC staff

members.

As of this writing, Banolf has not forwarded to Fyan the

promised letter, the terms of which resulted in continuation of Ryan's

deposition, and Ryan has not affirmed his deposition.

By letter dated 1/19/76, Patrick V. Murphy,_ President,

Police Foundation, Washington, D. C., informed the Director that he

had accepted an invitation to participate in a panel of police officials

at an Executive Session of a subcommittee of the Senate Select Committee

on Intelligence Activities on Tuesday, 1/20/76. According to correspondence

to Vir. Murphy extending the invitation from Senator Walter F. Mondale,

Chairman of the subcommittee, the topic for discussion at the Executive

Session would be the FBI's dissemination of the product of its domestic

intelligence investigations to local authorities and whether such dissemination

has been of value.

In his communication Mr. Murphy indicated that it would be

helpful it someone on Mr. Kelley's staff would contact him in order to

brief him concerning the issues involved in his testimony.

In response to Mr. Murphy's request I telephoned Mr. Murphy

at his home at 5 p.m. on Monday, 1/19/76. With the assistance of Special

Agent Albert F. Watters, JI., of the Intelligence Division, who is familiar

with the issues of concern to the Senate Select Committee, I outlined for

Mr. Murphy what options the Committee was considering adopting to govern

FBI domestic intelligence collection in the future. Specifically these options

are: (1) to charter the FBI substantially in the same manner as it is currently

chartered by Presidential Directives and other authorities to conduct

investigations into subversive activities and related matters; (2) to take both

domestic intelligence collection and foreign counterintelligence out of the FBI

and create a separate agency to perform these functions; (3) to eliminate the

domestic intelligence collection effcrt by the FBI and confine the Bureau to

gathering evidence of Federal violations; and (4) to enact a statutory charter

for the collection of domestic intelligence concerning a narrow range of

matters involving potential force and violence, under strict guidelines such

as those now being proposed by the Attorney General's Guidelines Committee

within the Department of justice.

Memorandum to Mr. J. B. Adams

RE: PATRICK V. MURPHY

I pointed out to Mr. Murphy that the subcommittee, in

assessing the probable effect of eliminating FBI domestic intelligence

investigations, would be most interested in his views as to whether

this activity by the Bureau has been of value to local government

officials in anticipating violence and dealing with civil disorder.

Mr. Murphy indicated that the Senate Select Committee's

invitation, dated 1/15/76, left him little time to prepare for his

testimony and that his remarks would, therefore, have to be of a

I general nature. However, he asked that 1 convey his appreciation to

the Director for affording him an opportunity to become better

acquainted with the broader questions of concern to the Senate Select

Committee.

ACTION:

None. For information of the Director and for record

purposes.

He almost immediatoly joined the UcLA chapter of the

B.D.B. Du Bois Club that was

then active on campus.

sometime in 1266, he attended the W.E.B. Du Bois Club

national convention in Chicago as a West Coast representative.

However, by late 1966 or early 1967, the W.B.B. Du Bois Club

had grown unpopular because the members at UClA got tired oi

it and it foläed.

CRoWe states that in Aprils. 1907, he and seven

others formed a Student Club of the Communist Party, USA,

the campus of UCLA. They met to discuss political

matters, he paid dues, but not to any national headquarters,

only in his group.

He remained in this CP club until he was

graduated in March, 1953.

He is still in the clubs but

each of the othes seven members graduated with him, ana they

are considering forming an ex-student CP club.

CRONE, stated

joining the CP club was a natural extension of his membership

in the W.E.B. Du Bois Club.

CROWE states he considered

liberal and left of

center, he had deiinite phases oi his

thinking where he was right of center, particularly on the

subject of the state of Israel. Hhen

askea wnat he meant

by liberal, CROWE stated,

"politically liberal."

Pressed

for more definite information, CROWE states he does not

KnOw SIRHAN's economic philosophy. Politically, SIRHAN

favored movements that according to CROWE are considered by

the general populace to be leit of center. CholE states

SIRHAN was opposed to the Vietnam war.

While at PCC In 1965, CROVE reCalls that SIRHAN

claimed he wanted to live in society in the United States

and get along with people and make money.

SIRHAN was not

Interested in the SDS Club that CROWE wanted to form. Although

aware si CROWD's activities, SIRHAN did not support him. CROWE

cannot recall specifically discussing the formation of the

SDS group with SIRHAN although STHAN must have nown. SIRMAN

period of time, like membership in a ciub like the W.I.B.

Du Bois Club thai CROWL was in. - Since this background was

Zacling In SIRHAN, CROWE could noi recruit him and did

not try.

CROWE states that of the hour between & p.m.,

and 9 p.m., when they talked, the discussion of CP

activity, including the W.E.B. Du Bois Club took about

twenty minutes. At about 9 p.m., two other former students

whom CROWE recognized but whose

nares he absolutely does

not know and never knews came into Bob's Restaurant, he

stated. Bob's is the restaurant adjacent to Pasadena City

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

During your appearance before the Select Committee

on December 11, 1975, there was considerable discussion

concerning proposals

use of paid and controlled informants to infiltrate

political groups in domestic intelligence investigations.

You expressed concern that a warrant requirement in such

cases would be impractical and would unduly burden the

courts.

Second, you indicated the Justice Department would

be developing guidelines for the use of informants.

Presumably, their provisions might so limit the manner ano

predicate for use of intormants as to make a warrant

requirement unnecessary.

To explore this matter in greater detail before the

Committee drafts its recommendations, we seek your comment

on the enclosed set of questions which are designed to

focus on some of the practical aspects of a warrant

requirement.

In addition, please feel free to comment on

other aspects of a warrant requirement for informants and

to state the case against warrants, including what provi-

sions might be included in the prospective guidelines which

would tend to make a warrant requirement less useful.

ATTACHMENT

1.

If the effect of new guidelines on the opening of

domestic intelligence investigations is to sub-

stantially reduce the number of such investigations,

would there not be a corresponding reduction in the

number of intelligence informants? If so, would this

not greatly reduce the number of warrant applications

that would have to be submitted to the courts or to

an administrative review body? Would this affect

your view that such a requirement is overly burdensome?

2.

According to figures submitted to the Select Committee

Dy the fbl, as of June 30, 1915, there were 1,040

domestic intelligence informants. How would you assess

the impact on the work load of the judicial system if

a warrant application were applied to an informant

program of this approximate sizé?

3.

Would not the alleged impracticality of an informant

warrant requirement be greatly reduced if judicial

approval was required, not for each individual informant,

but for the use of a particular number of informants

against a group that is the subject of a domestic

intelligence investigation?

What are the reasons why

this could not be done?

4.

In United States v. United States District Court, 407

U.S. 297 (1972), the Supreme Court stated that .

differ-

ent standards for a warrant application may be appro-

priate as between criminal surveillances and those

involving domestic security.

407 U.S. 322-323. What

standard would you suggest for a warrant requirement

for intelligence informants?

5.

What is your view with respect to the proposal that,

rather than a judicial warrant requirement, the Attorney

General or his designee approve the use of informant:

in domestic intelligence investigations?

Dear Mir. Attorney General:

Your statement to the Conmittee on December 11, 1975 indicated

that on February 25, 1975 you instructed FBI Director Kelley to report

to you "any requests made of the Burezu or practices within

the Bureau,

which he deems improper or which present the appearance of impropriety."

You stated further that on February 28, 1975 Director Kelley oriered

FBI personnel to report such requests or practices to him. According

to your written statement, you reaffirmed your February directive in

July 1975 and made an additional request "for a report of all sensitive

investigativa practices."

You indicated that the Director promptly complied with your

directives and "has regularly provided information on conduct by Bureau

agents and programs underway within the Bureau that could raise questions."

In your response to

questions from members of the Cormittee you

testified thai the information reported by Director Kelley in response

to your directives dealt with IBI activities and programs outside the

COINTELPRO.

The Committee requests that you provide it with all documents:

including but not limited to Director Kelley's memoranda and the attach-

ments thereto, which you have received from the FBI in response to your

directives of February 26 and of July 1975. The Cormittee will, of

course, treat these documents in the same manner in which other

sensitive

material has been handled.

OFFICE OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS

I look forward to your response to this request.
