on No. Name Key to take photographs of Army maneuvers

for

propaganda purposes, and to raise funds. They claimed to

have the permission

at No Name Key on Friday, August 16, 1963, for the purpose

of making a motion picture of training maneuvers for

propaganda, publicity and fund-raising purposes.

He

estimated the group would remain on No Name Key for about

one week. He was unable to furnish the name of the

individual, group or organization who was going to film

the picture.

CASTILLO denied that the 27 Cubans represented

any particular anti-CASTRO group, stating it was composed of

many individuals who had received training in the United

States Army at Fort Jackson, others who desired to receive

some training and volunteered to appear in the film. He

stated the majority of the group were followers of MANUEL

ARTIME, but that he had not sponsored the idea or financed

it in any manner. CASTILLO stated he had originated the

idea, and was responsible for bringing the group to

No Name Key•
