REPORT ON INTERROGATION

DATE:

26 July 1965

from

1600 to 1730.

The intorrogation took place fron 1230 to 1500 and

I commenced according to thr previously

prepared plan.

Subject asked no questions about my identity,

raised no objections of any kind, and said he was willing tọ

answer

any questions.

Although I frequently challenged the

truthtulness and corroctness of Subjeet's answers, the overall

tone of the interrogation was calm, and Subject's attitude was

correct and cooperative.

Soft drinks were served, and at his

request, Subject was allowed to smoke during the

second part

of the interrogation.

Subject said at the beginning that he

had told only the

truth in the past, that he had not been sept

by anyone, and that he was willing to tell only the truth to

me.

Questioning was concentrated on the 1953-54 period.

The following are

the must interesting and significant points

that emerged:

In talking about his return to Moscow on leave

fron "Sovetsk, Primorskly Kray, in

the Baltie flat the end

of December 1952, Subject was unable to correctly explain the

proper registration procedure for a military officer on leave.

He affirmed that he did not have to report to anyone upon.

arrival in Moscow.

COMMENT: If Subject was truly a naval intelligence officer,

according to regulations he would have been required to

report to the Personnel Department of the GRU/VMF and also

to the Naval Commendant of the City of Moscow within three

days of his arrival.

Subject diu not dispute ny statement

that these were the regulations, and finally said vaguely

that he reported to Naval GRU Personnel "seven or ten days"

alter arrival.

b) Under close questioning, Subject's story about his

necting with KABULOV took on some new aspects.

lle now says

that relations betweon his father and KABULOY were those of

colleagues only, that the two families had never gotten to-

gether before, and that he (Subject) himself had never spoken

tO KABULOV before this occasion.

Furthermore, Subject now

says that the mecting took place at KABULOV's dacha (rather

---

## Page 3

that at the NOSENo dacha), that the date of this fol-torether

was cither l or 2 January

1053, and that Vasilly VAKHRUSHEY

•(who was then marriod

to KABULOV's daughter) was also prosent.

In a tspical plece of improvisation, Subject evon unlu that

it was VAKHRUSHEV, rather than kABULOV, who first raised the

question of what Subject was doing.

COMMENT: In view uf Subjoct's different previous storieg

about this incident,

his readiness to chango hig atoxy

and to improviso under my questioning makes it impossible

to believe thathe ms actually recommended by KABULOV to

the KGB.

c)

In talking about his first visit to the KGB, Subject

was unable to give a consistent and accurate account of tho

procedures at

the KGB pass officr.

Succifically, he madntained

that the name of the interviower was not indicated on the pass.

COMMENT:

The name of the intorviewer is always indicatod

on the visitor's pass.

It ts difficult to understand

why

Subject would not know this if he had ever sorved

in

the KGB, much less in 1953-54:

Subject maintained that on this first visit hu talked:

to some personnel officers (he could not remober nny namos) who

were lucated in an office on the sixth floor of

of Building #12.

He said that he left his coat at. the garderobe

on the bround floor of this entry.

same section of offices as ROLlENKO, whom he talkod

to here on a later visit.

the 8th ontry

He said that these officory

CONENT:

Subject insisted that he was positive about

the fact that ROZHENKO's office was in the 8th entry

even though I told him

this was inpossible.

to the time

of my departure from Moscow (Sept 1953)

neither ROZHENKO nor any units or officers of KGB Personnel

were located in the 8th entry.

As far as the garderobe

is concerned, although Subject correctly nentioned that

there was also one on

the second flour by the dietetic

restaurant. there was

no garderobe on the ground floor in

those years.

(From 1917 to the time I loft, KGb personnel

were located on the oth and ith flours of the tti entry,

Building #12.)

Subjuct said that on

(*13 or 15 March 1953') le

went from the pass office

went unescorted to KABULOV' offico on the ird floor.

COMMENT: - It is not posalblo to so through any entry

of Building #2 with a vinitor's pas: without escort.

(Espocially to tho offico of the deputy minister!)

In senoral, Subjoet rive a correct description of

what was located in entries

Ilowover, he

ild not mention the oxistence of an ostra entrunto to tho left

of tho KGB Clụu..

Moro important, he said that he did not

know whother or not there was a oth entry, but that ho belleved

thoro was not.

The Oth

entry was located around the cornor

on Malaya Lubyanka, and

was used by a few sectiong of

tho Oth. Directorate.

Although Subject may never have

had occasion to enter it, lo

shoul certainly be nware

of its existence, espocially sinco lie montioned going

to the Moscow UKGB, which was lochted noxt to entry 9.

g). In describing the papory that he lndato fill out

to apply for entry into

the KGB, Subtoct mentloned only a

quostionnaire/ankota/ and an autoblography.

leasaid that he

received the forms

on his first visit to tho KGB, took them

honc and filled them out, and thon delivered them to tho

pergonnol officer

on the following day.

He said that ho was

obliged to turn both the questionmire and the nutobiography

in in two copies.

He maintained that the questionnaire did

not have any name, other than simply "anketa." He said that

it was four or six pages long.

Subjeet way challenrod on all

these points, but ingisted that he was correct.

The questionnaire is called "Anketa Spetsialnoge

Naznachenlya Sotrudnika KGB: "

This is prominently printed

at the top

of the first page.

It is not less than 12

pages long - probably 16.

This is not correct.

Also, Subject

n) Subjoet insintod. that he was not regured to take

When challened on this and asked to explain 1t,

Subject said that it was probably because they knew that ho

CONMENT:

A medical exan was mandatory for all now employses

of tho KGB, whether or not they were officurs on activo

1)

Asked about his salary when he first startod to work

for the KGB, Subjoet sald that ho got a baste salary

• rublos as a

case officor, 500 rubles for his rank of lieutenant,

plus socrecy, languago, and length of service pay.

that this

was corroct undor close questioning.

I thon told

Subject that NGB officers were in longer bring paid for rank

in March 1953.

Subjuct First said that he wasn't at all

interested in monoy in that period and really couldn't remember.

Then ho said that ho renembered that there was one year when

they wore not paid for rank - which herbell&ved was 1951,

and

that

he still thinks that lie was pald for rank when ho first

entored the KGB.

Salary for rank was taken away from MGB officors

in mid-1952.

It had not been restored as of february 1954,

although I bellove it is likely that it was restored at

sono time thoroafter.

ASked Who were IGNATYEV's deputies, Subjuct mentioned

SANCHENKO (among othors) veer

Asked what was SAVCHENKO'y background,

Subject said that he had

in the Ukraine, then had beon

head of the Intelligenco Directorate of the NGB: after BERIYA

he was deputy chairman

of the KGB for a short while, after which

ho went to Moldavia as Chief of the Moldavian KGB.

Subject thus

repeated a mistake he lad made previously.

He firmly stated

When told that

thore are tro

Goneral SAVCHENKOs and that he

had then mixed

up, subject replied. that he didn't know

SANCHENKO's first

he didn't sue what difference it made anyway.

COMMENT:

As explained carlier,

Subject has confused Lt.

uneral Sergey Romanovich SAVCHENKO and It. General Ivan

Tikhonorich SAlCHENKO.

Both of them occupied prominont

positions in the MGR

The Gastronom was definitely not thore as of

that Subjeet's slip on the Gastronom

Tentative Conclusions:

The above items mll indicate

that

Subject

did not work

In the XGB 1n 1953 or 1901.

Some

of them case doubt on whether he ever worked in the KGB at all,

älthough it is very difficult to conc to a firm conclusion on

this as yot because he dons havo an impressive knowledge of

KGB personalities, and knows quite a bit about KGB proceduros

and installations

as well.

Tho rost of the interrogation

will

attempt to establish, if posible, whether Subicet's knowledge

explained entirely by rigorous

briefing,

with

the KGB.

cedures is' consistent with that of any ordinary, apathetie

could easily have this same

even if he had never been a Komsomol mumber).

served in this capacity anywhore.

6. Other questiong:-

a) In discussing his Konsomol merbership in the Baltic,

Subject again referred to this area as the Primorskiy Kray.

Challenged on this, Subject appeared to be astounded, and:

insisted vebemently that he served in

the city of Sovctsk,

Primorskly Kray, and that he even received letters addressed

that way (Subject was not told that he was also wrong on

the city).

Told that. Primorskiy Kraj is in the Far East,

Subject compounded his geographical blunder by saying that

he knew all about that because Sovetskiya Gavan',

had served before coming to the Baltic, is in that Primorskly

Kray ( it is actually in Khabarovskiy Kray).

b) "When Subject first mentioned the German Department,

he was asked to think carefully about whether or not there

categorically that there was, but when challenged ho retreated

to my challenge on this point

of context with the mutter under discussion- that he didn't

spot that the Detskly Mir store now occupies bofore it was

constructed in 1957, even though he used to go by it every

Subject gave a rather complex splanation about

the changes of terminology for the surveillance apparat and

for the elements responsible for supporting the diplomatic

colony. Comments on this will bo reserved until there has

been an opportunity to compare it wit! what Subject himself

has said on this in the past and with collateral information.

At the beginning of the session, when Subject re-

marked

that this was his 48lst day in tie

safchouse. I asked

him how he managed to keep track of the days so well. He

replied, "prison experience was acquired" /tyurennyy opyt

The phrase is difficult to translato

exactly, but it is the past tense that is significant. I

asked him if he had ever been in jail beforc, but he said

he had not.

to be filled out when

questions and service in. the Baltic sore not touched at ull.

Fullowing highlights:

a) ANKETA (DPIIQ): Subject displayed a superficial

knowledgo of this basic questionnaire.

the appearance, the nature of the gestions, and the purpose

He continued to maiatain,

It was socunent in two copies, thai be tilind is nut at homo.

Incorrectly, that

He amunded his story to say

that he does not remember for sure wether

ho turned it in

to ROZHENkO's people on

one of his first visits, or gave it

to SAKHAROV when

he first reported for work.

COMMENT:

An ordinary

member of the KGB might conceivably

have forgotten the dotails of shis document which was

filled out only at the begtanias of his carcer.

As a

supervisor, however, Subject clains to have reviewed

many personnel files (as he shruld have): as

such, ho

could not possibly make the mistakes that he

has about

this docunent, or be unable do give a better description

ofit.

b)

Secrecy Agreement:

Subject hinself stated that

he had signed such a form for Salast when he first reported

for work.

He was unable

to rementer the proper designation

or contents of the document, however.

The description.of

the wording which he provided was

sinilar to that used prior

to 1947; also, it is similar to tre secrecy agrecment that

might be signed by an agent.

c) Lichniy Listok po Uchet fairov: Thig is not a

very important document,

but irisTie out by evory

officer, and is found in every personol file.

Subject was

not only unable to recall it. he

maintained he had never

heard of it even afterit was descrits to him.

the questions on his former wifo.

and on his mother's ancestry.

I then asked

Subject how it. was, taking into recount his mother's pristocratic

ancestry,

the fact

that he father died in jail, the Trotskyice

allegationg against Subject's father, the fact that subieek's

furmer

father-in-law was still in Jail, and the fact that Subject

was

present when TELEGIN's apartment was scarched

-- that he

had been accepted into the KGB, particularly in 1953!

Subject

admitted that the question was logical, and sald that he could

only assume that the influence of KOBUlOV and the important

and influential position of hiy own father outweighed these

nebative factory.

le also ested his GRU experience in this

connection.

I then askod Subject how he had reported his second

this in a routino check. howovor.)

I then reviewed for Subject

the negative security factors

mentioned above, audink the

arrest of HOLUlOY, the fact that his new

wife and her parcnts

had been abroad,

the tact that her crandmother was in german-

occupied territory, the fact that Subjeet was now ovrage for

the Komsomol but not set a party membor or candidate. and tho

fact that

Subject receired a 15 day sentence for misuse of

cover documents and incurring venoreal discase. and asked

1f he didn't think that

his personnel file had been revlowed

in 195%, and 1f so, what grounds there could have been for

retaining lim

in the KGB.

Subject sald that he thought thiat

his file probably was reviewed but that again the influence

of his father had saved him.

Subject added that another

important Inctor was probably his languago qualification and

particularly his higher education.

I told Subject that we

would examine the question uf

119

curation in creater dotall

lator.

Ile made

no comment.

I also pointed out to Subject

that if his second wife and her parents had been abroad it

was impossible that her name check could have been negative.

He admitted it was illogical, but instatod that this

was 30.

4.

CONCIUSIONS:

Evidence continues to pile up to

show

that Subject was never in & supervisory position

in the KGB.

that he could nut hare and did not enter the KGB in 1953.

His wenk knowledge of the documents discussod indicates that

if he was ever in the kGB at all, it was later. and for a

rolatively short time.

5.

Despite the fact that I continued to challenge Subject

frequently,

the tone

of the interrogation was pareicularly

about it, Subjoct said that such congresses took place

This in false; the previouy Kongunol

Congress, the 1lth, was in 1049.

b) Subject again stated that he was sure that the

maximum age for Komsomol monberg at that time

was 27.

Subject

was shown the portent konsonal sratitions for the period.

which prouide that the maximum

SubJuct simply

continued to insist that he is sure that he wis excluded

that no exceptiona wore made for hin.

how he could be wrong on the regulations if lie had boon a

c) In the discugsion of Komsonnl regulations, subjoct

continued to insist that tho

He spotted the varagraph about 2: entry dues in

that were shown tu him and said that monthly duey wero

identical with entry dues.

This is not so, but as wo do not

MEMORANDU! FOR THE RECORD

• SURJECT: REPORT OF INTERROGATION

DATE: 3 AUGUST 1965

1.

Mogt of tuday's session (0945-1130 and 1230-1330)

was devuted to questioning on to structure and organization

of tho MVD in 1953 and 1954.

It was originally planned to

touch on this subject ouly littly and then to move on to

another topic,

but subject's knowledge was so limited that

It seemed worthwhile to cover it in consad rable depth.

Asked to describe what directorates existed in the

MVD under BERIYA, Subject named the ECD and the SCD, whicb

he said were the intelligence and counterintelligence

directorates respectively.

place later was that

for a short tine, under KRUGLOV, the

FCD became the SCD and vice verya. I cold him that he was

wrong and asked again if he wore sure.

He replied that he

was certain that this was donc by KRUGLOV and that it was

for a short time only.

Actually, of courge, this change

instituted by BERIYA and existed until at least February

195•1.

Thus, Subject does not even know in what diroctorate

he worked during the first year of his alleged servico in

the KGB.

Previously,

because Subject had indicatud in a

homework assignment that he was aware that the directorates

had heen

numbered differently, we had assumed that he knew

when and how this happened.

This was a false assumption

and

we now have conclusive proof (if mure was needed) that

Subject did not serve in the AVD in 1953-34.

Subject displayed a similarly hazy and insufficient

knowledge on all other organizational questions of that

period. He could not describe the functions of the 4th

Directorate accurately.

He did not lines the functions of

the 4th and Sth Special Dipts.

He claiced that there was

a 10th Directorate, which was the Directorate of the Kremlin

Coarandant (this had actually merred with the Orhrana in

1917, and was called

the 9th Directorate since 1952). he had

never heard of Spetsbure

71. he had never heard of the

Directorate for the Preservation of Govt. Treasures, he

knew nothing about the Jails Directorate, he had no notion

of the subordination of the Internal Troops, Convoy troops,

GULAG, GUSHASDOR, the Mililia, etc. etc.

Subject did not cren

know when the

KGB was organized.

He said that it was in late 1954 or carly 1955.

Tuld that

was wrong by a year and asked to think

11 over.

stubbornly insisted that he was right.

5. Asked to the name the chiels of ll:

directorates

and scharate departments of the HVD under BERIYA and

KRUGLOV. Subject was able to name only nine

out of 28.

was unable to name the leadership of the Intelligonce

Directorate,

saying that he remembered only SAKHAROVSKIY (PANYUSHKIN wag

chief until 1955).

Subject was able to name unly SEROV and

ROMASHNOY A KKUGLOV'S deputies.

He was ignorant of such

prominent names as LUNEY and SILATALIN.

Asked where the Main Directorato of Militia of

the USSR was

located in 1953 and 195l, Subjuct said that

he did not know, and knew only that later it was on Ul.

Obareva.

Actually, in 1953-54 it was located next to the

main KGB building on Dzerzhinskiy $2.

Asked to describe how he conducted name checks

Soviet citizen and on a new arrival to the American

Embassy in 1953-54, Subject managed to bivo a superficial

description of how such checks were donc.

However, ho

resisted every attempt to get hin to describe this process

in detail, and he made several blunders which

show that ho

never actually ran such a check himself.

For cxample, he

did not know where the records of all Soviet citizens who

have been tried are kept. and attempted to improvise an

answer (completoly wrong) that they

would echeck with the.

militia about this.

Subject correctly said that Archives

were located in Bldg 2, Bldg 12, and on Kirov Street.

• he was completely unable to stretch his limited knowlodgo

to provide a description of how these various repositories

were netually chocked.

Subjeet was also asked to describe

how he ran such a check on a Soviet citizen in the 1956-59

Here again he was in difficulty ay soon as pressed

for details on how the check was run.

It was particularly

interestiny that he did not leel able to dispute my challenges

of his information in this period, even though he wareusterlypr...bl,

knews that 1 do not have first hand knowledge of procedures

in this period.

Subject was asked to describe the KGB identity

document that he received when he first entered the KGB.

He was asked if there was anything unusual in connection

with this document at that time.

He repliod. that he knot

of nothing unusual.

He was then told that both under SERIYA

Subicot was totally ignorant of this, and way unablo to recall

anything about it despito a number of hints and loading

Actually, this business of the spocial amps was

the subject of numorous ancedotes at the timo, and no officor

who served intho MVD in 1953 could puysibly lave furgotton

it complotely.

Subject wag asked again about tho personal KGB

that he had montloned

1u a pefulous sorgion.

replied that he did not remember exictly when this

instituted, but that he

sure It washot lefore 1958.

and that he rocolood his number while he was in

the Sovonth

Department.

He said that the number: were issued on a

metal, aluminum dogtar about 2 by 1 or 5 cms. thnt it wag

inscribud at the top:

"VS SSR" (Armed Forces of the USSR),

and below that was the serial number,

which in hity caso

was E 00 and four digits which he could nut remomber cxictly

but thought were 1033 or 1022.

A hole is punchod in

dostag, which properly spoaking ly called a "lichnyy znak."

The serial number is also entered in the KGB idculity document.

Subject that the purpose of these numher tary was not

explained when they were issued, that they wero

bo carried with ono's personal documents, but that he kopt

it in his safe, ag did most others.

10.

It was intoresting that at the very beginning of

the

session, Subjoct declared that he had thought it over

and

wag sure that although he had been wrong about Primorskly

Kray, there had to bo a littlo Sovetsk in Kilingrad Oblast

that was called Sovotske rimurskiy

to distinguish it from

the other Sovietsk. Subject was told that this la nonsense,

chich it 1s.

Subject has probably decided that ho cannot

afford

to admit to any substantive errors which cannot be

explained by just poor memory.

Subject was told that there was and is a RR connection

to Baltlysk.

Subject immediately said that

there was a narrow gauge line that ran from Kalingrad to the

various resorts but insisted that under no circumstances

although ho uid not know this from his own

AUT

NENORINDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: REPORT OF INTERROGATION

DATE: 1 August 1985

1.

Today's scssion (0945-1145) was devotod almost

untiroly to Subjoct's education from the ith to the l0th

orndus, the period in which he nilegodly attended Naval

Schools in Kuybyshev, Baku, and Leningrad.

Subjoct was

challenged stornly and repeatedly, and ho grow visibly

upsot.

For tho firat timo in this

of inturrogationg

he started to sulk and the session was ended when ho

virtually

stopped answering questions.

2.

Subjert said that

when

unly

ho attended this schoof in Kuybyshov it consisted uf

the 7th and gth classes.

It 1y quito possible that

if tho school was first croated in 1910 It had only two

classes in 1941. However,

Subject insistod tliat tho Special

Naval Schools were intended. to ru unly throuth tho Oth krade.

This is quito incorrect; both ARTANONOV and GONDEYEV state.

positivoly that these schools save the final three yours of

a full socondary education:

the 8th, 9th and loth grades.

:In talking about the school, Subject save no moro information

than proviously:

he can remember the ramos of fivo or six

schoolmates, one or two instructors, ho doesn't remombor

oxactly how

or when he went to Kuybyshev or back, ho doesn't

remembor where in Kuybyshev the school was located.

of the paucity of his recollections it in difficult to

como to a conclusion about whether or not he was really

there:

judged by

itself, it soens impossible that ho was

there and is unable to recall more; compared to his story

about Baku it luoke good.

One possibility, perhaps is that

he enrolled in this

school in Muscow, but dropped out at

somo point in the first year.

Baku Naval Preparatory School:

Subject repeated

his previous story that in the

summer ot. 1942 he returned

tọ Moscow and through the Moscow Naval Equipage ho was

processed to join the. Leningrad Naval Preparatory School

which at that time had been evacuated to Baku and combined

with the Baku Naval Preparatory Schoul.

---

## Page 25

104-10227-10008

arrived in Balu in the end of 19.12 and Joined the Baku

Preparatory School which had a three year school consisting

of the sth, 9th, and 10th grides.

Subjoct was told that

this was nonsonso and that no Naval preparatory. schools

offering n threo year courge ever existed in the Soviot.

Ho insisted that he was riglit, and gald that not

unly did such schools exist in Leningrad and Baku, but alho

in Sevastopol and Vladivostok.. For the first time, Subject

struck a very confident and even agrressive attitudo, saying

such things ay, "I know, I way there,"

and "you are ovidently

not sufficiontly well informed about these schools," otc.

(Actually, ARTAMONOV's tostimony about tho location and

organization of tho Special Naval Schools, the daval Pre-

paratory Schools, and the Preparatory Courses of tho Naval

ncademies - which is both logical and consigtent - completely.

contradicts and rules out Subject's story.)

Subjoct was asked to describe his route from Moscow

to Baku in tho sumner of 1912,

He replied that tie didn't

remember.. He was then reminded that originally he had

siad that ho went diroctly, and that when told that the RR

lines were cut,

l had mado up a story about a ta?-week

long train ride.

Subjoct looked uncomfortable and mado

no reply. I thon told

SubJect that there was only one

possible way to get frou Moscow to Baku at that time and

that the cities through which it passed were so unusual

that no one who had made the trip could forget it. Subject

said he did not remembor.

(Tho only way was by say of

Tastikent:)

Askod to name the leadorship of the Chief Directorato

of Naval Schools and Academies at that time, Subject said

that Vice Admiral RAMIASIVILI was the chief, and that his

deputy was Major General TATARINOV.

The chiep of the Diroctorate

of Educational Institutions was Vice Admiral SUKHIASHVILI.

According to ARTAMONOV, SUKHIASIVILI was the chief of the

first prototype Nakhimov school which way organieed in Tbilist

in 1913.

The fact that Subjeet knows SUKHIASHVILI 6 namE

(which he mentioned for the first time), the character uf

the Nakhimov Schools

(a full secondary education for sons

of the Soviet elite), and

the fact that Subject's story for

this period includes a trip to t'bilisi with lis father all

point to the possibility that Subjoct was actually in the

Nakhimov School in Tbilisi at this time.

Subject sill be

questioned further on this at the next session.

Subjuct again

ingiated that he tout the military

oath in Baku when he was lo years old, as did all the othor

gtudentg in thu school.

subicot was told that this wag

inpusutbo, but continuod tu maintain that he way telling

"how. it wag."

Subjoct.repcated hiy old atory about completing

"oxternat" (somewhat similar

to correspondonce courses) at tho Mintig Institute in Moscow.

Subject gave a complotoly wronk duscription of what such a

course of study consists. of, and it is not possible that

ho actually did what ho said.

For example, he stated that

he studied at thu Institute four days a wook, Ior approximalely

7 hours a day; actually, in

"externat" studunt would do all

of his studying at homo.

Here, ns elsewhere. throughout

the session, I told Subject thathe was making things up

and

that 1f ho obtained his 9th grade certificate by blat

1t would bo nuch botter for him simply to say so, but he

did not avail hinself of the opportunity.

Sutject was asked what subjoets ho studied in the

10th grade (in Leningrad).

do replted that ho did not

renember, and gave a similar reply to questions about what

he had studiod

in the 9th and 8th brades. Tho sossion was

Subject was visibly upsot by this time

and his answars aro, probably moro indicativo of his mood

than of total inability to recall what subjects are taught

in Soviet secondary schools.

In the middle of the sossion, as a chango of paco

I asked Subject to toll mo the lorations of all the rosidences

of KGB officerg that he could rocall.

Subject wag ablo to

recall about 12 different buildings inhabited by KGB officers,

and although ho did not give the exact addresses his locations

and

descriptiong were goncrally correct.

What was interosting

was that

SUBJECT:

Roport of Intorrogation of 6 August 1965

1.

Today's sousion was from 1000 to 1200 and from

1305 to 1110.!

As planned, I started the sossion by sum-

martzing for Subjoct the results of tho first six sUyy1on8,

listing for him approximatoly twenty pointe on which he had

failed. badly, (Summary list attached.) At first Subject

attemptud to contcut the points as I cited them, for oxam-

plo, on tho

variations in the KOBULOV story, and on the

locution of ROZHENKO's office, but. when I gavo him the

facts ho did not challenge them and he listened to most of

the litny in silencc.

I told Subject that the results

of

those sossiony had confirmed further the previous findings.

I asked him why ho continued to cling to his legend, und

reminded him that he had turned down the opportunity

offerod to liim last spring to chango his minu while we

still could take

stons to preserve his operational userul-

noss.

I snid

that this opportunity was now past, but that

I did not want to concoal

from him the fact that he still

had knowlodge and information which could be usoful to us.

Howover,

thoro was a tino limit. oven. to thig.

I rominded

him that ho had boon out of circulation for a long timo

and that many things had happoned in the world and especially

in tho Soviot Union during this time; for examplo, KHRU-

SHICHEV was no longor in

power (Subject's comment,

A8 OX-

pocted, was "Thank God!").

Other changes had taken place.

If Subject did not mako up

his mind to toll the truth, his

490 days could ensily turn into 4000, and he would not bu

of interest to anyone. I told Subject again, that he had

nothing to fear, no matter what he had done in the past,

that wo

would not prosecute him for any past crimes, no

matter how bad.

If ho wero

worried about reprisal from

Soviot security organs, I told him that we were just as

capablo of keeping his

confession secret as we were of keep-

ing secrot the fact that we knew he was a provocateur for

a year and a half before his defection.

I promised him

that he would hu given

normal living conditions ny soon

as he started

to cooperate hy tolling the rend truth.

CA

complete transcript of this part of the session ly being

done for the record.)

2.

As expected, subject's unly response to all this.

was that he had told the truth--with allowances for mis-

takes on minor points of detail owing to forgetfulnes--

and that he would continue to tell nothing but:

llo said

that dospite his griovances over his treatment he con-

tinued to be willing to serve American Intolligence in any

way ho could, short of returning to the USSK, of course.

Ho complained that I denied and contradicted everything

ho said, great and small,

and said that he could see by

many romarks that I had

made that I thought that ho had

never served in the KGB ns a stall officer but had perhaps

been

an agent for the KGB.

This,

he. said, was completely

excluded, and 1 should know that it is not possible for

tho KGB

to recruit the son of a minister as an agont. I

replied simply that I know of several cases

where not only

childron of ministers but even more important people had

sorved in this capacity.

3. Another interesting remark that Subject made was

that he fully approciated the fact that his knowlodgo was

field.

knowledge on this next week.

Subject complained that we had not checked his

story sufficiently and pointed out that thousands of boys

had studied in the same schools as

he had and that we

should be ablo to get confirmation sonewhere.

Here he made

an interesting remark as follows:

"Incidentally, when I

first came hore I understood from sonething that Mr. Peter

Bagley said that you have operational contact with a Spar-

tak KAZAKOV, lie was also in the Baku Naval Preparatory

School with ne."

Subject was questioned in sone detail

about his

duties

public holidays.

ject's

description was generally accurate, and even quite

good ns long as he kept his answers general.

When forced

to be more specific he made a number of mistakes about the

procedures involved, such as insisting that instructiong

for the holiday were issued by the chief of the department

without the participation of a oth Diroctorate officer,

about the preparation of the duty and mest lists for

passes, which lead me to conclude that; hu did not stand

duty there as a KGB officor.

He was unable to remember a

single delcration that he had been assigned to watch, al-

though he maintained that he had pulled such duty every

year Since 1957.

However, on the basis of his othersise

very good familiarity with Red: Square and the procedures

of parades there, I would conclude that he has attended

more than one such event as a guest, or perhaps with his

father.

After the luncheon break, I started to question

Subject on his first marriage.

before, Subject was

unable.or unwilling to remember any of the data that would

enable us to pin this story down.

He doos not remember

the date of Telegin's arrest,

oxactly when ho mot Telegathe location of the ZAGS office

the dato of the marriago,

where the marriage was registered, or cven the year of

birth of his wife (1928 or 1929):

Subject simply made no

offort to answer these questions,

and for this reason the

questioning proceeded to Subject's first. passport.

Asked where and when he received his first internal

that he thought it was in Moscow in

early 1944 before leaving for Leningrad. Reminded that this.

was a change from his previous story that he had gotten

his first passport in Leningrad, Subject replied that he

hadn't remembered it, and that in any case he also got a

passport in Leningrad.

Asked to describe the purpose of

the internal passport mystem, Subject's answer would embar-

rass any real SCD officer.

He insists that all Soviet

citizens over the age of 16, except those on active military

service and prisoners, have passports.

10 AUgURE 1965

SUBJECT:

Report u1 Interrogation for 9 August 1965

Today'g

seggion (1100 - 1200 and 1215 - 1400) was

dovoted primarily to quostioning about subject's alvorce

and sucond marriase.

In this

context, a number of othor sub-

jects were touched upon in passink, and at the end i put

some further questions about the organization and leadership

of tho MVD in 1953.

2.

At the beginning of the session Subjoet said that

ho had boen thinking about my questions on the naval prepara-

tory schools and that he wished to remind us that felix

KRUTIKOV, who was recruitod in France by either the French

or British Intelligence Services

and later arrested by the

Soviets for this, had also studied at the Baku Naval Pre-

paratory School

and that since he undoubtedly gavo somo bio-

graphic data to his caso officors we should at least be able

to confirm the existence of the naval preparatory school in:

this way.

3.

In questioning Subject about his divorce, the ques-

tion of the territorial subordination of Sovetskaya Gavan

quickly came up.

Subject sald repcatedly that it was in

Primorskly Kray. (Sovetskayn Gavan is, and always has beon

in Khabarovskly Kray.)

When I told Subjeet that ho was nig-

taken, he wag quito upset. At first he insistod that he was

right, then he shifted to a position that he was pretty sure

he was right but that ho reully had no decasion to know bo-

cause it wasn't included in the mall address, which was:

Sovetskaya Gavan, V. Ch. 90-176.

Subject did not know how

many krays there are in the USSR (thero are six), nor could

he explain the disference betweon a kray and an oblast,

and

whatever the rest of his education, his knowledge of geo-

kraphy is rudimentary. As with Sovetsk, 1t is virtually

impossible to nake a mistake of this magnitude if you have

actuully served in the place.

In contrast to the Baltic,

Subject evidently has learnod some descriptive facty about

Sovetskaya Gavan which he scemed ongor in lull mu, howevor,

I cut him off.

4.

In discussing the procedures involved in sctting

his divorco, Subject displayed a general knowlcuge of how

this is done, but broke down on a number of specific points.

It is difficult to say

that he was never divorced, but wo

may certainly conclude that he was not divorced at the time

and under the circumstances that he describes.

Subject's

divorce is so woven

in to his legend of service in the Naval

GRU that it is impossible to isolate it. Evcrything in

this period sounds wrong,

and it must be significant that

this is the period in his life story that has been subject

to the most variation durine the different interrogations.

Subject continues to say that he published the notice of

intention to divorce in Sovetskaya Gavan in 195l, but 1g

"unable

to remembor" the name of the newspaper or the dato

or month if publication.

The choice of an obscure newspaper

in the Far East for the publication of this notice is theö-

retically possible if we assume thit Subject was actually

serving there at the time, but is particularly significant

in that we would have the capability of checking it if the

notico had been published in one of the Moscow papers.

Sub-

ject did not name correctly all the documents required to

file for a divorce, he could not remember the dates of the

various hearings, he does not remember what Peoplo's Court

of which Moscow city rayon the first hearing was at, nor

does he know where the City Court of Moscow is located.

Sub-

ject continues to say that he did not receive a divorce

certificate, and that the divorce was simply entered into

his military identification booklet.

Subject was unwilling

to estimate the date of the divorce more precisely that sum-

ner 1952; asked why he had previously told the story about

returning from the Baltic for the divorce, Subject was un-

able to give an explanation.

5. Asked why he had so much icave in Moscow in 1952,

Subject arain became entangled in the question of military

leave procedures.

He does not aprear:tu.know,

and impro-

vised some false statements about, the correct amount of

leave

coming to an officer serving in the Far East, and

the

normal procedures for registration

in Moscow while on leavo

status.

Sinilarly, Subject at first said that he did not

report his divorce to Naval GRU.

Reminded that Personnel

would be interested, Subject improvised a little story

about

"mentioning it" to them.

All this. tends to confirm previous

findings that Subject did not ever serve as

an

officer in

the Navy. (In this connection, 18 1s

striking that in

Subject's languago there is not the slightest hint or traco

of naval terminology or slanz,

even when discussing the

naval schouls.)

The only officer in Naval GRU leadquartors

in Moscow with whom he seems to have had any personal con-

tact dy tho Chiof of Personnel, KOLOSHIN; lie claims not to

remember the names of any other officers there.

Asked about

how he deregistured from the Komsomol organization in Sovot-

skaya Gavan, Subjoct again said that he hadn't derogistered

and had simply boon picked up by the K/O in "Sovetsk/Primor-

sky" upon arrival there on the basis of his transfer ordera.

6. Subject was shown an exemplar of the Lichnty Listok

po Uchetu Kadroy

and asked if he had ever seen. it betore.

Imnediately said importantly;

"Yes, yes, I know this

ment.

I've seen it in personnel files.

But don't believe

I ever filled

it out mysclf."

Asked where, when and in

whoso personnel files he had seen the document, Subject was

totally unable to give an adequate answer--the

best he could

manage was

"I think it was for civilians.. interpreters,

and so forth"--and finally said that he didn't think that

the KGB used the document at all.

Here Subject's initial

response is as noteworthy an the fact that he does not know

the purpose of the document.

7.

Subject was questloned about lis second marriage.

He has changed his story slightly and now says that he lived

• with his wife at her parente apartment. for two weeks prior

to the final registration at YAGS is Subject's assertion that

he did not have and was not required to produce a Certificate

of Divorce.

This is not possible.

Subject provided a com-

plete guest list of the party at the dacha.

In answer to my

questior, he said that KOBUIOV was not invited because the

party was for close friends only,,

and that although VAKHRUSHEV

was a close friend he simply wasn't there.

8. Subject was then asked a few further questions about

MVD structure in 1953.

He was again unable to recall any of

KRUGLOV's deputies except SEROV.

Asked what CC/CPSU menber

was appointed deputy to KRUGLOV it this time Subject was

completely baffled, satd he dian't know,

and finally

that I was cvidently making a mistake.

(It was SHIATALIN.)

Subject continued to insist that when

he joined the MVD the

CI Directorato was the SCD.

A;ked

where the Intell Direc-

torate was located at the time, he replied Building 2, the

Agricultural Exhibition, the k.l. building, and Kiselngy

---

## Page 40

104-10227-10008

Perculok.

This is a confused and incorrect answer..

Subject

scems to

think that the K.I.

butlding is soncthink separate

from the Agricultural Exhibition

building--actually it 15

the only building there used by

the

KGI3.

Asked for clari-

fication, Subject said that he nover visited the k.I., and

never visitod the CD building at the Agricultural Exhibi

fion.

Thus,

he also roomed. to be unaware that the k.l.

nas not existed since 195l.

Asked who was the Chief of the

Intell Dircetorate Under KRUGLOV and SEROV, Subject roplied

that he know only SAKHAROVSKIY, but didn't know whon SAK-

HAROVSKIY bocamo chief:

He said that he knew that before

EERIYA,

LESNOY,

SAVCHENKO and even FEDOTOV had servod in

this

job.

I

askod Subjoet n dircet question about. PANYUSHKIN,

and ho sald that he had heard that he served in. the MCB at

ono

timo, and thon latur becamc Ambassador to America, and

after that a CC workci.

Even in this context, Subject did

not realizo that PANYUSHKIN. was Chief of the

Intoll Direc-

torato as of July - August 1953.

It is increasingly apparent

that Subject's proparation for his legend of service In 1955-

1954 was limited to his work in the American Department and

that it did not occur to the KGB that we might question Sub-

joct in dotail

on information alrcady provided by mysols and

other defoctors.

SUBJECT:

Report of Interrogation of 10 August 1965.

1.

Today's session was from 1100 to 1200 and from

1300 to 1500.

It was

largoly devoted to a sorter of Sub-

ject's millary ranks and mards, but inevitably a numbor

of relatod topics were touched upon..

Subject was also

questioned about his father's funeral, and about merborg

of the prestdium and the Soviet Government generally.

2.

Subjact was first asked when and where he first

entered on activo military

service.

He said that normally

people were called up at the age of 18, and I told hin that

the ure was

19, but 18 1f the porson has the equivalent of

a full

secondary education.

He said he was never called

Into the army, but roceived a deferment because he was a

student at tho Institute of International Relations.

In

June or July 1947, at the und of his second year at the

Institute he roceived the rank

of Jr.

Lt. of the Reserve,

as did all his clagsmates.

He recoived his first voyonnyy

bilet (VB) at the end of 1945 or carly 1946, at the

rayvovenkomat for his placo of residence at Ul Granovskogo,

ho said ho

thought it might have been Krasnopresnenskly

rayon (this is correct, and

is

the first timo he has cor-

rectly mentioned a rayon in which he lived). This was an

ordinary enlisted man's VB.

In 1047 this VB was replacod

with an officer's VB.

In neither case was Subject able to

five an adequate description of how the documents were

issued,

nor did he have nny idea of what was in then.

He

does not know in what branch of sorvico he was (except :

that it was not the navy), what his sostay /category/ was,

or his NOS.

He said that

the military registration desk

BaS located in

were actually locat dovenkonnt, whereas prior to 195s they

in the Militia Sections.

3.

Subject sald that he first went on active military

service when he entered Naval GRU.

was in October

Ho lift fos tho Far East Innudintely..

Questioned about

tho procedures involved in processing for la eparture,

•Subjuet was totally unablo to describe tho correct docu-

munts and procodures,

and oven said that he travelled in

civilian clothos.

If Subject had ever been a naval offi-

cor anywhore (or for that matter on officer in any branch

of service) hu could casily have invented satisfactory

answers to my olementary questions; instoad he appeared

to.

be improvising answors on tho basis of vory inadequato

knowlodge.

Subjoct gave the following chronology uf his

July 1917 - Jr. Lt. of tho Reservo

Octobor 1950 - Jr. Lt.

April 1951 (whilo in Far East) - Lt.

April 1953 (1n MVD) - Sr. Lt.

Octobor 1959 (KGB) - Capt.

October-November 1903 (KGB) - Lt. Colonel

In no instanco does ho remumber who stoned the order of his

promotion

to

a now military rank (normally,

one could

remember at least a few).

I told Subject that it was 1m-:

possible for him to have been promoted in the HU in April

1953, or at any timo in March-June and even later in 1953-

because

not uno single person in the MVD was procoted at

this time.

llo looked astounded and at first seined unde-

cided what lino to tako, but finally said that he couldn't

say about anyone ulse,

but he was sure that he received

his promotion at that

tine.

(In Pact,

this

1'9

excluded.

All promotions were held up from

Beria until late 1953.)

5.

Subject said that he was put up for captain in

1956, but that the promotion was

blocked by LYALIy--who

was

deputy chairran at that time and a member of the pro-

motion board--on the grounda that Subject should be made

to wait becauso of shortcomings in his work.

Subject

said

that he was proposed for major in 1959, but only re-

ceived captain.

At that time, he was

promised by GRIBANOV

that he would be promoted directly to

Lt. Colonel the

next time around, and this happened.

I told

Subject that

this was impossible,

Today'y session ways from

1310 to 1500.

Subject

Has questionod on the types of filos used in the KGB, on

cable procedurcs,

on Blds #2, and finally was tested on his

knowledbe of underworld slang.

2.

Subject was questioned in considerable detail about

the different typos of files that exist in

the KGB.

Askod

what such filos ho remembers,

Subjoct replice,

"I will list

fur you all the

filos from 1953 to tho present time, includ-

ing the changes."

Ho was not able in do quite that,

but

ho did have a protty good familiarity with

the diffcrent

types of files.

lowever, he did muke some mistäkes--such

as affirming that tho files on soviet citizens who curros-

pond abroad aro kept. in the 6th Department of OTU--and

almost all his answers rang of memorization rather than of

f1rst hand, dilly experience.

As usual, ho had difficulty

in answering spocific questions.

He was weakest on ques

tions which involved a knowledge of procodures in the 1953-

1954 period--such as tho delo formulyn, agenturnoye

delo,

and lichnoye delo formulyar.

ile was unable to describo

the format and broakdown of a liternoye doly, although he

knew its purpose woll chough,

and when

pressed on this he

said that he nover handled one personally, although he was

responsible for an annox to ono.

Conclusion:

Subject's

knowledge of this topic is largely memorized;

however,

some

limited diroct experience cannot bo excluded.

3.

Subject was asked what KGB dircctorato and depart-

neuts are locatnd in Building #2.

SUBJECT:

Report of Interrogation for 12 August 1965

Today's session was fion 1030 to 1200 and from

1245 to 1435.

Subjects

covcred were the Richard BURGI

working hours in the KGB, nunbur and location of

ÄGE dining rooms,

Leningrad naval prep school; and the

land-shooting incident.

Subjoct was questioned in detail about certain

aspects of the BURGI case.

He claims to have been the

case officer responsiblo for handling all

on the case,

and

the paper work

to have assisted A.S. KOZLOV in

the re-

cruitment.

Despite the fact that he

was supposed to have

been thie

only Has caso officer hindling the case from its

beginning,

Subject was complotely unable to describe the

origins

and planning

stages of

the operation.

It is. obvi-

ous from

the circumstances of the casc,

from BURGI's testi-

mony, and indeed from much"of what NOSENKO himsclf says

that the opcrational proposal must have ortginated in the

FCD:

PURGI had never been in the USSR before, but the KGB

knew a great deal about his life history (according to

BURGI, and they certainly knew beforchand that he wag a

homosexual.

Yet Subject says that he ran the nane checks,

which

sere

blank, ho

does not renember whether or not there

was a cable from

the United States about BURGI, and if so,

what

was in it, ho has no idea when or how the KGB learned

that

BURGI was a homo, who first proposed an entrapment

operation,

waS

of what the ops plan was.

He, insists that it

the SCD that first raised the case with the FCD, and

that he went with GUSKOV to talk to FELISOV; Chief of the

Ist Department, FCD, about it, but he cannot remember what

was discussed except in the most general terms.

He main-

tains that FEKLISOV spelled out the specific mesting

arrangements which should be given BURGI in New York at

this

neeting--which

took place before BURGI had even been

approached, much less recruited; this is absurd. Subjoct

tioning and took frequent

wag

equally weak on all questions which pertained to planning,

communications, and behind

the scenes arrangements:

doesn't know what instructions

were sivon

lance team, whethor or not BURGI's room way

etc.

Subjuct did not oven know that there was trouble with

BURGI's visa, and that special steps had in be taken to.

extond it for him.

Subject clained a much larsgr role in

the notual recruitment than BURGI describes, and he do-:

liberatoly falsified certain aspects which show him in an

agent light: for example, he claims not to rencher that

hc:

was

introduced to BURGI in Moscow by the lionesexual agent

"STROYEV," and he was careful to say that although he

stayed in the sanc

hotel as BURGI in Kiev, he was on adle-

ferent flour and BURGI didn't know he was

there (BURGI

says he was in tho next room).

There can be no doubt that

Subject did not participate in this operation as a case

officer.

3.

Subject repeated what he had told previously about

the New York sequel to

the oporation. Asked how he had

learned this, he replied that he and BuskoV learned this

from FEKLISOV, because thes were interested.

Ho admittod

that this was

unusual, and that FEKLISOV shouldn't have

told them.

Pressed, he threw in KOSOLAPOV for good moasure:

KOSOLAFOV was working in the New York Napravleniye of the

Ist Repartment, FCD at that time, knew of the rago, and

told Subject that it had ended.

• Subject was asked what the working hours were in

the MVD when

he first started to work there.

He said it

was 1000 or 1030 to 2400 with a break from 1700 to 2000.

Aslied when this changed, he said he thought it was about

a year later, in 1951.

In reality in MVD Has up to August

1953 the hours were 1100 to 2400 with break from 1700 to

The hours were changed by MALENKOV in August 1953.

Subject said he did not know who

changed the hours or why.

Subject gave the new hours corrcetly.

Ilis mistake on the

old hours is another example of the lack of preparation

that was given to the 1953-51 period of his legend.

5.

Subject was then asked how many dining rooms there

were

in the old part of Building =2.

He replied that there

eighth floor, and the general's dining room between the

I then asked Subject if ho had ever ridden in tho

clevator in the now building; and lie sald ho hui not. Asked

about Bullding 12,

subject said he know unly of the diotetie

restaurant, and that ho had norer eaten there (there aro

Askod about attendance at the KGB Club, Subject

again said that he practically

never went excupt. to meet-

ings, that ho had beon only one on kiB birthday, that his

wifo had been only onco or trice.

Subject was questioned briefly about study in

Leningrad in 1944-15 and the hand shooting incident, but

nothing now omergod:

his story is just as terrible

I asked Subject a few questions about elcmontary

naval subjects and ho

was barely able tu usplain the dif-

terence betwoon a buttloship and a cruiser.

8.

As planned, I concluded by rending Subject a ver-

batim transcript of

what he said about this period of his

lifo in Geneva on 25 January 1961.: Subject smiled at sone

points, contosted others, and did not seen disturbod by

the contradictions.

I ended by reminding Subject that ho

did not have much time left.

9. P.S.: I asked Subjeit that sort of a lapel pin

(anachok) he received upon graduating from the Institute

of International Relations.

He inmediately replied that

he had received one, but much later, in 1957 or 1958 when

he was serving in the Tourist Department. I asked him if

he were sure, and he said he was,

and recalled going with

BELIKOV to get it.

I then read him

the decree establishing these jins for all higher educa-

tional institutions, dated Jaruary 1961.

Prior to that, so

far as I an aware, only Universities

and military academ-

des had such pins.

Subject insisted that he received his

in 1957 or 1958.

(Upon returning wi checked with KAZNACHEYEV,

who graduated from the Instiruse of International Relations

in 1956.

and he never heard of them being instituted later, although

he knows that the universities had them.)
