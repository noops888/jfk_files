On October 22, 1903, AUSA BAER, SDNY, requeste

information as to the whereabouts of PLUMERI on March 28.

1963, to support allegations contained in the impending

IRS indictmant of PLUMERI.

NY 3936-C, whose testimony

is not available,

advised that his records reflect a meeting

with PLUMERI in NY at 10:30 a.m. that date, but the source

advised that he could not

be certain that they met.

The

informant further advised that on that date he flew to Florida,

and recalled that PLUMERI told him that if the people in

Florida he contacted did not believe he represented PLUMERI

that the informant should telephonically contact him in NY.

Based on the above, the source of the informant is confident

that PLUMERI was in NY all day on March 28, 1963. AUSA BAER

was advised that PLUMERI was in New York on the critical date,

but that the informant was not available to testify to this

fact.

On November 20, 1963, AUSA BAER advised that he had

learned that PLUMERI was possibly in Florida at the present

time, and,

therefore, was violating the terms of his bail. He

requested

that an attempt be made to determine if PLUMERI was

in fact out of New York City.

Contact with NY 3936-C on that

date reflected that PLUMERI is presently in Florida.

AUSA BAER

was advised that the subject is presently in Florida, and he

advised that he

sent a telegram to the subject's residence,

400 East 59th Street, New York City, ordering him to appear

on November 22, 1963, or forfeit his bail.

NY 3842-C advised that he has been in contact with

for two reasons.

Either the buttons are stolen, or he is

The informant will continue

to develop information in this regard.

Special Agents of the FBI conducted spot checks on

several dates throughout the period of this report in the

vicinity of the subject's residence, 400 East 59th Street,

New York City,

subject's place of business, York Hotel,

488 Seventh Avenue, New York City, and in the surrounding

immediate vicinities throughout the garment district of

New York City; however, no activity was noted on the part

of the subject.
