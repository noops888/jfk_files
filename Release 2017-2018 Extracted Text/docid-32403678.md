MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORU

SUBJECT : Meeting between DDCI and Chairman Stokes, HSCA

The DDCI, with Mr. Hitz and the undersigned, met

with Chairman Stokes yesterday afternoon at the Cannon

Building.

Mr. Blakey was with Mr. Stokes.

2. The discussion covered the five points in the

letter of 11 September from Mr.

Stokes as follows:

a.

The question of the "mug book" has been

resolved.

b. We believed that the "missing memorandum"

had, in fact, been reviewed on five separate occasions

not we different lethough probler is that tentialy

numbered debriefing memoranda of AMMUG. However, the

time of the memo was such that it had to fall between

others in that

sequence, and was on the subject

(Oswald) in which they were interested.. The HSCA

investigator had been told of this. Mr. Stokes

asked that we simply write a letter explaing this,

and stating our opinion that this was the case..

c.

The Security files of the employee, which

they wished to review were described by the DDCI

as containing information of a personal nature about

the employee.

Mr. Blakey or Mr. Cornwell could

review it. This was accepted.

d. After emphasizing the sensitivity of the

Mexico City history, the irrelevance of 22 years

to the inquiry, and

the nature of the Agency's

status there,

the DDCI stated that Mr. Blakey and

Mr. Cornwell could review it in unsanitized-form.

That was accepted.

e.

It was noted that the 201 file of the

person in question (Proenza) had been reviewed

for the period from January 1963

through May 1964.

The DDCI emphasized the sensitivity of the operation,

especially in the light of certain current develop-

ments.

We stated that the file had been reviewed

by two named officers

tor the period requested,

and that they reported

that it contained no reference

to assassination plotting or the subject of the

investigation.

The DDCI stated that if the

Chairman insisted we could bring the file for him

to review personally.

Mr. Blakey then stated that

there was an allegation that Proenza had been recalled

to Cuba as part of a Cuban inquiry into knowledge

within the Cuban government about Oswald and the

assassination, in addition to which there is a tele-

phone

transcript in which Proenza seems to have

indicated that she had advance knowledge of the

assassination. (We had assumed that the HSCA

interest in Proenza was based on the coincidence

in time of her being recalled to Cuba, but were

tong veteraney ten

not previously aware of either of the

two allega-

tions Blakey revealed). On the basis of this show-

ing of relevancy the DDCI agreed for Mr. Blakey

to review the file of the special operation for

the period requested. Mr. Blakey stated that he

could read Spanish sufficiently well to handle it

personally.

3.

It is noted that Mr. Blakey stated that the

Mexico City

story is to be told in the public hearings

without any reference to CIA, or its presence in Mexico.

4.

Mr. Blakey also stated that no testimony will

be sought from the DCI until December.
