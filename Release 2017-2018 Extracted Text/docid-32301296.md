SHEGET

that it had originally been sponsored by some unknown

cultural : group.. In connection with CONTE's broadcast,

he mentioned the name of the station as "wRUL" and when

asked to repeat it, did so in the same manner.

noted, however, that he named

the station manager as Mx.

BRENT and that New York letter of June 15, 1962, (Bufile

109-584, New York file 105-35253), page 9, sets

infornation identifying a Ns. BRENT as the president of

radio station WvRL in New York City. Accordingly, it is

possible that CONTE is working for station WWRL rather than

WRUL, as he indicated.

During interview, CONIE stated that he has been in'

contact with CIA representatives in Miami for some time and

that he furnishes them with information which he receives

in letters from Cuba in response to his radio broadcasts.

He noted that the CIA representative has never acknowledged

to him that they are sponsoring his broadcasts. (S)(U)

AS CONTE has disbanded the subject organization

and is active in radio propaganda work, (apparently for GIA](SU)

no further investigation of this matter is believed

warranted at this time.

The confidential sources mentioned in the details

are as follows:

MM 639-S; contacted on May 23, 1962, by

SA ROBERT JAMES DWYER.
