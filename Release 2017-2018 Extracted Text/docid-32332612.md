SEBASTIAN JOHN LA

ROCCA, aka

WEEKLY AIRTEL SUMMARY

LA ROCCA, according to informants, is still

travelling throughout the State of Florida and has not

contacted any of his business operations for more than

a week.

Pittsburghn Saturday, 3/16/63, special Agents of the

Office of

the FBI entered the Jockey Club at

Chester, W. Va., which was being operated by JOSEPH (JO-JO)

PECORA in the absence of CHARLES FREDERICK TEEMER who

1s vacationing at Miami, Florida.

PECORA was arrested

and arraigned before the United States Commissioner at

Wheeling, W. Va., on 2/16/63.

PG 632-C has advised that

immediately following his release from incarceration. on

bond, PECORA visited MIKE GENOVESE at the GENOVESE farm

located at RD#2,

Box 149-B, Gibsonia, Pa., and remained

in conference with GENOVESE for approximately five hours.

GENOVESE is obviously in charge of the Pittsburgh situation

during the absence of LA ROCCA, but Pittsburgh informants

do not anticipate any forced return by LA ROCCA to the

Pittsburgh area as a result of the Jockey Club incident.

SUBJECT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
