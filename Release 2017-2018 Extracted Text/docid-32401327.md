Three independent clandestine sources have reported on

the unloading of military equipment from the Soviet vessel

METALLURG BAIKOV in Havana harbor on 19 or 20 November.

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

In a 6-7 December speech devoted mainly to education, Cas-

tro digressed to discuss the situation resulting

from Vene-

zuela's charge that the arms cache discovered on

a Vene-

zuelan beach

last month had come from Cuba.

Castro implied

that the arms had been planted by CIA and are being used

as a pretext for new action by the "imperialists and their

lackeys" against Cuba.

He expressed confidence that what-

ever the result, the Cuban revolution will not be defeated.

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

Faure Chomon Mediavilla is replacing Omar Fernandez as

transportation minister; Major Jesus Montane Oropesa will

be new communications minister. (Page 3)

Heavy rainfall has apparently caused damages to military

facilities in Pinar del Rio Province and hampered travel

FIDEL CASTRO'S SPEECH:

Fidel Castro's speech of the night of 6-7 December was

on the occasion of the graduation of women

teachers for the

literacy campaign. He devoted most of the 99 minutes to a

discussion of the development of local education in Cuba. At

one point, however, he made a moderately long digression to

discuss Venezuela and the situation raised by Venezuela's dis-

covery last month of a large cache of weapons, some of which

have been traced to Cuba.

castro stated that,

while "the imperialists and their

lackeys" charge that Cuba is promoting subversion in Vene-

zuela, rebellion and subversion cannot be promoted from with-

The Venezuelan revolution, he maintained, stems from

the Venezuelan people's own disgust with their government and

with its permitting the "imperialists" to plunder Venezuela's

wealth and resources.

If subversion could, in fact, be promoted

from the outside, why, he asked, have all

the resources of im

perialism failed

to subvert the Cuban Government?

Betancourt,

"that miserable lackey," is trying to incite

the United States to take military action against Cuba, Castro

charged.

As a pretext the Venezuelans say they have discovered

arms from Cuba on the Venezuelan coast, Castro stated.' "Some

of the arms," he said, "are said to have borne an effaced Cuban

seal, and other arms are said to be bazookas, recoilless cannon,

mortars.

But Cuban mortars perchance? No!

Yankee mortars!

Yankee bazookas! Yankee recoilless cannon! Arms which we did

not manufacture; arms which we did not buy!" Castro then went

on, without specifically denying that the weapons had come from

Cuba, by implying that

the CIA had obtained Cuban arms from

Cuban deserters and that it would not be difficult to plant

these weapons in Venezuela.

(Here he is obviously referring

to the Belgian-made light rifles and submachineguns which have

been identified as among those shipped to Cuba in 1959 and

1960.)

With respect to the US-made mortars, bazookas, and re-

Castro challenged the OAS investigating com-

at to sala ton to roches a tale to at 8010 o reach

Castro then attempted to show the "brazenness" and in-

consistency of those who would use the Venezuelan arms cache

as a pretext to invade or to bidckade Cuba when for more than

four years the very same kind of subversive activity as is

now being charged to Cuba has been perpetrated against Cuba--

without any hemispheric attempt to punish the aggressors.

"Things have changed quite a bit," Castro declared, "to

fend ourselves; we are calm; we know what we have to defend

shipment of strategic missiles to Cuba last year, castro de-

talking so calmly about invading Cuba, when it has been only

one year since the October crisis, they are once more proving

us right and are once more justifying Cuba's taking defensive

measures; this talk led to the October crisis." Castro then

declared that "these men are so deceived by their own propaganda

that...they cannot conceive of what any invader would meet here."

A war against Cuba, he said, "would not end while there was a

single mercenary soldier treading on our soil."

Castro then returned briefly to his views as to how peace

CUBAN INTERNAL SITUATION:

A shake-up in the Cuban cabinet has moved Faure Chomon

Mediavilla to the post of transportation minister; he succeeds

whose ministry was recently

under attack

by tastro for alleged inerticiencies and "vices." Major Jesus

Montane Oropesa is replacing Chomon as communications minister.

Chomon, who served as Castro's first ambassador to the

Soviet Union, took over as communications minister in March

1962.

He is

currently a member of the National Directorate

Of PURS.

Fernandez, his predecessor,

is reportedly moving to

an unspecified position in the Ministry of Industries under

Che Guevara.

Montane took part in the attack on the Moncada Barracks

in 1953 and followed. Castro to exile in Mexico.

He took part

in the GRANMA expedition of 1956 when he was captured and

prisoned. After the revolution, he reportedly received only

a minor post in the government because he had talked too much

in prison.

His most recent post, dating from at least August

1962,

has been as number two man

in the Tourism Institute

(INIT). He is said to be an ardent Marxist-Leninist, who

preaches it at every opportunity. (UPI 63, 6 December, UN-

Intercepted Cuban military messages of 7 December indicate

that serious rain damage has occurred in both Pinar del Rio

and Oriente provinces.

Five unidentified military units in

Pinar del Rio reported the extent of damage to their defensive

fortifications and facilities in messages to the operations

officer, apparently at fourth army headquarters in Pinar del

Rio.

More than half the trenches had been destroyed, the

shelters and command posts at most of the units reporting

had suffered serious damage, and division headquarters reported

that, while its facilities were still in good condition; the

roads leading to it will have to be repaired. Meanwhile, in

Oriente Province, intercepts indicate that torrential rainfall

had caused the rivers to flood making travel difficult and

had forced the closing of the Baracoa airport.

However, they claim that he arrived in Spain

on 29 November and to the

best of their knowledge has abso-

lutely no connection with the assassination. They maintain

that he was expelled from the United States

for undetermined

A trained clandestine source who is a civil aviation

expert with the Cuban Ministry of Transportation reports that

several minor incidents of sabotage have been discovered on

CUBANA aircraft.

On 15 November a CUBANA IL-14 made a

round-trip flight from Rancho Boyeros Airport to Nueva Gerona

without a storage battery.

The source comments that serious

trouble would have resulted if one engine had stopped or had

been feathered while en route.

This incident may be related

to various acts of subtle sabotage against CUBANA aircraft,

such as stuffing exhaust tubes with rags or obstructing car-

buretor intakes.

In addition, the source reports that a CUBANA Britannia

aircraft was sabotaged by Algerian personnel during a recent

flight to Algiers.

The hydraulic line was fractured forcing

the crew to use manual controls to lower the landing gear for

a stop in Madrid.

SHIPPING SUPPORT FOR CUBA:

Argentina is reportedly attempting to stop one of its ships--

the SS ANAMAR--from delivering a cargo of coffee to Cuba, despite

the fact that there are currntly no legal restrictions against

Argentine ships calling anywhere in the world. The ANAMAR left

Brazil on l November with a cargo of Brazilian coffee, purchased

by the

USSR and destined for Cuba.

(See Daily Summary of 8 No-

vember.) The Argentine Foreign Ministry informed US Embassy of-

ficials that it was determined to prevent the ANAMAR from going

to Cuba because of potential unfavorable press reaction. Argen-

tina wants to avoid

legal and financial entanglements in the mat-

ter; however, it is determined to stop the ship and

is reportedly

even considering some type of provocation which would force the

Ship to put into Puerto Rico. The owners of the ANAMAR are

equally adamant that the ship will not go to Cuba; reportedly

they had agreed to ship coffee from Brazil to some Central Amer-

ican country to pay some back bills, and were only informed later

that the shipment would go to Cuba.

According to the owners, the

ship is now lying off the coast of Brazil awaiting resolution

of the problem.

The owners reportedly stated they will sink the

ship rather than go to Cuba. (Am Emb Buenos Aires 1017, 4 Decem-

identifying marks recently ground off. Venezuelan technicians,

using a highly technical

process, were able to raise the serial

numbers and the Cuban shield on some of the weapons. In inde-

pendent tests, US technicians were able to raise the numbers

and shields on three of these weapons. The numbers correspond

to those of weapons known to have been delivered to Cuba from

Belgium in 1959 and 1960.

Similarly, in the case of the 81

light

automatic rifles of Belgian manufacture found in the

cache, all identifying marks had been obliterated.

In this

one-fourth inch of molten brazing alloy had

been used

to cover the places where the numbers had been ground off and

it was not possible to restore the numbers.

However, Venezuelan

military authorities have noted that these weapons are unique

On 7 November he

talked with a group of students

at Havana University and on 19 November he reportedly visited

a PURS meeting in Matanzas. However, between these two

dates there is no current evidence that he appeared on Cuban

radio or TV

ances in Cuba.

This does not, however, rule out the possibiliti

that he was indeed in Cuba in mid-November. (CIA IN 75946,

NON-BLOC RELATIONS:

The Moroccan foreign minister has received a three-man

Cuban "good-will" mission for the second time and the Istiglal's

Nation claims that a resumption of formal diplomatic relations

is imminent, according to the US Embassy in Rabat (see Daily

Summary for

29 November and 6. December). According to a semi-

official account of the meeting, which took place on 4 December,

the Cubans reasserted their desire to normalize relations and

professed a lack of hostile intentions against the Moroccan

Government--which severed formal relations after Cuban "techni-

cians" arrived in Algeria on 22 October.

"Informed sources"

in Rabat claim that the government is considering the Cuban

demarche with "attention." The Nation explains that the Cubans

now recognize that Morocco has not been the aggressor in the

Algerian conflict and that they are "repentant" over their pre-

cipitous action in aiding Ben Bella. (Am Emb Rabat, 866, 6 De-

There is additional information on Cuban use of a DC-4

aircraft allegedly to supply Venezuelan guerrillas with weapons

through British Guiana.

A clandestine source who is a civil

aviation

expert and affiliated with the Cuban Ministry of Trans-

portation reports hearing rumors to the effect that the recently

refurbished CUBANA DC-4 with CUBANA registry number CUT-785 has

been issued a "Guiana license," presumably a license for operation

in British Guiana, and has been operated by military personnel.

He adds that

"it is said that clandestine flights have been made

to Venezuela."

The same source had previously reported the re-

furbishing of this plane and some others and indicated that extra

fuel tanks had been installed on them.

The Cubans are reportedly involved in the serious political

crisis now under way in Bolivia, where a split between President

section

of the governing party and the leftist sector led

by Vice President Lechin threatens serious civil disorder.

Cuban

Chargé Lasalle has given two boxes of arms to leaders of the left

section of the party for use in the Catavi-Siglo mining area, ac-

cording to information received by a clandestine source.

The

source, a medium-level member of the left section of the govern-

ing party who has excellent contact with national leaders of

that section and who is apparently trusted by Lasalle, was given

this information by a Bolivian labor leader who added

that he

had personally received the arms from Lasalle.

The source re-

ports that the arms are of German origin and had been stored in

Lasalle's house in La Paz. (CIA DD/P La Paz, IN 76093, 8 December,

SECRET )

Two unnamed Cubans are reportedly with a group of 18 members

of the Peruvian Army of National Liberation (ELN) who are cur-

rently hiding in Bolivia, according to a usually reliable medium-

level member of the Peruvian Movement of the Revolutionary Left

(MIR) who is in regular contact with MIR leaders.

The members

of the ELN may have been returning from training in Cuba, since

several such groups from that movement have gone

there in the

past. According to Gonzalo Fernandez Gasco, leader of the MIR,

his

group will help them return to Peru by providing them with

necessary documentation.

In return, the weapons owned by

the ELN--automatic weapons and "San Cristobal" carbines--will

be turned over to the MIR, reportedly in accordance with an order

from Fidel Castro.

Once the ELN youths are back in Peru, the MIR

will look after them and try to convert them to the cause. The

object is to eliminate the ELN as a rival force.
