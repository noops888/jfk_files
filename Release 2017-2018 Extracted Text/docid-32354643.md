MEMORANDUM FOR: Inspector General

VIA:

Deputy Director for Operations

SUBJECT:

Agency Involvement in the Watergate Case

REFERENCE:

Meande Secret my 197 Manage nt et from the

1. I have known E. Howard Hunt since 1950. We served

together in Mexico City from 1950 to 1953.

Both of us were

assigned to Miami in 1960 and 1961. At other times since 1950

we have crossed paths while pursuing our respective CIA careers.

2. The last time I talked with Howard was during his last

days of work here at headquarters, as he was processing out.

He told me then that he was retiring and would be working at the

White House. I believe that he described his job there as

"speech writer." To my recollection, the year was 1971. We

have had no contact since that time.

Should there nevertheless arise a requirement for a

further discussion of this matter, I can be reached through the

office of Mr. Reid Denis, ISD/DIS, Extension 7833. My current

contract with his office runs out on 31 May 1973, but his

secretary will be able to get in touch with me thereafter.
