MENORANDUM FOR:

SUBJECT:

Secretary; CSCS Board

Recommendation for Promotion -

As one of the final acts in my CIA career 1 want

to bring to your attontion and add my atrong concurrenco

and rocommendation to two (2) recorded rucommendations for

the promotion

of

to tho grade GS-17.

find it hard to imagine & more persuasive recommendation

for this nction than that forwarded by my predecessor in

June

1969 (Attached).

I can' imagino.

lecling

when

he prepared the

second recommendation in February 1970

(Attnched)..

And yet, I find in February 1071 there has still

been no

action.

the yoar that has passed this promotion

has become even more doserved. *

for despite the natural dis-

appointmont accompanying such

continuing lack of rocogni

tion,

chore has beon no diminution of entliuslasm,

no lowering

of standards, and the cs is cicarly better managed becauso

of his continuing

efforts.

Were these two previous recommen

dations

not so clear cut and descriptive, I would conclude

that thoso in control simply do not know

what thie officor

does and has done.

Knowing what he does and how he dous

1t

should not continue to be unrewarded and, hence,

I add my

strongest recommendation for carly and favorable action..

This officer has performed la a mont cutstanding

as testified in his fitnoss reports by my predo-

and cortatnly during my tenure as Chiel, Mps for

the past 12 months.
