MOVIMIENTO INSURRECIONAL DE

RECUPERACION REVOLUCIONARIA (MIRR)

Bosch has instructed that aerial surveillances be

conducted twice daily of the sea lanes off the east coast

of Florida from May 12 through May 14, 1964, to locate the

"Las Villas"

as it approaches the Florida coast.

When the

vessel is spotted, the pilot of the plane is to advise the

individuals: located at Palm Beach of the vessel's location

and direction and then return to a predesignated spot on the

Florida mainland to pick up seven to ten 25-pound napalm.

bombs and a weapon..

The pilot of the plane reportedly is to

coordinate his movements with the speedboat and is to drop

the bombs on the "Las Villas" immediately prior to the attack

by the speedboat in order to divert attention from this boat.

The above-mentioned source feels that Bosch is

promoting this plan for his own personal benefit and profit

without sharing any risk.

The Bureau of Customs in Miami has been furnished

complete details in this matter and is conducting investigation

aimed at stopping the

raid-and seizing the contraband.

• Morons:

Appropriate care shoüld be used in handling this

information so that the source will not be jeopardized.
