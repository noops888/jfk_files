stopped and searched by U.S. Customs Agents. "If no weapons

are found, then the Coast Guard will stop and board Comando

L boats, and will check for all necessary fire prevention

equipment, running lights, safety devices, papers and regis-

If the boat meets these requirements, it will

then be surveilled by the Coast Guard and if it goes into

British waters, the British will be immediately notified

by the Coast Guard.
