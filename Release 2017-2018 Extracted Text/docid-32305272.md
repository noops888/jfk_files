It is possible,

however, that the place of departure

might be changed to Naples. In either event, MM 639-S

will have prior information. In the meantime, this

office is maintaining close liaison with U. S. Customs,

which agency will be prepared to make a seizure of

BOSCH's bombs prior to the time they are loaded on the

plane. Both Customs

and this office are of the opinion

that the security and reputation of MM 639-s would be

seriously jeopardized if the seizure was made after the

bombs are

loaded on the plane. (de (U)

Miami will keep the Bureau informed of

further

pertinent developments.
