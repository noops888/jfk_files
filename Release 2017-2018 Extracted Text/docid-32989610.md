SUBJECT:

CHANNELIZING MEMORANDA

SECURITY-TYPE CASES.

MDR - 16

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

TERTINIS INGLAUSIPE

АТЕ 10/4/00 БУ САт/є

The purpose of this memorandum is to call atten-

tion to the problem of retaining channelizing memoranda in

field case files.

BACKGROUND: Under the present procedure, when data is

received from security informants either their

reports or a memorandum on data furnished is prepared and

is placed in the subfile relating to the particular informant.

A memorandum, which is called a channelizing memorandum, is

then prepared

setting forth the various items of intormation

furnished and copies are designated for each file for which

the contents of the memorandum relate. The original memo-

randum furnished by the informant is placed in the subfile of

the informants file.

Any memorandum which is prepared on the

basis of oral information is placed in this file and also

reierred to as a channelizing memorandum.

Many

suggestions have been received starting in

September, 1952, and up to April 18, 1960, to destroy these

memoranda

in case files after the information has been

incorporated into a report.

In all instances, these

suggestions have not been adopted.

The Executive Conference

on 7/6/53 considered this matter and was unanimously opposed.

The Domestic Intelligence Division has consistently opposed

these suggestions.

This matter was discussed at the Internal Security-

Espionage conferences, January 12-13, 1959, and recommended

study by the Training and Inspection Division during inspec-

tions of larger offices.

Un september 1i, 1959, in a memo-

randum Irom br. lamm to Mr. lolson, (100-00-1481), it was

recommended that the channelizing memorandum be retained

in individual subject files.

The inspection stall has frequently been presente

this problem during inspections.

In discussing-this matter

with field representatives, there is a divergence of opinion.

Memo to Mr. ilohr

RE:

Channelizing Memoranda

security-type Cases

ADVANTAGES: Saving of file cabinets, office space and prevént

case files from becoming voluminous, particularly

in larger offices. As an example, during the last New York-

inspection (completed 3-25-60) in

four Internal Security case

files, there was an increase since the last inspection of 17,

20, 16, and 12 volumes respectively.

These files contained

some reports, letters and airtels, but the bulk of the files

was channelizing memoranda.. These examples reflect the increase

of storage space for these files.

DISADVANTAGES:

The purpose of these memoranda is to insure

that all information from informants pertaining

to a particular subject is placed in the subject's file and

readily available.

Comparisons of channelizing memoranda against

reports reflect all information from the memoranda is not in-

corporated into the report such as information of intelligence

nature.

Intelligence information available in channelizing

memoranda is often needed in conducting surveillances and other

investigation relating to a subject. If the memoranda were

destroyed, the Agent would be required to review numerous in-

formant subfiles to insure he had all information. It is a

possibility he might miss some valuable intelligence information.

Security reports are prepared for future prosecution. Should

there be an emergency, it would be virtually impossible for all

Agents

involved to review the original reports or original

channelizing memoranda due to the great demands which would be

made for such material.

CONCLUSIONS: While this matter has always been decided in favor

of retaining channelizing memoranda, we continue to

receive suggestions from the field that consideration be given to

destroying them once they have been incorporated into a report.

It is obvious there would be a great amount of filing space saved

11 this were possible. However, in view of the objections set

forth, it is believed this matter should again be considered by

the members of the Internal Security Espionage Confrence on

June 9 - 10, 1960, in an endeavor to establish whether it is

possible to overcome the enumerated objections. It is the con-

sensus of the Inspection Staff that if the material objections

can be overcome the destruction of channelizing memoranda after

they have been incorporated in a report would be desirable.

RECOMMENDATION: That this matter be discussed at the Internal

Security - Espionage Conference, June 9 - 10, 1960.

PAM/EHL:

from a review of investigative reports concerning security

matters in recent months a tendency has been noted on the part of

the field to report plans of a subversive group to take certain

action, without a tollow-up to report that the action did or did not

take place. This is an undesirable practiceas it may infer inadequate

investigation and could prove embarrassing because of the fact that

we disseminate information to many other agencies which rely on us

for the full facts in given situations.

Examples of the foregoing may be found in the following:

Bufiles 97-401-1291, 1292; 100-3-29-1162, 1163; 100-3-63-1037;

100-46808-820, 823. In all these instances the reporting period

encompassed the dates when certain activities were to have taken

place but the reports failed to resolve the actuality of the situ-

ation.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is basic that we are as much interested in actions taken ..

by a subversive group or individual thén what it or he may plan to

1do. To report only an intention or plan without the necessary follow-

up is to leave the matter unresolved in the mind of the reader. It

is believed that a reminder to the field in the form of an SAC letter

would be desirable and is therefore recommended.

ACTION:

Attached for approval is an SAC letter reminding the field

of anges nesses chozoughness in security report

writing. Manual

with the understanding that any investigation which the

NATIONALISTIC TENDENCY MATTERS

During the period 11/10/65 to 3/18/66 in connection

with work handled by your office regarding various nationalistic

tendency matters it has been necessary for the Bureau to

initiate correspondence with the San Juan Office on 41 separate

occasions regarding nonsubstantive errors in conmunications,

other than teletypes, prepared by the San Juan Office.

An analysis of the 41 communications sent to San Juan

in this connection has revealed that 62 separate errors of

form were involved.. Fifteen of the errors related to incorrect

description or insufficient concealment of sources. An

additional 15 errors were of a typographical nature. In seven

instances errors were made in classifying reports and letterhead

memoranda prepared for dissemination.

Remaining errors were

in titles of communications (four); failure to submit evaluation

memorandum (three); inclusion of incorrect references in

communications (three); omission of character of cases (two);

incorrect designations of copies (five); failure to submit

material in form for dissemination (four); and one error each

In going over the types of errors committed, 1t will

be noted that almost all of them could have been avoided by

the exercise of more care in preparing the communications or

in proofreading them.

Administrative correspondence to call the attention

of your office to errors committed is time-consuming and must

be reduced. The pattern shown here is indicative of a lack of

proper attention to details and to accuracy of material

prepared in the San Juan Office.

Reports and letterhead

memoranda are often given wide dissemination at the Seat of

•Government and you must assure that the material emanating

from your office is closely scrutinized from a standpoint of

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

On 2/27/69, the Executives Conterence approved a

six-month suspension of investigations in selected Security

Matter - Communist cases as well as report writing in cases

involving Priority II and Priority III Security Index subjects.

This moratorium was imposed as amatter of temporary expediency

in order to make additional investigative personnel available

for organized crime investigations in the field.

At the

conclusion of the above six-month period,

evaluated and on 9/17/69,

that this moratorium would remain

i goate a sect one

the moratorium was.

a letter was sent to the field advising

in effect for an additional

six months.

Priority I of the Security Index includes those

individuals considered to be hard core national

and state

leaders of subversive groups and individuals with no organizational

affiliation who are believed to pose an imminent threat to the

internal security.

Verification of residence and employment of

individuals in this category are conducted every three months

and reports submitted annually.

Cases in this category have not

been affected by the moratorium.

Priority II of the security Index includes those

individuals considered to be the second level of leadership in

subversive organizations and individuals believed to be dangerous

but in less influential positions than those included in Priority I.

Verification of residence and employment in this category and

submission of reports

are performed on an annual basis. Cases

In this category have

been affected by the moratorium.

•.Д.

All other individuals in the Security Index are tabbed

Priority III. Cases in this category have likewise been affected

by the moratorium.

Prior: to 12/69, verification of residence

and employment

these individuals was conducted on a yearly

basis and reports were submitted every two years. In 12/69,;

for the purpose of streamlining om procedures, the Bureau, with

the concurrence of the Department, instructed

the field that

in the absence of unusual circumstances, annual reports no longer

need be submitted regarding Priority III, subjects.

SECURITY INVESTIGATIONS OF INDIVIDUALS

100-358086

As of 3/13/70, the Security Index contained 696

Priority, I subjects, 2065 Priority II subjects and 8286

Priority III subjects. In view of the above-stated changes

in procedures, should the moratorium be lifted at this time,

no reports need be submitted in the 8286 Priority III cases,

and reports need only be submitted on a periodic basis in

the 2065 Priority II cases.

This represents an approximate

73 percent reduction in report writing in these categories.

As the Bureau has gone on record in placing the

above moratorium into effect, it would be in the best interests

of the Bureau to similarly go on record, notifying the field

that the moratorium pas been suspender Ada nonali hIs

"*'**imperative that the moratorium be suspended to help regulate

size of the Security Index.

Manual of

Instructions requires

that subjects, after five years of

revolutionary

inactivity in a basic

group or three years of inactivity in a front

group,

be considered for Security Index deletion.

As a result

of the moratorium, no action has been taken by the field in

this respect in the past year, and the Security Index has

continued to grow. From March, 1969, to March, 1970, the

Security Index has increased by over

800 names, principally

because the necessary process of attrition has

been suspended.

It is recognized the moratorium was necessary when

instituted.

It is felt, however, that now is the appropriate

time for the moratorium

to be rescinded not only to enable

the Bureau to fulfill its responsibilities in the vital

internal security field, but because lifting of the moratorium

at this time will not create the burdensome increase in the

workload of the field that would have existed had not the

previously-stated changes in procedures been placed into

effect.

Attached is letter to all field offices advising

that the above moratorium has been rescinded.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the attached letter to all field offices,

advising of the lifting of the moratorium, be approved and

sent to the Mechanical Section in order that appropriate

copies be made.

investigations, was extended on September 17, 1969, for an additional 6 months.

The moratorium has not affected Priority I, Security Index subjects, i.e.,

hardcore national and state leaders of subversive groups, and individuals with no

organizational affiliations who are believed to pose an imminent threat to the internal

security. Matters involving Priority II subjects (currently 2065 in that category),

individuals considered to be less influential in subversive organizations and/or who

hold positions of lesser influence, were affected by the moratorium in that verification

of residence and employment was not required and the submission of reports was

suspended. Cases relative to individuals in Priority III (representing about 8, 286

cases), the category of Security Index subjects considered to be least dangerous, were

affected by the moratorium in that these cases were not reopened and verification of

residence and employment of the subjects was not conducted.

It is the view of the Domestic Intelligence Division that the revoking of the

noratorium is desirable at this time in order to help regulate the size of the :

security Index, in order that the whereabouts of the subjects of Priorities II and III

nay be brought up to date, and in order that the Department and other Government

gencies with an interest may receive dissemination of information developed relative

o current subversive activities of the subjects of Priority II cases. •

Memo for Mr. Tolson

Re: Security Investigations of Individuals

OBSERVATIONS:

The setting of the moratorium on February 27, 1969, and its subsequent 6-

month extension in September, 1969, have resulted in a cessation in the dissemination

of reports relative to the over

2000 individuals who make up the secondary level of

leadership in various subversive organizations. Further, imposition of the moratorium

has caused the field to cease verifying the whereabouts of Priorities II and III subjects.

However, in spite of the moratorium, the field has in many instances remained

cognizant of the current whereabouts of those subjects through established sources,

and, of course, it might be expected that the whereabouts of many of the subjects.

has remained unchanged through the moratorium period.

The rescinding of the moratorium would result in requiring the preparation

and submission of reports in all Priority JI cases there are 2065 such cases) in which

cadilitional pertinent information had been developed since submission of the prior.

report, and would require the preparation and submission of an approved form or

other correspondence in other instances. Further, lifting of the moratorium would

cause the field to initiate investigation to verify the current whereabouts of the subjects

in Priorities Il and III (10, 351 cases).

Subsequent to the initiation of the moratorium, approval was given, with the

written concurrence of the Department, that the writing of reports on Priority III

subjects would be suspended. The appreciable savings of Agent, stenographic and

clerical man hours which resulted from this change would not be affected by a

continuation of the moratorium, since reports on individuals in the Priority II

category would still not be required.

The foregoing would indicate that the lifting of the moratorium would require

the assignment of additional personnel to the Security Index program throughout the.

feld, and that the additional communications generated in the field would impose ar

additional work load on Seat of Government clerical and supervisory personnel.

Rescinding the moratorium would increase the work load, both in the field

and at Seat of Government. In view of additional manpower requirements relative to

the Bureau's intensification of investigations of New Left terrorists, it would not appear

that the rescinding of the moratorium is justified or advisable at this time. This

intensification ordered by the Director will require a considerable manpower commitmen

and make necessary. the reassignment of personnel, both in the field and at the Seat of

Government, to this area of emphasis. Accordingly, the streamlining effect which has

resulted from the imposition of the moratorium should be continued.

ATE 10/5/00 BY SP PALM/EHI

Current MOI chapter on security investigations is

extremely lengthy 110

0 pages and cumbersome:

This section,

which governs a substantial part of our security work, including

investigations of Marxist-leninist organizations and front groups,

New Left organizations, and Security Index subjects, has not been

overhauled for more than 15

years, and it is seriously in need of

streamlining, updating, and

reorganizing.

For the past several months, as time has permitted, this

entire

section has been reviewed, streamlined, and reorganized by

Supervisor John E. Keating of the Research Section who has worked

closely with inowledgeable supervisors throughout the Division in

connection with this project.

This proiect has now been completed

•and there is attached a revised Section 87 which it is believed is

far better organized and will prove more useful and more readable

both to Agents in the field and to our supervisory staff. Not

only is the revised section much shorter than the current version

(ess than half in length), but it has also been organized with

view to providing maximum convenience in locating subject matter.

and in combining related topics which are not scattered throughgut

this section.

The following specific changes have been made in

connection with this project:

1. All of the pertinent material relating to applicable

statutes has been combined in the initial section of the choter.

heretofore, pertinent statutes had been scattered throughout the

section.

At the same time, we have considerably streamlined the

statutory information especially to eliminate portions of the

Smith Act of 1940 and the Internal Security Act of 1950 which

have recently been declared unconstitutional.

Based on r'ecent

court decisions declaring these statutes invalid, we have also

deleted references to the National Defense Education Act of 1958,

i the National Science Foundation Act of 1950, and the statute.

concerning the right to strike against the Government.

2. We have substantially streamlined the current

provisions (87C) relating

to investigations and reports on the

Communist Party, USA, and other Harxist-Leninist groups to

eliminate redundancies of verbage and repetition..

We have broken down current Section 87D (relating

to security investigations of individuals into a number of more

meaningful and clearly defined subsections. Currently, 87D xuns

to some 80 pages and is most unwieldy and complicated.

In our

rewritten chapter we have broken this lengthy section

down into

such categories as policies and objectives, procedures, techniques,

administrative procedures, and dissemination.

4. Throughout the entire chapter ve have used stream

lined wording, eliminated repetition and verbiage, and sought to

organize the material under weil-defined and meaningiul subheadings.

5. A table of contents has

been prepared for the entire

chapter. Currently the chapter contains only a table of contents

with regard to 87D.

This rewritten version of Section 87 has been reviewed

and approved by the Internal Security Section which handles the

bulk of investigations involved.

Pertinent portions have also

been reviewed and cleared by the Nationalities Intelligence

The purpose of this memorandum is to recommend the destruction

of files in the 100 (Internal Security) and 105 (Internal Security or Security

Matters - Nationalistic Tendencies other than Domestic) Classifications

containing record material which no longer possess sufficient historical,

investigative, intelligence, and reference value to merit retention.

The Records Disposal Committee, Files and Communications

Division, conducted a survey of our records holdings in the 100 and 105

Classifications which revealed that files over 25 years old occupy 585.

six drawer cabinets (100's occupy 565 cabinets and 105's occupy 20 cabinets).

A cross section aralysis of these files revealed that cases occupying

approximately 350 cabinets relate to alleged Espicnage, Sedition, Sabatoge,

Hatch Act, and Internal Security Violations as weli as alleged subversive

activity, subversive tendencies, sympathizers, members of subversive

organizations, suspicious actuates, recipient

of funds from foreign sources

and miscellaneous matters in which no violations are present and the

allegations were unfounded.

Also numerous files in the 100 Classification were opened on

outgoing letters to Field Offices based upon excerpis from other Bureau files

pertaining to subscribers to the Daily Worlier or publications of a similar

nature and/or alleged membership in o1 aftiliation with subversive organizations.

No further correspondence appears in these iles, therefore, all information

will be available in the original Burcau case lile alter these are destroyed.

Iviemorandum P. F. O'Connell to Mr. Marshall

Re: PROPOSED DESTRUCTION OF TILES IN THE I0O INTERNAL SECURITY)

AND 105 (INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS) CLASSIFICATION CONTAINING

VALUELESS FILE MATERIAL BY THE RECORDS DISPOSAL COMMITTEE

Files, which will be considered for destruction, contain valueless

information comprised principally of initial correspondence, and preliminary

reports or letters. They were opened based won rumor, personal grievances,

suspicions, non'specific allegations, nebulous information or forcign publications

mostly during World War II, for record or informational purposes. All of this

material has been extensively de-indexed and files which will be destroyed do not

contain any information reflecting unfavorably upon the character, loyalty or

associates of the subjects in the title or persons named therein.

Approximately

350 six drawer file cabinets of badly needed filing space will be reclaimed. The

destruction of these files will be handled on a most selective basis by experienced

Records Branch Personnel and will in no was adversely affeci the Bureau's

operations or Its responsibilities in the Name Check field.

The proposed destruction will include material in the 100-0 general

file and in the 100-0 Sub A file, where applicable. Archival Authority is

required for the destruction of original record material and will be requested by

separate memorandum.

It is noted that this proposal is very similar in nature to a recent

proposal involving files in the 65 (Espionage) Classification, which was approved

by the Bureau in memorandum P. F. O'Connell to Mr. Marshall dated 8/13/72.

Archival Authority was granted on 9/12/72 for the destruction of the valueless

Espionage file material.

It is recommended that this proposal be referred to the Intelligence

Division for its evaluation and comments.

• RECOMMENDATION:

That approval be granted for the destruction of files in the 100 and

• 105 classifications in accordance with the above guidelines in cases over 25

years old.

If approved, appropriate Archival Authority will be obtained.

ADDENDUM INTELLIGENCE DIVISION 4/3/73

Attached to this Addendum is a list furnished

by the Files and Communications Division of the files

being considered for

• destruction.

A review was made of

a random sampling of these files

(those checked in red

on the list; one of each general

type; total of thirty

files).

The sample review bears

out the conclusion of

the Files and Communications Division that these files

have no apparent historical, investigative, intel igence

or reference value which would merit their retention.

The Intelligence Division concurs in the recommendation

of the Files and Communications Division thai such files

be destroyed after receipt of Archival authorization or

such disposal,

provided

that each and every file to be

destroyed is

first individually reviewed by experienced

Records Branch personnel to ensure they meet the destruc-

tion criteria and that their destruction will in no way

adversely aîfect the Bureau's operations or its responsibii-

ities in the name check or security field:

It is recommended

nowever,

that General Investigative Division

(Name Check

Therefore, the authorized

destruction of any files having no apparent historical,

T. J. Smith to E. S. Miller izemorandum dated 7/24/73,

caplioned as above, enclosed a 43-page position paper prepared for

I. Patrick Gray, I, relating to captioned matter. This memorandum

also described previous efforts to got a request to the Attorney Generai

to seel a comprehensive Executive order whiel would provide definitive

guidelines for the FBI to conduck domestic intelligence-type investigations.

This memorandum pointed out that the political climate cl

suspicion and distrust resulting from disclosures coming cui of the

Watergate hearings could present an obstacle to getting an Executive

order signed at this time, but that the need is groat and such an order

would establish definitive guidelines which have heretofore been unclear.

We recommended that we go forward with a request for the Executive

order and leave it up to the Attorney Conerai and perhaps the White House

to make a final decision. In that way we would be taking a stop forward,

The Director noted, "There may be some obstacle in pursuing

ine recommended course, but lieel we shoud proceed rather than to wait

for a more favorable climate. We never progress by standing still. Con-

tinue as set out in memo which was an excellent review of the problen."

Pursuant to the Direcion's instructions, there is attached a

SCOPE OF FBI JURISDICTION

AND AUTHORITY IN DOMESTIC

INTELLGENCE LNVESTIGATIONS

August 7, 1973

14 55027

During our meeting on July 26, 1973, you referred to a discussion

you had with Senator Charlos hicC, Mathias, JI., of Maryland during your con-

fixmation hearings as to the statuiory authority of the FBI and the Department of

Justice in the field a domestic intelligence investigations. You thon asled

Mr. Wilham D. Ruchelshaus to work with the Fil in weighing the pros and cons

with regard to statutory authority in this area. I mentioned that rescarch was

boing performed on this subjcet at the present time and that we would be in

touch with ar. Fuciseishaus with regard to this matter when we have compicted

the results of our consideration and findings within the FBI.

Actually, a study has been going on in the FBI for more than two

years as to the scope of Fil jurisdiction and authority in domestic intelligence

investigations. When Mr. I. Patrick Gray, Ill, was designated as Acting

Director of the FbI, he instructed that a position paper be prepared concein.

ing the jurisdiction and authority of the FBI to conduct domestic inteligence

investigations. A position paper was prepared which in essence stated that

authority of the FBI in this field is based on legislative chectmants, evon

though we may have publiciy relied heavily on Presidential directives as the

basis for such authority. fir. Gray ordered an in-dopth study made of the

position and in August, 1972, i detailed report was furnished io lim. The

following is a summary of that report.

• Over a period of several months there were a numbor of public

etatements questioning authority and jurisdiction of the FBI to corduct comcatio

intedigenes-type invostigations, particularly where there is no clear-cut

legislative authority apparent. Che oi the nost saching inquiries was con-

tained in a paper presented by troiessor john I. Plug a a twe-sex conference

at Princeton University in Cutober, 1971, sponsored by the Conmitee for Public

Justice.

The Attorney General

A major thrust of Froiessor Elliff's paper concerned FBI authority

derived from legislative enactments as opposed to that derived from Presidential

directives, beginning with a directive issued by President Roosevelt in

September, 1939. Protessor Elliff is of the opirion that the 1939 directive,

which was reiterated on three subsequent occasions, was nagnified by the

FBI from its original purpose to a definitive order to conduct intelligence-type

investigations.

Senator San I. Ervin, as you know, had been probing into the

nature and extent ol FBI intelligenco-type investigations. Senator lirvin had

even announced that he intended to propose legislution to prohibit the FBI

from investigating any person without that individual's consent, unless the

Government has reuson to believe that person has commitied a crime or is

about to comnit a crime. Other Congressmen indicated a similar interest

in FBI investigative activities.

Our study revealed that the EBl had declared publicly over a

long period of time that its responsibilities in the domestic intelligence field

are authorized under legislative enactments, Presidentil directives, and

instructions of the Attorncy General. The Presidential directives are obviously

the 1) directive dated September 6, 1939, and reitcrated January &, 1943;

• July 44, 1950; and December 15, 1953, and 2) Executive Order 10450 dated

April 27, 1953 (and amended but not yet implemented by Executive Order

11605 dated July 2, 1971) •

In carefully analyzing the language of the first directive, dated

September 6, 1939, and considering that the subsequent directives are all

hinged on that one, we believe that there is a misconception as to the extent

of jurisdiction or authority conveyed to the FBI by these dircotives. It

appears that while the 1939 directive fixed responsibility on the FBI to handle

espionage, sabotage, and neutrality matters, it did not convey any authority

or jurisdiction which the FBI did not aircady have from lepislative ennetments.

It is difficult to read into this direclive or in any of those which followed any

authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations which would or could

not be conducted under an umbrella of legislative enactments.

Tho Attorney General

Az a matter of histozical fact, President Roosevelt in August,

1936, did request former Director i. Edgar Hoover to conduci investigations

of subversive activities in this country, including communism and iascism.

This request, however, was a confidential oral request and there is doubt

that any record ol li was made outside the FBI. This request, or Presidential

mandate, was based, incidentally, on the lact that the law provided that the

FBI could conduct such investigations il the Secretary of State should so

The study rovoaled that while the 1939 et son. diroctives did not

grant any special intelligence-gathering authority to the FEI, we were respon-

sible under these directives to collect all intolligence information furnished

by local, state, and Federal law enforcement agencies and patriotic citizens

and to silt and coordinate all such information for indicatione of subversive

activity covered by Federal statutes.

The study concluded that the FBI has the responsibility to con-

duct whatever investigations are necessary to determine if stututes reiating

to esplonage, sabotage, insurrection or rebellion, sedition, seditious con-

spiracy, advocacy oi overthrowing the Government, and other such crimes

allecting the national security have been violated, In this connection we

note that in a letter dated September 14, 1987, the Department of justice

advised thnt the EB! is continuaily alert to the problem of recurring riota

and is submitting intelligence reports to the Department of Justice concern

ing such activity. This lettor enumerated several Federal statutes and

atsted these could be applicable in using maximum availabla resources,

investigative and intelligence, to collect and report all lacts bearing on

the question of schemes or conspiracies to plan, promote or aggravato riot

activity.

In other words, the Department was requesting all possible

intelligence-type investigative activity based on the caistence of certain

statures. We see this as being no different from our intolligance-type

investigations relating to plans oi groups or individuals to overthrow,

dostzoy, intarfere with or threaten the survival of effective operation of

national, state, and local governments.

Based on this siudy, we believe that had thore nerer been a

conducted and will, through necessity, continue to conduct the same intelli

gence-type investigations as were conducted from 1330 to the present dato.

We also believe, however, that in order to counter the critician and skept-

cism of such individuals as Professos Elliff and Scnator Sam J. Ervin that

an up-to-dute Executive order should be issued clearly establishing a need

for intelligence-type investigations and dolinetting a clear authority for tha

FBI do conduct such investigations based on guidelines established by the

Attorney Goneral and adhering to constitutional principles.

The study concluded with two basic recommendations.

1) That the Department of justica be reguested to sponsor comprehensive

legislation spelling out the FBI's investigative nuthority in the collection of

intelligence intornation relating to the national security and; 2) tant the

Department of Justice be requested to seek a comprehensive Executive order

which would cover any possible gay between statutory authority and Exscutive

necessity in protection of the national security.

At first glance these recommendations may appear to contradict

our position that we already have statutory authority to conduct security-type

investigations; thet this being the case we do not need additional legislatve

enactments, nor do we nced an Executive order. But being realiatle we think

that the basic statutes upon which we rely for our authority to conduct

domestie intelligence investigations need to be updated to fit 1973 needs.

Tide 18 U.S.C. Sections 2383, 2384, and 2385 relate in the national security,

but the legislative history of 2333 nd 2384 indicates that they were designed

for the Civil War cra, not the Twentieth Century, und Saction 2385 has been

reduced to a fragile shell by the Supreme Court. These statutes are unques-

sionably still valid, but updating is certainly indicated. The bills introduced

as H.k, 6046 and S, 1400 in the S3rd Congress appear to contain lunguage which.

should till our statutory needs, excopt perhaps for those groups, such as tho

Ru Klux Klan, which do not seok to overthrow the Government, but never

theless are totalitarian in nature and seek to deprive constitutionally guaranteco

rights.

The Attorney General

As to the need for an Executive order, we think that to issues

are involved. We have stalutory authority, but what we need is & definitive

requirement from the President as to the nature and type of intolligence data

he requires in the pursuit of his responsibilities based on our statutory

authority. In other words, there is a need, from our standpoint, for both

authoritative and definitive guidelines. The statutes rive us the authority.

The Executive order would define our national security objectives.

Members of Congress, including such men as Senator Robert C.

Byrd of West Virginia, have proposed legislation to spell out jurisdiction and

authority of the FEI in this field. It would appear that the President would

rather spell out his own requirements in an Executive order instead of having

Congress tell him what the FBI might do to help him fulfill his obligations and

responsibilities us President.

The political climate of suspicion and distrust resulting from

disclosures coming out of the Watergate hearings could present an obstacle

to getting any such Executive order signed in the immediate future. However,

the rationale is nevertheless valid and when scrutinized closely, the language

in the Executive order we hercinaîter propose establishes definitive guidolines

which have heretofore been unclear. It is my belief that we should go forward

- with this.

We therefore propose and recommend that an Executive order

along the following lines be submitted to the White louse with a strong

recommendation for ayproval. The language which follows is merely to

illustrate the type of Executive order which we think would be appropriate

and does not necessarily represent an ideal format or style which should

be subritted to the White louse.

EXECUTIVE ORDER

"Whereas the Constitution of the United States was established to

insure, among other things, domestic tranquility; to provide for the common

defcuse; and to promote the generul welfare for the people of the United States:

HN 55027 Do0Id:32989610 Page 77

## Page 78

The Attorney General

"Whereas the President of the United States has the constitutionally

- imposed responsibility of defending the Constitution and the existence of the

Government thereunder; and

"Whereas there heve been continuing unlawful acts of violence

perpetrated agoinst the Government of the United States or against citizens

of the United States or against persons entitled to the protection of the

United States thereby endangering the domestic tranquility, threatening the

common defense, and jeopardizing the general welfare of the people-of the

United States; and

"Whereas the Congress has enacted laws prohibiting acts such as

treason, sedition, sabotage, espionage, insurrection and rebellion, seditious

conspiracy, civil discoedience, rioting, assassination, kidnaping, deprival

of civil rights, and conspiracies to commit such acts; and

"Whereas the President of the United States as Chief Executive

in the maintenance of the Government thereunder must have intelligence

information for appropriate decisions in the discharge of his constitutionally

imposed responsibilities;

"Now by authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes

of the United States and in the interest of orderly operation of this Government

and in furtherance of the domestic tranquility, common defense, and general

welfare of the people of the United States it is ordered that;

• "The Attorney General prepare and issue guidelines, contorming

to the principles of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and outlining the

necessary direction, coordination, and guidance of investigations to assure

that the Federal Bureau of Investigation provides on a continuing basis

intelligence information essential to the execution of laws pertaining to sub~

versive activity and other such activity alfecting the national security,

domestic tranquility, and general welfare of the United States."

The Nation has been going through a time of terror. The concept

o urban guerrilla terrorism has been adopted by various extremist elements

iu the United States. Bombings of pliolic buildings and national institutions;

-8-

НН 55027 DooId:32989610 Pade 78

## Page 79

The Attorney General

killing of police officers who, by their uniform, are a symbol of the democratic

establishment; hijacking of aircraft in furtherance of revolutionary movements;

terrorist assaults on foreign diplomatic personnel and establishments; and open

declaration of wai on our form of government are only a few of the violent acts

which have been perpetrated by domestic subversives who seek to destroy or

seriously cripple our Government. Terrorist guerrilla attacks which were

once continea to far away places and related to problems of no immediate con-

cern of ours are now possible in this country. Forcign terrorist groups in

collusion with domestic terrorists have laid plans for an airport massacre of

the type which recently occurred in Israel. Other foreign terrorist elements

have laid plans for terrorist attacks on American soil. Already one foreign

official has been assassinated, possibly by terrorists.

It would be folly to arlopt an investigative policy based on

the concept of investigation only when there is reason to believe a crime

involving the national security has been committed. The FBI must

obviously anticipate the crimes described above. We believe that in

order for the Government to be in position to defend itself against revolu-

tionary and terrorist efforts to destroy it, the FBI must have sufficient

investigative authority to conduct intelligence-type investigations not

• normally associated with enforcement of the statutes. In other words we

think the President has the inherent Executive power to expand by further

defining the l'BI's investigative authority to enable it to develop advance

information concorning the plans and aspirations of terrorists and revolu-

tionaries who seck to overthrow or destroy the Government. However, we

also believe that such expanded authority must be formally set forth in an

Executive order and that this recommendation is responsive in the Attorney

General's expressed interest in laying more formal guidelines to our work

in areas where definition is not now clear.

We consider the issuance of a new Executive order delineating

our jurisdiction, authority, and responsibility to gather and report intelligence

Information relating io the national security to be a very important and hign

priority matter. We believe the issuance of guidelines by the Attorney General

under Title 28, Section 533, United States Code, to be equally important.

For your information, our own investigative guidelines as con

tained in our Manual of Instructions relating to domestic subversive invostiga-

dions have been completely rewritten to conform with the concept that our

domestic intelligence-type investigations are based on Ecderal statutes. These

guidelines provide thet in each instance, the domestic intelligence investigation

must be predicated on information indicating that the organization or individual

is engaged in activity which could involve a violation of specifc statutes relating

to the national security. A copy of the new guidelines was previously provided

to the Dapartment of Justice in connection with the request o Sonator Edward M.

Kennedy to obtain a copy of the FBI's Section 87 of the Manuai of Instructions.

The effective date of the new guidelines was August 1, 1973.

PURPOSit :

To obtain ayproval to send attached airtel to all

offices which airtel reiterates instructions pertaining to

the proper character to be utilized in connection with

investigations of subversive individuals and organizations.

BACKGROUND:

section 8l, Manual of Instructions (Mol), was

extensively revised in that it now stresses a statutory

approach relative to investigations of domestic security

matter's.

Subsequent to its effective date of 8/1/73,

Headquarters supervisory personnel have noted while

revicking incoming mail submitted by the field that the

majority of the field offices continue to incorrecily use

"Revolutionary Activitios" as a character in connection

with the investigations of

subversive individuals and

organizations.

The use of

the character "Revolutionary

Activities" was terminated with the implementation of the

revised Section 87, MOI.

In this connection,

the revised

Section 87, MOI, sets forth specific instructions regarding

the correct charactor to be utilized in all subversive

individual

and organization investigations. However,

various field officos continue to disrogard these

instructions

and continue to use the "Revolutionary Activities"

character.

With reference to the oral directive issued to former FBI

Director Hoover in August, 1936, by President Roosevelt, mentioned on

Page 80 of the transcript, the following is noted. Instructions received

by Mi. Hoover from President Roosevelt were recorded in two FBI

memoranda. The originals of these memoranda cannot be located

although copies are available. These communications indicated that two

separate meetings took place between the President and Mr. Hoover on

August 24 and 25, 1936, respectively.

At the first meeting the President indicated he desired to discuss

subversive activities in the United States, particularly communism and

fascism. Mr. Roosevelt expressed his keen concern over these matters

and his desire to obtain a broad picture of the general movement and its

activities as they may affect the economic and political conditions in the

United States.

The President arranged to meet with Mr. Hoover and Secretary

of State Full on August 25, 1936. At that meeting Mr. Roosevelt pointed

out he was desirous of having these investigations conducted and that, under

the Appropriations Act, the FBI would have the authority to conduct such

investigations il so requected by the Secretary ni State, A formal request

for such investigations was then made of Director Hoover by Mr. Hull.

In compliance with the wishes of the President, it was agreed this request

would not be in writing since the President desired that it be kept

confidential.

It is noted that at the meeting on August 24, 1936, the President

Indicated that he would put a handwritten memorandum in his safe at the

White House indicating he had instructed the Secretary of State to request

these investigations. The President further instrueted Mr. Hoover to advise

the Attorney General of this matter. Subsequently, Mr. Hoover recorded

that he informed the Attorney General.

We would have no objection to the foregoing information being

provided to the MCIS but it is not desired that copies of the two memoranda

in question be furnished to the Committee.

As set out on Pages 116-118 of the transcript, Mr. Maroney was

asked to provide the following material from the FBI: (a) a statement

from the FBI as to how it construes the duties imposed upon it by

Subsection (d) of Section 0. 85 (Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations);

(b) a statement from the FBI as to how it construes the duties imposed upon

It by Subsection (a) of the same Section.

With respect to the baste authority for investigative activities

of the FBi, this is generally derivea from Title 5, U. S. Code, Section

533, which authorizes the Attorney General to appoint officials to

(l) detect and prosecute crimes against the United States; (2) assist in

the protection of the person of the President; and, (3) conduct other such

investigations regarding official matters under the control of the

Department of Justice and the Department of state as may be directed

by the Attorney General.

Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, Section D. 85, sets forth

the general functions of the FBI as defined by the Attorney General.

Included is the delegation of responsibilities to the FBI under subpara-

graph (a) to investigate violations of the laws of the United States and

collect evidence in cases in which the United States is or may be a party

in interest, except in cases in which such responsibility is by statute or

otherwise specifically assigned to another investigative agency.

Additionally, Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 305%, confers upon

investigative personnel of the FBI the power to carry firearms, serve

warrants and subpoenas, and make arrests without warrants under certain

circumstances.

Accordingly, there is no question as to the FBI's jurisdiction and

authority to investigate violations of Federal statutes which impose

criminal sanctions. The FBI obviously is charged with the responsibility

to investigate violations of Federal laws such as those involving kidnaping

and bank robbery, as well as those relating to espionage, sabotage, and

sedition.

Section 0. 85 under subparagraph (d) delegates responsibilities

to the FBI to carry out the Presidential directive of September 6, 1939,

as reaffirmed by Presidential directives of January 8, 1943; July 24, 1950;

and December 15, 1953, designating the FBI to take charge of investi-

gative work and matters relating to espionage, sabotage, subversive

activities, and related matters.

The question under subparagraph (d) is not really whether the

win. wish.has.the.authority.to.investigate.crimes.against the United.states.out.

whether its authority is limited to investigating crimes after they have

occurred with no authority to perform a preventive law enforcement function.

Assistant Attorney General

The record is clear that historically law enforcement agencies

have performed the dual function of investigation of crime and crime

prevention. It would be ridiculous to believe that the FBI would be forced

to take no action until after the commission of a crime when its capabilities

would permit it to develop prior information regarding a kidnaping or a

bank robbery and thus be in a position to thwart the criminal act.

Likewise,

there have been no serious claims made that the FBI should refrain from

extensive counterespionage activities designed to identify foreign agents and

prevent the theft of vital and extremely sensitive national secrets atfecting

the security of our country.

It would seem to follow that the FBI also has the authority and the

responsibility to identity and follow the activities of individuals and groups

who secretly or publicly advocate or engage in activities which aze in

violation of laws of the United States designed to preserve the security of

this country and its citizens.

A recent decision in the Second Circult of the United States Court

of Appeals appears to be in point. In this case, the Director of the FBI.

and othere were sued in a civil action by the Fifth Avenue Peace Parade

Committee and other plaintiffs for alleged invasion of constitutional rights

and invasion of privacy. The plaintiffs complained that an FBI investigation

conducted immediately prior to the November 14-16, 1969, Moratorium

Demonstration in Washington, D. C., had a chilling effect upon the exercise

of the plaintiffs' constitutionally protected acilvity. The purpose of the

FBi's investigation in this case was to determine the number of individuals

who would be coming to Washington, their mode of transportation, time of

arrival, and to detect individuals who had a potential record of violence.

With regard to the FBI's authority to conduct the investigation,

the court said, "Beyond any reasonable doubt the Federal Bureau of

Investigation had a legitimate interest in and responsibility for the

maintenance of public saiety and order during the gigantic demonstration

planned for Washington, D. C. In fact, had it been ignored the agency

would be properly chargeable with neglect of duty." The court went on

to say no matter how peaceful the intention of the organizers the

assemblage of the vast throng planning to protest the Vietnam action and

to express their sincere and conscientious outrage, presented an obvious

potential for violence and the reaction of the Government was entirely

justifiable. The court said, "That reaction was not to deter, not to crush

constitutional liberties but to assure and to facilitate that expression and to

minimize controversy which in the end would harm the cause of the plaintiffs

more than the disruption or violence would injure the Nation." (480 F2d

328 (1972)) The court not only condoned the FBI's prior investigation of a

constitutionally protected activity, it went further by stating that the FBI

had a duty.

With respect to the discussion set out on Pages 82-84 of the

transcript regarding Executive Order 10450 (Federal Employees Security

Program), the following observations are offered:

The U. S. Supreme Court in Cole v. Young, 351 V. S. 536,

Tame lI, 1956, held that Government employees can be dismissea under

Executive Order 10450 only it they occupy sensitive positions, 1. t.,

positions affecting national security. The Attorney General by memorandum

dated June 15, 1956, advised the FBI that the Cole decision involved only

processing of removal proceedings in connection with nonsensitive positions

under Executive Order 10450 and would not have any effect on the right of

the Executive Branch to investigate its employees or applicants for employ-

ment, as heretofore. The investigative role of the FBI involving individuals

has not changed.

The results of the FBI's investigations under Executive Order 10450

are sent to the Civil Service Commission, which sends copies to the

interested agency or department, for adjudication under applicable regulations.

It is noted that Section & of Executive Order 10450 provides that it is the

responsibility of the head of each department and agency to establish and

maintain an effective program.

As a result of its recent hearings, the HCIS found that departments

and agencies have virtually abandoned the practice of post-appointment

dismissals on loyalty grounds. The Committee also called for centralized

direction in a central loyalty-security review agency for the loyalty and

security programs pointing out that functions delegated to the Attorney

General ünder Section 13 of Executive Order 10450 "are at best adyisery.

discuss updating and revising certain functions of Executive Order

10450.

In connection with Mr. Nittle's inquiry as sei out on Page 123 of

the transcript, as of March 28, 1974, the FBI was conducting full-scale

investigations concerning a total of 5% organizations and groups within the

United States on the basis of information developed indicating a possible

violation of statutes relating to internal security.

It is noted that detailed observations of this Bureau with respect to

our jurisdiction and authority in domestic intelligence

This is to recommend the attached airtel to all SACs be

sent emphasizing the importance of our comestic internal security respon-

sibilities particularly with respect to guerrilla-oriented criminal activity.

In recent years we have observed in the domestic internal

security field the rise of the urban guerrilla and the terrorist, often moti-

vated by Narxist-Leninist and related revolutionary theories and on occasion,

with ties and allegiances to foreign national ideologies. To meet this threat

we have concentrated our investigative attention on violence-prone and

terrorist oriented revolutionaries here.

The recent "first U.S. political kidnaping" of Patricia Campbel

Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) accentuates our need

to conduct continuing concentrated intelligence investications aimed at

identifying and determining the plans of

revolutionary, cerrorists who adopt

guerrilla-type tactics prosecutable under Federal and local statutes.

In the past we have witnessed two sources of revolutionary

violent action. The white revolutionary skilled in clandestine know-how who

generally targeted property and buildings for violence; and on the other

hand the black extremist-lype revolutionary who directed his violence

against individuals such as police officers. By contrast the current SLA

endeavor is multiracial and may represent a merger of the clandestine

abilities of intellectual-lype white revolutionaries with the more personal

violent propensities of black revolutionaries. Coupled with this is the

emerging practice of recruitment by revolutionaries of individuals confined

to penal institutions thus adding their criminal espertise to revolutionary

endeavors. These developments represent the possibility of an even great

thrcat in the domestic internal security fiold in the future.

INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS

In recent years we have observed in the domestic, internar

security field the rise of the urban, guerrilla and the terrorist,

Many of

these individuals are motivated by Marxist-Leninist and related theories

and an investigation has shown that they often have ties and allegiances to

foreign national ideologies. To meet this threat we have been concentrating

our investigative attention in the domestic subversive field on such

violence-prone and terrorist-oriented revolutionaries here in the United

States.

The recent "first U.S. political kidnaping" of Patricia

Campbell Hearst by the Symbionese: Liberation Army (SLA) accentuates

the need for our concentrated investigation in this area, In the past we

have wimessed on the one hand the violent action of white revolutionaries

skilied in clandestine know -how who generally targeted property and build-

ings for violence; while on the other hand biack extremist-type revolutionaries

directed their violence against individuals such as police officers. Signiti

cantly, the current SLA afair was multiracial in nature representing a

possible merger of the clandestine abilities of intellectual-type white

revolutionaries with the more personal violent propensittes of the black

revolutionary. "Coupled with this has been the emerging practice of re-

cruitment by revolutionaries of individuals confined to penal institutions

thus adding their criminal expertise to revolutionary endeavors. All of

these factors represent the possibility of an even greater threat in the

immediate future in the domestic internal security field

Airtel to SAC, Albany, et al

Fie: INTERNAL SECURITY MATTERS

Although many structured revolutionary and violence oriented

groups of the past have dirtused, the incividual extremist still exists and

in some instances has joined with others in such loose-knit clandestine "

guerrilla operations. Prime examples thereof include the SLA, members

o which have been identified as former Venceremos Organization activists

guided by the Revolutionary Union; the Black Liberation Army, which had

its origin in the Black Fanther Farty and other black nationalist groups; and

some communes in various paris of the country composed of individuals

with New Left and Marxist-Leninist backgrounds who have engaged in bomb

ings, theit of weapons and bank robberies in pursuit of revolutionary goals.

It is such individuals as these committed to violating laws through guerrilla

tactics outlined by the likes of Carlos larighella in his "Minimanual of the

Urban Guerrilla" that must ba our primary investigative targets.

Investigative aids to this end already exist and must be utilized

to the maximum by every field office, Section 122A, Item 8, Fages 6-9,

of the Manual of instructions generally sets forth identifying guidelines and

procedures for recognizing and combatting urban guerrilla-type operations.

Although this manual section is primarily aimed at black-oriented urban

guerrilla warfare, there is no restriction to utilizing these guidelines in

investigating any guerrule type operation by either black, white, nationality

oriented or multiracial conspirators. Periodic publications such as the

"IDI summary of 'Extremist Activities" and "*BI Police Bulletin" as well

as the Weatherman Photo Album, the Arab Terrorist Filoto Album and the

Extremist Photo Album are already in possession of each office and cun be

valuable background sources and investigative aids in dealing with guerrilla

activity.

It is imperative that all Agents including those working both

criminal and security matters are cognizant of and remain alert for violent

guerrilla tactics and endeavors by guerrilla-priented accivists. Each SAC

should reevaluate the nature, extent and potential of urban guerrilla problems

within his territory and insure thai commensurate with this problem appropriate

investigative attention is being given to it.

GLOSSARY OF TERMINOLOGY RELATED

Attached for approval is the yellow fle copy of a document entitled,

"Glossary of Terminology Related to Internal Security Matters," which has been

prepared as a result of the suggestion by Inspector Thomas R. Dugan, 10/25/73,

with the concurrence onAssistant Director E. S. Miller.

The suggestion indicated that the glossary should be concise and

would serve as a ready-reference source of terms encountered by Special Agents,

especially those involved in investigations of racially or ethnically oriented

extremist organizations, "new left" revolutionary organizations and "old left"

or communist revolutionary organizations, as well as of members or followers

of such groups.

While the suggestion also called for descriptions of these organiza-

tions, none were prepared inasmuch as already existing characterizations are

available in field offices in ready-reference form, and an additional set of

characterizations might be confusing, would require regular updating of the

volume, and could not be done along with the terminology in a concise form.

Also, a listing of key personnel of the above groups was omitted from the document,

although suggested, in order to avoid unnecessary updating and to keep the

document brief.

The original of the glossary is being held in the IS - 3 Section,

which will arrange for printing and distribution to the field following approval of

the yellow copy, attached.

INTRODUCTION

This glossary of terminology has been compiled as an aid

to Special Agents, especially those conducting investigations in the

field of internal security matters. While not all-inclusive in scope, it is

a ready-reference source containing a considerable number of terms

which are encountered in investigations related to racially or ethnically

oriented extremist organizations. "new left" revolutionary organizations,

and "old left" or communist revolutionary organizations, as well as to

members and followers of such organizations..

The terms and definitions thereof are related to the purposes,

ideologies, organizational setups, and activities of various groups in

the United States, some of which are under active investigation by the

FBI for possible violations of statutes related to internal security matters.

On the other hand, it should be noted that some of the terms and defini-

tions thereof have come into common use by elements beyond the scope

of FBI responsibilities.

TERMINOLOGY RELATED TO "OLD LEFTY OR

COMMUNIST REVOLUTIONARY GROUPS

ANARCHISM

A theory that all forms of government interfere with individual

liberty and are thus undesirable and should be eliminated by violence if

necessary.

BOURGEOISIE

also the middle-class. To communists, the bourgeoisie is a class enemy which

must be destroyed.

CADRE

The trusted inner circle of trained members and leaders on whom

the communist parties can depend to carry out policies and programs without any

questions or objections.

CAPITALSM

Capitalism, according to Marxist-Leninists, is an economio

system based on private ownership of property, the private control of the

means of production, and the private accumulation and use of profts. It

is regarded as a form of exploitation of one class--the proletariat or workers--

by a second one-the owners of property and the means of production.

CELL

The lowest organizational unit of a communist party.

CENTRAL COMMITTEE, ALSO REFERRED TO AS NATIONAL CENTRAL, COMMITTEE

OR POLITBURO

The leading leadership organization which conducts affairs of

communist parties between conventions.

CLASS

A section of a given population that, according to communists,

occupies a specific relation to means of production: (1) the capitalist or

bourgeoisie class which owns property and the means of production; and

(2) the wage-earners, proletariat, or working class. In highly developed

countries like the United States, there is also the "middle class" or "petty

bourgeoisie."

COEXISTENCE

(See Peaceful Coexistence)

COLLECTIVE, also CELL

The lowest organizational unit of a communist party.

COLONIALISM

The stage of capitalistic development, according to communists,

wherein capitalism captured overseas colonies in its search for markets.

Today, the word is applied by communists to almost any form of aid or influence

extended by the West to lesser developed countries.

COMMÜNE

of land and implements and common sharing of production. In communist

context, refers to a group united for revolutionary purposes, as the Paris

COMMUNISM (MARXISM-LENINISM)

A doctrine and program based on Marx, Engels, Lenin and others,

which regards history as a relentless class struggle leading eventually to -

a proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat with state owner-

ship of the means of production and control of social, economic, political, and

cultural activities by a single, authoritarian party that will eventually become

a classless society. Also known as Marxist scientific socialism.

CULTURAL REVOLUTION (GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL, REVOLUTION)

A period of internal political struggle in the People's Republic of

China (PRC) during 1966-1969; interpreted by the West as an effort by

MAO Tse-tung to consolidate his power.

DEMOCRACY

According to communists, a capitalist democracy oppresses the

workers while only after communists seize power can there be a proletarian

democracy which will be supplanted under full communism with its classless

and stateless form.

COMMUNISM (stages of development)

The first or lower stage, called socialism, is the society immediately

after the proletarian revolution. The state is needed to suppress vestiges of

capitalism and the main principle will be "from each according to his ability, to

each according to his work." In this transitory period, capitalistic characteristics

will gradually disappear and the state will "wither away" as the threshold of

the final stage, communism, will be reached with a stateless, classless society

in which the main principle will be "from each according to his ability, to

each according to his needs."

DEMOCRATIC CENTRALISM

The rigid principle that the decisions of the highest body in

a communist party (even though dominated by one man) are binding upon all

lower bodies or organizational units in the party.

DEVIATIONISM

A term used by Marxists-Leninists to identify "political errors."

A deviation from set policy and practice may result in discipline.

DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM

A doctrine stemming from Karl Marx and combining a materialistic

concept of the universe with the dialectical method, which states that there is

continual growth, change, and development in matter and the world. The

changes occur as in the dialectic (the art of reasoning) in which one idea (a

thesis) is tested against another idea (antithesis) to provide a synthesis, which

is a new idea produced by the clash of opposites inherent in the thesis and anti-

thesis and combining the best characteristics of both.

The materialistic belier and the concept of continual growth,

change, and development as applied to history is called the theory of historical

materialism. By this, communists explain that society has developed from

primitive communal forms through slave and feudal systems to the capitalistic

systemn which will, because of the inherent class struggle in that system,

later be overturned and communism will develop as the highest and final stage

of society for man.

DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT

The forcible dictatorship of a communist party whereby capitalist

opposition is crushed after the communist seizure of power and prior to

reaching the classless society of communism.

FASCISM

A political philosophy, movement, or regime standing for a one

party dictatorship, forcible oppression of the opposition, retention of private

ownership of means of production under centralized governmental control,

belligerent nationalism and glorification of war.

FRIENDS

A term used by the officials of the People's Republic of China

in referring to independent sympathetic revolutionaries as distinguished

HISTORICAL MATERIALISM

Historical materialism is the extension of the principles of

dialectical materialism to the study of history and a prediction that communism

will follow the overthrow of capitalism.

IMPERIALISM

The last stage of capitalism which develops when capital and

production become concentrated in the hands of a few individuals who practice

capitalist exploitation in colonial areas in seeking outlets for goods produced

and raw materials for manufacturing.

LABOR ARISTOCRACY

Usually, the highest paid element of the working class that has

been "bought" by capitalists.

LEFT DOGMATIST or LEFT SECTARIAN

A rigid purist in Marxist-Leninist ideology who will not sacrifice

principle, even if doing so temporarily might further long-range goals of the

revolution.

LENINISM

Development of Marx's theories on the class struggle and

revolution by Lenin into practical strategy and tactics to bring about a

revolution under leadership of a communist party.

who take support from state or private charities but who reject communism.

Because of lack of militancy, these workers are considered useless to a

communist movement.

MASS ORGANIZATION

Non-communist organizations, such as labor unions, churches,

fraternal organizations, cultural groups, peace groups, and the likes, are

the targets of Marxist-Leninists seeking to infiltrate, dominate, or indirectly

control such organizations. Marxist-Leninist endeavor to conceal their basic

affiliation while working in mass organizations to inject communist objectives.

MODERN REVISIONISM

Considered by Marxist-Leninists as the most dangerous perversion.

Modern revisionism declares Marxist-Leninism as outmoded, denies the necessity

of proletarian revolution and dictatorship of the proletariat and demands the

rejection of Leninist principles of organization and democratic centralism.

Maoists describe the Soviets as modern revisionists or social imperialists,

while the Soviets accuse the Chinese communists of distorting Marxism-

Leninism.

is advancement of the good of society; to communists, the revolution.

RE:

(Thumbnais Sketches)

Predications For Investigation

100-7254

It is desirable that no develop uniformity in the

characterization progran. Experience with the annual progsam

has shown that field's preparation of two versions of sketches

- lengthy and

abbreviated - has been time consuming and com-

pIicated without adequate compansating resuits. bong and shoxo

versions are occasionally not in agreement as to information

set forth.

Consequextly, it has been necessary, on occasion,

to instruct fleid to resubmit corrected sketches, or corrections

have been handled by ud desk and the Lield appropriatoly advised.

It appears, therelore, thnt program could be handled with greates

Lacility by preparation of a single coucise, but complete,

characterization for each organization and publication, which

could be used in SGE and appiicant-type conmunications as well

as si, IS and ali communications.

The field will continue to pre

pare sketches or each organization and publication of local

Laterest and will be instructed to resubnit sketches already

Eubmitted in dual form.

EQ substantivo suporvisors will prepare

sketchos of field wide interest. Latter sketches, which are

presently prepared by the field

and approved through HQ channels,

could then be prepared with groater lacility at HQ.

Descriptive information set sorth in a predication

for investigation of an organization is often similar to the

sharacterization of that organization.

This similarity has

caused a certain amount of contusion in the fleid, which

occasionally fails to include EQ authorized predications in

communications. A recurring error in this regard is substi

tution of the characterization for the descriptive information

concerning the organization in the predication.

This problem

can be overcone by having field utilize approved characteriz

tions of organizations interchangeably as descriptivo paragraphs

In predications of those organizations. This will simpliy fleld's

reporting requirements and insure that

predications are nain

tained in a current status, since characterizations are regularly

reviewed as to currency. Appropriato instructions will be issued

to fleid and IQ supervisors concorning implementation of

rovised charactorization program and prepazation of predications

upon approval of foregoing recommendations.

PROPOSED CHANGE IN REPORIING PROCEDURES

Reurmemo 6/28/74, recommending that for six-month trial period

we adopt summary reporting system in a number of our subversive and

extremist investigations. You recommended that at conclusion of trial

period we would resolve with U.S. Archivist whether it would be necessary

to retain full details of investigation in field office files.

Mr. Kelley inquired (1) why we do not resolve question of retention

of field files now and (2) why FBIHQ needs synopsis in these cases, i.t.,

whether we need any reports ai all. He suggested that similar practice has

already been used in certain types of cases. The following observations are

set forth in response to the Director's questions.

Question of whether we would have to retain details of investigation in

field files could be taken up with U.S. Archivist at any time, but we believe

this should be deferred until trial period is completed. Based on our experience

during this period, we may want to make certain modifications in new reportig

procedure. Thus, we will be in a better position to discuss matter with

Archives following the trial period and after any "bugs" have been ironed out

It we adopt summary-type reporting procedure permanently we can, of course,

do so regardless of the outcome of discussions with Archives. Concurrence

of latter is needed relative to issue of file retention in field but would not

preclude us from using summary procedure in any event. Under current rules;

our field offices maintain subversive and extremist files for a 20-year period

and the question of file retention is therefore not pressing.

With respect to Director's second question, it is true that in certam

criminal matters the field has not been required to submit anything to FBIHQ.

However, when dealing with security and extremist investigations, there are

considerations involved which make it mandatory that Headquarter's receive

certain essential information regarding each investigations? 16 1971

PROPOSED CHANGE IN REPORTING PROCEDURES

enforcement officers and Federal agencies, as well as private citizens, have been

requested io report information regarding subversive and related matters to the

Bureau. We, in turn, have the responsibility of correlating this data and referring

.. information of interest to other Federal agencies to them. Unless we receive basic

information from the field as to the identities of subversive and extremist individuals.

we could not fulfill this responsibility.

2-Bureau has a number of specific agreements with other Federal agencies

requiring us to furnish them with information within their areas of interest. These

include the Delimitations Agreement between the Bureau and the armed forces

intelligence agencies; a Memorandum of Understanding adopted in 1955 by the

Departments of Justice and Defense; and our agreement with Secret Service regarding

Presidential protection. The receipt of summary-type reports from the field vill enas.

us to fulfill these dissemination responsibilities, but we could not satisfy our

obligations it all information were retained in the field.

3-Executive Order 10450 (Security of Government Employee program)

specifically requires the FBI to check the names of all civil applicants and incumbents

of the Executive Branch against our records. In order to meet this responsibility

FBIrQ records must contain the identities of all persons connected with subversive

or extremist activities, together with necessary identifying information.

4-In addition to the above commitments, it is believed that we should receive

at least a summary of all subversive and extremist investigations at FBIHQ in order

to meet our overall internal security responsibilities. As indicated in your

memorandum of 6/28/74, FBIHQ supervisors do not need to follow many of these

subversive and extremist investigations in detail nor do we require reports

containing every scrap of information developed during the field inquiry. However,

FBIHQ does have a broad responsibility to recognize and follow major trends and

patterns of subversive and extremist activity; to coordinate information being reportedl

by the various field offices; and to detect and remedy any deficiencies or poor

investigative practices developing in the field. It is believed that the receipt of

summary-type reports from the field with regard to rank-and-file subversives and

extremists will allow us to carry out these functions without bogging us dovn in

meaningless detail.

ACTION: (1) This is for the Director's information.

(2) I approved, we will prepare specific guidelines and institute the

summary-type reporting procedure throughout the fick on a sis-month trial basis.

The HCIS

and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on FBI Oversight

are currently conducting extensive and continuing hearings into our intelligence

collection jurisdiction and authority. Initial reaction appears to be acceptance of

our position explaining that authority, and, at present, the respective members

of these Committees do not appear to feel that there is a need for additional legislation.

The Director has appeared before the Oversight Subcommittee and

explained our position in all three areas of intelligence collection, viz., organized

crime, foreign counterintelligence, and internal security, in executive session, and

is making public statements before the Subcommittee on these three areas seriatim.

Mr. Wannall is engaged in a continuing series of appearances before the HCIS regarding

our internal security jurisdiction, authority and operations.

Referenced 5/17/74 memo directed a memo to the Attorney General

recommending possible clarification of our internal security jurisdiction and

authority via amendment to 28 U.S.C. 533, or in the alternative, amendment to

28 C.F.R. 0.85 (a), or an executive order. This recommendation was previously

made on 8/7/73. No response to either memo has been received from the Department

Investigations of Individuals

Streamlined Reporting

This system will apply to all investigations of subversive and extremist

individuals conducted under the provisions of Sections 87 or 122 of the Manual of

Instructions with the following exceptions:

1. ADEX subjects;

2.

Individuals who within the prior year are reported to

have personally and directly engaged in subversive or

extremist activities involving violence or preparations

for violence;

3.

Individuals who within the prior year are reported to

have been actively and directly connected with hoscle

or subversive foreign elemenis;

Cases involving probable prosecution under the Federal

statutes enumerated in Sections 87 and 122 of the Manual

of Instructions;

In other cases where detailed reports have been requested

by FBIHQ or where SAC believes special circumstances

warrant preparation of detailed reports.

Streamlined reporting system will apply to the initial communication

prepared in a case as well as to subsequent communications (so long as the case

does not fall within one of the five excepted categories outlined above).

Contents of Investigative Summary

A.

Predication

The first investigative summary should begin with a concise

statement identifying the subversive and/or extremist organization(s)

with which the subject is affiliated and specifying the statute(s) upon

which the investigation is based.

Re: Subversive and Extremist

Investigations of Individuals

Streamlined Reporting

This statement should not include a narrative description of the

subversive and/or extremist organization(s) in question. Instead

the notation" (See Appendix) should follow the first reference to

each such organization. Copies of FBIQ-approved characteri-

zations should then be appended to each copy of the investigative

summary in the order they are mentioned. Each characterization

should be set out on a separate Appendix page.

In the event an organization is mentioned for which there is no

FBIH@ approved characterization, a concise characterization

should be included at the end of the investigative summary itself

(not on an Appendix page) and an appropriate notation to this effect

should follow the first mention of the group (e.g., See description

below).

B.

Background or Descriptive Data

The first investigative summary should set out sufficient back-

ground information to clearly identify the subject. This should

include subject's full name and any aliases; date and place of

birth; sex; race; marital status; citizenship status i other

than U.S.; and current residence and employment (including

occupation). Other background or descriptive data should be

included only if it is relevant to an assessment of the subject's

subversive or extremist activities or capabilities. For

example, information relating to such factors as prior military

or weapons experience, past emotional instability, or a

previous arrest record on the subject's part could be pertinent

to such an assessment and, if so, it should be included in the

investigative summary. Background data which has no bearing

on the subjeci's subversive and extremist activities or

capabilities should not be included.

HH 55027

2.

Pertinent background or descriptive data should be reported

in a succinct fashion. The identities or characterizations of

sources from whom information was secured should not be set

out, either in the investigative summary or transmittal

communication, except in unusual circumstances where common

sense dictates that FBIHQ or recipient agencies would require

the information. (As will be outlined later, such details of

reinvestigation will be incorporated in the field office file.

c.

It a photograph of subject can be obtained through reasonable

effort, two copies should be forwarded to FBIHQ, one of which

will be furnished to U. S. Secret Service headquarters. A

copy should also be forwarded to Secret Service locally.

Detailed descriptive data (including height, weight, scars and

marks, etc.) should be set out on reverse side of subject's

photograph. If no photograph is being submitted with the initial

summary, such descriptive data should be incorporated in the

summary as succinctly as possible.

Whenever FBi Identification Number is available, it should be

reported.

No effort should be made to secure handwriting or

handprinting specimens: in these cases.

If pertinent background or descriptive items are not available

when an initial summary is submitted, they should be included

in subsequent communications as they become available. Any

pertinent changes in this type data (e.go, a change of employ

ment or marital status) should be reported in the next communi-

cation submitted. Cases should not be kept in a pending status

solely to obtain or report background data unless it is needed

to make a clear-cut identification of subject.

5.

If information is available indicating that subject could be

dangerous when contacted this should be included in the investi-

gative summary in an appropriate caution statement.

Subversive and/or Extremist Activities and Affiliations

Each investigative summary should set out in concise fashion

a resume of pertinent and previously unreported information

regarding subject's subversive and/or extremist activities and

affiliations, such as:

a.

Identities of subversive and/or extremist groups or

movements (including front groups) with which subject

has been identified, period of membership, positions

Indications, through actual statements or otherwise,

Any information tending to show the subject's importance

in subversive or extremist groups, such as degree of

leadership or influence exercised, close association

The identities or characterizations of sources from whom

communication, except with respect to any item of information

which originated with sources other than those who have

furnished reliable information in the past. In latter event,

the information should be specifically attributed to the source

and an appropriate characterization included to describe the

source in the investigative summary (e.g., "a source,

contact with whom has been insufficient to establish his

reliability..."). Derogatory information initiating with

other Government agencies should aiso be specifically

attributed (e.g., "another Government agency which conducts

intelligence investigations...").

characterization should be appended to each copy of the

summary in the order they are mentioned. On organizations

for which there is no FBIH-approved characterization, a

concise characterization should be included in the summary

itself.

If subject has been interviewed, pertinent information developed

should be succinctly set forth in the investigative summary.

The investigative summary should include a property statement

and any necessary classification markings. In most instances,

however, the summarization of subversive or extremi st data

will preclude the need to classify. The investigative summary

should not indicate the status of investigaion, which is to be

shown in the transmittal letter or airtel.

II.

Contents of Transmittal Communication

A.

The transmittal airtel or letter should include pertinent information

regarding the following: office of origin; copies, including any local

dissemination made: references to prior communications; notations

as to any enclosures; any necessary justification statement if either

the investigative summary or transmittal communication is classified;

and status of case. The transmittal communication should also set

out any outstanding leads and it should call attention to any factors

which would be of particular interest to other Federal agencies, such

as individuals employed in or having access to Key Facilities or

affiliated with reserve branches of the armed forces. Refer to

Section 87 D of the Manual of Instructions for additional suggestions

along this line.

B.

Where available, the identities of subject's immediate family should

be set out in the transmittal letter or airtel together with readily

available identifying data and any information of particular interest.

transmittal communication should be accompanied by an FD-376,

appropriately filled out. This form can serve as a transmittal

communication in disseminating the investigative summary to Secret

Service, both at Headquarters and in the field.

The transmittal letter or airtel should account for any obvious gaps

in the investigation and include observations with respect to any

matters which logically require further explanation.

E. The transmittal communication should ordinarily not include the

specific identities of sources utilized; documentation regarding the

information included in the investigative summary; the identities of

Agents who conducted investigation; or information as to the investi-

gative period involved.

F.

When available, two photographs of the subject should be forwarded

as an enclosure to the FD-376. Remember to include available

descriptive data regarding the subject on the reverse side of these

photographs.

III.

Field Office File

Details of all investigation conducted, including negative contacts, must be

recorded and retained in the field office file concerning the subject. Ordinarily,

this would be accomplished through the preparation of memorandum(a) for the file

by the case Agent which would set out the identities of Agents conducting inquiries,

the names of persons or sources contacted, dates of contact, and full details of

information developed.

!

Specifically, the field office file should document information from all

confidential informants utilized during the investigation using the following format:

Identity of Source

Nature of Information

Location

The first column should identify the particular informant; e. go, SE 2000-S

or NY 1500-PSI. Under the second column there should be shown in a word or

phrase the category or categories of information originating with the informant;

e:g., "CP membership, " "attendance at PLP meeting," "revolutionary statement

by subject 5/15/73, " or "travel to Los Angeles 8/73." The third column should

indicate the file and serial number of the original recording of the information.

Where more than one category of information originated with an informant,

separate entries will be necessary in the second and third columns. For example:

Identity of Source

Nature of Information

Location

SE 1000-S

CP membership

134-1000-300,

302, 307, 310

134-1000-347

Travel to Los Angeles

• 8/73

Intraoffice memorandum (a) recording details of the investigation,

including the above-described documentation of confidential informant data, must

be prepared no later than time when the investigative summary is submitted to

FBIHC. Following preparation of such memorandum(a), the field office file may

be purged of channeling informant memoranda.

It is contemplated that this streamlined reporting system will be tested

for period 9/16/74 to 3/15/75. At the conclusion of this time, we will determine

whether to adopt the system on a permanent basis. At an appropriate time, the field

will be asked to submit its evaluation of this system including an estimate of its

impact on manpower (both Agent and clerical) and its overall effectiveness.

ALL INFORMATION CONTAINED

PURPOSE:

To recommend the establishment of a uniform policy

of handling investigations of members of subversive or extremist

organizations who are candidates for and/or elected to public office,

and to so advise the Department, Secret Service and appropriate

Bureau personnel:

DETAILS: The proliferation in candidacies for public office on the

part of members of subversive and extremist organizations currently

being investigated by this Bureau under statutory basis has created™

a serious problem. Continued investigation during the time of can-

didacy could leave Bureau open to unwarranted charges of abridging •

individual's Constitutional rights by interfering with lawful

political processes.

However,

termination of such investigations

would establish the undesirable precedent of granting investigative

immunity to subversive and extremist candidates for public office.

In the past, such matters were handled on an individual case basis.

Recent substantial increase in such candidacies, mainly by organi-

zations attemoting to generate an aura of political responsibility,

coupled with the likelihood of civil suits being filed against this

Bureau by such individuals under investigation, dictates need for

uniform field-wide handling of this type investigation.

In instances referred to above, it is recommended that a

field office, upon learning of the candidacy for public office of a

subject under investigation, should furnish FBIHQ with a dissemi-

native communication to that effect incorporating previously

unreported pertinent information concerning the activities of that

subject. In the absence of evidence indicating a vialation of a

specific Federal statute, no investigation should be conducted.

until the individual's candidacy for public office is mesolvea.

Intormation received during the period of candidacy indicatingta

specific violation of Federal law(s) should be furnished FBIHQ by

mans consistert with evirencios of situation along with recome da-

ions for additional actor merrimi, Other uneclicked attire

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

• RE ::

Security Investigations of Individuals

Extremist Investigations of Individuals

information received from informants and sources or obtained inciden-

tal to other investigations should be channeled to the individual's

file and, when appropriate, furnished to FBIHQ in disseminative

form with recommendations

; as to additional action warranted.

Results of candidacy in each instance should be furnished

to. FBIHQ.

Should the candidate have been defeated, necessary

. communication should contain recommendations as to additional

action

warranted.

Should the candidate have been successful, necessary

communication should contain statement that, in the absence of

information indicating a specific violation of Federal statute, no

additional investigation will be conducted. At such time as the

individual ceases

to serve in public office, field should submit

such information to FBIHQ accompanied by recommendations as to

-additional action warranted. Should information be received

indicating a violation of a specific Federal statute while individual

is in office, field should submit pertinent information to FBIHQ by

means consistent with the exigencies of the situation along with

recommendations as to additional action deemed warranted.

Apropos of the foregoing, FBIHQ memorandum to the

Department dated 7/3/74 and letter to all offices dated 7/17/74, both

concerning National Caucus of Labor Committees

(NCLC), advised the

Department and instructed the field along similar lines concerning

individuals holding public office.

OBSERVATIONS:

Inasmuch as the foregoing has a direct bearing on

Bureau investigations

conducted under statutory basis and could have

bearing on future litigation involving this Bureau, a memorandum

will be forwarded to the Department advising of the policy being

instituted above. As subjects of security and extremist investiga-

tions are of interest to U.S. Secret Service (USSS), a similar letter

will be forwarded to that agency.

Correspondence to. the Department

and USSS will be handled under the more descriptive title "Investi-

gations of Members of Subversive and Extremist Organizations Who Are

SUBJECT:

Revision of FBl Regulations

no or i are

This is in response to your memorandum which proposes

amending regulations governing the Federal Bureau of

Investigation so that the Bureau would be authorized to

"detect and investigate" violations of law rather than to

"investigate" violations as presently provided. 28 CER

10.85 (a).

As you note, the Attorney Coneral is authorized to

appoint officials

"to detect and prosecute crimes against

the United States"

for "investigate" in the regulations governing the Bureau.

But to use both words is to imply either (1) that "investi-

gate" means something beyond "detect"

, or (2) that

"investigate" is merely one category of activity included

within the broader term

"detect."

The first implication

would render the new regulation in excess of my statutory

"detec since I am only empowered to confer authority to

" The second implication would cast doubt upon.

the extent of the powers which the Bureau had before the

new regulation was adopted, in pursuing some matters

which are now in litigation.

It is and has been my understanding that the words

"detect" and "investigate" are equivalents for present

purposes.

see Black's Law Dictionary, Po 536 (4th ed.

1951); Worcs and Phrases, "Detection.

This was the

thrust of tle recent testimony of DAAG Maroney before the

House Commitee on Internal Security (February 20, 1974).

Though it may be possible to assign each of the words a

separate meaning, I do not consider it advisable to alter

at this point the interpretation we have adopted in the

past. It is important to maintain a record consistent with

the proposition that the Bureau has been operating under

delegation of the full powers I am authorized to confer.

Thus, whatever might have been desirable as an

original matter, in the present circumstances I think it

advisable to leave the regulations in their present form..

BACKGROUND:

The current developments in the application of rights

of privacy and general recognition of such rights by the public, as

well as pending legislation in this regard, have caused a number of

changes in the handling of our internal security investigations with

particular emphasis on the sensitive nature of these investigations.

While in New York on another matter, Assistant Director, Intelligence

Division, had an opportunity to brief appropriate personnel regarding

the sweeping changes which have been effected in the handling of

domestic security investigations.

These briefings went into detail

regarding the history of FBI jurisdiction in security investigations,

investigations and the importance and necessity for personnel to

the common goal. It is felt attendance of field personnel at these

briefings contributed to their increased morale and engendered

enthusiasm for thoughtful review of the problems the Bureau faces

in this area and hopefully would be applied in their day-to-day

investigative efforts.

It is felt these briefings should be conducted in other

key offices where there is a substantial volume of internal security

work. Set forth below are eleven offices which have consistently

exceeded 1, 300 total cases in the Security category each month according

to monthly Administrative Reports submitted. These offices would

be those offices having the greatest concentration of the Bureau's

security investigations.

Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit,

Los Angeles, Newark, New York, Philadelphia,

San Francisco, Washington Field

As noted above, appropriate personnel have already

been briefed in the New York and Washington Field Offices and because

of the volume of internal security investigations being conducted in

the other offices listed above, it is felt briefings in these offices would

serve a beneficial and worthwhile purpose. It is anticipated that the

briefings at the Baltimore and Philadelphia Offices, if approved, would

be attended by Assistant Director W. R. Wannall and Inspector

P. L. Mack, so that Inspector Mack, newly assigned as Number

Two Man in the Intelligence Division, would have the necessary

background in this area prior to handling briefings alone in three

other offices listed above. In addition to briefings at Baltimore

and Philadelphia, Assistant Director Wannall would brief the personnel

at Newark, Boston, Los Angeles and San Francisco; and Inspector

Mack would handle the briefings at Cleveland, Chicago, and Detroit.

Each of the offices would be contacted to establish a convenient date

for the proposed briefings and to determine if the particular oftice

desires any other areas in the security field be discussed.

SUBJECT: 'Gathering and Reporting Data.

Regarding Civil Disturbances

MDR-16

ALL IBI INTORMATION CONTAINED

EUREIN IS UNCLABSDYIEHD

DATE/0/5/D0 BY SPSALM/EHL

Reference is made to your memorandum to the Attorney

General dated August 6, 1974, captioned as above which enclosed

a copy of a teletype dated July 31, 1974 from your Baltimore

field office reporting a disturbance at the Glen Burnie Fair,

Glen Burnie, Maryland, July 30-31, 1974. You requested guide-

lines with regard iu gathering una reporting information con-

cerning civil disturbances and suggested that your reporting be

limited to those particular situations which are of such a

serious nature that Federal military personnel may be called

upon fox assistance.

While the Department recognizes and appreciates that the

FBI expends a significant amount of manpower in gathering and

, reporting data on civil disturbances, it also feels that the

guideline suggested is not practical. If such a criterion were

used, it would place the burden on the Bureau of determining,

at least initially, whether military personnel may ultimatcly

be needed in connection with a particular disorder.

As YOU

know, that responsibility legally rests with the Président, not

with

the FBI, and is based on the advice and information he

receives from the Attorney General.. One source of such infor-

mation would, of course, be the FBI. In only rare and extreme

situations in the country's history have Federal military forces

been requested to put down domestic disorders. More often,

National Guard units have been activated by the state to.supple.

application of the legislature or the executive, against

domestic violence.

On April 1, 1969, the President designated

the Attorney General as chief civilian officer to coordinate the

Government's response to civil disturbances. Without timely

information the president, the Attorney General, and othex

interested Government officials and agencies could not adequately

meet the constitutional responsibility to protect the nation's

security. See also, 10 U.S.C. $331, et. seg. While this power

is rarely used, it is incumbent upon the Federal government to

remain abreast of potential situations where it may be requested

or invoked.

It is our opinion that the FBI, as the investigative arm

of the Department, should continue to gather and report on

significant civil disordess throughout the country so that the

Attorney General and appropriate Government agencies may be

fully informed of all situations which may develop into major

Incidents of violence. This information should include all

significant incidents of civil unrest and should not be re-

stricted to situations where, in the judgment of the Bureau,

military personnel eventually may be used. On the other hand,

the FBI should not report every minor local disturbance where

there is no apparent interest to the President, the Attorney

General or other Government officials and agencies.

The Bureau should continue to report all disturbances

where there are indications that extremist organizations such as

the Comnunist Party, Ku Klux Klan, or Black Panther Party are

believed to be involved in efforts to instigate or exploit them.

These situations should be reported promptly and fully because

of the great potential for rapid nationwide exploitation.

AS

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Kevin I. Maroney testified

before

the Comnittee on Internal Security of the House of

Representatives on Febrüary 20, 1974;

, the viölent nature of an

organization maybe a süfficient basis for investigating so that

the Attorney General may be apprised of potential civil disturb-

ances

"Of course, any possible violations of rederal law,

such

as the anti-riot statute, 18 U.S.C. S2101, should be investigated

fully.

Regarding coverage of potential disorders, the Bureau,

" through its liaison with local and state police departments and

other law enforcement agencies, should be aware of disturbances

and patterns of disorder which would be of interest to the

President, the Attorney General, and other Government officials

and agencies, and should make timely reports of significant

disturbances, even when no specific violation of Federal law is

indicated.

such situations would cover, but would not be limited

-to, cases where (1) extremist groups or individuals are involvea

or may attempt to exploit the situation, (3) the disorder may

develop into a major disturbance, (3) it may become a matter of

national attention, (4) the disturbance or disorder is of obvious

interest to the President, Attorney General, or the Department,

:0, (5) the incident is of particular interest to the Secret

•Service in fulfilling its protective function. You should also

insure that copies of all such reports are disseminated promptly

íto the Department's Analysis and Evaluation Unit in the office

-of the Deputy Attorney General, and where appropriate, you

'shoula continue to keep local U.S. Attorneys' offices advisea.

The Department recognizes that assessing the need to re-

port information regarding civil disturbances requires some

judgment in the initial stages on the part of the Bureau's field

divisions and rBI Headquarters, and it is urged that whenever

possible the Bureau focus its reporting efforts on those incidents

and patterns of disorders which may fit the above criteria, rather

than reporting each and every relatively insignificant incident of

a strictly local nature coming to its attention.

This informative memorandum summarizes mandate from the

We wrote the Attorney General (AG) 8/14/73 asking For

guidelines to follow in gathering and reporting data concerning

civil distubances. On 3,6,74 we again wrote the AG for guidance

bui in this letter we expressed the view that our activities be

... Re: Subversive and Extremist Investigations

of Individuals

Matters of form such as copy count are to be followed

as set out in the do oi

as instructed by Headquarters in

particular invastigations.

Also, the property statement should

be attached to Investigative Summaries as was noted on page

six of referenced airtel, although erroneously omitted from

the example.

The following are problem areas which appeared most

frequently and should be clarified with appropriate personnel:

The caption "INVESTICATIVE SUMIARY" must appeal

immediatoly under the letterhead in full capital letters

and be underscored. This serves as a flag to recipients

of our dissemination and is descriptive of the information

which follows.

Regarding predications, when an Investigativo

Sunmary is the first communication for dissemination sub

mitted to FbIHO or where no previously submitted communication

for dissemination has contained a predication (by error os

some other reason), the Investigative Surmary must bagin wich

a predication.

The predication

should be a concise statement

of the specific statutes upon which the investigation is based

and identify the subversive and/or extremist organization or

activity in which the subjoct is involved.

The laiter data

was noted as being frequently onitted in Investigative

Summaries received at FBItO.

Utilize "(see appendix)"

following the ficse reference to each subversive or extrenisc

organization mentioned in the predication and any other such

organization nentioned laver in the Investigative Summary.

Because of the succinct nature of Investigative

Summaries, care must be taken to avoid mattributed opinions

not supporiod by facts.

This critique can apply equally vell

to Reports and letterhead Memoranda.

avoided. II the opinion is pertinent, the Invescigative

Summary should identify who had the opinion, i.e., a specifio

organization's leader or member.

If the facis

creating the

opinion or consideration are know, the facts should be

succinctly set out.

What must be avoided is conveying the

thought that it was the FeI's opinion or consideration.

It is incumbent upon field supervisors to see that

Agents preparing Investigative Summaries are avare of the

general guidelines.

It has been noted that several communi

cations have been sent the FBIIO labeled Investigative Summary

which were nothing more than xegular Letterhead Memoranda.

This type of situation merely diminishes any good wich

precedent for all future Investigative Sunnaries prepared

by the Agent or patterned after his work product.

Field Supervisors are encouraged to raise any questions

or call attention to any apparent problems with this streamlined

reporting.

Additionally, considerations and comments are re

quested regarding the errect investigative summaries have

INTERAGENCY INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE MEETING

I am sure you gentlemen will all agree with me

that our meeting with the President on Friday was of very

special significance. The President clearly recognizes

that we are confronted today with unique and complex problems

arising from subversive activities on an international scale.

There is a distinct relationship between these activities and

much of the disorder and violence which increasingly

threatens our internal security. The President made it.

abundantly clear that he expects us, as members of the

intelligence community, to do more than we have been doing

to bring the worldwide picture of these problems into better

perspective for him.

Having been designated by the President as Chairman

of the Committee to meet this challenge, I feel a special

responsibility. First, I would like to state that I agree

completely with the President's view of the situation.

Соп-

sider what has transpired in the 1960s.

We have witnessed

the emergence of widespread racial unrest which threatens

to grow much worse before it gets better.

the emergence of a new left militancy which has consituted

massive mob rule in action. From what we have learned to date

at 101: 210m ht mẻ a

We have also seen

it is apparent these are not solely domestic problems. There

are definite foreign links to our domestic disorders.

Yet, the föreign aspect of the problem is different

than that which we experienced in the past. Prior to the

1960s, foreign-directed intelligence and espionage activities

constituted the main threat to our security.

We in the

intelligence community geared ourselves accordingly and met

that problem successfully.

We coordinated our activities in

doing so. But the nature of the problem pas such that it

left us to a marked degree free to operate independently in

Today, it is mandatory that we recognize the changed

nature of the problem confronting us. Unless we do so, we

will be incapable of fulfilling the responsibility levied

upon us by the President.

The plain fact is that there currently are thousands

of individuals inside this country who want to see our form of

government destroyed. They have in fact pledged themselves

publicly to achieving this goal. They have put their words.

into actions constituting revolutionary terrorism, and the

total effect of their actions to date has been disasterous.

In addition, they are reaching out seeking support

from this nation's enemies abroad to further their objectives.

Thus the links to Cuba, China, and Iron Curtain countries

already have been established

and promise to grow because of

the equal determination of various international communist

elements to destroy our form of government.

In contrast to the rigidly structured subversive

organizations of past experience, the current

subversive

forces threatening us constitute widespread, disjointed, and

varied autonomous elements, the destructive

potential of which

is manifold.

Individually, those of us in the intelligence

community are relatively small and limited.

Unified, our

own combined potential is magnified and limitless. It is

through unity of action that we can tremendously increase

our

intelligence-gathering potential and, I am certain, obtain

the answers the President wants.

I am establishing a working committee to insure

that we achieve the desired unity.

It will be the job of the

committee to (1) assess the overall nature of the problem as

we know it today, (2) examine individually and together the

respective resources of each Agency to insure full utilization

of them for the benefit of all, and (3) devise coordinated

procedures designed to penetrate the current nebulous areas

of subversive activities here and abroad as they relate to

our domestic problems.

The first meeting is set for tomorrow afternoon,

Tuesday, June 9th, and you have been furnished the details

as to the time and place.

The working committee will hereafter meet each

Tuesday and Friday for the purpose of preparing a comprehensive

study to be completed in rough draft form by June 22, 1970,

for presentation to the President on July 1, 1970; in final

form.

This should serve as the foundation of our committee's

existence and purpose and as the basis for a coordinated

intelligence effort best suited to serve the country's

interest at this time of crisis.

This memorandum is to record meeting of captioned Committee

to

the President at the

Section Chief George C. Moore and myself.

The Director pointed out to the Committee that the

President, in establishing this special intelligence Committee,

recognized definite problems arising from subversive activities

on

the international scale and expected the Committee to coordinate and

plan so that the worldwide picture could be better brought into

perspective for the President.

recognized the importance of the work of this Committee and he stated

that along with organized crime this is equally important.

The Director further commented concerning the foreign aspect

of today's subversive domestic problem and stated that prior to the

1960's, the main threat to our security was foreign-directed intelli-,

gence

espionage activities but today we have a different problem

marked by highly organized dissident groups seeking to destroy our

form of Government.

In outlining the work of the Committee, the Director pointed

out:

(1)

The situation should be thoroughly explored to determine

exactly what the problem is.

(2) Each agency must explore the

facilities which must and can be used in order to develop facts

a true intelligence picture.

so that the President can make a decision as to which ones should be

utilized. (3)

The Director stated it was most important that the

foreign connections of domestic problems be determined pointing out

thạt we know Cuba, Red China and the Soviet-bloc are deeply in the

picture. The Director also commented the importance of ascertaining

what is happening in foreign countries concerning this same subversive

problem and how it has been dealt with by those countries; for

example, the Director mentioned that the water cannon had been used

nost effectively against the hippies in paris,

and maybe the application of this tactic should receive consideration.

application on this tact.

as well as elsewhere

In this regard, the Director commented the picture of what goes on

abroad would more appropriately come within the purview of the CIA,

DIA and NSA.

The Director stated he was establishing a working sub-

committee headed by Assistant Director William C. S

Sullivan and

composed of designated representatives of the other agencies present

andthe first meeting would be at 3:30 pm, 6/9/70 at the U. 'S.

The Director

emphasized it was most vital that all agencies give this matter top

priority.

Following the Director's initial remarks, those officials

present commented that the aims and goals presented by the Director

were realistic and that all present would cooperate in the fullest

in getting organized and getting on with the highly important task

which faces the special Committee.

During the discussion all agreed that the initial primary

problem facing the Committee was to concentrate upon methodology in

This memorandum records the results of the Working.

Subcommittee meetine on June 9. 1970.

Mr. Tom C. Huston, hite House, spelled out the desires

of the President, furnishing members with a "Top Secret" outline

(copy attached).

This outline addresses itself to the Purpose,

Membership,

Procedures, and Objectives of the Committee's Review.

In his oral presentation, Huston emphasized the President was not

interested in being told

what the current problem is, but rather

what the future problems will be and what must be done to counter

them.

He stressed the Committee should provide the President with

the pros and cons of any restraints so that he can decide what

action is to be taken.

It was agreed that all papers and reports prepared by

the Committee will be classified "Top Secret - Handle Via Comint

Channels Only" because of the President's desire that the existence

and work of the Committee be tightly controlled. (The reference to

Comint Channels refers to communications intelligence and insures

that this matter will be handled in a secure manner.)

the necessary intelligence.

In accordance with the President's

instructions, the next meeting of the

Working Subcommittee will

consider all restraints restricting intelligence collection efforts

across the board, as well as submissions on defining and assessing

the existing internal security threat, both domestic and foreign.

It was agreed that the Working Subcommittee would next

meet at 1:30 p.m., June I2, 1970, in the Conterence Room of the

U.S. Intelligence Board.

HEBTING OF THE WORKING SUBCO-MITTEE DUNE 14, 1970

This memorandum records the results of the Working

Subcommittee.

At the meeting of June 12, 1970, the Committee agreed

"Ion an outline for the report to be furnished to the President

by July 1,. 1970.

'Of interest:

(a) an assessment of the current internal security

threat along with the likelihood of future violence; (b) a

listing of the current restraints which deter the development

of the type of information the President desires; (c) an

evaluation of interagency coordination.

With regard to an assessment of the current internal

security threat, the Committee agreed the President does not

desire a recitation of history but rather desires information

as to what the problem is and an estimate of what the future

problen will be.

The White House representative advised the restraints

portion of the Committee report to the President should include,

in addition to identifying the restraints and a listing of the

pros and cons oi removing or modify the cestraints, a briel

paragraph allowing the President to indicate what action he

desires be taken. Specifically, this would provide the President

the opportunity to indicate whether he desired the restraints

to be continued, relaxed, or that he needed additional infor

nation upon which to make a decision. It was the sense of the

Committee regarding the third portion of the report that a

permanent operations

committee was needed to coordinate operations,

prepare estimates of potential violence during future demonstra

tions, and to develop new policies. The creation of such a

committee was endorsed by the White House representative who

indicated such a committee would probably be desired by the

President.

In two previous meetings of the above-captioned committee

general discussions took place and the ground work was prepared for

dealing with the substance of the report. Yesterday, a third

"neeting was held which extended throughout the afternoon and into

the early evening.

Memoranda has been prepared and submitted to

the Director on the previous two meetings.

Yesterday, the members

of the four intelligence organizations worked out the

received the impression that Admiral Noel Gaylor of National Security

Memorandum to Mr. C. A. Tolson

RE:

INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON

INTELLIGENCE

OBSERVATIONS:

If committee agreement is not reached at Tuesday's

meeting on the controversial points involved, it would appear

we have four possible courses of action:

(1)

We can offer no objection to the report and

wait to

see what the President decides. (I think this would

be unwise.)

(2) The Director can voice his objections to the

President verbally.

(3) The Bureau can take a position in writing in the

report opposing any relaxation of the investigative restraints

discussed on the grounds that the arguments supporting these

restraints outweigh the arguments opposed.

(4) The Bureau can take a position in writing in the

report that it is opposed to the extensive scope and ramifi-

cations of the proposed new committee, while at the same time

noting that we would have no objection to a committee which

would be limited to meeting periodically in order to effect a

better operational coordination among member agencies with

regard to particular targets in the intelligence field.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) That approval be given for the Bureau to include

in the final committee report a statement opposing the

relaxation of investigative restraints which affect. the Bureau.

(2) That the Bureau take a position at Tuesday's

meeting of the working committee that it is opposed to a new

committee of the scope described in the attached draft. but

that we would not object to

a committee limited to better

coordination specific intelligence operations or problems.

(ESTABLISHED BY THE PRESIDENT, JUNE 5, 1970)

The final meeting of the working committee was

held on 6-23-70 and there is attached a proposed final draft

of a report for the Director's review.

During the final working committee session, a

number of changes were made in the prior draft which the

Director has seen. Significant changes include the following:

1. Two of the investigative restraints previously

listed have now been completely eliminated.

These related

to investigations involving clearance with

State Department

regarding diplomatic personnel and surreptitious optical

surveillances.

2. The FBI's objections to the six remaining

restraints have been

spelled out specifically in appropriate

footnotes which include the basis for our position.

In

addition, some of the key wording in the narrative has been

modified

in accordance with the observations the Director

made to me Monday. For instance, the term "restrictions"

in the decisions section relating to electronic surveillances

(page 28) has been changed to "procedures." In the same

write-up (page 26), reference to electronic surveillances

having been

"substantially reduced in recent years"

has been

taken out.

3. In the section dealing with evaluation of

interagency coordination (pages 42-43);, the reference to

restrictions on FBI and CIA Headquarters liaison contacts.has

been removed and the specific reference

the proposed chairman of

4. The prior draft contained a number of

proposals relative to a permanent interagency committee

including a full-time working group staffed by the various

intelligence agencies. In the proposed final draft, these

proposals have been

toned down somewhat and the proposed

full-time working group is mentioned only in passing as

a possible future eventuality*

In fact,

after considerable

discussion the wording of this whole section was framed

with a View of eliminating any suggestion that the

proposed interagency committee would interiere with the

internal operations of any individual agency. In addition,

a footnote was added expressing the Bureau's specific

views. concerning any such committee orgroup.

5. The section on budget and manpower

restrictions (pages 40-41) was revised to make it clear

that the FBI does not have any problem with regard

to review and approval of its budgetary requests.

Copies of this proposed final draft are being

furnished to the member agencies for their review so

that all interested parties will be fully cognizant of its

contents

in advance of the final meeting of the

Director's Committee in his office at 3 p.m., Thursday,

June 25, 1970.

Those present will be Mr.

CIA; Lt. General D. V. Bennett, DIA; and Vice Admiral Noel Gaylor,

NSA. Each man will no doubt be accompanied by an aide.

ACTION:

Upon approval, this report will be printed ano

assembled and then delivered to the Director's Office with

a transmittal letter to the President in time for the

Director's meeting. Due to the extremely sensitive nature

of the report, each copy is being numbered and a record

will be kept of each recipient.

The Director will note that

at the beginning of the President's copy there will be a

form to be signed by each agency's head indicating aporoval

of the report.

but eliminated, a footnote was not taken regarding this item.

SUBJECT: INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (AD HOC)

Pursuant to the request of Acting Director Ruckelshaus,

I contacted Mr. J. Fred Buzhardt, Special Assistant to the

President on 5/17/73.

Mr. Buzhardt requested our co-operation in providing him

with a comprehensive outline of the history and activities of the

Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc). A copy of the

"Special Report" prepared by this Committee was found among

highly sensitive material in the papers of former Special Counsel

to the President John Dean.

A detailed review has been made of Bureau files in this matter.

In summary, the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc) was

established under the chairmanship of former Director Hoover

following a conference between Mr. Hoover and President Nixon on

6/5/70. Its purpose was to make recommendations for the more

effective coordination of the intelligence gathering efforts of the FBI,

Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA),

and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and to examine existing

limitations on the use of certain intelligence collection techniques.

Members of the Committee included CIA Director Helms, Director

Gayler of NSA, Director Bennett of DIA and White House Staff Assistant

Tom Huston.

Following a number of sessions of a working subcommittee

headed by Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan of the Bureau, the

Committee issued a 43-page "Special Report" which was delivered to

the White House on 6/26/70. This report summarized the internal

security threat facing the United States, reviewed limitations on

intelligence collection and suggested measures to improve the co-

ordination of domestic intelligence collection by the various Agencies.

It was approved and signed by the head of each member agency

Memorandum to Mr. Felt •

Re: INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (AD HOC)

By memorandum 7/23/70, Mr. Huston advised that the

President had reviewed the "Special Report" and had reached

certain decisions. According to Huston, the President desired

a relaxation of restraints in a number of areas and the creation

of a permanent interagency committee on domestic intelligence.

A copy of Huston's memorandum, along with pertinent

background information, was sent to Attorney General Mitchell

by letter 7/27/70. Mr. Mitchell was requested to furnish a prompt

expression of his views and was advised the FBI was taking no action

to implement the instructions contained in Huston's memorandum

pending his reply. The Attorney General's attention was called to

Mr. Hoover's opposition to the lifting of various investigative

restraints and to the creation of a permanent interagency committee

on domestic intelligence. The letter noted, however, that the FBI

was prepared to implement White House instructions at Mitchell's

direction.

The restraints referred to in the "Special Report" included

limitations on the use of electronic surveillance of foreign establish-

ments, the use of student informants on college campuses, covert

and overt coverage of the mail, and surreptitious or illegal entry

(so-called "bag jobs").

Our file does not show any further developments subsequent

to the 7/27/70 letter to AG. There is no indication Mitchell ever

responded to this communication or that any further action was

taken by FBI.

However, it is the recollection of knowledgeable personnel

that, on instructions which apparently originated with Mr. Hoover's

office, the original of Huston's memorandum of 7/23/70 was

returned to Huston about 7/30/70. It was the understanding of

supervisors handling this matter at the time that a converstation

had taken place between Mr. Hoover and Mitchell; and that Mitchell

had reached an understanding with Mr. Haldeman at White House

that the Huston memorandum would be returned without any

acknowledgement or action being taken with the entire matter

being a closed issue. No documentary evidence exists to support

the foregoing.

Memorandum to Mr. Felt

Re: INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE (AD HOC)

In any case, Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc)

was terminated on 6/25/70 upon approval of its report.

It is noted that former Assistant Director W. C. Sullivan

might have additional information concerning this matter,

particularly regarding the basis for our returning Huston memorandum

of 1/23/70 to the White House with no action being taken thereon.

We are not recommending, however, that Sullivan be interviewed

at this time. It is felt this should be left to the discretion of the

White House and/or the Department.

ACTION:

Attached is a letter to Assistant Attorney General Petersen

of the Criminal

Division advising him of Mr. Buzhardt's

request. We are providing Petersen with a letterhead memorandum

(attaching copies of pertinent communications from our files)

which summarizes the work of the Interagency Committee on

Intelligence (Ad Hoc). Mr. Petersen is being asked to advise

whether the Department has any objection to our providing this

data to Mr. Buzhardt at the White House.

Providing the Department interposes no objection, we will

immediately furnish Buzhardt with this information following a

response from Petersen.

INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON INTELIGENCE

(AD HOC)

Federal Bureau of Investigation (EBI) files disclose the

following information regarding the captioned Committee:

During a conference with President Nixon on June 5, 1970,

FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was appointed chairman of a special committea

to coordinate more eifectively the intelligence-gathering efforts of the FBI,

the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the National Security Agency (NSA) ,

and the Defense Intelligencs Agency (DIA) so as to assure that the President

tras being furnished a comprehensive picture ci subversive activities.

Present at the time of Hr. Hoover's meeting with the President were CLA

Director Richard Helms; NSA Direcior Vice Admiral Noel Cayler, General

Donald V. Bennett, Director of the DIA; and Nr. Tom C. Huston, White

House Stait Assistant; all of whom were designated by the President to

serve on the special committee. Also present were Presidential Assistants

H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichnan, and Secretary Robert H. Finch

of the Department oi Health, Education, and Welfare.

An initial meeting of the Interagercy Committee on intelligence

(Ad Hoc) was held in Mir. Hoover's office on June 8, 1970. This meeting

was attended by Mr. Helms, Vice Admiral Gayler, General Bennett, and

Mr. Huston. Mr. Hoover stressed the President's keen interest in this

matter and outlined the general objectives of the Committee. He instrueted

that a working subcommittze be established, composed of representatives

of all of the member agencies and headed by Assistant Director William C.

Sullivan of the FBI.

This working subcommittee subsequently held a series of

meetings beginning June 9, 1970. At the initial meeting of this group,

Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad Hoc)

It was agreed that all papers and reports prepared by the

Committee would be classified "Top Secret - Handle Via Comint Channels

Only" in view of the President's desire that the work of the Committee be

tightly controlled, and since the Committee report would be based in

part on Comint data.

-

During subsequent meetings of the working subcommittee,

representatives of each member agency submitted written material for

use in compiling the report being prepared for the President. Detailed

discussions took place regarding this material, and a drait report was

prepared. The final meeting of the working subcommittee was held on

June 23, 1970, at which time a consensus was reached on a final draft

of the report to be issued by the Interagency Committee. This "Special

Report," which was dated June, 1970, and numbered 43 pages, was

signed and approved by the heads of each member agency at a final

meeting of the Committee held in Mr. Hoover's office on June 25, 1970.

A copy of the report was delivered to Mir. Huston at The White House

on June 26, 1970, with a brief transmittal letter dated June 25, 1970,

addressed to the President by Mir. Hoover. A copy of this letter is

attached. (Attachment 2)

The "Special Report" was divided into three main sections.

Part One set forth a summary of the internal security threat. Part Two

summarized limitations on certain intelligence collection techniques

(e•E•, electronic surveillance coverage of foreign establishments) and

cited advantages of maintaining such restrictions as well as the advantages

of relaxing them.. Part Three consisted of a brief evaluation of interagency

cooperation together with suggested measures to improve the coordination

of domestic intelligence collection.

By White House memorandum dated July 23, 1970, addressed

to Mir. Hoover, with copies for the President and Mr'. Haldeman, Mr. Huston

advised that the President had carefully studied the "Special Report" and

had made certain decisions with respect to the issues raised therein.

A copy of Mr. Huston's memorandum is attached. (Attach-

also attached an undated memorandum outlining the organization and

responsibilities of an interagency group on domestic intelligence and

internal security which the President had ordered be established. A

copy of this memorandum is also attacheci. (Attachment 4)

Following receipt of this memorandum, the FBI directed a

• letter dated July 27, 1970, to Attorney General Mitchell, furnishing him

with pertinent background facts regarding the interagency Committee on

Intelligence (Ad Hoc) and providing him with a copy of Mr. Huston's

communication. This letter stressed Mir. Hoover's opposition to the

lifting of various investigative restraints as well as to the creation of

a perinanent interagency committee on domestic intelligence; but it noted

that the Bureau was prepared to implement White House instructions at the

Attorney General's direction… The memorandum requested a prompt

expression of Mitchell's views concerning the matter and noted that the

FBI would take no action to impiement the June 23, 1970, White House

communication pending the Attorney General's reply. A copy of the

Bureau's letter of July 27, 1970, is attached. (Attachment 5)

The FBI file in this matter does not show any further,

developments subsequent to the July.27, 1970, letter to the Attorney

cine

General. There is no indication that Mitchell ever responded to this

communication or that any further action was taken by the FBI.

However, it is the recollection of knowledgeable FBI

personnel that, on instructions which apparently originated with

Vir. Hoover's office, the original of Mr. Huston's memorandum of July 23,

1970, was returned to ruston on about july 30, 1970. It was the under-

standing of supervisors handling this matter at the time that a conversation

had taken place between Mr. Hoover and Attorney General Mitchell; and

that Mitchell had reached an understanding with Mr. Haldeman at The White

House that the Huston memorandum would be returned without any

acknowledgement or action being taken thereon, with the entire matter

being a closed issue. It is stressed, however, that no documentary

evidence exists to support the foregoing.

In any event, the Interagency Committee on Intelligence (Ad

Hoc) was terminated on June 25, 1970, upon approval of its report to

the President.

INTERAGENCY COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

There is enclosed a copy of a letter dated July 23,

1970, with attachment, addressed to me from Mir. Tom Charles

Huston, White House Presidential Assistant.

For your information, on June 5, 1970, the President

established an ad hoc interagency committee on intelligence chaired

by me and also inclucing the Directors of the Central Intelligence

Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the National Security

Agency. Mr. Huston served in a liaison capacity with the committee.

This committee was requested by the President to submit a report

assessing the current internal security threat, providing an evaluation

of intelligence collection procedures, identifying gaps in our present

collection efforts with recommended measures to close such gaps,

and reviewing current procedures for interagency coordination with

recommended steps to improve such procedures.

The final report of this committee was completed on

June 25, 1970, and delivered to the Fresident. This report set forth

eight specific areas (corresponding to the eight numbered paragraphs

in the attached letter from Mr. Huston) which had been reviewed by

the committee. The first six related to current restraints on intel-

ligence collection procedures; the seventh was concerned with budget

and manpower needs in the event the various restraints were relaxed;

and the eighth area dealt with the possible establishment of a permanent

interagency committee on comestic intelligence. In each area the

report of the committee was presented to show the advantages and

disadvantages of any changes in current policies and also to allow

the President to indicate his desires.

As set out in the attached letter from Mr. Huston,

it is noted that the President has directed the relaxation of four

investigative restraints directly aliecting the responsibilities of

the TBI. These include:

1. Intensified use of electronic surveillances and

penetrations to effect coverage of individuals and groups in the

United States who pose a major threat to the internal security, as

well as foreign nationals and diplomatic establishments in the United

States of interest to the intelligence community. In this connection,

in the report presented to the President on June 25, 1970, I made

clear the FBI's opposition to the relaxation of our present policy

of selected coverage on major internal security threats through

the use of this technique. I pointed out that the FBI believes

electronic surveillance coverage is adequate at this time, but

that we would not object to other agencies seeking the authority of

the Attorney General for any coverage required by them and there-

atter instituting such coverage themselves.

2. Removal of instructions on legal mail coverage

and relaxation of covert mail coverage to permit use of this technique

on selected targets of priority foreign intelligence and internal security

interest. In this connection, in the report of June 25, 1970, I made

clear the FBI's strong objection to implementing any covert mail coverage.

It is the FBI's position that if covert mail coverage is implemented,

it is likely that information would leak out of the post office to the

press and that serious damage would be done to the intelligence

community because of the very nature of this coverage. We haye no

objection to legal mail coverage, provided it is used on a carefully

controlled and selective basis in both criminal and security matters.

3. The removal of restraints on the use of surreptitious

entry to permit the procurement of vitally needed foreign cryptographic

material and against other urgent and high priority targets. In the

A COMENT CHAI

The Attorney General

report of June 25, 1970, the FBI was clearly on record as being

opposed to the surreptitious entry of embassies for the purpose of

obtaining cryptographic materials, because the increase in the

number of police guarding these embassies increases the operational

hazards involved. I would like to point out further that the FBI no

longer is equipped to canduct such operations against foreign embassies.

Accordingly, in the event this technique should be employed against

foreign embassies in the future, I feel strongly that it should be

implemented by the particular agency requiring its use, and not loy

the FBI.

4. An increase in coverage of violence-prone campus

and student-related groups and the removal of all restraints which

Limit such coverage. In the report of June 25, 1970, the FBI specifically

objected to removing any of the present controls and restrictions

relating to the development of campus sources. It was pointed out

that to relax these restrictions would severely jeopardize our inves-

tigations and could result in leaks to the press which would be

damaging and which could lead to charges that investigative agencies

are interfering with academic freedom.

In connection with the proposed establishment of a

permanent interagency committee on domestic intelligence, in the

report of June 25, 1970, I specifically made clear my opposition to

such a committee while pointing out that the FBI would approve of

preparing periodic domestic inteiligence estimates.

Despite my clear-cut and specific opposition to the

lifting of the various investigative restraints referred to above and

to the creation of a permanent interagency committee on domestic

intelligence, the FBI is prepared to implement the instructions of

the White House at your direction. Of course, we would continue to

seek your specific authorization, where appropriate, to utilize the

various sensitive investigative techniques involved in individual cases.

The President is aware that procedural problems may

arise in the course of implementing these decisions. However, he is

anxious that such problems be resolved with maximum speed and

minimum misunderstanding. Any difficulties which may arise should

be brought to my immediate attention in order that an appropriate

solution may be found and the President's directives implemented in

a manner consistent with his objectives.
