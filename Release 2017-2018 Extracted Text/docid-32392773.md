The attached suggested draft to

De Mohrenschilat was written without

knowledge.gf the flavor of your personal

relationship with him.

The tone may not

be appropciate, but the message boils

down to the fact that neither CIA nor

in Mr

De Mohrenschildt for a number of

years.

This draft was coordinated with OGG

Director of Central Intelligence

John H. Waller

Inspector General

Mr. George de Monrenschildt

de Mohrenschildt's letter to you,

dated 5 September 1976

Action Required:

None.

This memorandum is for your information.

We have also

attacied at A a suggested draft reply.to.Mr. de Mohrenschildt's letter.

Action Taken:

We have reviewed DDO and IG files on Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

addition, at our request, the CI Staff has run Agency traces on him and

has been in touch with the FBI as well.

Findings:

3. There is voluminous material on Mr. de. Mohrenschildt in CIA

fries, most of it dating from the post-Kennedy assassination period

when he testified before the Warren Commission on his acquaintance

with tir. and Mrs. Lee Harvey Oswald. (A copy of the de Mohrenschildts'

testimony is attached at B.)

The bulk of the material in our files consists of FBi reports,

the most recent of which is dated 1967.

The FBI has informed CIA that

it has no traces on Mr. de Mohrenschildt beyond that date; our files

contain all of its previous material on him.

Mr. Helms' 3 june 1964 memorandum for the Warren Commission on

the de Mohrenschildts' is attached at C.

it describes the Agency's

interest in obtaining reports from Mr. de Mohrenschildt in 1957 as a

result of his sojourn in Yugoslavia that year.

Contaci Division

(now

Domestic Coliection Division - DCD) had its resident

agent in Dallas,

Mir. J. Walton Moore, contact Mr. de Mohrenschiidt

at that time.

The

history of Mr. Moore's relationship with Mr. de ohrenschildt

from 1957

to 1961 is also attached at C. As a routine matter, Mr. Moore requested

traces on fir. de Mohrenschildt.

The trace results (attached at D) con-

tained sufficient derogatory information to preclude further extensive

contact with the de Monrenschildts.

(An OS summary on Mr. de Mohrenschildt

prepared in response to the current request is also attached at D.)

Our files show that a mail cover was placed on letters: addressed

to Mr. de Mohrenschildt c/o the U.S. Embassy in Haiti from about 1964 to

1966:

(This was probably not uncovered at the time of the external in-

vestigations.) This included opening and photographing the contents of

some

letters by the CIA Station there. The results of this operation

were shared with the FBI.

Mr. de Mohrenschildt came to the attention of this office during

the Rockefeller Commission investigations.

We were asked to respond to a

memorandum submitted to the Commission by Mr. Paul Hoch entitled "CIA

Activities and the Warren Commission Investigation."

Mr. Hoch called for

an identification of Mr. J. Walton Moore's employment affiliation and

asked what Mr. Moore knew about Oswald and what he may have told Mr. de

Mohrenschildt about him. Our reply to the Rockefeller Commission is

The most recent information we have on Mr. de Mohrenschildt comes

from Mr. J. Walton Moore who was contacted in May and July 1976 by writers

connected with the Reader's Digest, and with the Dial Press and the Dell

Publishing Company.

Both writers

questioned Mr. Moore about Oswald and

Mr. de Mohrenschildt.

Mir. Moore's reports on these contacts are attached

Conciusions:

Mr. de Mohrenschildt appears to have lead an adventurous and

colorful life as a petroleum engineer and businessman.. He is both well

and

poorly connected,

and some of his associations in the past have

raised serious questions.

Certainly his relationship with the

Oswalds has caused him considerable trouble and may have caused this

Agency and the FBI to spend more time and energy on him in the past

than was necessary.

10.

Both the FBl and this Agency, however, had dropped their

interests in. Mr. de Mohrenschildt's activities

by the mid-to-late

1960's. We speculate that any attention he is now receiving could

either be from local authorities in Dallas or from media representa-

tives

on the trail of a warmed over story concerning the assassination

of President Kennedy. We offer no proof of this conjecture beyond

Mr. Moore's reports attached at F.

What we can say is that we have

found no

indication that either CIA or the FBI has taken any active

interest in Mr. de Mohrenschildt in recent years.

Dear George:

Please forgive the delay in my reply to your September 5th letter.

It took time

to explore thoroughly the matters you raised.

Let me say first that I know it must have been difficult for you

to seek my help in the situation outlined in your letter.

can appreciate your state of mind in view of your daughter's tragic

death a few years ago and the current poor state of your wife's health.

I was extremely sorry to hear of these circumstances.

In your situation, I can well imagine how

the attentions you

described in your letter affect both you and your wife.

However, my

staff has been unable to find any indication of interest in your

activities on the part of Federal authorities in recent years.

flurry of interest that attended your testimony before the Warren

Commission has long since subsided. I can only speculate that you

may have becone "newsworthy" again in view of the renewed interest

in the Kennedy assassination and, thus, may be attracting the atten-

tion of people in the media.

I hope this letter has been of some comfort to you, George,

although I realize I am unable to answer your question completely.

Thank you for your good wishes on my new job.

As you can imagine,

I'm finding it interesting and challenging.

Very truly yours;

Georgé Bush
