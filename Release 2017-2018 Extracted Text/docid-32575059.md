On July 21, 1958, PCI Arthur Newman (conceal), Credit

Manager of the gambling casino at the Hotel Nacional, advised that

MANNARINOS presently have any gambling interests in Cuba.

large sum of money in Cuba in the old Sans Souci Night Club operation

and that he had no intention of investing more money in gambling

operations in Cuba in the near future.

Source noted that in the

past the MANNARINOS have shipped slot machines to Cuba. Sourçe

believed that most of these shipments have been through ALBERTO

ARDURA, MOYA.

Source, noted that ARDURA is the "bag man" for?

ROBERTO FERNANDEZ/ MIRANDA, the brother-in-law of Cuban President,

Cut FULGENCIO BATISTA.

Source said that since FERNANDEZ MIRANDA receives

50% of the "take"

from all slot machines operating in Cuba, ARDURA

control of the slot machines.

Havana sources have been instructed to be on the alert

for any information that the MANNARINOs have gambling

interests

in Cuba. (8742)
