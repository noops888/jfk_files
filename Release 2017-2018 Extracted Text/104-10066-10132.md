DIRECTOR 323590

STATION HAS NO OBJECTIONS TO CONTACTING KDAFGHAN/1

(K/1) AND TO SOLICITING MIS AGREEMENT TO SUBMIT TO SCA

INTERVIEW. BEFORE DOING SO, HOWEVER, WE WOULD LIKE TO CLARIFY

A FEW POINTS WHICH MAY HAVE A BEARING ON HOW WE PROCEED. FIRST,

KI1 WORKS FOR A U.S. FIRM AFFILIATE (BERLITZ).

WILL ANY PARENT

COMPANY APPROVALS BE REQUIRED FOR US TO CONTACT K/1 AND SERVE

AS MSCA MIDDLE-MAN? SECOND, K/1 MAY HAVE TO REQUEST LEAVE FROM

HIS EMPLOYER TO TRAVEL FOR INTERVIEW.

IF THIS SHOULD BE THE

CASE, CAN WE AUTHORIZE HIM TO INFORM HIS EMPLOYER OF THE REASON

FOR SUCH TRAVEL? HOS WILL RECALL FROM REF B THAT K/I'S EMPLOYER

CAME TO EMBASSY AT LEAST TWICE TO SEEK GUIDANCE ON HOW TO

REACT TO PUBLICITY ON K/I'S ACTIVITIES IN MEXICO, AT THAT TIME

BERLITZ WAS HIGHLY CONCERNED AT PRESS REPORTS HIGHLIGHTING KAI'S

BERLITZ EMPLOYMENT.

2: AGREE WITH HOS THAT

WOULD NOT BE BEST VENUE FOR

NSCA INTERVIEW.

IF K/1 SHOULD BALK AT TRAVEL TO U.S., PERHAPS

INTERVIEW COULD BE ARRANGED IN OTHER EUROPEAN CITY SUCH AS PARIS..

3. OUR FILES DO NOT REFLECT IF KAI IS U.S. PERSON, PLS ADVISE.
