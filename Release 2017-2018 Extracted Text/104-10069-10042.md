Yev Adolfovich Aronson, his

his wife Gilborte on Tuesday

Oct. 29th.

Aroneon is one of those who in Paris sees the most soviet

visitora of all kind. Through the Dr.Laary I met lagt year

a group of soviet physicians.

no to read a tre ye reate dude he ret time that

about hig encounterg with soviet citizens who come to rrance

and so we learned that he invites them regularely to his re-

staurant/"Dominic", 19, rue Bréa, Paris 6/ - sometimeg as many

as 15 to 20 persono Moreover soviet citizens of all kind:

srtista, painters, actors and directors of theatre, but also

journalists - for instance from "Pravda" and "Izvestia", come

to see him privately in his house.

Last night however he talked mainly about various visite he

had in the past. He didnt mension once somebody who is pre-

sently or was recently in Paris.When I asked him if he had

not seen shan now, these last days, he said "no, nobody" and

he added that the last time, since the Ichecoslovaquia events

the soviet visitors beceme far less numerous This might be

true, but I had impression thats it was on purpose that Aron

son did not want to tell about recent visite he had. received.

He is a very cautious man and as he net yesterday. for the

I-st time the Dr. Laury and his wife he perhaps did not want

to t0l1 too much about this.

Ne ostablished recently very friendly relationa with the

Aronson and yesterday's gathering certainly contributed to

tighten our link with them. It remains to be seen if in the

futur he will reveal more about his encounters with the so

viet visitors ind if he will be willing to help us meeting

ween them.

What can be established already is that he certainly la well

connooted with a number of them and that his restaurant 1a

¿ place whore they come frequently. What 1a his purpose of

mooting then? I and 2. are not inclined to think thet ho

works for them: he is a rich man and does nt need it. Aloo

he cortainly has not the nentality of a communiot sympathicer.

thom because ho loves art and literature

and, especially, bocause he is a passioned collectioner of rug

san antike and object of art and that these soviet vloitors

bring him now and then - ag a gift for his dinners, or juat

for sale - some of the objects they succeed to smugle out of

USSR.

see Appendix D about his personal char-eteriatice.
