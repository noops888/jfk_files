and Abner "Longie' willman are the principals in the operation

of the Havana Hilton casino being "fronted" by Cliff Jones.

Cliff. Jones and his "law firm' (Jones and Wiener) are known to have

represented several of the leading gambling establishments in

Las

Vegas, Nevada,

and investigation by the Nevada State

Tax Commission and the Kefauver Committee brought out that

Jones actually held a proprietary interest in some of the

"gambling casinos. One of these was the Thunderbird and another

was the Tropicana..

It has been established that a loan of

several hundred thousand dollars was made by Meyer and Jake

Lansky to Marion Hicks, the principal of record in the Thunderbird.

Also, Jake/Lansky has

reported income from the Thunderbird in

Federal income tax returns.

When Frank Costello was shot

and slightly wounded in New York in 1957, the police found on

his person a slip of paper bearing figures which exactly

corresponded

with a particular operation of the casino in

the Tropicana.

femorandum to Mr. Rosen

o Gambling Activities in Cuba(P) M

to the Attache that a representative of Andres River guero,

Cuban Prime Minister, had been in touch with Jake Lansky.

Rivero Aguero has frequently been mentioned as the candidate

of the Cuban Government coalition parties to succeed President

that for a contribu-

tion of $3,000 a month-from each of the casinos at the Hotels

informant said that Jake Lansky indicated that he would not

"sit still for the shakedown" and simply refused to pay any:

sum at all to Suarez Rivas for Rivero Aguero.

Informant said

¡that he got the impression from Jake Lansky that the latter

apparently believed that his brother, Meyer, was SUlI]CIentLy

well connected. with the Cuban Government anc

so had no desire

Ito start lining the pockets of the potential candidates for

the Presidency.

The informant in this matter was in a good

position to obtain the foregoing information in view of the

fact that he acted as interpreter between Suarez Rivas and

Jake Lansky•

If reports are true that Cliff Jones is "fronting"

in the Havana Hilton for Meyer Lansky,

Lansky's connection in

that group could conceivably be indicative of good political

connections in Cuba®

One of the group, Roberto Mendosa 15

has-

a brother Mario who is a prominent lawyer and reputedly

legal adviser to the Cuban Government. EM

In view of the above, it will be interesting to see

if Lansky is denied readmittance to Cuba k)
