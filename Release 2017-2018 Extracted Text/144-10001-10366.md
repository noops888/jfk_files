REPORT ON MEETING BETWEEN U.S. PRESIDENT AND PAKISTANI AND INDONESIAN

MINISTERS

biii)

1. President JOHNSON met with both ABDUL NASUTION, the

Defense Minister of Indonesia and Pakistan's Foreign Minister,

ZULFIQAR BHUTTO, separately.

NASUTION, in response to the concern

expressed by the President abou Indonesia's attitude toward

Malaysia, replied that Indonesia herself would

not attack, but

would defend herself if attacked. I understand that the meeting

was profitable.

The President expressed his

concern to BHUTTO

saying that he hoped to reaffirm friendly, relations between America

and Pakistan and asked that both Presidents get together, soon.

2. At the

time of President KENNEDY's death, President AZIKIWE

of Nigeria wrote to President JOHNSON saying that this

assassination

indicates that there are deeply tooted feelings against!

the American

Negro, and that there is a need for serious consideration by the

African people as to whether,or not they can trust the U.S. because

of the strong elements which discriminate against the Negro, and

whether or not the UN should be moved to another country. I under-

stand that President JOHNSON without answering the criticism

directly made a written reply on the 29th of November 'to the effect

that the U.S, would 'keep trying to promote equal human rights.
