Source in IHM is PCI ELLIS SUTTON, JR., Hertford,

PCI travels extensively

throughout the United States and has always furnished reliable

information in the past. He was in Bangkok, Thailand, for

period 8/28-31/67.

SUTTON has known ATKINSON for many years and

obtained the information first-hand

and through this source.

PCI SUTTON was given $3, 000 by JACKSON and $800 by

"RED" to purchase blank military

United States. Subject ATKINSON, who is in the Goldsboro, N. C..

area at the present time, is expected to contact SUTTON in the

near future to ascertain

if he has made the purchase of the

identification cards.

ATKINSON will take the cards to Bangkok

with him if obtained by SUTTON. SUTTON is expected to take the

cards to Bangkok himself if he cannot obtain them by the time

ATKINSON returns. SUTTON has been advised to stall ATKINSON

when contacted by him. He will tell ATKINSON that he probably

can buy the cards, but not for at least a month. SUTTON has

not made any attempt to make such a purchase. SUTTON is

agreeable to travel and will help the Bureau in any way possible.

Charlotte indices are negative for ATKINSON and

JACKSON.

Upon furnishing the attached IHM to military agencies

or other agencies, the Bureau is requested to advise them to

protect the information in the IHM, as to reveal it in total

when interviewing subjects would surely reveal his identity tó

those individuals.

Charlotte desires to be advised of the results of

information developed by the military in order that the

veracity of the informant will be evaluated and to determine

whether there are any possible prosecuteable violations within

continental jurisdiction.

From the information set forth it appears that most,

if not all, of the potential illegal operations are in Saigon

and Bangkok, Thailand; therefore, appropriate dissemination

of the IHM should be made to agencies having an interest in

these locations.
