EMM 639-Syon January 30, 1962, advised GERALD

PATRICK

HEMMING on January 12, 1962, left for California FLP

for purpose of trying to raise money for anti-CASTRO

activities.

Informant feels certain HEMMING will return to

Miami, but does not know when.

Informant estimates HEMMING

will be back in two or three weeks, and does not know

HEMMING's present address in California.

o1 tomm

It is noted that on July 2, 1961, HEMMING held a

restates

parachute demonstration at Davie, Florid, and received

considerable publicity.

As a result local Miami newspapers

162

received a volume of mail addressed to HEMMING from young

32Â°

men throughout the country. HEMMING thereafter devised a

form letter in answer to inquiry about his organization.

It

appears that enclosures furnished by TOBIN is a form letter

by HEMMING in response to a letter by TOBIN's friend..,

Miami will interview HEMMING on his return, to Miami.
