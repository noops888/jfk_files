TP 41-C has also furnished information indicating

that in a conversation with TRAFFICANTE during Labor Day

In addition, during November, 1966 TRAFFICANTE using his true

name traveled from Miami, Florida to Madrid, Spain and

identification record and that there had been no indication

that TRAFFICANTE had visited or interded to visit in Canada.
