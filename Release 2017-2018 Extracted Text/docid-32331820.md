broken up with him in September, 1958, after going with him

for three years. She has known for some time that MARTINEZ

has been

held responsible by the Cuban Rebels for its loss,

Airport in Toronto.

MARTINEZ had engaged four Panamanian

pilots to fly the planes from Canada; but although they were

permitted to travel to the United States, the Canadian

Authorities would not allow them to enter Canada to pilot the

planes from Toronto. Informant stated that it is her under-

standing that the planes are now in New Jersey, possibly around

LEBLOVICH's home, but she was unable to furnish information as

to how they were

assumed to be Cuban Rebels at the Edison Hotel, and for this

during the past summer when the Spanish Fiesta was held,

MARTINEZ was accompanied by a young boy who made a speech

in an effort to solicit funds for what he termed a Cuban

The collection was not fruitful

and MARTINEZ later made a comment to her that those in

attendance were not interested in helping their own kind.

Informant advised that a man she knew as MIKEN DUGAN or

DUNCAN was also in Toronto with MARTINEZ and his group when they

purchased the surplus planes.

She stated this man was from

White Plains, New York, Telephone No. WH 8-9430.

to MARTINEZ in which notations appeared thereon concerning

purchase of B.A.R. surplus rifles. She said that she had also

heard MARTINEZ mention that he was making contacts somewhere

in Brooklyn, New York, for the purchase of B.A.R. rifles for the

Informant indicated that MARTINEZ had mentioned that

he intended getting medicinal supplies in New York for

MORALES and was going to pass MORALES off as a medical student.

Informant said she presumed fron the conversation that this was

to involve a large shipment of supplies to be destined for the

Cuban Rebels.

Informant stated that MARTINEZ was promoting the

building of a Pan

American

Building in Cleveland, Ohio, but

that Cleveland officials were not interested and he later

tried to get such a building erected in Miami. MARTINEZ advisea

from insurance companies in South America or the United States.

MARTINEZ made frequent trips to Caracas, Venezuela, and ir

July or August, 1958, he called from Miami and said he was

going to go "across the water" which she took to mean Cuba.

She said MARTINEZ has stated that he met with CASTRO, the head

•of the Cuban Rebens, in the past.

Informant said that although she had no definite

information she would presume that any arms which were trans-

ported to Miami from New York would end up at the Trade Winds

Hotel, Miami, which is where FRANCISCO BARONA ALONSO stays

while he is in Miami.

It is informant's opinion that ALONSO

spends most of his time in Florida.

Informant said MARTINEZ has an associate in

Westchester, New York, by the name of TOATER (Phonetic).

Informant stated MARTINEZ. owes her $340, which she

has

loaned him over a period of time and she has been seeking

repayment of this debt since she broke up with MARTINEZ.

She said MARTINE called on September 9, 1958, and

said he was going to üp-state New York and then to Miami

and would be

in Canton on Monday or Tuesday, October 13 or

14, 1958, and he did not want her to tell anyone where he was

going to be.

Informant stated that MARTINEZ was explicit in

telling her

that he was going to be in up-state New York and

then Miami, then Canton, and she did not know why he made such

a point of

making this clear to her.

At this time MARTINEZ

also asked her to obtain twenty dollars which a friend owed

him and send it by Money Order to him at the Main Office of

Western Union,

New York, which she did. He promised to send

informant the $340 he owed her on October 11, 1958, but to

date it has not been received:

Informant said that she had no definite information

that MARTINEZ was responsible for the theft of instant

weapons at the Canton Armory but when she read it in the news-

paper she immediately thought that he would be the logical

person to dispose of such a quantity of arms and that he

possibly had done so to make up for the weapons he failed to

get when he lost the $30,000 given him by the Cuban Rebels for

this purpose.

themselves as THOMPSON and MARDIGO and they were interested

in learning of MARTINEZ' whereabouts.

She refused to give

them any information.

On September 15, 1958, while driving

to her home she was forced from the road by two men in a

black Packard bearing Ohio license, number unobserved, who

to give them any information.

She said she was offered $5,000

for this information and the men stated they had seen her in

MARTINEZ' company the week end before. in New York, which in-

formant stated was true.

When she refused to tell them

anything they slapped her around before letting her go.

When

she later told MARTINEZ of this he asked her why she did not

report it to the police, to which she replied if she had done

so she woüld have had

to tell them all she knew about him.

Informant said MARTINEZ has access

• to a private

plane because he. flew from Miami to New York on the occasion

that he went to Toronto. While in Toronto they stayed at

the

Conroy Hotel registered under the names SALLY KRAJCIK and

LOUIS MARTINEZ, • She stated MARTINEZ has always used his own

name in registering at any hotel and she has always called him

at various hotels under his own name.

Informant said that on the week end of July 25, 1958,

she called this number MARTINEZ answered.

On another occasion

when she called this number the person answering said it was

the Bel Air Corporation and MARTINEZ was unknown there.

New York had dropped all charges against him.

He stated he

planned to return on Wednesday (10/23/58) and wanted her to

meet him at the airport, which she believed to be the Cleveland

airport. MARTINEZ told KRAJIK they may

get married.

In addition, TOM MUSAT contacted her on October 26,

1958, and said the FBI had interviewed him and she could

expect cällers in: the near future.

MUSAT told KRAJIK to tell

the FBI that she was a girlfriend

of MARTINEZ and little if

anything else regarding him (MARTINEZ). She stated she did not

think MUSAT had anything to do with the robbery, but he was a

very good friend of MARTINEZ.

MUSAT also said he heard from

sity Hall, Canton, that she (KRAJCIK) had been interviewed by

the Canton Police.

On 10/29/58 SALLY KRAJCIV., Wooster, advised

SA GILLEY by telephone that she planned to "pick up" MARTINEZ

at the Cleveland airport at 9:50 PM this date. She was of the

opinion that he was coming in from New York and planned to

stay at her home in Wooster until after the election.

On 10/24/58 the New York Office advised that the

New York City Police Department was making available for review

the effects of LOUIS MARTINEZ and as a result three telegrams

were located which were in the possession of MARTINEZ on

Wooster several days after his arrival on 10/29/58 at New York.

MARTINEZ told KRAJCIK that he knew who took the guns from che

Canton Armory and that the individual had already received the

money for the job.

Of LOUIS MARTINEZ.

KRAJCIK stated that she had telephonically contacted

MARTIN RUTHFORD on 11/9/58 and RUTHFORD informed her that

MARTINEZ had. "blown the whistle" oh him and as a result the

FBI had questioned him. RUTHFORD indicated he had had nor

recent contact with MARTINEZ and if MARTINEZ did not soon call

him he was going to "sing like a canary."

KRAJCIK talked to RUTHFORD again on November 10;

1958, and stated that RUTHFORD's demeanor had changed towards'

MARTINEZ, which lead her to believed he had talked to MARTINEZ

and been reassured by MARTINEZ that he had told nothing to the

FBI.

The former stated that it was possible that RUTHFORD

and MARTINEZ may suspect that the information furnished to the

FBI came from her, as she would be the only logical source.

KRAJCIK was shown photographs of STUART SUTOR and

VICTOR CARLUCCI, neither one of whom she could identify.

She

further added that she knows of no associates of MARTINEZ

in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area.

MARTINEZ, according to KRAJCIK, hac access to a

Miami to New York in a private plane.

KRAJCIK drove MARTINEZ

KRAJCIK stated that MARTINEZ has never been in

military service due to the fact that his left side is

paralyzed and has been from birth and stated he has purchased

no new Cadillac.

MARTINEZ used informant's car while in

Canton and Wooster In the past week and had little or no

money in his possession.

In his recent visit MARTINEZ mentioned the possibility.

of traveling to the West Coast, but did not indicate the

purpose of such a trip.

KRAJCIR stated the only acquaintance MARTINEZ has

on the West Coast is BOBBY, ROSETTI, of San Bernardino,

California.

Informant stated that she is not

acquainted

with Dr. PESSALANO of Miami, but stated

that on the Toronto

trip when difficulty was encountered by MARTINEZ and his

group in gaining the admission for Panamaniar pilots into

Canada to transport the planes the group mentioned getting in

touch with a

"Dock" from Miami, who would come to New York

if necessary to straighten out

the trouble. The "Dock"

seemed quite important to the group and there is a possibility

that he was called while they were in Toronto.

Informant stated that on MARTINEZ' recent trip she

found twe post cards in his topcoat, one with. the name

SERGIO APABICIA, 103 West 80th, Apartment Iwo, New York,

recalled on the recent visit of MARTINEZ to Canton he was

talking to TOM MUSAT at the Spanish-American Center and

discussing the questioning of MARTINEZ and MUSAT by the FBI.

She said MARTINEZ was concerned if whether the FBI had asked

about a location in Cleveland, but she could not recall the

exact name of this place.

She said it had the name house in

it, either Harmony House,

Melody House, or some similar name,

and she gathered from the name that it had something to do

with architecture. She stated she had no knowledge of what

connection MARTINEZ may have with such an establishment or

why he should be so concerned about it.

Informant continued that she had learned from

MARTINEZ some time ago that a plane had been wrecked, she

believed in Florida, on which JOE MARALESwas injured.

She

stated that MORALESwas supposed to have suffered a broken

arm or leg in this crash.

She did not know who was piloting

this plane, but gathered it was a private plane.

KRAJCIK stated

that since MARTINEZ' departure from

Wooster on November 10, 1950, she had learned from ECK

*MARONE, who operates the Satellite Club in Wooster, that Ohio

MARTINEZ had called and reque sted some i

money and that MARONE

had sent him twenty dollars.

MARTINEZ was supposed to have been

in New York on November 13, 1958, and was to proceed to

Washington, D. C., on that date for what reason informant did

not know.

Mr. HAL BOYLAN (Protect Identity), Manager,

Auditorium, North Market Avenue, Canton, advised SA JAMES E.

GILLEY on 10/21/58 that he had read about the MARTINEZ thing

in the paper and recalled that MARTINEZ was the campaign

manager for Mayor BABCOCK (Canton) when he was elected.

During the election, MARTINEZ took $3,300 campaign funds and

left town.

No effort was made to prefer charges since the

mayor did

not want this type of publicity:

He also advised that WILSON J. MYERS, Canton City

Service Director, made a trip

to New York on 10/21/58 to secure

some monetary figures for the new city hall, and no such

trip was needed.

He advised he did not know if this had any

connection with MARTINEZ or not.

On 10/24/58 CV 411-C advised SA W. RICHARD GREGOR

that he had determined that instant theft was believed

"fingered" by a Canton attorney who was recently arrested in

New York on a kidnapping charge. Informant stated that Canton

attorney had five or six Cubans

in Canton prior to the theft.

The Cubans lived in different parts of town and on occasions

met in the evening at an unknown beer tavern in Cunton.
