Attached hereto is an editorial appearing in the Chicago

Sun-Times of July 11, 1963, which is critical of Police Super-

intendent O. W. WILSON of

the Chicago Police Departnent, for

failure to clean up the "strip and clip" joints in Chicago's

Loop and First Ward District.

It also is critical of the Chicago

Police Department for failure to enforce a local ordinance

prohibiting the soliciting of persons to purchase alcoholic

beverages.

Veteran crime reporter SANDY SMITH of the Sun-Times,

has this week prepared a number of articles exposing the use of

B-girls in bars in the First Ward and showing that the proceeds

of these bars has been going to the Syndicate.

Confidential

Informant CG.6649-C, who is herself a

"stripper" in these bars,

has told us

previously that these are local girls working in

the bars and are not brought in from out of state.

â€¢ SANDY SMITH has told us that he has uncovered no

evidence.of any WSTA or ITAR violations and the Chicago Office

has been, following this matter closely.

We were well aware of

all of this information and it has previously been reported in

connection with our investigation into the Chicago First Ward

and related hoodlums.

The connection between Chicago hoodlums

and

the "joints" in the Chicago area has previously been

established.

This matter is being

followed closely so in the event

thereNis

any violation whereby

hoodlums, it will be done MerfBI can take action against
