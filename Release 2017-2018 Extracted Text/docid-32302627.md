SAC, LOS ANGELES (92-113C)

JOHN ROSELLI, aka John Rosselli

The Las Vegas Office advised on 4/16/64 that informa-

tion was received from the Nevada Gaming Control Board that

one of their agents observed ROSSELLI departing alone from

Las Vegas at 1:30 a.m. on 4/12/64 on TWA Flight 58, which

flight stops at Chicago, Illinois, and terminated at New

York City. The Las Vegas Office was unable to locate any

record of

a reservation made by ROSSELLI under his true name

or to locate ROSSELLI's name on the passenger list of the

flight. The Chicago and New York Offices were advised by

Las Vegas by teletype to be alert for ROSSELLI in their areas.

On 4/16/64 Special Agents.of the Los Angeles Office

at about 2:00 p.m. observed a red-haired girl driving alone

in ROSSELLI's car in the Beverly Hills, California area.

Information was received

from a source at ROSSELLI's

residence that about two weeks ago she observed ROSSELLI

leaving the apartment garage with a red-haired girl.

The

identity of this girl is not known at the present time.

Check of ROSSELLI's bank account at the Fidelity Bank

Beverly Hills, California, on 4/14/64 revealed that on 3/13/64

he issued a check in the

amount of $8,961.30 payable to Ajax

West Coast Corporation. On 4/7/64 he deposited a check for

$13,945.50 which was drawn on the Bank of Las Vegas.

These

checks probably represent the purchase and sale of ice

machines. It is recalled that recently LA 4145-C furnished

information that ROSSELLI had recently purchased 24 ice cube-

making machines from Ajax West Coast Corporation, Santa

Barbara, for resale to the Desert Inn Hotel, Las

Vegas,

Nevada.

on 4/7/64 ROSSELLI also deposited fifteen checks

in small

amounts totaling $41.74 which probably represent

dividends from investments in oil leases as some of the

checks

are drawn on Texas banks

from which banks ROSSELLI

has in

the past received checks

for oil lease dividends.
