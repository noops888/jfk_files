You have this right to the advice and presence of a lawyer even if you cannot

afford to hire one. We have no way of giving you a lawyer, but one will be

appointed for you, if you wish, if and when you go to court. If you wish to

answer questions now without a lawyer present, you have the right to stop

answering questions at any time. You also have the right to stop answering

at any time until you talk to a lawyer.
