WIECK, Carl

4 March 1966

1. On 3 March 1966, Ilm Flint of SR Division contacted the

underpigned in reference to an Unknowe Identity mentioned in

20-4

2. The cable contained an account of the experiences of

Carl WIECK, an American student in Paris and his contact

-..with iwo RIS officers, XEVTUSHENKO and LYOV.

3. WIECK has been a contact aince the winter of 1964 with

these Soviets and had not reported to anyone in the American

Embasay. The contacts have consisted of restaurant meetings,

colfees, circus, ete. These meetinga have included discussions

primarily of political matters, especially recently a discussion

oî the United States involvement in Viet Nam (of which WIECK

does not approve, has said so to the Soviets).

* However, when YEVTUSHENKO asked Subject to trang-

late a travel brochure from English to French, WIECK began to

wonder what he was becoming involved in.

At this point, WIECK

wrote two friende in the United States asking advice. One of these

was "á former employee who allegedly did handwriting analysis

when employed by CIA."

They advised fat him to contact the United

States Embassy.

5. NIECK refused to do translation for YEVTUSHENKO and

was able to tell YEVTUSHENKO that be, WIECK, did not like the

idea of becoming enmeshed in Soviet espionage.

SECRET.

6. Sr posed the question whether the Office of Security

could identify the formor Kubark employee. Upon consultation

with Jan Bock of TSD (alter contacting the Secarity Offcer of

TSD), the individual who most closely fit the description was

Henry Edward KIMSEY (oven though the handwriting angle was

10$ KIMSEY 'a main forte).

7. SR. Hiat was notified that it probably was KIMSEY.

8. Flint was also advised that the FBI should be notified of

the information re WIECK and WIECK's contacts with the Soviet.

Flint said that this would be done as aoon as they had gathered

together all the information. WIECK's next meeting with the Soviet

is scheduled for 17 March 1966.

9. WIECK has said that he does not wish to gei involved as

"a junior spy" and does not desire to report after evezy meeting.

WIECK also said that he expects to be drafted into the United

States Army quite aoon and in view of his feelinga about Viet Nam,

does not know if he will agree to serve in Viet Nam.

10. Another angle to the case is the projected cooperation with

the bost services and since it la an operational matter will have to

be solved within the DDP. The French probably are already aware

of the contact between YEVTUSHENKO and WIECK because it in

known that they have YEVTUSHENKO under surveillance.

1l. There is no record of WIECK in the Office of Security

indices.
