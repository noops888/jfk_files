[

SURVEILLANCES IN GENERA

...I.. The maintenance of surveillances requires the use of the utmost discretion;

.'.'..common sense, and good judgment on the part of the sacs and the Agents.

Arbitrary rules cannot properly be laid down or adhered to for this type

•of investigative procedure.

A few general principles can be laid down,

however,

which

can be applied to various

types of surveillances.

÷ 2.

A surveillance is an investigative technique just as interviews, collecting

,.of evidence, and conducting raids are investigative techniques,

and; of

course, practical experience in this particular activity is the best

•teacher.

3.

Surveillances are expensive in that they cause the tying up of manpower and

should not be resorted to unless results can reasonably be expected.

4.

In surveillances in cases of major importance SACs should assume personal,

on-the-scene supervision and not delegate such command to subordinates.

Il a sufficient reason exists to prevent the SAC from being personally

present at the scene of a major surveillance, the ASAC must be in command.

SAC must assure himself that all physical surveillances comply with

Bureau instructions, and' are being given adequate supervison.

5..

FBI employees

than Agents must not be used on surveillances

without specific Bureau authority.

Provide Agents with explicit instructions on each physical surveillance

in which they engage.

Agent personnel participating on physical surveillances

should be orally advised concerning the duties to be performed in

¡.connection with such surveillances, and should not be permitted to carry

with them any written

surveillance schedules.

If it is necessary to utilize

code words for commun:cations over Bureau radios, the approved list of

code words it too long to be remembered may be furnished to the Agent

driving the car but should not be removed from the car during the course

of the surreillance.

When the surveillance has been concluded, the list:

of code words should be returned to the supervisor in charge of the

7.

surveillance.

All written data of any kind relating to physical surveillances must be

in by the Agents preparing or utilizing

same to the field

at the conclusion of caci day's tour oi duty.

In some instances

Agents will complete their tour of duty on physical surveillances outside

their headquarters city, and in those cases it will not he possible for

any written data they may have to be immediately turned in to the field

However, in such situations, the agents will be hold personally

responsible for saleguarding any such

written data until such time as it

can be returned to

the field office.

In addition, all such written data

relating to physical surveillances must not contain anything nich would

indicate to any persons unauthorized to have it that the data relates

to physical surveillances.

8.

In every security case involving a subject who has been apprehended for

a Federal violation within our investigative jurisdiction,

the office

of origin is to make recommendations to the Bureau concerning the

necessity for physical surveillance coverage of the subject who is

on bond while awaiting trial or pending appeal following conviction.

The office of origin is to closely follow the appeal proceedings of

security subjects, making arrangements with

the Washington Field Office

or other offices,

where necessary, in order that the office of origin

can be assured that it is instantaneously notiried of any

court decision

affecting the merits

The office of origin is to promptly

notify the Bureau in such instances, making recommendations for any

changes in the coverage of the subject and whether physical surveillance

should be utilized until he is committed to custody.]

C. REASONS FOR CONDUCTING SURVEILLANCES

The purpose of the surveillance is an important factor to keep in mind

at all

times, and

the Agents assigned to surveillances must know the purpose

in order to function efficiently.

The Bureau surveillances usually have

for their purpose one or more of

the following:

The location of fugitives through the

surveillance of relatives or

known contacts

2. Surveillances conducted to cover pay-offs in extortion cases

3.

Surveillance of subjects or suspects in espionage, sabotage,

national defense cases to observe their activities and ascertain the

identity of their accomplices

4. Surveillances conducted

at the request of other governmental departments

D. TYPES OF SURVEILLANCES

Fixed surveillances

are surveillances often referred

to as plants, where

the Agents

are stationed'in one location and usually involve

the surveillance of

a place to determine the activities

and the identity of persons going

and out of the premises under

surveillance.

2.

Mobile surveillances

This is a moving surveillance where the Agents are moving about on foot,

by automobile or on trains, airplanes, or other means of transportation,

surveilling subjects

suspects in Bureau cases.

These types

of

surveillances may be broken down into the following categories:

Close surveillances

Where it is necessary to keep the subjects or suspects under

surveillance at all times and where it may involve

considerable

activity to locate the subjects or suspects again if they are

Lost.

b.

Loose

surveillances

A11 surveillanes which may be conducted as spot checks to

'determine the contacts and activities of the subjects or

suspects and where it may be proper

to drop the surveillance

temporarily rather

than risk the chance of being "made."

This

type of surveillance is sometines desirable in very discreet

investigations involving subjects whose habits and contacts

are so

well known that they can be readily located again if

it becomes desirable to drop the

surveillance temporarily.

SURVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

4E - G

E.

SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT

The equipment used on surveillances will depend upon the type and purpose of:

the surveillance.

The following

examples illustrate some of the uses oi

technical and other equipment on Bureau

survelliances.

1.

Firearms, restraining devices, and lighting equipment on lugitive

surveillances

2.

Surveillances in

extortion cases often require a great variety of equip

ment, including radio,

decoy packages,

signaling devices, binoculars,

lighting equipment,

as well as firearms and restraining devices.

3.

Automobiles are essential in practically all types of surveillances and

care should be taken to insure that the cars used are not conspicuous

and are speedy enough to follow the rehicles driven by the subjects or

suspects in the case.

Consideration must be given to changing automobiles

and/ or license plates.

4.

Photographic equipment can be used in practically all types of surveil-

lances.

In this connection, the tarious types of still- and movie

camera

equipment that the Bureau has available and which are described

elsewhere in this manual should be kept in mind.

5.

Radio equipment can often be utilized

to adrantage on surveillances;

however,

care must be taken not to utilize such equipment ir it will

attract attention by being conspicuous.

6.

Although cash is not ordinarily considered as equipment, it is very

essential that the Agents on surveillances provide themselves with

sufficient cash to enable them to operate without the use of credit

cards

and in some cases GTRs.

# supply of small change is essential,

especially nickels and

dimes, for use in making phone calls at unusual

hours from pay stations.

17.

Special surveillance devices for major cases can be built by the Exhibits

Section in conjunction with the FBI Labcratory when time permits.

When

requesting such derices,

include photographs,

measurements, and

other

informative data which will be needed to

build the items.

Full justifi-

cation for the request must be included. l

F.

DRESS OF AGENTS ON SURVEILLANCES

It is extremely important that Agents on surveillances dress in such a

manner so as not to attract attention by looking out of place in the areas

where they are working.

They should at all times try to blend

into the

background and make themselves as inconspicuous as possible.

This may

involve wearing sweaters,

slack outfits, or overalls in

some situations and

In others may even require the wearing of formal attire.

G.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE SUBJECT UNDER SURVEILLANCE

1.

Agents on surreillances should familiarize thamselres with the pile of a

case and utilize

every other possible means of obtaining a knowledge of

the subject that they are to have under surveillance.

2.

Agents going on a surveillance to relieve other Agents should, wherever

possible, have an opportunity to talk with the Agents who have previously

worked on the case in order

to obtain information as

physical characteristics, as well

as nis habits,

recreation, and business

contacts,

since this will

enable them to more intelligently carry out

their assignment.

URVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

ACTIVITIES OF AGENTS ON SURVEILLANCES

la It is of paramount importance that Agents on surveillances aot perfectly

natural at all times.

Any indications of self-consciousness or unusual

aotions or appearance of the Agents will, of course, assist the subject in

verifying any suspicions he may have that he is under surveillanoe.

20

Agents on surveillances must be constantly on the alert for countersurveillances

on the part of accomplices of the subject.

For example, when a surveillance

is being conducted on foot, it is desirable to have one

of the agents walk on

the opposite side of the street from the subject in order that he might be in

a position to observe any countersurveillance activities on the other side of

the street.

Agents on fixed surveillances must, of course, always be on the

alert for microphone plants and taps on the telephones being used by the

3.

The use of contacts, sources of information and confidential informants

should not be overlooked by the Agents on surveillances.

For example,

the event a subject registers in a hotel, considerable information can be

obtained among the employees and management of the hotel if informants have

been developed among them.

4.

Agents on surveillances should constantly keep in touch with the supervisor

(SAC in cases of

major importance) Jin order that he might be continually

the developments in the case.

It is extremely important that

Agents immediately communicate with thel supervisor (or SAC) ]when the surveil-

lance is lost by one particular Agent in order that

this Agent might be able

to catch up with the surveillance again the next time the Agents who are

folloking the subject call in.

The importance of the coosdination of

Agents working on the surveillance with the (supervisorlby means of telephone

and in some instances radio,

cannot be over-emphasized, and in order that

this might be effective,

is necessary for the Agents working on the surveil-

lance to be in communication with

the [supervisorlas frequently as this can be

done without attracting attention.

RENTING OF PREMISES FOR USE IN FIXED SURVEILLANCES

1. Fixed surveillances from automobiles parked on the street are usually good

for only a lew hours due to the faot that the cars become conspicuous.

2. Prior to renting quarters, care must be taken to first ascertain the

reliability of the owner of the property by a discreet inquiry.

3. Where the reliability of the owner is questionable or when other ciroumstances

such a procedure

a pretext should be used; how

ever, the seent developine the pedest abdula be carerul not to evoly some

situation which might be even more embarrassing than the truth.

such use

of pretext requires

careful thought and planning.

In many instances the

Agent must disclose his official identity in order to obtain suitable

quarters for the surveillance; nowever, in such instances, the intimate

details of the surveillance and the case under investigation should never

be disclosed to the person contacted no matter

how reliable he may appear

to be.

4.

When quarters are rented for a fixed

in order to enable the Agents

on surveillance to communicate with

All Bureau property taken to the place of a fixed surveillance must be

completely inventoried.

This action should be done before the property is

moved into the quarters to be

occupied.

When such property is removed, or

when the surveillance is abandoned, the property removed must be checked

off the inventory.: With the abandorment of such a surveillance, a thorough

and detailed search of the premises must be made to prevent the loss of

Bureau property, or the subsequent identification of Bureau Agents through

the tracing of such property.

4. SURVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

Lo PLANNING SURVEILLANCES IN ADVANCE

1.

Certain types of surveillances, such as the surveillance of pay-off spots

in extortion cases,

can and must be carefully planned in advance and each

of the Agents assigned to the surveillance should know

exactly what his

duties are and just what is expectea of him in this particular assignment.

A careful survey of the pay-off spot should, of course, be made in advance

and the details of the location and the surrounding terrain explained to

the Agents by blaciboard diagrams or other illustrative methods.

2.

In other types of surveillances,

certain problems arise again

which can and should be planned

in advance.

For example, the problem of

taking over a surveillance i a railroad station comes up

very frequently

in most field offices, and sire is

no reason why detailed plans

cannot be

worked

out in advaice

at Agent conferences so that all the

Agents in the office will know the details of such plans.

The same pro-

cedure

should be worked out for handling surveillances

at airports and bus

verminals, as weld as other surveillance problems peculiar

to the particular

field office, such as handling surveillances on subways, ferry boats,

tunnels, and other means of transportation.

M.

RAIDS IN GENERAL

1.

When a dangerous assignment arises in which the practical application of

firearms might be reasonably anticipated, the SAC must personally take

SACs must assune leadership in raids or arrests where firearms

might be used and in mujor cases of great importance even though there

no indication that firearns might be employed.

Unless emergency

conditions prevent prior notification, the SAC or person acting in his

absence must be innediately notified when such a situation arises, before

action is taken toward apprehension.

The Bureau should be advised by

teletype or telephone of the name of the official who will be in charge

of the dangerous assignment.

If the SAC or ASAC will not be on the spot

in charge, suficient explanation should be outlined which will indicate

the reasons for the inability of the above-named official's participation.

2.

If a major case is being investigated involving the hot pursuit of fugitives

which requires

a concentration oi Ajents, it is incumbent upon each sAC to

arrange for 24-nour coverage in the resident agencies in his territory where

the activity is such that it

cail be expected there will be nunerous phone

personnel.

situation may demand.

As careful and detailed reconnaissance as time permits should be made of

the vicinity of the place to be raided, noting all avenues of escape,

as doors,

The equipment to be used will be determined by the raid commander and

will depend upon the circumstances of each particular

case.

Obriously

high-powered rifles cannot be used in congested areas and

the type of

firearms used will conform with the location of the place to be raided

and the proximity of neighboring houses and buildings.

All the equip-

ment, including firearms, handouffs, leg irons,

electrical and technical

eguipment, should be inspected by the raid commander or an

designated Special Agent prior to the raid.

Agents should be partic-

ularly alert to display suitably their identification, either by means

of arm bands or badges, especially at all times when they are moring

about in the possession of exposed firearms.

Consideration should be

given to using arm bands and pass words to identily Agents on the raids

and Agents should display badges prominently on the outside of their

with gasoline and oil and be in perfect running condition.

[Fach office is to maintain a

supply of arm bands in sufficient quantity

to provide 50% of the Agent personnel with them.J

An assembly point should be designated near the place which is to be

raided where all Agents can assemble just before the raid for final

instructions prior to proceeding to their positions.. In the event the

place to be raided is near the field office, it would not be necessary,

but where the objective to be raided is some distance away,

an assembly

point should be used.

Of course, the assembly point must be sufficiently

be selected

which will prevent concentrating the personnel in central

and public places. The Agents should not arrive in a group but

singly or in pairs and avoid attracting attention to their movements.

When carrying firearms,

such as machine guns or shotguns, the departure

from the Bureau headquarters or wherever

a temporary headquarters may

be located should be by rear or side entrance and such movement should

•not be a group departure which will give the appearance a mass raid

is about to take place.

APPROACH TO THE PLACE TO BE RAIDED

The exact manner in which raiding Agents and cover Agents should approach

the place to be raided depends upon the type of place raided and the

surrounding territory.

In any event the approach should be made in such

a manner as not to warn the occupants of the raid objective before all

SURVEILLANCES AND RAIDS

4P - Q

?.

ENTERING THE PLACE TO BE RAIDED

1.

Raids may begin by a signal

from the raid commander to the occupants of !

the place being raided, advising them of the official identity of the

raiding party and requesting their surrender.

Sometimes this can be

• accomplished by a telephone

call and

in other instances it will be necessary

.::i. to shout to the occupants of

the house from the outside, attract attention.

by blowing a whistle

or some

similar method.

Many raids of premises,

however, are begun by the raid commander,

after providing for appropriate

outside protection of the premises,

approaching the front entrance and

demanding entry after making his prosence and official capacity known.

2.

Both the raiding Agents and the covering Agents must utilize all natural

covering available during the approach

the raid.

Cover not only protects the Agents from hostile gunfire but also

conceals

their movements and whereabouts so that they cannot be observed by

It the subjects in the house being raided do not surrender and are known

to be dangerous and desperate characiers, tear gas should be utilized to

forco them out of the premises.

will have to wear a gas mask when entering the building after the raid is

over.

Even though subjects emerge from the house after the gas is used,

Agents entering the house thereafter should use extreme caution to guard

against surprise

attack by others hiding in the house whose presence was

not contemplated.

4.

In any raid the

participants should clearly identify themselves as Special

Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to all persons in the place

being raided and those nearby so that no claim can be made by subjocts that

they were being hijacked by other gangsters.

Identity should be made known

verbally by a loud clear statement on

the part of the raiding officers that

"We

are FBI Agonts,"

or "We are Special Agents of the FBI," and by the

•display of badgos.

Q.

DUTIES OF COVERING AGENTS

The primary dutios of covering Agents are to cover the approach of the raiding

• Agents to the house and prevent the escape of persons sought.

Ordinarily no

Agent should fire unless he observes someone firing out of the house.

2. When persons are seen emerging from the house, they should be advised of the

raidors' identity and called upon to surrender,

It, however, they come out

of the house shooting, the covering Agents should immediately return fire.

3. It is the duty of covering Agents to guard against possible attack by con-

federates of

the occupants of the raided house who may come up from the rear

either to assist the

subjects in the house or possibly due to the fact that

they are unaware that the

raid is in progress.

The covering Agents

must

also

guard against the possibilities of accomplices residing in adjacent houses

or apartments.

4. It should be

realized that raid commanders assign sufficient personnel

•to all areas outside

the premises to meot

any reasonable emergency that

may arise.

Membors of a raiding party should not leave their posts and

congregate when any ordinary activity arises.

In doing so,

the areas

previously assigned

loft unguarded,

and in

the event

of shooting, it is highly possible that some of the Agents may find them-

selves in the cross fire of other Agents.

to the place where they are to be detained.

Where the possibility

exists of other members of the subject's gang coming

to the house that has been raided, a sufficient number of Agents properly

armed should be left in the house

or apartment.

These Agents must conduct

themselves in such a manner as to not arouse

suspicion and warn confederates

of the apprehended persons that the former occupants are no longer there.

4.

111 raids should be conducted as secretly as possible and without resulting

in undue publicity.

The names of

participants in a raid should not be

•disclosed without prior Bureau authority.

Should anyone be killed during

• a raid and inquest by local authorities is necessary, arrangements can

usually be made for one or two Agents to testify for the entire raiding party.

self-defense.

The point selected should be located where natural cover is

afforded for the Agents engaged in this work, such as where a roadbed

is cut through a hill or where concrete abutments or bridges are available

for cover.

Consideration should be given to locating the point of

blockade at a place where it cannot be observed from a distance and

thereby enable the approaching cars to turn around and go back without

approaching the blockade.

Wooden barricades and stop signs can be

utilized in telling the vehicles to travel in one lane.

the other direction so that the traffic will not be unduly delayed.

Io block a road and

stop a specific automobile can be done by selecting:

a point in the road which is relatively narrow and extending a rope or

cable across the road with a stop sign attached to the center.

One end!

of the rope or cable can be fastened to a tree or some other similar

object on one side of the road and the rope then laid flat across

the

road

and the other end wrapped around a tree or pole in such a manner

as will permit the rope.to be pulled taut across the road and securely

fastened.

Agents can be stationed under cover to pull up the rope or

cable when the wanted car approaches. Other cars will not be stopped

and can easily drive across the rope

or cable as it lies on the road.

This cable or rope should be placed across the road diagonally so that

if the wanted car is

driven into the obstruction it will be deflected

sideways to the side of the road into a ditch or an embankment.

Agents should be stationed at a considerable point up the road in the

direction from which the car is expected to appear, and these Agents

have the duty of watching for the wanted car and notifying the Agents

at the barricade of its approach and also of blocking

the car if it turns around and tries to go back. If the wanted car

approaches the barricade and stops, Agents, properly armed, located

under cover on one side of the road should train their guns on the car

and command the occupants to alight.

Roads can be blocked with automobiles in those cases where a car is

expected to proceed along a certain road on which there is considerable

traffic and where it is not feasible to use either of the above methods.

This roadblock can be established by baving Agents in one car stationed

beside the highway at an intersection or in a filling station, who will

be on the lookout for the wanted autorobile.

One or more

cars

with

Agents should be stationed at a point at a considerable distance down

the road but within view of the first car so that signals may be ex-

changed.

When

the wanted car approaches, the first car

will signal

to the Agents in the other cars

who will drive their cars across the

road in such à manner as to completely block the road and force the

car to stop or turn around.

No Agents, of course,

should re-

main inside the car which

car turns

around and attempts to turn back, the Agents in the first car can use

their car to block the road.

d.

In general, the type of barricade used will depend upon the type of

highway, the amount of traffic on it, the surrounding terrain, the

character of the persons sought, and

the time available.

Blockades

should be established at a point where the road is narrow if this is

at all possible.

The point selected should be between deep ditches,

high embankments, or heavy woods to prevent the wanted persons from

driving around the barricade through open fields.

Agents covering this

point should all be placed on the same side of the road so that they

will not injure one another by cross fire.

e.

If it becomes necessary to approach a car

which has been stopped at a

barricade, you should take advantage of the cover provided by

itself in approaching it.

This should be done, of course, in such a

manner as to place the occupant of the car at a disadvantage in your

approach to him to effect an apprehension or require him to get out

of the car in question.

Whenever a roadblock is established in which any Bureau personnèl is

physically present and participates, it is fundamental that the Agents

be in charge of such operation

and they must make

sure that the police

or any others participating furnish full cooperation.

Each SAC will be

held personally responsible to see that any such roadblock is complete

records of Civil Service Connission, Central Intelligence

Agency, armed forces intelligence agencies, and any other

appropriate agencies. If special circumstances so dictate,

manner that will fully protect the source.

All written bomb threats are to be submitted to the FBI Laboratory for

document examination

and to the Identification Division for latent

All offices should maintain liaison with military Explosive Ordnance

Disposal (EOD) units and/or local law enforcement bomb squads in order that

assistance can be promptly obtained if bombs or live explosives are

encountered in connection with official investigations.

of live explosives.

Due to emergency conditions,

requests for assistance

from CONARC EOD units are usually oral. All such oral requests are to

be confirmed in writing by letter addressed to the Commanding Officer of

the EOD unit involved. CONARC does not have EOD units in Alaska,

Hawaii, or Puerto Rico. Therefore, the Anchorage, Honolulu, and

San Juan

Offices

should maintain liaison with Navy and/or Air Force units in their

18.

respective divisions.

Bombs are to be disarmed only by a qualified expert and Agents are not to

assume responsibility for handling them.

FBI Laboratory explosives

specialists are available at all times for consultation and for active

on-site participation in the examining, handling and disposal of live

explosives where the circumstances warrant.

19.

The cooperative facilities of the Bureau which are made available to local

authorities are the services of the Laboratory and Identification Divisions

and coverage of out-of-state leads.

This area of cooperation does not

include searching for bombs,

alternate Agent should be designated to assume

responsibility for the suspect in the absence of the assigned Agent.

If the suspect may personally handle explosives, the latent Fingerprint

Section should be requested to include

him in the appropriate section

of the single fingerprint explosives file.

The effectiveness.of this

lile will depend upon the field offices furnishing complete information

from their files.

This should include the names and aliases, as well

as descriptions and

arrest or FBI numbers of suspects.

In this

connection the Bureau is not interested in the names

of known safecrackers

or persons known to have used explosives unless it is indicated that

they may become involved in bombings.

It is not necessary to maintain a pending file on each suspect; however,

an appropriate administrative device should be maintained to insure

that place of residence and employment and description of automobile will

be verified each six months.

E. INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDU

A preliminary investigation normally covers all of the below-listed procedures.

A limited investigation normally covers all of the below-listed procedures

with the exception the subjects are not interviewed unless they voluntarily

1.

Thoroughly interview complainant and/or victim obtaining complete data,

including names and addresses of subjects, additional victims, and poten-

tial witnesses.

2.

Ascertain reliability and background of the complainant, victim, and/or

subject.

30

Identify subjects and, if possible, suspects and interview them. If any

reason exists for not

interviewing

subject, set forth reason in report.

If the subject, be he a police officer or otherwise, requests the inter-

view be conducted in the presence of his superior or any other single rep-

resentative of his choosing, the interview may be conducted provided

approval of the SAC has been obtained.

insure they do not volunteer the information they will conduct the inter-

view of the subject under such conditions prior to making efforts to conduct

an unrestricted Interview. Any difficulty experienced in connection with

interview of a subject law enforcement officer must be brought to the atten-

tion of the Bureau immediately.

If

a Chief of Police or acting head of

such department declines or indicates a reluctance to make a police officer

available for interview, you should nevertheless advise such official that

it will be

necessary to

personally contact each police officer involved for

a personal expression of his desires.

Your office must then contact each

officer personally and ascertain whether or not he desires to be interviewed.

4.

Interview not only available pertinent witnesses but all known eyewitnesses

to the incident.

5º Check jail and court records when victim has been arrested. If the com-

plaint relates to a federally protected activity, determine what complaints

have been made to local authorities regarding the act of interference and

what, if any, action is contemplated or has been taken.

6.

Check hospital records and interview doctors if victim or subject received

hospital attention and also identify and interview all persons present when

vIctim received medical attention as well as the persons who transported

I accompanied victim to the hospital or doctor. If victim required

medical treatment and if warranted, have victim execute FD-465 (Authority

co Release Medical Information), if he appears legally competent.

under age, FD-465 should be executed by parent or legal guardian..

7.

Take appropriate color and black and white photographs of complained-of

injuries or damage to property if possible and locate and preserve any

physical evidence.

After completion of investigation, unless Bureau instructs otherwise, USA

should be contacted for his views

as to merits of particular case and

whether or not further investigation is desired. If he suggests further

investigation, a report should be submitted showing information developed

and views of USA.

dvise bureau by wire or alrtel, depending on urgency,

oi specific investigation requested, and conduct investigation unless infor

mation known to your office indicates request should be referred to Depart- .

ment before proceeding. USA is not to be advised of your action in this

regard.

If USA is unable or unwilling to furnish his views at time of initial con-

tact, he should be followed on a day-to-day basis until such is obtained.

If USA indicates he desires to furnish his views directly to Department or

views will not be forthcoming promptly, set forth this in report with state-

ment to effect that in light of comments of USA, this matter will no longer

be followed with USA for his determination unless specifically requested

by Department. Report should not be delayed to report additional inves-

tigation but a supplemental report submitted. USA cannot decline prosecu-

tion inasmuch as final determination of prosecution rests with Civil Rights

Division of Department.

Consequently, no arrests are to be made or com-

plaints filed without Bureau authority.

this should be pursued until they are interviewed or justifiable reasons

exist why they cannot be interviewed. The same requirements hold frue for

complainants, known eyewitnesses, doctors who have examined the victims,

police officers, etc.

Procure all evidence possible from which a jury would form the natural

conclusion that the subjects mutually agreed, planned, acquiesced in,

or intended to carry out

the object of their agreement.

Be on the alert for direct evidence of the agreement, such as letters

docunenis,

¡ormal contracts, memoranda, of other papers.

Ascertain what

verbal

statements, admissions, or confessions sach

jects may have made from which the agreements or conspiracy may be

indicated.

Obtain evidence of the acts or transactions, statements,

or communications of subjects that would indicate the existence of

mutuad plas and purpose.

Bear in mind that while

it is not necessary to prove the existence of

a formal agreement in the nature of a contract ii still is necessary

to prove that two

fection of a plan haring as

its object the violation of any lair of

U.S. or committing any fraud against the U.S. in order to fulfill

requirements of element 1;

With regard to proving overt

the Agent should obtain evidence as to each act or transactión

also circumstantial evidence that the act in

Investigative steps and procedures

Preliminary steps

Carefully review

subject's selective service file for Enformation which

will serve as basis for leads.

Unnecessary effort and expense can be

eliminated by thorough and analytical review of selectave service

file preliminary to investigation, and no investigaticz should be con-

ducted prior to such review in absence of good reason to contrary.

Large proportion of cases have been closed in past because subject

found to be IV-I, or incarcerated or confined in penal or mental

institution, or serving in armed forces, or exempt beczuse of prior

service, or coverage,

or because registration fictitious. In many

instances,

selective

service files will contain inforration indicating

or suggesting case will fall into one or another of these categories,

thus giving direction to investigation and enabling intestigator

to select procedure most likely to prove successiul in each

without preliminary wasted motion.

In addition, reviem will disclose

any obvious defects of procedure by local board

indicating premature

referral of case to USA or denial of procedural rights of registrant.

In such cases, USA may desire to return case to board, without

investigation, for further processing.

Placing wanted notices

To eliminate needless searches by Identification Iñvision,

wanted notices should ordinarily not be placed untãl after

preliminary investigation completed.

By this procedure, a local

FBI, or alien registration

be cotained which

will afford positive means of identification. (When wanted-flash-

cancellation notice (FD-165) submitted to Identizacation Division

in Selective Servico

cases where subject being sought for interview

no longer being sought for interview, submit FD-I€5 to Identilication

Division and designate one copy for NIC. Il provess obtained prior

7.. Fictitious registrations

Selective Service Regulation 1613.43a requires local boards to mail

registration certificates (SSS form #2) to registrants not later than

five days after the registrant has been assigned a selective service

By Operations Bulletin #56, local boards were instructed as to

procedure to be followed upon return of a certificate undelivered by

Post Offico Department, i.e.,

to endeavor to contact person listed

as always knowing registrant's whereabouts and employer, if any, listed

by registrant and, if

negative reports are received from

case immediately to USA as possible case of fictitious registration.

Upon receipt of confirming report from USA,

board is authorized to cancel

registration as fictitious.

Upon receipt of such a case from USA,

investigation should be made promptly to ascertain whether registration

is fictitious.

Ordinarily, this can be determined by checking out all

information furnished by subject at time

of ragistration. If information

is false

or cannot be substantiated, registration may be considered ficti-

tious, and form FD-411 should be prepared, of which USA must receive

a copy.

Although fictitious registrations may be motivated by desire for

identifying document to accomplish any of an infinite variety of

purposes, from enlisting in the armed forces or obtaining employment

to evading arrest for desertion or past criminal offenses, majority

of such registrations fall within one of the following categories:

ruthorities so that appropriate

be notified if individuals within registration ages are arrested on

legitimate local

charges and do not possess registration certificates or

• delinquent for nonregistration or otber reasons.

It is to be clearly

understood and imparted to local authorities that no arrests or detentions

for sole purpose of determining whether an individual is in possession

of registration certificate or notification of classification are desired.

Such action may constitute illegal arrest or detention and Bureau will not

be party to

such activities on part of local authorities who may be over-

zealous or attempting to use this aot as authority for arrest

in instances where no grounds for arrest under local laws and ordinances.

Detention of an individual on charge of "hold for FBI," or any similar

phraseology, while registration is being verified must be neither requested

nor tolerated.

It is responsibility of SAC to advise USA of above policy

so there will be no nisunderstanding on his part as to course of action

Bureau will pursue in these cases.

organizations opposed to the act who will distort facts and take any

other action necessary to bring act into public disfavor. Illegal

organizing opposition to act.

Such opposition may assume

refusal or evasion of registration,

these organizations may come in conilict

with either or both of two penal provisions of section 12(a) of Title I

provisions of litle I, as well as hindering or interfering with

N. PRESENTING CASES TO

All pertinent facts relating to reported violations of act should be

thoroughly discussed with USA. A decision as to prosecution should not

ordinarily be sought from USA until evidence has been obtained indicating

violation is wilful, or delinquent has been located and interviewed.

Large number of ragistrants are found by investigation to be

exempt from induction, currently serving in armed forces, or obviously

disqualified physically

or mentally.

Complaints filed with U.s.

Magistrates by Agents in these cases are regarded by public as formal

accusations by Bureau of serious violations of law punishable by severe

penalties.

Good judgment and common sense should be used so that reported

lelinquents are not lightly mronalessay thus stigmatized.

When a USA

indicates in advance he will decline prosecution in lavor oi

compliance

by subject if the violation is nòt willui and subject is willing to comply,

decision as to whether violation was wilful must be made by USA and not by

Accordingly, after location and interview of a delinguent, a11

pertinent facts developed must be presented to Usa for a prosecutive opin-

obtained, if possible, for protection of Agents in

be furnished USA.

such delinquents may be morally unacceptable

The Department has Indicatod Congress intended that the common

Assault is defined in U.S. v. Hand, (26 Fed: Cas. 103):

But it is essential to constitute an assault,

an intent to do some injury should be coupled with the act;

and that intent should be to do a corporal hurt to anoiher."

Use of Army,

"posse

Title 18, USC, & 1385, prohibits the general use of

the Arny

Section 1751 (i) specifically

authorizes the IBI to request assistance from these military

"any statute, rule, or regulation to the contrary

These terms are defined in Title 18, USC, & 1751 (f).

Actual assault, killing, or kidnaping

The FBI is

for the investigation of any actuzl

assault, killing, or kidnaping of those individuals designated

in the statute.

Conspiracy to

kill or kidnap

The FBI shall invostigato conspiracies to kill or kidnap provided

two or more persons are involved and there is an agreement

between coconspirators, as well as the presence of some overt

act, such as obtaining

the instruments, means, or

the execution of such conspiracy.

Attempts to kill and kidnap

The FBI shall investigate actual attempts to kill or kidnap.

An actual attempt to kill or kidnap, even on the part of an

individual acting alone without known coconspirators when there

is activity,

such as obtaining the instruments, means,

other necessities,

so as to indicato an effort

individual

to consummate the attempt, would likewise be investigated by

the FBI.

Attempted assault

SECTION 146.

PROTECTION OF FOREIGN OFFICIALS AND

OFFICIAL GUESTS OF THE UNITE

STATES

146A

BACKGROUND AND DEFINITIONS

1.

Background

The Act for the Protection of Foreign Officials and Official Guests of

the United States was signed into law on October 24, 1972, which provides

for the concurrent iurisdiction of

the Federal Government in the

tion of certain acts committed against foreign officials and official

guests as well as property occupied by foreign governments in this

country.

In enacting this legislation, Congress recognized and reaffirmed

that police power to investigate, prosecute and punish common crimes such

as murder, Kidnaping and assault

should remain with the states, but

also noted that at times the commission of such crimes against

foreign

officials or official guests may adversely affect or interfere with the

conduct of U.S. foreign affairs.

Therefore, Congress felt that the

Federal Government must have jurisdiction in

situations where international

repercussions may be felt or where the incident may have some affect on

U. So foreign relations.

The Department of Justice assigned investigative jurisdiction for this

Act in those cases in which the Federal Government has an interest to the

FBI.

2• Definitions

as to abridge the exercise of rights guaranteed under the First .

Amendment to the Constitution.

Protection of Property of Foreign Governments and International Organiza

tions (I18, ESC $ 970)

shall be fined not more than $10,000, or imprisoned not more than five

years, or both.

DEPARTMENTAL INTERPRETATION OF STATUTES

1.

§1116

Following the precedent of USC $ 1114 (Protection of Officers and

Employees of the United States), the Act adds to T18

new § 1116

relying on the definitions and penalties in I18, use if Illi and 1112,

except that punishment of first degree is mandatory life in prison.

20

The term "foreign official" includes two distinct categories.

With

regard to the. first group, such as Chiefs of State,

the purpose of the

foreign official's presence in the U.S. is immaterial.

With regard to the second group, that is "officials or employees of a

foreign government

or international organization duly notified to the

United States," their coverage under the Act requires they be foreign

nationals and

in the U. So on official business.

Such persons inciude

officials and employees of foreign governments at embassies, consulates,

missions and those employed at trade or commercial offices of foreign

governments.

3.

The family of a foreign official in this second category is included, but

unlike the first category, a family member's presence in the U.S.

must be in connection with the presence in the U.S. of the related

foreign official.

Coverage does not extend to the families of official guests unless the

family members are so

designated in their own right by the Secretary of

State.

§ 1201

The act of kidnaping a foreign official or official guest is punishable

without regard to interstate transportation of the victim. The permissible

punishment was reduced to imprisonment for any term of vears or for

life, but no statutory proof of harm to the victim is required to support

any sentence which may be adjudged.

§ 112

As amended by the Act, & 112 now includes assaulting, striking, wounding,

imprisoning or offering violence to, foreign officials or official guests.

In addition to broadening the classes of persons covered, & 112 (b)

makes it a misdemeanor to willfully intimidate, coerce, threaten or

harass a foreign official or official guest or willfully obstruct a

foreign official in the performance of his duties. Protection against

STATES

obstruction extends only to foreign officials who are actually engaged in

the performance of their duties at the time of the violation.

Although not all-inclusive, examples of violations would be:

Following the foreign official or official

guest about in a public

place after being requested not to do so;

c.

Communicating with the foreign official or official guest by anonymous

telephone calls, or otherwise, in a manner likely

to cause annoyance

or alarm with no purpose of legitimate communication.

§ 112 (c) is intended to protect the peace, dignity and security

of foreign officials in their embassies

consulates, missions, residences,

and offices,

Note that premises of official guests

are not covered

by § 112 (c).

§ 112 (c) does not apply at all to the District of Columbia wherein the

protected zone for both persons and premises begins at 500 feet.

$ 112 (c) applies only to acts done publicly,

and specifically applies to

• person who parades, pickets, displays any flag, banner, sign, placard,

or harass a loreign

official or to obstruct him in the performance of his duties.

The terms used in § 112 (c) "purpose" and "intent" require proof that

the person or persons allegedly violating this section were knowledgeable

that the person or premises against which the alleged violation occurred

were covered under the Act.

Requirement for proof of knowledge ordinarily

would be by putting violators on notice of the provisions of the Act.

4.

This

is

where such knowledge by the person or persons perpetrating

immaterial.

The fact that the person or premises is covered under the

sEe however, must be alleged and proved in order to show FBI jurisdictiona

In addition to covering embassies, consulates, missions to international

organizations and places of residence of foreign officials and official

guests, trade and commercial offices of foreign governments, and premises

and property of international organizations, this section also covers

automobiles and other vehicles and personal

ownership, use or possession.

or unofficial purposes 1s immaterial. Only property located within the

United States is covered.

D.

PROTECTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES OF TREASURY DEPARTMENT

The Act does not limit or interfere with the power of the Secretary of

Treasury in the discharge of his statutory protective responsibilities.

Secret

Service may take such action as may be necessary to implement these responsi-

bilities.

However, the Secret Service shall advise the FBI of

the initiation of : ch action as soon as possible and the results

FBI Indexing Procedures

## Page 124

FBI INDEXING PROCEDURES

The FBI utilizes a system of maintaining its over 6, 500, 000 investigative,

personnel, and administrative files by which all information on a given subject is

channeled into one file. In order to facilitate control of the file and accommodate

multiple subject(s) matters, a numbering system is used to'indicate: (1) general.

classification and nature.of the violation; (2) the individual case file in this category;

and (3) serialization of each piece of mail in the file. For instance, the number

7-100-10 on a piece of mail indicates it is the 10th piece of mail in the 100th file

assigned in the Kidnaping (7) classification. Our files are maintained in 185 classi-

fications. A list of these classifications is attached.

The key to these numerically maintained files is the general index presently

consisting of over 58, 000, 000 index cards on all manner of subject matters but

primarily a name index of individuals. This master index must be searched to

determine what information, if any, the FBI may have in its files. In view of this.

system, each communication must have a subject.

The classifier in the Classifying Unit of the Mail Processing Unit of the

Records Section in the Files and Communications Division designates the "subject"

of the particular communication on which a "main" index card is prepared; assigns

the classification showing the violation or nature of the matter involved; and designate.

names in the body of the communication on which "see" (contraction for see reference

or cross-reference) index cards are to be prepared.

The "main" index card denotes that the name on index card is the subject of

the file and the name on "see" index card indicates the name is not the main subject

of the file but that the name only appears in a specific communication filed in the ille

of a different subject matter.

The subject of the file may be on a variety of topics such as an individual,

organization, company, publication, foreign intelligence activities, or suen adminis-

trative items as space, equipment, or automobile accidents involving FBI automobiles

After the classifier has designated the "subject"' and assigned the classificati

for the communication, the classifier designates the names in the body oi the com-

munication on which "see" index cards are to be prepared. The nature and extent of

## Page 125

detail in the communication require the classifier to utilize judgment as to whether

information should be designated for index cards. The classifier has general guide-

lines for each of the 185 classifications. Generally, in a criminal-type matter, the

following will be cross-indexed: suspects; uncooperative individuals; anyone giving

assistance to the subject such as a person who allowed a bank robber to use his car

while committing a bank robbery; person passing, possessing and disposing of

ransom money; fençes of stolen property; titles of song sheets or films being dis-

tributed in violation of copyright laws; madames and procurers; a person suspected

of harboring a fugitive, and the original complainant in the case.. Complainant is

indexed so that the investigation can be identified should the complainant make inquiry

_- regarding his allegation at a later date..

----

In security-type investigations, the classifier is governed by the type 'of

investigation and the nature and extent of the information in the communication.

The classifier will generally index associates and relatives of the subject; members

of organizations under investigation or determined to be possible subversive; indi-

viduals contributing funds to subversive-type activity; subversive or seditious

publications; writers of articles in subversive or seditious publications; bookstores

specializing in subversive-type publications and related types of information.

As an example of such indexing, the following indexing would occur in con-

nection with a case involving the investigation of an extortion threat against Congress-

man X in which the individual making the threat is unknown. The vast majority of

extortion cases we receive involve threats against individuals by unknown individuals.

As previously stated, each file must have a subject to insure all mail on a matter is

filed in one place. Accordingly, in order to insure that all mail on an investigation

is placed in the same file, the victim's name is used as the subject of the file when

the individual who made the threat is unknown. Accordingly, Congressman X, as

the victim, would be subject of the file for mail filing purposes.

The "main" index

card prepared would show that he is the victim and not the extortionist. "See" index

cards will be prepared on any individuals suspected of writing the threatening letter.

If a suspect is later identified as the extortionist; a "main" index card is prepared

• on his name to indicate we now have a file on this individual as the subject of a

specific criminal investigation.

As previously stated, access to the numerically maintained files is through

the index cards maintained in the general index. The index cards are, accordingly,

retained as long as the file is in existence.

Age of information in FBI files covers a relatively short span of years.

FBI had a relatively small number of files until the President, in 1939, directed the

FBI to be responsible for the internal security of the United States. In view of this

and, as the number of violations of law over which the FBI has jurisdiction has

increased greatly since 1939, the vast majority of FBI files has been created since

НН 54977 DooId:32989723 Page 125

## Page 126

ud,?

1939. We do, however, have a program for destroying files which no longer have

a contemporary value.

Regulations of the National Archives and Records Service,

General Services Administration, issued under authority of Chapters 29, 31, and

33, Title 44, U.S. Code, govern our file retention and destruction procedures.

When the files are destroyed, the "main" and "see" cards for all matters in the

files are pulled from the general index and destroyed.
