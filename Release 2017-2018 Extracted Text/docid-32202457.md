INTERVIEW AND MISTING SUNTARY

Page 3 01 6 3

FILE:

the President probably did not know of the gun transfer, but he said

that the assassination and the U.S. role with respect to it would have

come as no surprise to the President. He doubted that the CIA even

would have had to clear the transfer, although a general policy of that

sort might have been passed by the Special Group.

Goodwin reported no other mention of assassinations. In fact,.

he said he once heard a CIA man say that assassination was a bad idea

because once started, it never ended. However, an agent in the field

might regard killings of one sort or another as within his mission in

supporting one political faction over another. And of course someone

might have gotten carried away. It was clear from the Bay of Pigs that

the CIA sometimes acted without, or even against, instructions (e.g.

by bringing Batista followers into the Bay of Pigs invasion team). In

general, Latin American work seemed to attract the worst personnel in

all Washington agencies

including the CIA.

CIA Activities in Brazil:

Goodwin knew little of CIA activities in Brazil.

The sinited

States had strongby backed Quadros and never liked Coulart. In the

period before 1964, the

Unsa gave political support to anti-Goulart

factions: followers of Kubitschek andseven to the Furtado in the

Brazilian northeast. The U.S, had been involved in Brazilian elections

for many years and presaliably spent a good deal in the 1963 congres-

sional elections On the military side, Walters was brought from Rome

to keep

A contact with the Brazilian military. How much

further

Walters' activities might have extended Goodwin did not know.
