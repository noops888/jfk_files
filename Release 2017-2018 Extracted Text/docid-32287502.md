TP 92-1

On February 21, 1968, SD 1064-C-TE advised that

JOHN ROSELLI is apparently making an effort to take

over

the TCN leadership in California

and in his efforts to

make such an attempt has been in contact with leaders of

the Chicago ICN family and with SANTO TRAFFICANTE, OR.

subsequently, on 3/1/68, SD 1064-C-TE advised that

ROSELLI had recently attempted to get TRAFFICANTE to meet

with him in Los Angeles, but that TRAFFICANTE claimed

could not come to Los Angeles at this time.

Subsequently,

on March 6, 1968, ROSELLl indicated he had

again talked

with TRAFFICANTE and that TRAFFICANTE indicated was too

busy

to make a trip to Los Angeles at this time, but

expected to make it in the near future, and ROSELLI men-

tioned that if TRAFFICANTE did not come to California by

April 15, then ROSELLI hoped to send SD 1064=C-TE to

Florida to meet with TRAFFICANTE.

Om March 13, 1968, CG 6588-C-TE advised that

FELIX ALDERISIO may have had a clandestine meeting with

SANTO TRAFFICANTa in Chicago on March 12, 1968, anc

based such an assumption on the fact that son€

time ago

ALDER ISIO wanted to send a gift to TRAFFICANTE, but did

not have TRAFFICANTE's address and in telephonic contact

with TRAFFICANTE on March 8, had asked TRAFFICANTE fOr

his address and had been told that TRAFFICANTE WOUld nOt

give him his address over the phone, but would give it to

him when he next saw All ERISIO.

Informant remarked that

on March 12, 1968, ALDERiSI had had the informant drop

him at an innocuous place in the Chicago Inn area and

later, when rejoining the informant, ALTERISIO handed the

informant a piece of paper with the address 740 Northeast

155th Street, North, Miami, Florida, and told informant

this was TRAFFICANTE's address and to send the gift to that

address.

On March 14, 1968, TP 120-C advised that TRAFFICANTE

had departed the Tampa, Florida area, 2/8/68, and had not

returned to the Tampa area until March 13, 1968.

Informant

mentioned that during the time TRAFFICANTE was absent from

the Tampa area, his daughter and her family had also been

absent and that during this period of time, informant had

determined that there were no secret access or hiding

places at the TRAFFICANTE residence. Informant did discover

a hand weapon

which is the first gun known to have been

in TRAFFICANTE's possession,

but informant not familiar

with weapons, therefore, unable to identify type at this

time. Informant also was able to advise during the time

the entire family was

absent from the TRAFFICANTE residence,

Mrs. TRAFFICANTE's father would arrive at the residence

during the late afternoon

and remain in the residence

until

the following morning.
