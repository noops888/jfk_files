to his departure from Florida.

He believes that on the one occasion

when he spoke to Alex. Alex mentioned his classes on labor unlons, and

the subject said he put him off by saying that he would be in touch

with him later. The Subject stated that on the several occasions

prior to his departure for-Florida he avaided talking to Alex because...

of Mr. SHROUDI's admonition against becoming any further Involved

with these people.

6. With respect to his midnight trip to New lork in the campany

of Alex PASSIKLOFF and Al SMITH, I asked the Subject what his wife's

resction was to this rather hasty decision. The Subject replied that

his wife is usedto his mandering and did not question bin nor express

any surprise in any wy. He explained that his wile is more the home

The Subject described his marriage as a happy one and states that he

and his vile and six year old boy live In perfect barmony.

was a walte wounn. He was never introduced to his host and hostess

and never heard their names.

8. I asked the Subject how he knew that marijuana was being

smoked during this get together. He stated that Ray ROBINSON told bim

they were smoking "pot". Ray offered him one but he refused and used

ing got to say o

as an excuse that he had once tried it but had become 111. Although

Ray was the only person whom he saw smoling, it was obvious from the

number of hand rolled cigarette butts in the ash tray that others had

also smoket it.

He described the meeting as being made up of little

groups of people sitting around on the floor who paid no particular

attention to him. Alex talked to him about labor organization and

advised him that he conducted classes and Subject could join his class.

Alex did not say where or when these classes were held and Subject did

not pursue it any farther. Subject states that he had not drunk mich

at this time possibly four or five drinks, however, he was interested

In what was going on and purposely held back on the liquor.

9. From Corcoran Street he accompanied Alex and Ray to Alex's

much as one hour there and had one drink going from there to jazz land

on 14 Street. Wille at Alex's room he saw that Alex had numerous copies

of the WORKER displayed. Alex told him that he had all kinds of ltere-

he could provide that person with the particular literature to his liking.

his life and bad been jailed for them on occasion.

10. Subject was next questioned about the events leading up to

his arrest with Ray ROBINSON in November 1964. The Subject stated that

on that particular evening Ray had Invited him to his brother's home

to meet his brother and sister-in-law.

The Subject does not remember

where this house is located. He states that the brother is named Robert

ROHINSON and he is an employee of the District of Columbia government.

He is reported to be a radio technician servicing radios on cars owned

by the District of Columbia. During the course of the hour or so that

he apend there there was no talk of civil rights. Ray had told him

that his brother 1s not a civil rights worker and Ray 18 constantly

trying to recrult him.

home in Forrestville. While they were there the Subject consumed

several scotches while Ray talked with Subject's wife. Ray showed

liquor suddenly hit him and he stopped the car. He moved over to

perndt Ray to drive. The Subject belleves that the scotch on top of

the bourbon he'd had at the brother's house coupled with the lack of

sleep the night before put him out. Subject was very vague concerning

the circumstances surrounding his arrest. He vaguely recalls a police

officer talking to him and recalls being placed in the patrol vagon.

The Subject denies fighting with Ray and stated that Ray was pushing

and shoving him in an effort to rouse him. Ray told him that he wanted

to take him somewhere for coffee to help him sober up. Subject claims

that at first he thought perhaps Ray had done something which antagonized

the officer thereby causing their arrest. He stated that he called

the officer a day or so later to ask what had actually happened and

learned that it was the officer's impression that they had been fighting.

The officer stated he locked them up for his own protection.

13. The Subject was again reminded that he was remiss in his duties

In not reporting this at the time. The Subject stated in order to justify

condition it would have been another matter.

book store. Alex is supposed to have said, "don't leave your government

job, you are just where we want you in the Pentagon." Subject stated

that his reply. to this was just a laugh. The subject claims that at

this point he had adopted a rather frivolous attitude toward Alex.

He

explained further that he considers him dangerous. By this he does not

mean that he was personally afraid of Alex, but that he recognized him

as a revolutionary. The Subject quoted ROBINSON as saying that Alex

worked against "nick" and Ray sighted an incident where Alex kept trying

to stir up the looters in Brooklyn, New York in 1964 when snick was trying

to calm them down.

that they were not in sympathy with Communism, where upon Alex became

very angry and finally waxed sullen. Subject was next asked for his

empression of the WE DuBois group in New York. He stated that it was

clear to him that this organization was dominated or heavily infiltrated

by CP members. He states that Alex circulated throughout the hall talking

to various groups and paid little attention to him. The Subject was

approached by an elderly well-dressed negro man who obviously commended

great respect from other members of this organization. Inis man, whose

name he did not learn, spoke to him at length the tennor of which was

that the United States is the aggressor In Viet Nam.

to this office at 900 hours on 28 September.
