I have considered this matter, discussed It with

appropriate agent and supervisory. personnel of the Mobile

move on kING's Washington Spring Project.

KING has quite a following in and around the Selma,

Ala. area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion

at the church of Reverend I. I. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

KING's appearance, was running

; for mayor of Selma.

ANDERSON

was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated

with the idea that it can be given to a friendly newspaper

contact such as David Lawrence, who is Editor of the U.s.

News and World Report.:

The article was prepared because the cry

of "black power" is a most timely issue in the country today.

This issue has split the civil rights novenent and

has caused

civil rights leaders to take sides for and against "black

power."

However, Martin Luther King has

been attempting

to straddle the issue, based on advice gives him by his

advisors with communist backgrounds. The attached article

indicts King for his failure to take a stand on the issue

and. at the same time exposes the degree of communist influence

on ;him

"5.

It is felt the public should again be .

reminded of this communist influence on King, and the

current controversy among civil rights leaders makes this

timely to do so.

The attached article has been prepared with

no letterhead relating it to the FBI and is on unvatermarked

bond paper.

On the other hand,

he Director's schedule had caused him to not accept these invitations. I explained the

Director's heavy schedule and the fact that he was reluctant to leave Washington whie

Congress was in session.

Upon leaving, Dr. Olds assured me that no information would be release

and none would be attributed to the FBI. I told him that we would, of course, deny any

such information had been furnished. At this point he advised me that, of course, his

main reason for coming to the FBI was to determine if we could suggest any course of

action he might take. I told him we could suggest nothing, that any action taken was

entirely up to him.

ACTION:

For recora purposes.

King's strong criticism and

condemnation of the

Administration's policy on Vietnam in a speech he made at New Tori

on 1/4/67 shows how much he has been influenced by communist

advisors. His speech was a direct parallei of the communist

position on Vietnam.

Both agreed that there was no way at this time that the con-

tract with SCLC could be gracefully canceled without causing

severe and embarrassing repercussions. He stated, however,

that in view of the infornation received, both he and the

Secretary are in agreement that steps will be taken to insure

that no further

contracts will be awarded to King's group.

has advised that King recently completed

cipating in benefit programs to raise funds for the SCIC.

While

on this tour, King took an excessive dosage of sleep ing

Ac-

coxding to the source, King not only "traveled, ate, and drank

first class but slept with his secretary and óthers."

RE:

SECURITY MATTER - COMMUNIST

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS:

At a staff meeting recently, King announced

the Ford Foundation had granted his organization a quarter

of a million dollars. King did not state how this money 4

was going to be used.

OBSERVATIONS:

It is interesting to note that King's group

will only get $250,000, a large sun, but considerably

smaller than the original amount. Perhaps our measures

had some effect in causing this reduction. In view of

King's current announcements indicating he will hold a

Camp-in at Washington, D. C., across from the White House,

it is felt the President would be extremely interested l

In the source of these new funds being made available

to SCLC.

PURPOSE:

Attached for your approval for dissemination to

editorial attacking Martin Luther King, JI., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

BACKGROUND:

Прудети

Dil 1: 29:91

313/81509nhamne

King's group is in desperate need of funds. In

an effort to combat this problem, King has organized

variety show starring Harry Belafonte, well-known Negro

vocalist with a subversive background, to tour seven major

cities in the United States. The proceeds will go to the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. King is touringS

• with the group and speaks during each performance.

The attached editorial entitled/

Think Iwice

Before Going to Coliseum Tuesday Night" appeared in the

/Texas. This paper attacks King for his Stand on Vietnas Pl

"forward limes," the leading Negro newspaper in Houston,

and clains his appearance in Houston is "an imposition on

the cormunity." King is also referred to as "a misguided

'Moses' who has lost himself."

In addition, the article

claims King's position regarding the Vietnan war "borders

upon treason." Further, "a man who will not fight for his

country hasn't got any civil rights or any respect due hin."

In addition, the advanced

performance on October 17, 1967.: This newspaper story

may have caused many of the citizens of Houston to "think

twice before going" and indeed, not go at allo

It is felt that if this article is given wide-spread

000000071

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated, among other things, thai Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed ott onto an

rextremely dangerous course wnich ran

fin the opposite direction from the civil

frights leadership course that vast

numbers of citizens.had come to know

and respect him for over a wide span of

years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear:

that this newspaper, of course, respects

and upholds Dr. King's right to take &

• position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. If he wishes

to be the spokesman for the 'peaceniks',

that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

§that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already beset with,

jmore in-depth and complicated problems

than can apparently be coped with, at that!

¿point we call it our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday night is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We also

thin' that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subterfuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of "peaceniks' to use her name to

further their efforts, all that we cay say?

is, "that's her business." It she wakes up.

Plater and finds that she has acted just

Tise Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that

we can say is that she broughtit all upon

nersell.

Our concern is not so much with what

course Dr. King and Miss Franklinelect

to 10llow. pat concerns us is that the in-

WH 55070 DocId: 32989755 . Page 62

nocent public, it not properly tore-

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that if wha: Dr. King

phas to say Isn't within itseitmeritorious :

enough to draw a crowd, he shouldn't be

¡coming to town in the first place to say

it. As it stands now, Aretha Franklin'Si

name has been added to the show and many

people will pay the lee expecting to hear !

her sing. She will be the "bait" to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once!

inside, the trappedticket purchasers will

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews

about the "immorality of tha war in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the :

United States of Ainerica is at war with

a determined aggressor. How wegotinto

this war matters little at this point. The

"Doid truth is that we are shooting "live'

ammunition at them and they are shoot-

ling the same type back at us with re-

"markable etfectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andi;

realistically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonafide American

citizens, must take a stand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver-

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no ald and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

immoral and wher. Martin Luther King

preaches about how immoral the Ameri-

can bullets are and tails to otter us and

alternative for stopping those immoral

bullets being fired at our boys, we havel

got to tave the ex-civil rights worker-

•to task for his oversight.

There is no middle ground here for any

misguided "Moses who has lost him-

self_King zot lost just outside of Chica-

go in a town called Cicero and he hasn't

been the same since. We cannot sit by

and allow him to lose thousands of

Negro citizens also just because he can't

find his own way.

Crispus Attucks didn't call the cause

at Boston Commons "Immoral". He

stood up like a man and tell like a proud

soldier. From that moment on, tota black

sand white men have stood up for Amen-

: Ca. Negro citizen soldiers have stood

like men and fallen, it need be, on battle

fields in tar away places all over the

world every since Crispus Attuck first

stood up back in the beginning. This na-

tion has grown strong and it is respected

and, yes, even feared, because we have

• been blessed by the Almighty Grace of

God to have strong men at the right place

jat the needed time who didn't mind stand-

jing up for right, for God andfor Country.

It then is not reasonable that we now.

should settle for anything less than what

the most courageous bave done.

As we see it, Dr. Martin Luther King

is suggesting that we Negroes take some-.

thing lesser than the courageous route:

•If he follows the same pattern that he has

tollowed in his other "remarks" made

in other cities, he will dwell upon Negro

problems just long enough to get the at-

tention of the listeners and then he will

-suddenly shitt to the hard-sell of taking:

the lesser route in the war that this

country is now engaged in.

FORIVARD TIMES tirmly believes that

•in the long run we will lose any and all

respect that the total community might

now hold for us. Our job is to try and

build more respect and not tear down

the little we atready have...

that this will continue despite people

like Martin Luther King and company.

It puzzles us how

Harry Belafontr

was selected to headline a show that was

supposed to be aimed in thereg-ointer-

real concern he has for the sumering of

Negro womanhood. As tie recall, once ne

got famous, he quit his Negro wite and

married a white woman. We doz't have

anything against marrying white women,.

but when you do, don't come into Hous-

During the evening of March 29, 1968, the police

received numerous calls of reported fire bombings, vandalism,

and looting over a wide area primarily in the Negro neighbor-

hoods. but many of these proved to be unfounded on investigation.

Lux advised that the cufrew imposed by Mayor Henry Loeb on the

night of March 28, 1968, continued on the night of March 29,

1968, but that it was a

loose curfew in that any individual

on the streets who had identifications would have nothing to.

worry about provided he could give a plausible explanation as

to his purpose in being there. This meant that theatres,

places of amusement, and restaurants and other functions

normally operating at night would be uninterrupted. He

stated

that riot damage resulting from the March 28, 1968,

window breaking and looting was estimated by insurance

officials at approximately $400,000 not including the mis-.

cellaneous fires. He pointed out fortunately none of the

fires were serious. This would not, of course, include

losses due to interrupted business days because many office

managers, store owners, governent agencies, including

Federal, state and county, dismissed their employees early

both on March 28 and 29, 1968, in order to avoid trouble.

He stated that the Memphis city buses were operating throughout

March 29, 1968, but would stop around 7:00 Poli. and that in

the near future it was anticipated that they would be operating

of a full-time basis.

Lux advised that Tennessee National Guardsmen are

bivouacked at the National Guard Armory on Central near the

Mid-South Fairgrounds and on the military side of the

Memphis Metropolitan Airport. He stated that there are

approximately 4,000 troops from the west and middle Tennessee

National Guard

units on duty in Memphis. He had no knowledge

as to when they would be pulled out, but predicted that they

He pointed out that school absenteeism in the

city school system in Memphis on March 29, 1968, was nearly

40,000 and that the largest number of truants were at the

predominantly Negro high schools.

Lux stated that the oaly injury reported during

the day was to Memphis Police Patrolman E. W: MAXYELL,

whose finger was severely cut while he was arresting a

drunk young Negro who was fighting with other officers on

•Polk Street north of Chelsea; which is in a predominantly

Negro neighborhood. He stated that at about 1:15 P.M.,

officers arrested two white youths, namely Samuel R.

iaddell, age 20 o1 2581 Kallien, Larry Williams,

He stated that he had been informed that

officers seized a .22 caliber rifle in Williams living room.

He did not have the details of the arrest. He stated many

of those arrested for looting were youngsters ranging from

8 to 12 years of age.

These were being turned over to

semphis Juvenile Court.

The Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper, Saturday

morning

issue, March 30, 1968,

reported in detail

• cerning activities of Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr-, on

Harch 29, 1968, and stated in a story

on page

1'by Reporter

Thomas BeVier that King came to Memphis to star in what was

billed as a "dress rehearsal" for his April 22, 1968,

"Poor People's Crusade" on Washington, D. C. The story

as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968, for

another mass march and was quoted as saying.

"We are.

to have a massive non-violent demonstration in Memphis."

The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,

the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing

militancy of black youth - anyone can say with certainty

that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

King stated in the interview,

"I am convinced

we can have a non-violent demonstration" but was reported

as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that

there would not be any violence.

The story stated that it

was significant that King was more than a half hour late

for his 11:30_A.M. press conference because he was meeting

with three members of a Black Power group, which the paper

referred to as "The Invaders." . BeVier stated that these

three young men refused to give their names and stated that

they would give their own press conference at a later time.

-

$29 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also known as

the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he

in the Negro community who were "talking about violence."

He stated, "We (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the

march.

Our intelligence was nil."

He said that it he had

known there were persons likely to start violence, he would

have had them made parade marshals, a move which he said had

been successful in other marches.

•:.

He was reported as being critical of the press

for reporting that he left the march in haste after the

trouble started on March 28, 1968.

He claimed that he left

calmly because he said, "I will not lead a violent march."

He said that while he

"walked" with aides to a car, he was

"agonizing over what had happened.". The story reported that

Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the

police radio at approximately 11:27 A.M., Thursday,

March 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-

ship as. Dr. King had asked for a police escort away from.

the march a few minutes after the first report of violence

during the march. King was reported in the story as saying

he.did. not think the riot "will in any way affect" his

Washington plans for his Poor People's Crusade to commence

April 22, 1968. He said he is undecided as to how much of

his SCLC

staff

he can spare to organize the next massive

march in Memphis early in April 1968.

The story said that later in Washington, D. C.,

Rev, Andrew Young, Dr. King's top lieutenant, said that the

main thrust of the Washington demonstration would be delayed

for about two weeks and that steps would be taken to avoid

violence and that a "symbolic delegation," including King

would reach Washington on April 22, 1968. The story continued

that King claimed that Thursday, March 28, 1968, march was

"poorly planned". which the paper

said amounts to criticism

of Rev. James M. Lawson, Jr., whon Dr. King himself had called

"the leading non-violence theoretician in the country." The

paper reported that Lawson is in charge of the strategy for

the Memphis Negro ministers; also known as COME,. and is pastor

of the Centenary Methodist Church and continued that Lawson

did not entirely agree with King's assessments.

The story stated for instance that King had said

that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had

said that there had been a lack of communication between them

and the ministers and that they felt "rejected." Rev. Lawson

was quoted by the paper as saying, "There has been communication.

I don't accept that," referring to King's statement.

The

paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked

•King to come to Memphis and that for about 10 years Lawson

has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that

Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration is

possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons

King was asked to come to Memphis. Lawson stated, "We didn't

bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the Student Non-

Violent Coordinating Committee), we' brought in King."

was reported to have further said that there were other

reasons for bringing in king, one being to give the movement.

• in Memphis a "national image" and another was to strengthen

the leadership of the Memphis ministers.

The same March 30, 1968, issue of The Commercial

Appeal newspaper had à lead editorial on page 6 entitled,

"King's Credibility Gap," which stated that "wartin Luther

is known as the Black Organizing Project(BOP) and is affiliated

with Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

(SNCC), which

has national headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia.

It is led by

John Burrell Smith and Charles Cabbage. !

"In connection with anouther investigation conducted

February 16, 1968, Charles L. Cabbage and John Burrell Smith

cabbage and John Smith advised

that some of their

followers wear the words "The Invaders" on their jackets

and John Smith stated that he personally wears these words:

on his jacket but that this is merely a name which some of

them have adopted and that it is all part of the BOP organi-

zation.

As recently as March 30, 1968,

that many teenagers in Memphis have put the word "Invaders"

on backs of their jackets, although they are not necessarily

connected with the BOP organization. They do this more or

less as a symbol of. their self-professed affinity with

Black Power.

pointed out therefore that the mere

fact that one wears the word "Invaders" does not mean that

he is a part of any organized movement, that the only known

organized Black Power movement in Memphis is that of BOP

headed by Cabbage and John B. Smith and the above mentioned

governing body. He pointed that, for example,!

had an audience with Martin Luther King, Jr.,

of March 29, 1968, were the hereinbefore identified. Charles

Laverne Cabbage, the hereinbefore identified Charles Harrington,

and Calvin Leroy Taylor, a male Negrowno: resides at 347 West

Waldorf and who is a senior at Memphis State University:

Taylor works part-time as a copy boy at the Commercial Appeal

newspaper. Taylor has recently told source 2 that he is a

part of the BOP group, which is affiliated with SNcC and

that he has been serving as a liaison representative oi

BOP with the COME group, with the Negro ministerial group,

which is coordinating the strike support.

Taylor further

stated that when Harrington, Cabbage, and Taylor had an.

audience with King that their purpose in seeing King was to

tell King that they wanted more of the "action" in Memphis

feeling that they were not getting enough of the action.

Taylor refused to elaborate but source 2 conjectured that

by this Taylor meant that the Black Power group wanted more

.. of a position of leadership and more policy making position

in the over-all Negro movement in Memphis:

Source 2 also advised that the newsmen in Memphis

and other officials will interchangeably use the word

"Invaders" when they are actually referring to BOP and pointed

out that it had been ascertained that actually the Black

Power movement in Memphis uses several names, such as Afro-

American Brotherhood, Black Student Association, BOP, and

Invaders and that Taylor has told him confidentially that

actually there are only about 12. to 15 hard-core BOP

people in Memphis and that the others are merely followers

or people who tend to imitate them. Source 2 also stated

that he had reliably learned from several individuals who

in the March 28, 1968, march when the trouble began, that the

actual BOP people did

not participate in any of the vandalism

or looting although prior to the meeting several of them,

exact identities not known to source 2, had been agitating

the young high school age Negroes who were preparing to

participate in the march by indicating that there should be

trouble and that Memphis was not worth saving and that it

should burn, and other inflammatory utterances to this effect.

On the afternoon of March 29, 1968; a third

source advised that Rev. Martin Luther

This language alnost suggests

some degree

adherence to teachings of ELIJAH

MUELANGLAD.

It is suggested the proposed publicity might be

slanted to convey the thought that the apparent alliance

between

SCLe. and the MOI possibly grew out of the former

meeting between KING and AMANAD; that in connection with

the WSP SCIC is "pushing" the NOI in Baltimore.

This, of

course, would raise a question as to the sincerity, of

KING'S

curzent statements that the WSP is to be based on nonyiolent

techniques because the position of che Mol tovard the white

man is

basically one of amihilation.

While KING is currently seeking

• the

cooperation of

other organizations to assist with SCLO's. WSP he has shown no

willingness to use SCLC to assist any other organization.

In effort to finance the WSP, SCLC plans to seek

financial contributions fron Negro churches.

Establishing

the thought of an alliance with the NOI which is opposed to

Christianity may well discourage a favorable reaction on the

part of some

Negro churches.

It is felt KING's reaction to the proposed technique

would:be positive for counterinelligence purposes.

The Hilton Havailan Village is a complex of five

steel and concrete tovers, each approzinately fifteen steries

tall,

linked together by

a series of 2-story concrete motel-like

buildings with perhaps 75 independent shops, restaurants, bars,

etc. arcund a huge open-air lobby.

In inspection of the halls

and the rooms revealed that the civicing walls vere made of

four inch concrete blocks.

•The Hilton Hawaiian Village has.

approxinately 1100 separate accommodations,. rcors, suites,

and pent houses with roon for approvinataly 2500 people.

Literally hundreds ane moved in and out of the hotel every day

accorcing to a fixed schedule, whereby they spend a certain

length of time at this hotel in donclulu, nove cut to other

islands to rake way forlather tourists to core in, and return to

the Hawaiian Village when the other tourists move out.

Through yr. ED FASTINGS, a SAC contact, and a personal

friend of SAC PRICE, "I. PRICE began a most discreet inquiry to

determine where the subject and his party were to be located.

It was discovered that the hotel is booked up so full and has

so rany cornitrents on a continuous basis, that it ordinarily

books blacks of ?cons and suites by type and price rather than

making individual assigments to guests vino hava made reservations;

thus, it would know that on a dertain day it would need, for

example, 100 s20.00 roors, 50 $25.00 roors,

and 40 $30.00 rooms,

but would not indiviaually assien then until after the incividual

guest had registered at the hotel. This was the case with regard

to the HAFTIN LUTHE? KItE panty.

lo specieic space had yet been

assigned and for security reasons it was determined best by the

SAc and by the agents on special assignment, that as

far as

possible, the hotel be allowed to follow normal booking procedures.

In the meantime, Ses CLIFFORD and LYMal proceeded

establish their identities as tourists in the hotel and its

environs. The fionolulu office has ter cars assigned to it,

211

of which

are relatively well known and all of which are equipped

with 2-vay radios.

The hrents on special assignment expiored the

possibility nitr

the SfC and experienced Agents of the rionolulu

Office of switching license plates on one of their cars and

utilizing it on the special assignment, but the considered opinion

of all concerned sas that security might be lost by such an

arrangerent and it was, therefore, resclved to rent à fertz car

right at the hotel for use during

the special assignment.

Under secure concitions, SAs CLIFFORD and LYMAN

unpacked

and experimerted with all of the Bureau equiprent

sent out or brought cut to Honolulu under conditions as closely

approximating what was anticipated in the actual investigation..

They found that all of the equipment worked vell and vould be

effective is we could arrange to be no more than che room away

Due to the neavy concrete

construction of the towers composing the hotel, approsinately

one-half of the radio transmitting equipnent. rould not be

effective at ary great distance because its sigral vas somewnat

overshadoned by a porenful local TV station.

2/16/64, the experiments continued and

PPICE most discreetly pushed his efforts to have definite space

issigned to the Subject's panty and to locate the special assign-

ment Agents along sice the Subjects.

The Kahala Filton Hotel is the newest and perhaps the

most luxuricus in the

entire hilton chain.

It was opened for

business in January,

1904, nes luxurious suites furnished at

man-made lake between a gols course and the sea. It is of solid

concrete construction, ten stories

SAS CLIFFORD and Will personally made a most discreet

survey of the hotel during

Sunday evening, 2/16/64, rade as much as a survey as was possible

of the

situation at the nahala filton.

It was possible to obtain a roch for these Agents in

another tower aporcrinately 100 yards away fron the roon

occupied by SAs CLIFIDED and inlei. On. Sunday afternoon

experiments were conducted with the equipment over this extended

space

and it was found that rost of the equipment worked very

well even at that distante through concrete walls and glass

windows, but that the IV station interferred with some. of the

equipment on certain wave lengths.

On Honday, 2/17/54, SAC PPICE vas able to arrange that

the subject and his

party be placed in Suites 404 and 405 of the

(. ocean tover building of the Hilton Hawaiian Village

that SIs CLIFFORD and LyMeN would be river the suite numbered

406 along side that to be occupied by the princival Subject (405)

end that the otner three agents aculd be given the suite

numbered 403. One complicating factor was that no clace

in the entire comples did the hotel have uncccupied space

available allowing the designation of four

Another complication was the fact that the Subjects

were due to land at the airport at 12:50 p.r., Tuesday, 2/18/64,

and could be expected to be at the hotel at approxirately

1:30 p.m.

on that date, but three of the four rooms were occupied

and could be ezpected to be occupied until the checkout time of

This provided the

necessary coverage which was activated when the principal Subject

SAC PRICE of Honolulu, with funds from the San Francisco

confidential fund, is settling the bill for the roors used for

experiments and for. the toners at the

Hanalian Village Hotel and

will forward the bills to sA CLIFFORD, who will voucher and blue

slip same.

OBSEPVATICHS AND PECOMMENDATIONS:

(1) No matter what its size in population, Honolulu

is basically

a resort srall town

all the

Bureau personnel who participated in the investigation agreed

that the bureau was extremely wise in designating this operation

to be handled as a special assignmert in a semi-undercover

capacity by Special Agents fror. arother territcry who were not

snown as Special Agents ir the licnolulu area.

The Honclulu

Office

and the Sar Francisco Agents are convinced that such an assign-

ment could not have beer. carried out with full security by the .

Honolulu hgents therselves because they are too well known in

this comparatively small toun. *

(2) Although using only five Agents to make technical

surveys, technical installations, provide theix

own security,

conduct discreet nearby fisurs of

Subjects and

potential subjects, and contact anchymous scurces means that the

manpower is

spread

very thin especially where

two separate

hotels are involved, it is believed that the use of an experienced

coordinated special assignment crew may very well be the best

way to attack

this problem.

13). The sac and the local fil Office are Indispensable

to the successful operation of such a speci

assigment. The two big questions that the local SAC has to be

a position to answer are: (a) Exactly where is the Subject

going

to Is? and (b) Can we get a room next to him?

Agents on

special assignment cannot walk in cold in any area,

ruch less

a crovided resort area, and accomplish this with. full security.

It is

; the considered airion of

teents wino participated in

this special assignment that he would have been spared much anxiety

and lasturinute improvisation if the Honolulu SAC could have

been advised in advance, with utmost security, that he rould

be called upon to determine where the Subject was staying

and to obtain acjacent space ior the Agents on special assignment.

This is a suggestion for the Bureau to consider in the event

it plans future special assements ci this sort.

This one

worked nell due to the exceilence ca the contacts.

...

(4) The playihe of IV sets in the room and the

operation os incividual air conditioning

units both presented a considerable problen which nade sore of

the conversations alrost, ií not completely; unintelligiale.

These particular Subjects

seemed to have a tendercy to turn

in the evening hours.

(WASHINGTON SPRING PROJECT)

ReBuairte1.3/11/68.

Chicago has carefully reviewed the Nation of Islam (NOï)

file concerning the suggestion in referenced airtel concerning

publicity circulated

to possibly embarrass jashington Spring

Project (WSP) efforts in Baltimore through a suggested alliance

between forces of MARTIN LUTHER KING and the NOI.

Additionally,

By way

OI

background,

the Bureau is aware, KING and

ELIJAH NUHAMNAD, head of the NOI, met briefly in Chicago during

2/86 under amicable circumstances, primarily as a result of MARTIN

LUTHER KING's then recent entry, onto, the Chicago civil rights scene

The meeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation,

unity or program was concerned, however,

did receive considerable

local publicity.

The meeting was basically for the purpose of

showing unity within the Negro community.

KING suffered no adverse publicity as a result of this

meeting although within several days MUHAMMAD, at an annual NOI

Convention, made remarks critical of KING for

the white man.

In reaction to these remarks publicly, KING

glossed over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,

indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the

cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments of regro.

opinion. Indeed,

as recently as S/G7, MUHAMMAD indicated a desire

to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and Atlanta are aware, KING and CASSIUS

CLAY

were in personal contact in louisville,

Kentucky, in 5/67,

in the course of open housing demonstrations hold under scic

auspices.

In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meetings.

KING was quoted as having praised Clit for his refusal to be

inducted into the armed forces, coupling this reference to attacks

on our policy in Vietnam.

The NOI publication "Muhammad Speaks"

was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,

including a comment that CIAY had given up $1, 000, 000 in order

to stand up for what his conscience dictated as right.

In short it would appear generally to be true that

contact between KING and the NOI is not a heretofore unknown

happening

and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in

Baltinre must indicate more than casual assoziations or contacts,

but in order to embarrass or inhibit IS! efforts should indicate

close working relationship or partnenship between the two groups.

It should be kept in mind. also, however, that as the

above sources note, although ClAY is nationally known for his

adhorance to the NOI, he is also somewhat universally acclained

and embraced by most grouys within the Black Nationalist Lovement,

CORE, and SNCE as examples, as well as the black community genezally

and has achieved somewhat the status of a martyred black folk hero.

D.

King is currently holding the first of two workshops

from 2/19-23/68 at Miami, Florida. He has invited approximately

150 Negro ministers throughout the nation to attend this meeting.

The Ford Foundation recently gave King's organization a $230,000

grant to hold these workshops in an effort to develop responsible

leadership in the Negro ghetto areas of the nation's major cities.

It ha's been determined that King plans to discuss the Washington

Spring Project at this workshop.

told Jone that he had accepted these engage-

ments because some of his Rabbi friends trave been telling him that Jers

were not supporting the civil rights movement. Hing believes this is in

part due to anti-Semitic statements being made by Negroes such as Malcolm

(the Huslim leader). King thought it would help improve the situation if

spoke before these groups.U

King's Fund-raising Activities:

King told Jones that he would be in California 2/25-27/65 to atten

a big lund-raising project. It will include a showing of the novie "The

Greatest Story Ever Told" and

it would "scare the house of about $28,000."

In addition, there are two or

• three wealthy people trying to get 50 couples

to give $1,000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 commitments

already.

King claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC); needs the money desperately.

discussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, Which King said already had

$5,000 and desired to use it for a fund-raising project to earn even more.

Jones told King that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York

Times" 2/5/65 soliciting lunds on behalf of the SCIC cost $2,000. King sa:

that his office had already received $12,000 as a result of this advertise-

ment. U

Friction Between King and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee •

In discussing the current racial situation in Alabama, King told

Jones that SNCC was again saying that King likes to come into a situation

at the last minute, get all the publicity and the benefit of contributions

IC claims that King makes "grandstand plays" after SNCC has done all the

eld sork. King asked Jones if something could be done about this througl

Harry Belafonte (noted Negro singer).

According to Jones,

Belafonte is

about the only person that SNCC will listen to and that he has heard

Belafonte stop SNCC workers who tried to attack King's integrity.

said that he did not like for SNCC to fight against the idea of having a

leader for the whole novenent. King stated that the movement must have a

leader because any ideology is fostered around having a leader around rhom

supporters can rally. Jones believes that he can arrange an unpublicized

meeting between SNCC,

SCIC and Belafonte.U

Comment:

The naked boldness of King's egotism is vividly reflecte.

in his pronouncements about the movement needing a leader (obviously Kins

himself). U

OESERVATIONS:

It 1s belleved that an examination of recent income tzr

returns of king might well reveal information which could assist the

Bureau in its efforis to discredit King or neutralize his effective-

iness. this is possibly applicable also 11 the income tax returns of

the sole and the Gandhi society were reviered. In view of the possi

bility that the SCLC has already been under some investigation by IFS,

a request for the results of such investigation is indicated.

tre also

had information in late 1953 that the Gandhi Society vas negotiating

with IRS relative to tax exemptions and therefore the results of any

IRs investigation of that society would be worth procuring. t:

::..

To date ve have been nost discreet and circumspect in our

handling of the king investigation, as vell as corollary investiga-

tions such as Icvolving around organizations, because of the position

King has not only as a clergynan, but also as a "respected" regro

#eader:

It is therefore essential thai our current requests of the

IRS which are herein being recommended be handled in a manner thich

would provide for optimum security so that neither king nor any other

unauthorized Indiviuals may becone aware of the Bureau's interest

and so that no embarrassment ray come to the Bureau. For this reason,

the attached memoranda are classified "Secret."

It is recormended that the Liaison Section obtain tho

Pursuant to the Director's request, there is attached

a detailed senorandun concerning the efforts of the Communist

Party, USa, to erploit the American Negro.

There is set forth below in this cover memorandun

synopsized version of the detailed memorandum.

SYNOPSIS

093112 85

The 19 million Negroes in thaiso

United States toda

constitute the largest and nost important racial target of the

Communist Party, USA.

Since 1919 connunist leaders have devised

countless tactics and programs designed to penetrate and control

no population. It has spent

hundreds of thousands of dollars

pagandizing the Negroes in

a variety of ways.

These colossal

forts have been related to "equal opportunity" and "self-

determination" policies (the latter being discontinued in 1959

with the auproval of Soviet Pussia because, it was ineffective),

front organizations, parades, denonstrations, articles, pamphlets,

books, Illus, speeches,. civil rights,

"peaceful coexistence,"

et cetera.

These eidorts, among other things, have resulted in

establishing today suca active Negro communist

front groups as

the MIrICan ATerIcan Heritage AsSocIatIOn, Ireedomways Associates,

and Sosthern Conferenca Educational Fund (not yet cited by the

attorney General). Additionally, efforts have been and are being

made to infiltrate with linited

degrees of success such legitinate

Negro organizations as the National Association for the Advance-

ment of Colored People, the Negro Anerican Labor Council, and the

Southern Christian Lcadership Confcrence headed by Martin Luther

King, JI.

Other lcgitinate Negro orfanizations not known to be

infiltrated, influcnced or controlled but are targets include

COnFICSS Of

44 years, the Party has failed to reach its goal with the

Negroes.

The Director, on January 26, 1960, said publicly:

"':"

'Is no secret that one of the bitterest disappointnenis

communistic efforts in this Mation has been their failure

in jure our legro citizens into the party. Despite every type

It one was to apply this

members today, it would give to the Party 1,000 Negro members.

That same day I called the SiC at Atianta and instructed

AC Atlanta advised the foilowing day, November 23, that Rev. King had left

astructions with his secretary that he did not have time for an interview, that he was

moving around the country. The secretary further advised the SAC that Rev. Jing

would call us when he was willing to sit down for an interview. Rev. King has not

salied since that date.

It would appear obvious that Rev. King does not desire to be told the

rue facts, de obviously used deceit, lies and treaches as prenande tenurter.

is own causes.

Realizing the above, I recommended, the Direco 3nvru semaame

alk with fir. wacKay, publisher of the four Afro-American newspapers. This

nerview was handled and reported by memorandum.

The interview was based on the

et that the Afro-American newspapers had published Rev. King's lies, quoting

im exclusively. In talking with Mr. Inchay I carefully went over each allegation

Y Rev. King and set him straight with respect to these lies.

The report reierrred to criticized the work of this

Bureau in relation to the Albany situation. King has stated among other thines

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regionzl

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 1l/15/62 and has been the subject

of a security investigation by this Burezu (100-360217). Zinn was reportealy

a member of the CP fron 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings during

that period. Zinn is a history proiessor at Spellman College in Atlanta. It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend Mr. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who arose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alacama.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RACIAL SITUATION

PECOMMENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The backgrand information regarding King, Tevison and Vin has

been furnished to the Department.

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times"

or the "Atlanta Constitution" as me obviously cannot give them background data

We possess on the CP influence of King, (u)

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him.

It is recommended that the Liaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

¡ Division bring king's comments in the article to the attention of Stai Director

Berl L. Bernhard of the U. S. Commission on Civil Rights and foint out to him

that there is no basis in fact for King's remarkg and in addition point out that - ci

the 5 Resident Agents assigned at Albany, Georgia, are from northern states agai

une is iron Georgia.

ACTION:

That this memorandum be referred to the Domestic Intelligence Dirisio

10r appropriate hancling.

OBSERVATIONS

notissies

this news iten is

extremely irritating to King.

In addition, the advanced

ticket sales were slow in Houston, Texas, prior to the

performance on October 17, 196%.: This newspaper story

may have caused many of the citizens of Houston to "think

twice before going" and indeed, not go. at all.

It is felt that if this article is given wide-spread

publicity as how thinking Negroes really feel about King,

two objectives can be accomplished, @emubtinteriting

•oc...to

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed oil onto an

extremely dangerous course which ran

din the opposite direction Irom the civil

frights leadership course that vastl

numbers of citizens.had come to know

and respect him for over a lide span of

• years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear

that this newspaper, of course, respects

ahd upholds Dr. King's right to take a

position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. If hewishes.

to be the spokesman for the "peaceniks',

• that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

¡that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already beset with?

jmore in-depth and complicated problems!

than can apparently be coped with, at that!

: point we call it our business.

FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday night is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We also

thin's that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

• lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subterfuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of "peaceniks' to use her name to

further their efforts, all that we cay say!

is, "that's her business." It she wakes up.

flater and finds that she has acted just.

lise Tokyo Rose and Axis Sally, all that

swe can say is that she broughtit all upon

herselt.

Our concern is not so much with what

course DI. King and Miss Franklinelect

to follow, yoat concerns us is that thein

nocent public, it not properly fore-

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that it wha: Dr. King

phas to say isn't within itselt meritorious

coming to town in the first place to say?

it. As it stands now, retha Eranklin's

name has been added to the show and many

people will pay the tee expecting to hear!

her sing. She will be the "balt' to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once !

inside, the trapped ticket purchasers wil

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews

about the "immorallty of the war in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the :

United States of Ainerica is at war with

a determined aggressor. How we gotinto

this war matters little at this point. The

bold truth is that we are shooting 'live'

ammunition at them and they are shoot-

Hing the same type back at us with re

markable effectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andi

realistically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonafide American

cilizens, must take a siand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver-

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no aid and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

immoral and wher Martin Luther King

preaches about how immoral the Ameri-

can bullets are and talls to olet us any

¡alternative for stopping those immorar

bullets being fred at our boys, we havei

got to take the ex-civil rights worker-

to task for his oversight.

It then is not reasonable that we now"

As we see it, Dr. Martin Luther King

is suggesting that we Negroes take some-.

thing lesser than the courageous route:

•If he follows the same pattern thathe has

tollowed in his other "remarks" made

in other cities, he will dwell upon Negro

problems just long enough to get the at-

suddenly shitt to the hard-sell of taking.

PURPOSE

The purpose. of

this memorandum is

to

lecommend

that either Assistant to the Director DeLoach or Assistant

Director Sullivan be approved to personally contact and

brief Governor Nelson Rockefeller of New York concerning

the connunist influence on Martin Luther King, inasmuch as

King is to neet shortly with Governor Rockefeller and King's

communist advisors hope to take advantage of the forthconing

meeting to influence events in Latin America along communis:

lines. (u)

BACKGROUND

Last week,

through

we learned that

a Stanles Levison,

who is Martin

Luther King's

chief

advisor, was in contact with an

•associate to

to Rockefeller.

one ascend that dead elenton talkerele

of New York because Levison said the discussion concerned y

Venezuelan iron ore deposits about which Rockefeller enteri

prises are negotiating with the Venezuelan Government.

Levison also told his associate that Rockefeller

was aisturbed

about Martin Luther King's position on Vietnam

and wanted to meet King to discuss it. Levison told his

contact this pleased him because it would give King

§ the

opportunity to present to Rockefeller King's views on :Latin

America which he feels has the potential of becoming the

next Vietnam.

According to Levison,.

King wanted to use the

opportunity

• to advise Rockefeller on

the steps that should'

be taken

in Latin America supposedly to avoid this.

Lieutenant Arkin pointed out that

join the march until it had proceeded one block north on

Lieutenant Arkin advised that at approximately 1:20

March 28, 1968, the lemphis Transit Authority which

operates the Memphis

City Bus systen, after receiving numerous

complaints from its bus drivers that

they feared for their

personal well being due to the disorder, coupled with the

fact that many of them had been individually robbed in the

past, decided as a safety measure to stop the movement of

City Buses for the reminder of March 28, 1968.

The Memphis 'Commercial Appeal" Newspaper, issue of

"arch 4s, 1968, in a from-page story, by an unidentitled

writer, reported that many of the looters and mindow breakers

were black power savocates, and that several wore jackets oi

the

"Invaders," a local black power group.

This story did

not give any basis for its statement to this effect.

On March 28 and 29, 1968, source one and source

tro, along with Lieutenant E.

H. Arkis, all of whom are

familiar with many phoses of the

black porer movement

in memphis, Tennessee, advised that a suill group of the tur

followers have put the ford "Invaders" on their jackets but

that many high school age students have done this for effect

and

are not necessarily affiliated with the BOP novement.

Sources one and tro, along with Arkin, added that

thus far there is no evidence

that any of the BoY group

SUBJECT: ARTICLE IN "THE NATION" FOR

FEBRUARY 4, 1961, BX

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Beginning on page 91 of the captioned magazine Reverend King has an Lavi

article entitled "The President Has The Power--Equality Now."

A copy of the

magazine is attached. (u)

As would be expected King's article is a plea for faster integration of the

races and he particularly makes the point that much can be done by the Kennedy

administration through Executive Order and example which has not been done in

I Previous administrations. At the top of page 94 the following statement regarding

the Bureau and other law enforcement agencies is made:

"If, for instance, the law-enforcement personnel

in the FBI were integrated, many persons who now defy federal

law might come under restraints from which they are presently

free. I other law-enforcement agencies under the Treasury

Department, such as the Internal Revenue Service, the Bureau

of Narcotics, the Alcohol Tax Unit, the Secret Service and

Customs had an adequate number of field agents; investigators •

and administrators who were Negro, there would be a greater

respect for Negroes as well as the assurance that prejudicial

behavior in these agencies toward citizens would cease. "

(4)

This is the only reference to the Bureau found in the article. Martin Luthea

King, Jr, is well known for his activities in behalf of the National Association for

the Advancement of Colored People in the south, and he reportedly planned the bus

boycotts in Montgomery, Alabama, and has participated in set-in demonstrations in

the south. He has been very active in attempts to integrate the races and Bufiles

contain numerous references to his activities in this regard. My

F-it will also be recalled that just prior to the election King was put in jail

and President Kennedy reportedly called him and was successful in obtaining his

NIGINAL COPY

release. Some political analysts have stated that the President's action in calling

King resulted in his receiving a heavy Negro vote in many parts of the country.

Re: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

Reverend King resigned his ministry in the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church of

Montgomery, Alabama, early in February, 1960, and became co-pastor with

his father in the Ebenezer Baptist Church,

Atlanta, Georgia. (100-106670) (4)

Although King is in error in his comments relating to the FBI, it is

believed inadvisable to call his hand on this matter as he obviously would only

welcome any controversy of resulting publicity that might ensue. (U)

We have had numerous instances of such requests

either being turned down by the Attorney General or remainin

unanswered by him.

since the individuals and groups which

were the subjects

of the requests are engaged in antiwan

demonstrations and in advocating black power and racial

unrest, it is entirely possible that our coverage could have

in such matters. u)

Our investigation of groups and individuals engaged

in staging demonstrations and other forms of unrest-partiou-

larly activity of national scope--has shown that the telephone

is widely used by them to coordinate with other groups and

individuals throughout the country.

Technical coverage would

not only enable us to obtain a "blow by blow account" of this

planning, but would be extremely valuable in obtaining leads

which would help us in determining whether or not there is

extensive foreign influence behind these activities. u)

There is set out below a listing of technical

coverage which has been turned down by the Attorney General

Carmichael and Brown encourage violence and the tearing

of the United States. On 8/12/66 we requested coverage of

SNCC.

It was denied 8/22/66.

was denied.

Socialist Workers Party, the Progressive Labor Party

and

Students for a Democratic Society, all of which are vehemently

anti-United States.

In order to cover its activities and to

AND FIELD OFFICES

THING.

ADVICTO TO RI

Martin Luther King, Jr., President of the Southern

Dia latristian leadership Conferenca (SCIO), has publicly stated

that he will create massive civil disobediences in the

Nation's Capital and in 10 to 15 major. cities throughout

the United States in the Spring of 1968 if certain

commitments are not forthcoming from Congress in the

civil rights field. An aide of King has stated "Jail

100030

will be the safest place in Washington, D. C., this spring."

The Atlanta Office of SCLC will be the focal point

for planning and instructions concerning the massive civil

disobediences and the telephone surveillance is highly

desirable so that we can keep apprised of the strategy...

and plans of this group.

Massive demonstrations could

trigger riots which might spread across the Nation.

In view of the above, authority is requested

DAT

to institute a telephone surveillance on the headquarters

of the SCLC, 330 Auburn Avenue, N.E., Atlanta, Georgia,

or on any office to which it may move.

PURPOSE: Attached for your approval is an airtel to our

Atlanta Office instructing them to conduct a survey for

King, Jre,

is planning massive civil disobedience to disrupt

ten to fifteen major cities in the United States including

Washington, D. C.

BACKGROUND: Since August, 1967, Martin Luther King, JI.,

President SCLC has publicly stated his group will stage

massive civil disobedience to disrupt ten to fifteen

Rit

major cities throughout the Nation. He has also stated

recently that he will call the poor, the sick and the needy

to our Nation's capital to disrupt its operation in an

effort to spur Congressional action to help the plight of

the Negro.

This may even include a camp-in at the White house

"To dislocate the function of a

city without destroying it can be more effective than a riot 1l

0423

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS: King recently held a one week retreat

to plan his campaign in this regard. He is attempting to

recruit 2,000 leaders throughout the Nation to effect this

plan.

Two individuals have been assigned to Washington, D.

and other cities to start recruiting.

is the target date to start massive civil disobedience if

certain demands regarding economic, housing and education

legislation does not receive unequivocal commitment for prompt

Congressional action.

OBSERVATIONS:

Because of the effect this plan of King's will

have on the racial movement and even possibly the internal

security of the United States itself, we feel it is most

necessary to have telephone surveillance coverage on King's

headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, where most of the planning

concerning this operation will take place.

Memorandum to Mr. W. Co Sullivan

RE: SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE

In the past, we have had a telephone surveillance

on SCLC, which was extremely productive, but it was dis-

continued on 6-20-66 upon receipt of instructions from

Attorney General Nicholas deB. Katzenbach. He was concerned

about jeopardizing the possible prosecution of a SCLC employee

for an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor Vehicles

statute violation.

On June 1, 1967, the Department advised

the evidence against the SCLC employee was of insufficient

strength to warrant prosecution.

Since there are no prosecutive

matters which this installation will jeopardize, it is felt

it should be reinstalled.

RECOMMENDATION: That the attached airtel be sent to Atlanta

so that a

of installing a secure installation on SCLC Headquarters.

Upon receipt of results of survey from Atlanta, appropriate

communication will be sent to the Attorney General requesting

authority for this installation.

UNQLASSALED

Reference is made to your inquiry concerning the

telephone surveillance on the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference which was discontinued on 6/21/66 upon instructions

of the Attorney General.

A telephone surveillance was instituted on the

headquarters of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

330 Auburn Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 8,

1963.

The Southern Christian Leadership Conference is a

racial-type organization headed by Martin Luther King, JI.

OHHAT TON CONTAINED

UNCLASSIO

en

This telephone surveillance provided considerable

valuable intelligence information concerning communist:

influence on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

through King, as well as the communist influence evident in

the outspoken position which King had taken in opposition to

the United States foreign policy concerning Vietnam.

. A memorandum from the Director dated 4/28/66 was

forwarded

to the Attorney General pointing out the valuable

coverage being provided by the telephone

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Authorization was

requested to continue the surveillance for an additional six

months.

The memorandum was returned by the Attorney General with

a notation dated 6/20/66 stating "I think this coverage should

be discontinued,

particularly, in light of possible charges of

a criminal nature against Hosea Williams and possibly others."

The Attorney General's notation concerning Hosea Williams

referred to an Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicles case under investigation by the Bureau wherein the

principle subject, Harold Belton Andrews, alleged he stole

four automobiles for subsequent sale to the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference headed by Di. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re:

SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE

1000442529

Investigation disclosed that one of these stolen vehicles

had been in the possession of Hosea Williams, Director of

Voter Registration for King's organization.

Due to the

ramification involving the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference and the civil rights movement, the Criminal

Division of the Department has been directing the prosecution

in this case rather than the U. S. Attorney.

On 7/28/66, Harold Belton Andrews and Morris Finley

were tried and convicted in U. S. District Court at Atlanta

on charges of Interstate Transportation of Stolen Motor

Vehicles.

Hosea Williams was not prosecuted nor indicted.

Atlanta Office

report in this case dated 8/30/66 set forth that

Assistant U. S. Attorney Allen L. Chancey advised that U. S.

District Judge Sidney O. Smith stated he did not know the

exact date that Andrews and Finley would be sentenced.

Judge Smith indicated he desired to withhold sentencing

until such time as the Department of Justice determined

whether or not additional individuals involved in the case

were to be tried. The report was disseminated to the

Department:

As you are aware King has been in close association

'with

individuals having Communist Party backgrounds since his rise to

prominence in the civil rights field

*Clarence Jones, another close

¡advisor to King, was a former member and in a position of leadership

'in the Labor Youth League, a communist front organization. Bayard

Rustin, another of King's close advisors, was a member of the Young

1 /Communist League in the early 1940%g and

On October 10, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy

approved technical surveillances on King's current residence or

at any further address to which he may move.

He also approved the

technical surveillance of the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference New York City Office or any other address to which it

may

be moved..

A wire tap was installed on King's residence, 563 Johnson

| Avenue, Northeast, Atlanta, Georgia, on November 8, 1963, and

discontinued on April 30, 1965, when King moved from this address. It

was not reinstituted on his new residence.

From October 24, 1963, to January 24, 1964,

and from

duly Y, 1964, to July 31, 1964,

a wire tap was maintained on the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference New York City Office.

In addition, on October 21, 1963, Attorney General Kennedy authorized

a wire tap on the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

Headquarters at Atlanta, Georgia, which was maintained from

November 8, 1963, to June 21, 1966, when Attorney General Nicholas^

In addition to the foregoing we maintained 16

microphones and 4 wire taps of a few days duration at various

original authority given by the Attorney General on 10/10/63.

concerning King's residences:

Attorney General Katzenbach was specifically

notified of three of these microphone installations.

In each

of these three instances the Attorney General was advised

that

a trespass was involved in the installation.

been currently in touch with representatives of the Department

concerning developments which have been brought to the Director's

attention. We can, however, screen teletypes and furnish copies

ADDENDUM, ASSISTANT TO THE DIRECTOR DE LOACH CDD:vea 6/8/68

The Attorney General asked me to come to his office at

approximately 2:20 p.m. In his office were his wife, Assistant Attorney

General Vinson, Assistant Attorney General Pollack, his Executive Assistant

Sol Lindenbaum and the Deputy Attorney General, Warren Christopher,

MinGEy

The Attorney General first congratulated the FBI and stated that

this was the greatest news he had ever heard. He next went into a long

song and dance on the absolute necessity of security and the avoidance of

evasion of civil rights of the subject, James Earl Ray. The Attorney

General asked me questions concerning the quality of our Agent personnel

in London and I told him we had absolute faith and contidence in these men,

otherwise we would not have assigned them there. He stated he thought we

should sendadditional men to London to assist in this case. I: told him

I thought this was both foolish and unnecessary. He asked me about

Legal Attache Minnich's bachground and i provided this inirmation iui

him. He asked me if the FBI had a representative in the same cell block

with the subject. I told him we did not and that furthermore, inasmuch as

this man was under British custody, we could not even talk to the prisoner

uniess he, the prisoner, agreed to interrogation. The Attorney General

asked if we had a man next to the cell block. I told him we did not and that

he must realize that this man was under British custody and, therefore,

• not the responsibility of American authorities. The Attorney General

stated he would feel better if he knew the exact provisions under which

security the prisoner was being maintained. I made no comment.

The Attorney General asked me if I thought it was necessary to

send a Departmental representative to London. I told him I thought this

was completely unnecessary if the representative would be going for the

purpose of attempting to look into FBI activities. The Attorney General

stated this representative would be going for the purpose of expediting

legal acifivities in connection with the extradition of the subject.

He added

that the Departmental representative would also check with the British

authorities to make certain there was ample security. Furthermore, to

make certain that the prisoner's civil rights were being protected.

The Attorney General asked me whom I thought should be responsible

for bringing the prisoner back to the United States. I told him I previously

discussed this with the Director and that the Director was agreeable to the

- FBI escorting the prisoner back to the United States. He asked how many

men would do this. Itoid him we would untize three very capable men.

He

stated he thought we needed more. I told him I disagreed and that three men

## Page 282

would be sufficient, particularly if handcuffs and leg irons were used,

The Attorney General asked me if I thought military transportation or

commercial transportation should be utilized. I:told him that military

transportation would probably be better and furthermore that the plane

should land at a military base, possibly near Memphis, lennessee, so

that maximum security could be afforded. The Attomey General agreed,

He then called Governor Buford Ellingion in Tennessee and specifically

asked him to expedite extradition proceedings by immediately making a

request to the President of the United States so that the White House in

turn could forward this request to the British Home Secretary. The

Attorney General also told Governor Ellington that he would personally

feel better if Federal officers (meaning the FBI) would escort the prisoner

back to the United States. Governor Ellington agreed to all terms and

stated that he would comply with the wishes of the Federal Government

in this matter..

The Attorney General next turned to the Deputy Attorney General

and asked him if he thought a Departmental representative should be sent

to England. The Deputy Attorney General replied, "Without question."

The Attorney General next asked the entire group whom they thought siouia

be sent. He ventured the personal opinion that it should either be Vinson

or Pollack. There was no comment. The Attorney General then stated

that Vinson should go and should leave tonight, June 8, 1968. He asked

that Vinson be placed in touch with our Legal Attache. I toid the

Attorney General that sending Vinson was his own business, however, I

would like to make absolutely certain that Vinson did nothing to upset the

very excellent relationship between the FBI and Scotland Yard. I stated

that Vinson under no circumstances should attempt to push Scotland Yard

around by insisting on different types of security. The Attorney General

repeated that Vinson would be there primarily for the purpose of expediting

legal activities. The Attorney General then told Lindenbaum to have

several Bureau of Prisons officials go to Memphis early Monday,

June 10, 1968, for the purpose of taking a look at the county jail in Memphis

so that proper security could be afforded the prisoner once he was turned

over to the state authorities. (This, of course, is none of the Attorney

General's business inasmuch as once the prisoner is turned over to the

state he is strictly the state's responsibility.)

Upon leaving, the Attorney General told me that he would like

to sit down with me within the next several days and completely go over

this case. I told him that we had already provided him with reports in the

matter and that these reports, plus the press release of today, covered all

necessary details. He made no comment other than to commend the FBI

once again and to say that hard work paid oft.

ACTION:

In the event extradition proceedings are successful and the FBI

is called upon to bring the subject back to the United States, it is suggested

that Legal Attache Minnich, Special Agent Supervisor Wilbur L. Martindale

and Special Agent Supervisor Kenneth I, Bounds be assigned this responsibility.

Bounds is approximately 6 feet 4 inches tall, is in excellent physical shape,

is a former firearms instructor and is currently assigned to the General

Investigative Division here at FBI Headquarters. He has an excellent

background. In the event the Director approves this recommendation, we

will have Bounds obtain a passport and the necessary medical shots so

that he can proceed to London, England, upon instructions.

I called the Attorney General (AG) at approximately 5:50 p.m.,

June 8, 1968, and advised him that in connection with the conversation in

is office with me, the Director had instructed me to send two men to London

instead of one for the purpose of escorting the subject back to the United States,

The AG was told that this would make a total of four FBI representatives

di

escorting the subject back to this country.

The AG was additionally told that the Director had instructed thi

the two men in question proceed to London as expeditiousty as possibie so

that they would be on the scene in the event extradition or deportation pro-

ceedings occurred faster than anticipated. He was told that towards this

end, I had called Joe Califano at the White House, who usually handled

military transportation in expedite matters of this nature, to tell him that

if he knew of a military plane proceeding to London, it would be appreciated

if the FBI representatives could hitck ride on this plane.

p98861-4447

The AG snappish iquired as to the reasons why this has not

been cleared with him personally. I told him I had specifically mentioned

in his office the fact that three men would be suitable for escorting subject

Ray back to the United States and that he had disagreed stating that he felt

additional men should be assigned to this project. He stated he did not recall

this exchange of conversation.

I told him I recalled it very well. He stated

there was no need to get into a "spitting contest"' over this particular issue

and that he wanted me to definitely realize that he did not recall such matters

being discussed. I told hih*I would not back down on the matter and that the

discussion had taken place.

He then turned to another topic. cos

The AG stated that he wanted me to know that he was unhappy

about the manner in which this case had been handed it imi

ediately asked

him for speciäcs.. He stated that obviously the FBI had possessed a great

deal of information and had not cut him in on it. He stated that as an example,

• MEMORANDUM TO MR. TOLSON

RE: MURKIN

the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) of the United States had called me

personally and that I had refused to give him "inside facts." I replied

that when the DAG first called me this morning, I had indicated that I

had no facts to give him but that a short time later I had called the DAG

and had read to him the press release prior to the time the release was

given to the wire services. I pointed out to the AG that his Deputy had

fully approved the press release and had indicated that it was completely

within guidelines of appropriate legal proceedings, The AG replied that

The had been told differently. He stated that he had been advised that I

had not given any information whatsoever to the DAG. I stäted that as.

indicated in my conversation with him, the facts previously mentioned

were true. The AG replied by stating this was one of the biggest cases

the Department of Justice will ever have. He then asked me point blank,

"Who the hell do you think you're working for?" He quickly added "I'll

tell you who you're working for, you're working for the Department of

Justice." He next added that he wanted to insist that in the future that

jany information whatsoever received in this case, any investigative step

whatsoever, and any communications be brought to his personal attention

without delay. He stated that obviously he had been kept in the dark thusfar

land that he did not intend to put up with this in the future.

I told the AG if he insisted upon making such falsifications that

there was no need to continue the conversation. I then hung up the phone

lon him.

The AG's secretary called me back approximately three minutes

later and stated that he wanted to speak to me again. He then came on the

phone and told me that our conversation had not been over and that he demanded

to know why I had hung up the phone on him. I told him that apparently there

was no need to continue the conversation and that I did not wish to discuss it

further.

He stated that he must insist, as Attorney General, that any arrange -

ments made concerning this case be cleared with him. He stated that in

connection with the military flight for our Agents that I should have realized

Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Vinson wanted to go on the same flight and

would have wanted to make arrangements on a personal basis with the White

House or the military personnel. I told the AG that if he wanted Vinson to go

on a military flight, this was entirely his prerogative to make his own arrange -

ments, The AG then told me he would discuss this case at greater length later

MEMORANDUM TO MR. TOLSON

RE: MURKIN

Within five minutes the AG's secretary called again and asked that

I come around to his office right away. I took Mr. Rosen with me as a witness.

The AG had with him DAG Christopher and AAG Pollak. The conversation was

initiated by the AG and he immediately referred to his previous conversation

relating to the Agents who were going to London and the discussion which had

taken place in his office earlier during the day when I advised him that three

Agents would be available in London for the purpose of handling the subject

insofar as his return to the. United States was concerned. He reviewed what

he had said earlier and I repeated exactly the position I had previously taken.

There was a stand-off and when he recognized that I had not changed my

position, he turned to Rosen for verification at which time Rosen repeated

that it was his understanding that three Agents would be available in London

and that this matter had been thoroughly discussed at FBI Headquarters earlier.

I made no further reference to this conversation and he then turned

to what he said were the three most important considerations in this matter:

(1) Security; (2) insuring that all proper legal procedures acceptable to the

United States and Great Britain would be followed; (3) that proper interviews

would take place.

In this connection, there was a discussion concerning security and

he referred to the availability of Legal Attache Minnich.

He insisted that

Minnich meet Vinson at the plane Sunday morning, June 9, 1968. I told him

that Minnich would not be available to meet Vinson inasmuch as Minnich or

one of our people would probably spend all night at the jail. He asked me if

this was a true statement. I told him it was a true statement or I would not

Khave made it.

He said that then enem to mat the ple would

make the arrangements and insure that proper procedures be followed. He

said that Minnich would report to Vinson concerning any developments and that

the question of deportation was viewed.

favorably by him.

He said if deportation

was pursued, it could be criticized from a legal standpoint insofar as he was

concerned.

He said transporting the subject by any plane, military or owned

by the United States Government, is not a free deportation from any country.

He said that his attorneys would be reviewing this matter and would be in a

position to make appropriate recommendations to him. He said that the legal

procedures which would be followed were obviously paramount and would have

to receive first consideration over any expedient investigative procedures.

told the AG at this point that we wanted him to know that the FBI had not injected

RE: MURKIN

itself into any such so-called legal procedures and that our actions up to this

date had been strictly of an investigative nature. I also advised him that I had

informed him of the attitude of the British Government with reference to their

attitude toward deportation and that this had not been an opinion of FBI repre-

sentatives in London. I stated that when I mentioned that there was a 60/40

chance that he would be deported, that this was the attitude of the British

authorities rather than our representatives.

The AG was advised that we had set in motion the obtaining of the

copy of the indictment which had been requested which indictment was returned

by the Tennessee authorities naming this subject as the person responsible for

the killing of King, that this would be made available immediately upon its

receipt and that a properly certified copy was being obtained.

DAG Christopher asked me if the subject was being detained on a

"holding action" or as a result of a violation of British law. He was told that

the subject was being detained on the basis of entering the country with illegal

documents and because he had a loaded gun on his person.

The AG then turned to AAG Pollak. He stated he wanted him to

divorce himself from other work for the next several days and that he should

supervise this case completely. The AG then turned to me and stated that he

wanted Pollak to be kept advised of any communication, airtel, or cablegram

that might come in in connection with this case. I told the AG that any facts

which were pertinent would be furnished to the Department. The AG then

andicated that the meeting was over. •

I called Legal Attache Minnich upon my return to the office and

informed him that he should proceed as planned; however, under no circum-

stances should he give the impression to Vinson or the Embassy that the FBI

was injecting itself into extradition or deportation proceedings.

Minnich

properly replied that he had not thusfar injected himself and that as a matter

of fact, following my call to him concerning Vinson coming over there, he had

immediately informed Embassy officials that all proceedings pertaining to

extradition or deportation would be strictly handled between Vinson, the

American Embassy and the British Government. I told Minnich that he should

be diplomatic but firm with Vinson and that under no circumstances should

Vinson be allowed to push our personnel around. I also informed him that the

AG had been told that he, Minnich, would be unable to meet Vinson inasmuch as

the would be spending almost full time at Scotland Yard and at the jail.

James Earl Ray has been identified as the sabject in the

case involving the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr.

Extensive investigation has been conducted, and no information

has been developed indicating his present whereabouts. In order to

possibly assist in locating and apprehending the subject, it would be

of extreme value to know if the subject has made any contact, either

personal or by telephone, with his sister, Carol Pepper, as well as

his brother, John Larry Ray.

operated by John Larry Ray. It is also requested that you authorize

installation of microphone surveillanceson the residencesof Carol

These installations could assist in the early apprehension

of the subject, which could possibly be instrumental in reducing the

John Larry Ray, subject's brother, and the installation of a microphone

surveillance at the residences of Carol Pepper, and Joha Larry Ray,

and at the Grapevine Tavern, These installations cord assist in the

early apprehension of the subject, which could passihly be instrumental

in recucing the stresses and tension placed on our nanonal security

suoseguent to the death of viarin Luther King, di.

investigation to determine the present whereabouts of the subject James

: Earl Ray; who is one of the TEN MOST WANTED FUGITIVES. Although

many hundreds of interviews have been conducted and leads run oüt, we

: have not been able to locate the subject nor have ve located any person

who can furnish us any information as to the subject's present whereabouts.

It has been determined that Carol Pepper, the sister of the subject, and

John larry Ray, the brother of the subject, are tie closest relatives to

him. Carol is married to Albert Pepper and they reside at 2025 Belleview, *

St. Louis, Missouri, telephone number 645-2948. John Larry Ray resides

at 1900 A Cherokee, St. Louis, Missouri, no telesbone listed. Cárol

telephone number PR 6-9417. This tavern is operated by John Lary Ray.

John Larry Ray has expressed a cooperative attitude; however,

it is felt that he is not giving us complete and acerate intoraration.

Carol

Pepper refuses to submit to interview and is not cooperative. • It is felt that

If the subject telephones or personally contacts any of the relatives, it will

most likely 'be Carol Pepper or brother John Larry Bait:

'-T.

As shown in attached memorandum of May 9, 1968, from Mr.

Rosen to Mr. DeLoach, consideration is given to microphone installations on

certain properties of Albert and Carol Pepper. The proposal raises a question

concerning the legality of any action taken against the subject of this case on the

basis of information obtained from the microphones.

-We believe these microphones can be installed and used without

prejudicing the case against the subject. In a very recent decision of the United

States District Court for the Southern District of New York, a listening device

gas insialled on the premises of one Levine. Later, a subject named Granello,

an associate of Levine, came up for trial and claimed that the listening device

installed on Levires premises, which was installed by trespass, was illegal as

to him, Cranello. It was not contended that any information obtained from the

Levine microphone was used as evidence against Granello at trial either directly

or as a lead. The court held that since Granello had no interest in the Levine

premises, the monitor was not illegal as to him and he could not obtain a new

trial or dismissal of the indictment. U.S. V. Granello, 280 F. Supp. 482 (1968).

Applied to instant case, this rule of law could work out in different

ways, Assuming that the subject of this case is not on the premises to be...

surveilled by the means suggested, and has no possessory or ther right in

?.

those premises, any information disclosed by the surveillance in some way,

such as conversation among the Peppers, could be used to learn the whereabouts

of the subject for purposes of arrest.- The problem becomes somewhat more

complicated, however, if the subject of this, case made a telephone call to those

premises and that telephone call were recorded and used as the basis for his

apprehension.

He then could clair that the surveillance violased lie right of

Divary ta the telephone coints tone ade to that place, ering he

decision in the Supreme Court.

Memorandum J. J. Casper to Mr. Mobr

RE: MARKIN

The worst that could happen in either of the above circumstances,

however, assuming that we follow the precautionary measures listed below -

is that we illegally learn where the subject is located and thus are able to arrest

him on that knowledge. The rule that comes into play here, established in the

last century by the Supreme Court in Ker V. Illinois, 30 U.S. 347 (1886), is that

an illegal arrest is no bar to prosecution. Wong Sun v. U.S., 371 U.S. 471 (1963);

U.S. V. Hoffman, 385 E2d 501 (1967); Keegan v. U.S., 385 F2d 260 (1967). A

person may be arrested unlawfully and actually kidnapped into the court having

jurisdiction of the criminal case, yet the court still retains jurisdiction to try

the person for the offense. The court would not allow the prosecution to use

as evidence any information obtained through the illegal surveillance but the

illegal surveillance would not taint the use of any other evidence obtained either

before or after and which was gotten in a legal manner. Nor, to repeat, would

the illegality of the arrest alone, resulting from whereabouts disclosed by unlawful

surveillance, prevent the court from trying the subject for the ofiense.

It the action being considered is taken, we strongly suggest three

precautionary measures, as follows:

(1) That all recordings be preserved intact. It may be necessary

to disclose some of them to the court or even to the defense.

(2) That no use be made of any information obtained against

anyone whatsoever or in any way whatsoever except for the single purpose of

locating the subject in this case. As we well know by this time, evidence of

the offense obtained in this manner is not admissible. It would not ba admissible

against the subject and it would not be admissible against the Peppers on a charge

of harboring.

(3) Be aware that since this search and seizure is unconstitutional

as to the Peppers, they have at least a theoretical cause of action for damages

against those who installed the devices by trespass. Here again, however, it

nothing learned by this surveillance is used against the Peppers in any way, their

cause of action is diminished to the lowest possible degree, becoming that for a

technical violation only rather than one of substantial harm to them. Moreover,

in any such case the government of the United States should surely be willing to

pick up the tab for any judgment had against those who installed the microphones.

RECOMMENDATION:

For information.

PROPOSED PROSECUTIVE ACTION

1 - Mi. Conrad

1 - Mr. Sullivan

This case concerns the murder of Martin Luther King, JI.

On 4/16/68 the Attorney General authorized the filing of a

complaint charging Galt with violation of Title 18, Section 241, U. S.

Code, for conspiring to interfere with the constitutional rights of

ПАріна

Martin Luther King, JI. It was understood that no publicity would be

even to the code beat unles one are the sitatin a ate elon

complaint should be mix molic. A progoted complaint is set out below.

REC 38-44-58861-1556

On or about March 25, 1960, at Birmingnam,

Alabama, in the Northern District of Alabama, Eric Starvo

Galt and an individual whom he alleged to be his brother,

entered into a conspiracy, which continued until on or

about April 5, 1968, to injure, oppress, threaten, or

intimidate Martin Luther King, JIo, a ..... Citizen of the

United States, residing in Atlanta, Georgia, in the free

exercise or enjoyment of a right secured to him by the

Constitution or laws of the United States, namely, the

right to freely travel from state to state. In fuythepanGe 1968

of this conspiracy, Eric Starvo Galt did, on or about

March 30

The above proposed complaint is considered to disclose the

absolute minimum information that would be acceptable to a U. S.

Commissioner or Federal Judge. To satisty the judicial officer,

it may

be necessary to add some additional details such as the description of the

gun and the fact it was abandoned at the crime scene. If necessary, such

detail will be added but only to the extent necessary to obtain a warrant.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

Under the statute being used the complaint can be filed in any

District in which the conspiracy took place or an overt act occurred.

On the basis of facts presently available, we are limited to filing the

complaint at Memphis or Birmingham

We understand that we cannot rely on the U. S. Attorney at

memphis. i we tried to file there, we would immediately lose contro

of the situation and the complaint would become public knowledge

We have checked with Birmingham and we have no assurance

we could keep a complaint filed there a secret. We would have to go

through the U. S. Attorney's Office and Macon Weaver, the U. S. Attorney,

is presently in Houston. The U. S. Commissioner is a woman who does

not have too firm a grasp on her operations.

Investigation at the Canadian address given by Galt, 7/31/6%,

has not been productive and a kansas City address as of 3/1/6%, that we

obtained in Canada is nonexistent. Galt is last known to have been in

Atlanta, 4/5/68, and his present whereabouts are unknown. We are

faced with the danger that he may leave the country before he is located.

In view of the above circumstances, it now appears charges

should be immediately filed and Galt's fugitive status should be given the

widest possible publicity.

ACTION:

1. We should openly file the proposed complaint at Birmingham.

2. We should issue a wanted flyer and a fugitive press release.

3. We should issue an Identification Order even though no

fingerprints are available.

4. At the appropriate time, the Attorney General should be

advised that circumstances have required the action being taken.

With reference to the dissemination to the Department

of investigative reports in this case, such reports fall into two

categories: a) reports containing information of evidentiary value

pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal violation involved; and

b) reports containing the results of the extensive fugitive investigation

conducted to locate and apprehend the subject, James Earl Ray.

All reports pertinent to the prosecution of the Federal

violation involved, and in which the Department has a legitimate

interest, have been disseminated promptly to the Department and

there has been absolutely no delay in doing so.

The remaining reports contain the results of our extensive

fugitive investigation to locate and apprehend Ray. Copies of these

reports were not disseminated to the Department since they relate

solely to the fugitive aspects of the case, and contain no evidentiary

material or information of value to the Department in the discharge

of its prosecutive function relative to the Federal charge involved,

There are twenty such reports involving approximately

2, 000 pages. They contain background data and results of extensive

interviews and/or other investigation conducted to locate Ray. Although

they do not relate to the prosecution aspect of the case, they will gone

Memo Rosen to DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

dentially came to our attention before Vinson's memorandum was written

that British prison authorities had asked Vinson for information of this

type in connection with their responsibility to maintain Ray's custody

and the extradition proceedings.)

We had, of course, reviewed such records in the initial

phase of the fugitive aspect of the investigation, and the results had

been set forth in the fugitive reports dated May 15, 1968, and June 14,

1968, submitted by our Kansas City Office. Copies of these reports,

which contained in full the information requested by Vinson in his

letter, were furnished to him on July 19, 1968, Since the Attorney

General had requested that information relating to the case be furnished

to both Vinson and Assistant Attorney General Stephen J. Pollak of

the Civil Rights Division, copies of the pertinent reports were also

furnished to Pollak.

It should be noted Vinson did not furnish Pollak a copy

Lof his (Vinson's) July 12, 1968, letter to the Bureau and consequently

Pollak is apparently completely unaware the pertinent Kansas City

reports were furnished to him and Vinson in answer to Vinson's

i specitic request. This is another typical example in the Department

of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing and explains

why Pollak has gone off half cocked in erroneously accusing us of delay

in disseminating the reports in question,

As a further example of this lack of coordination between

Pollak and Vinson as relates to this case, it is noted that after Ray

was turned over to state authorities in Tennessee we inquired of Vinson

by letter whether the Federal process against Ray should be dismissed

since the extradition order did not cite the Federal Civil Rights charges

and it was our understanding that Ray could not, thereiore, be prosecuted

on Federal charges. A copy of our letter was furnished to Pollak.

Vinson in reply advised us that he felt the Federal process

Should be dismissed; however, Pollak, apparently unaware of Vinson's

position, subsequently advised us that he felt the process should not

¡be dismissed pending disposition of the state aurder charges against

Ray. It was necessary for us by memorandum to point out the

discrepancy in the two views and request clarification in the matter.

A confidential source at the telephone company in Houston

has furnished the following information. Hugh Ainsworth of "Newsweek"

advised the telephone company that LouiskLomax and Charles Stein

identitied a public telephone at Uvalde, Texas, as one used by hay to

make a call to New Orleans between 6 p.m.

and 9 p.m., 12/16/67.

- CALiE

Telephone company records show that no call was made to

New Orleans from this telephone during the entire month of December.

Only one interstate call was made between 6 p. I. and 9 p.M., 12/16/67.

This call was by a man identifying himself as Ben Gomez and was made

to the residence of Guadalupe Mata (phonetic) at a telephone number in

California. Mata is being checked out as are eight calls made from this

telephone to Texas telephone numbers between 6 Do I. and 9 Do Ila,

12/16/0761

Mrs. Clovina/Olonzo, New Orleans, mother of Charles Stein,

describes him as "crazy but harmless." She bases this opinion on the

fact that he holds conversations with "space people" and on several

occasions has asked her to look into the sky to see a flying saucer he

allegedly was watching; she could see nothing. She also stated that Stein

Anthony Charles Decarvelho, a friend of Charles Stein in.

New Orleans, has advised that he held several conversations with Stein

when Stein was in New Orleans last December and that these conversations

dealt with a "cosmic philosophy" in which Stein believes. Decaryelho

said this philosophy deals with flying saucers, space people residing on 0l

earth and attempts to get closer to the Creator. Stein said that the Creator

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

New Orleans. Stein told Decarvelho he felt that he was on the

threshold of converting Ray to his "cosmic philosophy" and hoped to

complete the conversion on the return trip from New Orleans to

Los Angeles.

Lomax and Stein have now returned to Los Angeles. Stein

advised the search for the telephone booth used by Ray had been

nonproductive. He said a couple of telephone booths in Uvalde, Texas,

looked familiar but he could furnish no factual data as to their use by

Ray.

In an article for immediate releaseby Louis Lomax, now

writing for the North American Newspaper Alliance, Lomax falsely

claimed that there are certain contradictions in the FBI investigation.

Lomax in his article states as follows.

1. Lomax claims: The FBI has been forced to admit that the

fingerprints circulated as those of Ray are in fact of someone else.

Facts: The FBI has issued only one set of fingerprints

and these are the actual fingerprints of Ray. When Ray escaped from

prison in April, 1967, Missouri authorities issued a wanted notice that

bore the wrong fingerprints; however the warden immediately issued a

corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints. We had nothing

to do with these wanted notices issued by Missouri almost a year before

King was killed.

2. Lomax claims: An FBI search of the 1966 white Mustang

driven by Ray unearthed Green Stamps that were issued as a result of

a purchase at a Birmingham, Alabama, gas station in mid-February, 1968.

FBI reports consistently place Ray in Los Angeles as a student at dancing

and bartending schools at the time of the gas station transaction.

Facts: The manager of the service station in Birmingham,

Alabama, stated that the station purchases S & H Green Stamps every two

weeks and upon reviewing the stamps from the 1966 Mustang of Ray the

manager stated that the stamps were purchased on 9/8/67 from the S & t

Company and the number on the top of the stamps would indicate that they

were given to a customer sometime during 9/8-22/67. It is noted that

Birmingham investigation indicates that Ray was in Birmingham, Alabama,

from 8/26/67 to 10/6/67.

RE: MURKIN

3. Lomax claims: FBI reports indicated that cigarette

butts and ashes were found on the floor of the white Mustang when it

was recovered in Atlanta, Georgia, although Lomax alleges Ray does

not smoke.

Facts: The Agents in Atlanta, upon examination of the

1966 Mustang, determined there were no apparent cigar or cigarette

Jata an i do the hit deans and idean ray was slei

4 Lomax claims: The FBI reports indicate that Ray was

in Los Angeles until 3/27/68; he is reported to have bought the fatal

weapon in Birmingham, Alabama, on 3/30/68. Ray could not have driven

the route in a Mustang in that short period between 3/27/68 and 3/30/68.

Facts: Our investigation discloses that Ray departed

Los Angeles, California, on 3/17/68 giving a forwarding address as

General Delivery, Atlanta, Georgia.

5. Lomax claims: The most fatal oversight was the FBI's

failure to uncover the console television set Ray gave to a Hollywood

girl friend in return for her portable television set. The back of this

television set contained handwriting believed to be that of Ray.

Facts: We were perfectly aware that Ray traded his console

television set for a portable model and the television set has been in the

possession of a person whom we have interviewed at length. Our

Los Angeles Office advises that there is no handwriting on the back of

¿the television set.

6. Lomax claims: A clear reading makes it all but certain

that Ray took three trips to New Orleans between 12/13/67 and the end

Jof March.

Facts: Our investigation thus far discloses that Ray made

two trips to New Orleans: once when he left Los Angeles 12/15/67, was

registered at a New Orleans motel, 12/17-19/67, and returned to

apparently on the evening of 3/21/68.

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

7. Lomax claims: The FBI did not retrace Ray's trip to

New Orleans with Stein to find the telephone booth Ray used to call

New Orleans and did not consider the possibility Ray had called

New Orleans from a telephone booth in the St. Francis Hotel in

Los Angeles.

Facts: Lomax and Stein spent several days in an

unproductive search for the Texas telephone booth allegedly used by

Ray. We are checking the records of all calls made from more than

170 telephones along the route driven by Ray and Stein in December, 1967.

We have previously checked out calls made from the telephone booth

in the St. Francis Hotel indicated by Lomax as having been used by

Ray and no pertinent information was developed. We are also checking

calls made from all other pay telephones in the St. Francis.

ACTION:

Extensive investigation is continuing throughout the field

on a top priority basis to locate and apprehend Ray as quickly as possible.

Memphis authorities have indicated that they may seek a

murder indictment against Ray from a local grand jury on or about

5/3/68. It is not yet known if the testimony of FBI Agents will be

necessary but we will furnish whatever cooperation local authorities

may require in presenting the matter to a grand jury.

This is the matter involving the murder of Martin Luther

2D

Ma

King, sI.

Louis E. Lomax has now released his final news article.

It is a vicious and unwarranted attack against the Bureau and is

replete with misstatements of fact and ridiculous conclusions.

1. LOMAX STATES: The Director deeply disliked King

and once referred to him as a notorious liar; therefore, few

black people will believe the Bureau will work overtime to

find King's slayer.

FACTS: The total facilities of the FBI have been

fully committed to this case from the outset. Investigation

has proceeded around-the-clock on a top priority basis

throughout the United States and in various foreign countries.

Thousands of interviews have been conducted and hundreds

of suspects have been processed. A tremendous number of

examinations have been conducted by the Laboratory and

Identification Division. Every logical investigative approach

is being vigorously pursued and there will be no let up

until Ray is apprehended.

2. LOMAX STATES: The FBI is inept or its burgling

is intentional,

REG-20 44-38861-3145

FACTS: The Bureau's record in this case is one

of substantial achievement, Starting with an unknown subject,

the man known as Eric Galt was identitied as a prime suspect

within five days. Within another week we had obtained a

photograph of the subject and the Attorney Genera? MAY 9 1958

warrant Federal process. Three days later, as a result

of a project to check latent fingerprints against the

fingerprints of more than 53, 000 fugitives, Ray was

determined to be identical with Galt.

3. LOMAX STATES: Somebody managed to circulate

wrong fingerprints for Ray and if he had been arrested

when he abandoned his car in Atlanta (#/5/68) he would

not have been identified as Ray.

FACTS: The FBI has issued only one set of

fingerprints and these are the actual fingerprints of Ray.

When Ray escaped from prison in April, 1967, Missouri

authorities issued a wanted notice that bore the wrong

fingerprints; however, the warden immediately issued a

corrected wanted notice bearing the correct fingerprints.

We had nothing to do with these wanted notices issued by

Missouri almost a year before King was killed.

4 LOMAX STATES: The FBI has pre-empted local

police from the case by declaring the King murder a

conspiracy.

FACTS: We have closely cooperated with the Memphis

Police who obtained a murder warrant immediately after

Federal process was obtained. All evidence has been

turned over to the police together with the results of

Laboratory and fingerprint examinations and we have

offered locai authorities whatever assistance may be

needed in presenting the case to a local grand jury.

5. LOMAX STATES: The FBI has yet to ask the

cooperation of the Los Angeles Police,

FACTS: Our relations with the Los Angeles Police

in this case have been excellent. We have checked their

records on the subject and various other individuals and

on 5/3/68 when the police received a letter to the "Los Angeles

Times" purportedly written by the subject, it was immediately

made available to the Los Angeles Office,

6. LOMAX STATES: Ray made at least three trips from

Los Angeles to New Orleans,

1472-112

## Page 326

Memorandum to Mr. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

FACTS: Ray is only known to have made two trips

from Los Angeles to New Orleans, in December, 1967, and

in March, 1968.

7. LOMAX STATES: The FBI confiscated telephone

company records listing calls made from Los Angeles

telephone booths used by Ray and only the FBI knows what

these records show.

FACTS: We have not confiscated any records, We

have obtained information from the telephone company

regarding calls made from all pay telephones in the

St. Francis Hotel, Los Angeles. It would appear that • .

Lomax has been unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain

similar information from the telephone company.

8, LOMAX STATES: America's blacks never have

trusted either the Director or the FBI.

FACTS: We have long enjoyed the confidence of

responsible Negro leaders and the responsible Negro press.

This confidence has been gained by the Bureau's continuing

success in handling Civil Rights cases such as the murder

of three civil rights workers in Mississippi, the murder of

Lt, Colonel Lemuel Penn in Georgia, the murder of

Viola Liuzzo in Alabama, investigations concerning

discrimination in voting, education, and many similar

investigative accomplishments.

8, LOMAX STATES: The FBI leaked a story to the

press suggesting a Negro was behind King's murder.

FACTS: This is absolutely false.

10, LOMAX STATES: The Director should publicly

admit his dislike for King and then "share the hunt" with a

less prejudiced agency; the cause of justice would be better

served if the investigation were under a Warren-type,

biracial commission,

FACTS: This is unworthy of comment,

Memorandum to MI. DeLoach

RE: MURKIN

11, LOMAX STATES: It is certain powerful men in

American society were part of the deed.

FACTS: We have developed no evidence to indicate

this is true nor does Lomax document this statement in

any way.

In his prior articles Iouis Lomaz made reference to a

"mysterious blond" named Jerri who he alleged bad been involved

with Ray at Los Angeles and later went to Milwaukee where Loma

said she had disappeared, Jerri has been identified as Dycell

Dennis, a prostitute and narcotics addict whose relationship with

Ray appears to have been limited to a single meeting in a bar followed

by a brief visit to his room.

Edgar John Pendleton, Ios Angeles, with whom Lomas

has also been in contact, has made available a letter he received from

Dyrell Dennis, postmarked 4/19/68 at Milwaukee, This letter

states in part,

"Have you seen Ray? I hope he is OK," Pendleton

denies any knowledge of the subject and states the Ray mentionad by

Dennis is Ray Selma, a Mexicaa-American who formerly resided at

the St. Francis Hotel, It is noted Dennis has stated she knew the

subject only as kris,

Local authorities are scheduled to present this matter

to a grand jury at Meraphis, 5/7/68, to seek a murder indictment

against Ray»

At the present time it does not appear that Bureau

personnel will be required to testify, but the Special Agent in Charge

will be available if he is needed.

ACTION:

Vigorous investigation is continuing on a top priority basis.

MURKIN

While having lunch at Hammel's on 7/25/68, Jim McShane;

could U, S. Marshal'S. Office, Department of Justice, assed if he

sit at my table for a few minutes. I told him

to sit down,

McShane told me that he wanted to express the deep resent

ment that he and all US Marshals felt over the fact that the FBI

had brought James Earl Ray from London to the US. He stated this

was logically a job for the US Marshals and that, while he had

always meticulously adhered to the premise that the Marshals

should never infringe on FBI jurisdiction, yet the FBI had cer-

tainly infringed on the Marshals' responsibilities in this

instance.

McShane also told me that he had discussed this matter

with Fred Vinson and planned to mention it to the Attorney General.

I told McShane that it appeared his complaint was being

misplaced, inasmuch as this was something he should discuss with

the AG.

I told him that, although the AG made the final decision,

I wanted McShane to definitely realize that I personally was glad

that the FBI had brought the subject back to the US. I stated

this was a highly important case, very technical and complex in

nature, and it this man had started discussing the aspecis of the

case with marshals, the marshals would have definitely been

completely lost.

licShane replied that he personally had brought a subject

back from overseas in a previous important case.

I told him I

xemembered this, inasmuch as this particular subject had gotten

away from him and had succeeded in slashing his wrists.

McShane

laughed and admitted this.

McShane told me that his complaint meant nothing personally

between

the two of us; however, he definitely wanted the FBI to

subject, he should aiscuss this with the AG and not the FBI.

As the result of the request that the latent fingerprint

obtained in the Murkin case be searched against all fugitives, again

the NCIC system was used. Using the computer, the 25, 000 fugitive

records in the NCIC were searched looking for only the sixth finger

of the fingerprint pattern stored in the NCIC record for ridge counts

19 to 15. The questioned ridge count was reported by the Identification

(Division to be 11 or 12. In two hours machine time the computer

identified 1, 740 possible records for the Identification Division to

check within the ridge count range of 9 to 15. This information was

furnished to the Identification Division and within the first 100 records

positive identification was made of the subject in this case. If this

had to be done manually it would have possibly taken several weeks

of longer as they would have no way to isolate the questioned finger.

JAMES EARL RAY

• INTERESTING IDENTIFICATION

Martin Luther King, JI., was killed on April 4, 1958, while

standing on a balcony of the worraine note. in mempois, Tennessee.

The

unknown killer made good his getaway, but in so doing, left behind evidence

that would eventually help lead to his identification, apprehension and imprisonment.

Items left behind were a . 30-06 Remington rifle with attached Redfield telescogic

sight, binoculars, and a blue zipper bag containing clothing and personal

articles. These items were found in the vicinity of a rooming house across

from the Lorraine Hotel. Investigation determined that subject had rented a

room at the rooming house using the name John Willard, and it was from the

bathroom in this establishment that the fatal snot was fired. The rifle and other

evidence was delivered to the FBI Laboratory and Identification Division by a

Special Agent of the Memphis Division.

Several latent prints of value were developed on the items

submitted. Two of these latent prints, one on the rifle and one on the

binoculars were found to bave been made by the same finger and the position

of these prints, as well as the shape and slope of the ridges, indicated tha

prints were probably from the left thumb.

Thorough investigation developed considerable information.

relative to the murderer. The rifle had been purchased in Birmingham by

an individual using the name Harvey Lowmeyer; the white Mustang believed

to be the getaway car was registered to an Eric Starvo Galt wio had spent

the night preceding the murder at the Rebel Motel in Memphis. Galt was

furtber traced to a rooming bouse in Atlanta where additional evidence fas

recovered, including a map of Mexico. A latent fingerprint developed thereon

was identified with the latent prints on the rifle and binoculars. This identi-

fication enabled the FBi fingerprint experts to say that this print in addition

taprobably baing from the left thumo, was an unar lood of 12 ridge counts.

The latent prints developed on the rifle, binoculars, the map,

and other avidence had been compared during the eleven days following the

murder with approximately 400 suspects, had been searched through all

sections of the EBI's single fingerprini file and.compared with all outstanding

## Page 337

Based on the premise that the latent fingerprint recovered

from the rifle, binoculars and man of Mexico was probably from the left

thumb and was an unar loop of 12 riege counts, a revier of the fingerprint

records of the 53, 000 fugitives on file was undertaken and it was found that

approximately 1900 of these fugitives had unar loops of 10 - 11 ridge counts

in the left thumb. Comparisons were started and on April 19, 1968, 15 days

after the crime, the latent fingerprints were identified with the fingerprints

01 James Earl Pay, an escapee from the Missouri State Penitentiary Where be

had been serving time for robbery.

The fingerprint identifications with James Earl Ray triggered an

intensive man hunt involving law enforcement officers and investigative

personnel, not only in the United States, but also Mexico, Canada, England,

and other countries.

The possibility that Ray himseli might have been killed was

not overlooked and all unknown deceased fingerprint cards received by the

FBI were referred to the Latent Fingerprint Section for comparison. One

case of this type concerned a body found buried on the beach at Acapulco,

Mexico. Fingerprints taken by local authorities from this body were examined

in the Latent Fingerprint Section but, because of the condition of the body,

were of no value. An examiner from the FBI's Latent Fingerprint Section

lem to Mexico and on examining the flesh of the fingers was able to determine

that the body was not that of James Earl Ray.

Another: phase of the investigation led to Canada, and there,

following an exhaustive search of passport applications, it fas determined

that Ray had obtained a passport under the name of Ramon George Sneya and

nad taken an airplane flight to London.

Copies of the FBI Identification Order prepared following Ray's

identification by latent prints were immediately furnished to Scotland Yard and

on June 6, 1969, while attempting to board a flight for Brussels, Belgium,

Ray was arrested at London Airport.

Ray was subsequently ordered extradited to Memphis, Tennessee,

to stand trial for murder and to Missouri as an escaped felon. On Marco 10,

1069, Pay plead guilty to King's murder and was sentenced to 99 years in the

Iennessee Siate Penitentiary.

It has previously been reported Sandy Smith advised the Bureau

before the murder. It has now been determined that the photographs taken

by Way are actually photographs of John Patrick O'Rourke, formerly

a Sergeant on the West Orange, New Jersey, Police Department for

sixteen years. O'Rourke does not appear to have any connection with

this case,

The Laboratory has determined that a piece of brown tiread

from the room Ray had in a 'hippie" rooming house in Atlanta is like

the brown thread used to mend undershorts abandoned with the rifle in

Memphis at the time of the killing. The undershorts have been traced

to Ray by the laundry tag.

..

Information was received from "Life" magazine that one

Earl Smith, Nemphis, had allegedly been approached regarding a plot to

assassinate King. Smith has been interviewed and related that he served

six years in the Air Force as an Explosives Ordnance Disposal Technician®

engaged in conversation with another patron and mentioned his military

specialty. Two days later he met the same man again in the bar and

this man said that since Smith had been in the Air Force he should have

contacts for obtaining munitions and explosives. He then requested

Smith to get 50 hand grenades and laid $5, 000 in cash on the table saying,

"This is yours it you get me the grenades." The man then told Smith

that he and four others in Memphis had vowed that one of them would

kill Martin Luther King, JI., in one way or another and this was why they

wanted the hand grenades. Smith asked the man if he was a member

of the Ku Klux Klan and he replied that he was not. Smith declined to

provide hand grenades and was told, "It you can't get them for me, you

had better forget it." Smith has had no further contact with this man

and does not knov his identity. He described him as forty-five years of

age, 5' 7" tall, 220 pounds, gray hair, and driving a new Corvette:

automobile.

After being interviewed Smith alleged that he had been fired

from his job because he had furnished information. C. E. Weaver,

general manager of the Western Auto store was contacted and said he

had not fired Smith but had told him to go home because he was drinking

on the job. He also said that Smith had failed to appear at a scheduled

meeting of employees at 6:30 a. mo, 4/11/68 and he had determined that

Smith had been drunk the evening before and had overslept.. Weaver

considers Smith to be deceitful, unreliable, probably a heavy drinker

land Weaver has been considering firing Smith.

Records of the penitentiary at Leavenworth show that Ray

was approved for the honor farm in 1957 but was never so assigned

as he did not feel he could live in the honor farm dormitory because

it was integrated.

John Larry Ray, subject's brother, has been located in

Sto Louis where he operates a bar. John claims he has seen the subject

only twice in twenty years, the last occasion being three years ago

at Missouri State Penitentiary. John Ray expressed wonder that Ray

is being hunted by the FBI since all he has cone is "Kill a nigger" and

there would be no interest in Ray if King had been white. John Raj

said the subject would have no reason to contact him and would not be

able to locate him anyway.

Well, if you turn around and check to find out why he offered $20, 000

on Reverend King's death to four men in a UCLA building. I was there,

one of twenty-six men at that party. They had a big fight between the

two of them, It was never put in the paper. You have the FBI investigate

and find out why the man was offered $20, 000 and a hideout in Bimini.

That is why I left Los Angeles, to come up here, because I have heard

your program and explain everything to you so you can turn it over to the

| FBI and let them figure it out."

The caller also said the meeting had been in a white house and

when the announcer asked for his name so he could be contacted by the

FBI, the caller stated, "Well, I don't want them to contact me because

my life ain't worth two cents, on account of the man that hit (censored,

censored) it might trip away from him. That is all I am going to say.

Thank you." Los Angeles is contacting racial sources for any information

as to such a meeting and the statements actually made by Powell.

ACTION:

Every possible means of locating Ray is being vigorously

pursued.

While talking to Adorney General Ramsey Clark on soother mattes,

I was more or less atymied in legal technicalities in Creat Britain as & has

to go through a long process on extradition. I commented that, of course, the

Jawyer who has gone over to represent Ray Is a former FBI Agent; that he La

so zood and was the attorosy in the Mrs. Viola Lnizzo case, but, of course,

we got coarlotions in tial,

but tas lawyer hes aisrays beea strongiy pro tina.

"ne does not intend to ask for a change of venue i he i3 to ba taled in Memphis.

Ths Altorey General asked i we were getting any evidence that Ray had

somebody belping hira and supporting him and I lold him sons whatsoeves.

I auid we were checking various lines ag to Ray and Sirban Sirhan In the

Sobert F. Kennedy case as to the mysterims voman in the pantay of the

Ambassader Hotel and eo far they have all tallen through, I said the girl

in the Sizhan sase has remsed to take a lie detector test, but I thought the

police zero golag to give her one albongà eo laz she bas refused to take once.

The Atorney General based li this were the voman lo the polka doi dreas and

¿ tola bir it vas the one who claized she sau the voman in the polisa dos dress.

Tha Altorney General said he bad read the zeport on ber and got the iseling

eze wes unpainaced. I commented that the was secting mablicity.

I continued that we are aiso checking as to who was with airban

Sirkon at the riale range when he was practiciny with the revolver as well

as persons with him when he bought the ammunitios, Latted in these

inctances they were men.

I stated that in Ray's case, ve heve not lound a olegle angle that

would innicate a conopiraey. i suld the ouly Bignificant thing is the money

he had and which he apest freely in paying bills and I thought that could have

beea catained from a bank robbesy.

The Attorney General said that li we

could sbow he robbes the benk at Alton, it would be helpful. I said we are

working on that becauso he was paying his bills with $50 bille no to his arrest.

I sald on the other hand he stayed at flop houses and never staged at a first-

clasa botal but at the saine tume be agent, 1 thought, $1200 or more in biting

guns aed the car, which I thought was $1500, and then he tock dancing lessons,

Darrenter Leesons, and Leasong in picking lochs, and that 13 may 1 1i5a Secueity

Tha Attorney Genaral commented that he hoped my sen can bring

him back aud aaised 11 that were satialactory. I told him it was and that

17uuld be strongly of the opinlon, waless there is a compelling reason to te

contzary, that he ought to be brought back by military plane; thas I could nos

Zool; that ba is desperate and will make any elort to escape that ha can. i

sald I thonght he sboult be laaded at the Naval airport in hemphia and aus

the regular aleport The Attorasy General asked li we should hazy a repre

Bentative of the Memphis Polico Depastment on board or act, and 1 sail

would not thinis Bo. I maid I pould think we would be responsible for takiag

him from the British and arrange with Irant Holloman to have the Memphia

Polica at the airport in Meraphia on arstral, but to do li alracat on an "eges

enly" basis so there will be no leai as to where or whea he ls comlag in

bocauss me will be plagued by the press, as they are trying everything they

can in England to got a line en when he is baing moved. I said I noted the

lawyer says be expects to be advised exactly when and where he will depart

The Altornay General commented that he will kaow shen he gets in.

I said there is a military airport in London and I thought that is

where the military plane should land lilt goes from this country with

absolute allence on the part of the Commanding General as to lis departure;

that the flast moniedge in tals country would come when he is delivered to

the Memphis Police with saillelent tire to get him into jail. I sald the

Plane should arrive so as not to allow them to go through the dity in the daytime

but to arrive around 2:00 or 5:00 in the morning. The Attorney General sald

he was sure loat was enacily sight. i paid otherwise mere mill be citorca so

klll him 1l thero is a conspiracy and li there is no conspiracy, the supporters

of Dr. Bing will do everything in theis power to kill him. I said the same

thing ts trua la the case of Sirban Sirhan In Lios Angeles because the feelinge

on behall of the Kennedy lollowers is so strong feat they will have to take

zacat precautiona to see he 15 not klled. leaid lt would be a horrible thing

as it would be charged lt size done by the Federai Gorerament or somathing

Ice that sod foz that reason it muat ho very carefully handied both as to

¿raasportadon of Ray from Londoa and Incarceration, li he is ever extradited

as I think it is going to ding on for live or six weeks.

I said what I am atrald of

15, that there is going to develop in this country criticiom on the part of the Exitlsh

in getting this iclico back here. I said people have asked how soon he will be

brought back and I have told them it la up to the British as it Is not ous re

oponsibillty as we have done everything so tent he has legal representation.

Beczelary and cuz Ambassador ssked that be come back. He said that us bave

urged in every way that it be spesded un because of toe strong feeling in this

The Altornay Gonezal asked then 1i I kought a militazy plane i9

of goiting him back does not mase much ollierence as to the legality of the

thing or the image of it.

The Attorney Goneral Cormented that he had bees

that they are not tubt on benurity as they do not search & person mless be is

that. I sald they finally did, but they always tals about traditions over there.

I told the Abtorney Genaral thai the men who were in London were

back here, as ons man's lather had a serious heart attack. I said one la

Bpecial Agent Zelsa, whom he may remember, and the Attorney General sale

he did, that he was a close friend of his lather's and his son knows him, too.

I said he will ba on the plane and so would joan I. Minnich. The Attorney

Ceneral commented this would be ideal.

The Altorney General aaked how we thought Ray got the three sames

he used.

1 sald tais again shows bis astuteness as all three are llving people

residing in Cunada who never knew him and never heard of him. I said on

the other baad, Ray spent last yens, when he was wandering around the country,

a great portion of the time in Canada and I thought he was planning this thiny

and socking a douale identity like Sneyl, Gait, and Bridgeman and chechng

out those iames so ll there were any check made on his application for & birth

certificate, they - ould ascertain such a person existed. I said this abous his

shrowdness, I sald I think we are dealing with a man who le not za ordinary

critinal in the usual sense, but a roan capable of doing any lini of a sly act.

The Attorney General said be was ezceptlonally clever.

Ã sald Sirban Sirhan is a ditierent individual as he 1s a fanatic and

killed Roberi Kenacay because he apoke la favor of Israel and this fellow

ocing an arab became intensely bitter aminst dennedy and telt de should be

alled, which he dia, but he is a fanatle and Ray is not a fanatie in that sense.

I said I think Ray Is a racist and detested Neyroes and Martin Inther King

and there is indication that prior to the Memphis situation, he had information

about fing speaking in olher towns and then glosed out Memphis, & said i

inlak he acted enttrely alone, but we are not closing our minds that others

might be associated with him and ve have to run down every lead.

I sald we are getting more crank letters and letters about other

people woo ase going to be killed who are in bigh office, such as Senatos

Edward Kennedy, et estera. I said sae does not sealec how many puts

are loose in this eountry until we have a case like this. The Attorney General

said ll brings them out. I sale we have to be careful ci all of thema; that we

take abat three amay a vect tho come to toy ofilca who complain about

persetution sod sometimes they are armed and we senu them to the hospital

and thun they are sont to &k. Elizabeth's and in two or three months they are

back on the stesets. The Attoracy General said we are going to have to

find acy wegs to dual with that prublem as it in not flective now, I said it

is a problam for tea psychiatrists but they are apparently doing llite to cure

them, but they are mentally mmbalanced.. The Attorney General said it is a

pablic salety problem nos. I said i do not invor the view that the country

is depraved and all that. I said 1 think we bave a great block oi line people

in this country; that there may be some depraved citizens, but it is not a

depraved society. The Attorney General said he thought there was too much

emphasis today la the press that sociesy is siek, tbat i is the fashionable

thing to co.

I said I hoped the new Commission the President has appoiried

mill beep a balanced viewpoint aa to that because the othez Commission

went fas estray in regerd to white racism. I sald there is raciam but not es

precomlaantly as the Kerner Commiseion found it to be. The Attorney

General saw he had never lound it 30. a said as an example take the meelung

yesterday (Solldarity Day); that more than 50% of those who attended were white

and lt ras not precominantly Negro.

The Attorney General said that was

surprising to him and he felt better to see i that way. I sald this shows

unat white raciam ls sot as predominant as we bave been led to believe.

I said I hope the Elsenbower Commission when they get around to thel

findings view il with an unemotional attirade.

The Alturney Cereral sald

there are some good people on the Coromission, A sald it seems it should

• be done ulthout emotionaliam of crying llre. I said I get annoyed with the

editorials about cur aick society as I do not bellere thera is such a thing

in this country although there are come sick citisens. The Attorney Genera

said that if I could nake this polat in the Law Enforcement Bulletia on the

Director's para, he thought it would be helpful. I said I have been working

on coat just recently: that the idea was given to me by MeGill oi she atlanta

Constitution. A said he hed a line editorial about tbe attacie on the Sa

because we had not found the King murderer alter up months and the cracks

that we were not laying to lind bim and thea ba quoted several verses oi the

Slble which portrayed Christ as not Interested in the poos, but it ahoved

again that thera la alays on ellort to teas down and destrog. a commented

that à thought there was a tendency to debunk our Patrioss in bistory. I said

1t was that sort of thing that I thought drove President Johnson from running

for a secord term and the Attorney General azreed.

This is the case involving the murder of Martin Luther King.

Reference is made to previous memoranda concerning

Jensen's plan to interview subject Ray in the above-entitled matter

at the Tennessee State Penitentiary, Nashville, Tennessee.

I had previously advised that Jensen had entered the maximum

security building of the institution at 3:44 p.m. This information was

furnished to the Director's Office immediately thereafter.

It is also pointed out that the steps outlined and the Director's

comments concerning the need to make no public statement as the press

and TV would descend on the penitentiary en masse were brought to the

attention of Assistant Attorney General Leonard of the Civil Rights Division

after Jensen had started his interview with Ray today. Mr. Leonard

indicated he fully agreed that any publicity at this time would be most

undesirable.

Mr. Leonard asked to be informed of developments which

might have a bearing on this matter as it will be necessary to decide,

in the event Ray is not cooperative and there is no possibility of further

getting any cooperation from him, as to whether he should be brought

before a Federal Grand Jury and be questioned under oath concerning

the existence of coconspirators.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN: In accordance with the Director's instructions,

the resuits of the interview of subject Ray by SAC Jensen will be furnished

tó the Director before any further action is taken to disseminate such

information to the Department. "It is noted that Leonard indicated he was in

close touch with the Attorney General in this matter and is anxious to know

of developments. The information will therefore not be furnished to

Mr. Leonard until it receives the Director's approval.

GALT was very ill at ease in crowds and gave

her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or

with no more than one other individual.. He was an

introvert and was very hard to converse with.

She stated

that in the approximate two months that she knew him,

only towards the last did he feel confident enough with

her that he would joke with her.

She stated that toward

the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed

very few people knew he had. He was always ill at ease

around others and could not relax while in conversation.

with any other individual. He always fidgeied, pulled at

his ears, played with his

hands, and looked in every

direction but at the person with whom he was conversing.

She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that

he smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general

conversations she was led to believe that he came to Los

Angeles

from Mexico, possibly around Mexico City. He told

her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman;

that he wished to return to sea, and that he received

sufficient proceeds from the sale of a bar that he could

RHOADS stated that she was of the opinion that

GALT entertained the thought of asking her for a date on

many occasions, but his backwardness prevented him from

actually doing

During the dancing lessons he always

centered his conversations around dancing techniques and

never talked in general terms about himseli.

She believes

he was a southerner, and she recalled that possibly the

first or second week during. January 1968, he did not attend

dancing instruction, and upon his return,

stated that he had

visited a brother in the State of Louisiana.

RHOADS stated

that during the two month period that she knew GALT, he

changed residences twice in Hollywood, California.

She

at no time associated with GALI socially.

his social inaptness by his attire and placing his

schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an example, she stated that GALI took dancing

lessons she believed to

overcome some of his shyness.

pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling vo

on the number of lessons normally taught per week so as to

take the maximum number of lessons in the shortest possible

time.,

He abruptly quit dancing, telling her that he had

enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in

his schedule.

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with

his dancing lessons sufficiently to satisfy himself and

was

"running off on another tangent.'

she also stated

that GAlI was not sufficiently busy she believed to have not

pursued both courses,

because GALT told her that he slept

rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early aiternoon,

went to bartending school in the late afternoon, and would

then attend dancing lessons in the early evening.

This,

he explained to her, was his typical day, which was not a

busy, productive, or strenuous one in her mind.

She stated that GALT was very slow in his mental

processes.

He often did not understand jokes and did not

react favorably to a friendly gesture extended to him.

RHOADS stated

that during one conversation with GALT she

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any

jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed

otherwise. GALT replied that he detested jewelry of any sort,

and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,

RHOADS COUld remember nothing else of the

mannerisms, background,

of GALT.

She stated that GALI

was a white male, weighing about 165 pounds.

She stated

that he had brown hair; was in his middle 30s; had a medium

complexion,

and spoke with a Southern accent.

She stated

that from his diction she believed him to be high school

educated. To her knowledge, he spoke no foreign language.

Ray did report for the scheduled appointment on November 27th,

at 5:00 p.m. Dr. FREMAN exhibited a leaf from his consultatior

RAY had very little to contribute about his personal family back

ground. He said that he was unemployea.

That he had worked as

a cook on a Mississiopi river steamer, but did not like the work,

Although he gave his birthdate as March 10, 1928, on the occasion

of their first appointment, RAY impressed the doctor as being "young

and immature."

In consultations subsequent to their first meeting, the doctor

stated he felt that he and RAY developed a good rapport. Ray repeated

his request thai he wanted to overcome his shyness,

and gain social

confidence so that he would be able to talk to people.

He was usually

placid, cooperative, easily led in conversations, and did not fight

against the doctor as some of his clients do.

or thira visit, the doctor asked RAY if he had any "deep dark secrets

that he wanted

is da sti

to get off his chest.". The doctor said he usually asks

this question to determine if his clients have any criminal background

or any sexual problens or aberations.

He said that RaY answered in

the negative, and gave him no reason

to doubt his answer.

RAY indicated he had read a lot of books on hypnosis..

According

to DI. FREIAN,

"Ray hadthe old pover idea of hynotism.

That is that

you can go around looking people in the eye and can hyonotise them anà

make them do what you want them to."

In subsequent appointments, Dr.

FRESMAN placed PAY in a hypnotic state. He said he nould have RAy lie

down on a couch in his office, and stare at a little soiral on the

ceiling. Then the doctor would talk to him..

Ha was a very apt subject:

for. hypnosis.

Very eagers

and very cooperative. He was an excellent

hypnotic subject. He was likeable, and polite.

He was making progress

in overcoming his shyness.

At the conclusion of each session, he thanked

the doctor for his assistance; and indicated that he was satisfied with

the progress he was making.

He was learning to calm his boay down, and

overcome nervousness, and shyness. He usually did what the doctor wanted.

The doctor had no recollection ofany particular habits or hobbies

that RAl mighu have had. He did not recall any scars or peculiar

physical characteristics that made any special. impression on him vith

regard to RAY. He had no recollection of any discussions regarding

sports, although their visits were during the height of the football

and the start

of the basketball season. He was neat, and to

the best of the doctor's recollection, usually more a suit coat, without

a tie.

Iwo photographs of unic CALl (with eyes open and eyes closed)

were exhibited to the doctor, who said they were excellent likenesses

of his patient, JAMES E. RAY.

The doctor pointed out in his professional aupointment book, entries

for JAMES E. RAY covering six appointments and a seventh entry which was

patients cone to him a referral from Mr. MALVIN POWERS of the Wilshire

Book Company on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, California; which he

The doctor concluded by stating

• that JAMES I. RAY came to him

seeking psychological help in the nature of self-hypnosis to gain

confidence, overcome shyness, learn to sleep better, and to be able

to talk to people.

Following each session, he was instricted to g

home and practice

the methods of relaxation they had gone over in

the office.

He was shy, introverted, and withdrawn, but not psychotic

or plagued with any deey

Although he indicated he

was unemployed, he never seemed to lack money to pay in cash for his

consultations during the period of their appointments.

When he

called to cancel their last appointment, he indicated he was going

to New Orleans to accept a position his brother had obtained for him;

but he told the doctor he hoped they would meet again sometime.

on occasion, exact number of occasions. not recalled.

He does recall

that on at least one occasion on attempting to visit his brother,

le determined that his brother was in sone type of solitary confine-

ient and could not have visitors.

Therefore, although he had signed

in to visit his brother, he actually did not see his brother. JOHN

HARRY RAY pointed out that this may be the reason for the numerous

visits shown to the Penitentiary by him, all of which he does not

recall.

JOHN LARRY RAY stated that he has not seen nor heard of

his brother or from his brother since his escape from the Penitentiary

outside of what he has learned from newspaper articles and news

cormentaries:

He very emphatically denied having any knowledge, eithex

_airect or indirect, of his brother ever being in Omaha, Nebraska.

He stated that his

knowledge of his brother being in California

•is linited

to what was reported in the newspaper.

On one or more occasions he does recall, however,

that

JAMES EARL RAY mentioned that as soon as he got out of the Penitentiary

(not clarified as to whether he intended to escape or whether he

JOHN LARRY RAY, 1902a Cherokee, was interviewed at

that location at which time he supplied

the following infor-

mation:

RAY identified a photograph of JAMES DAVID DAILEY

as a person known to him only as "J.D." who at one time operated

a tavern on Morrison Street in St. Louis and with whom RAY ..

got involved in a fist fight with sometime in 1960. RAY is

of the opinion that although he knows "J.D." by sight he does

not believe that DAILEY knows him.

RAY was unable to provide

any information whether his brother, JAMES EARL RAY, and DAILDY

have ever known each other.

RAY was questioned regarding his stay at the Mac

Arthur Hotel in St. Louis at which time he readily stated

that approximately two or three months ago he spent a night.

at the MacArthur Hotel with the night barmaid of the Grape-

vine Inn, NAOMI REGAZZI (phonetic). According to RAY he regis-

tered as

Mr. and Mrs. JOHN RAY and provided a fictitious address.

He was questioned regarding the address 1886 Wyoming at. which

time he stated it is entirely possible that he used that address

when registering, however, it does not have any particular

significance to him.

RAY stated that in the

early fall of 1967, his father,

JERRY RAYNES, had sold a house on Park Avenue in St. Louis and

gave to RAY $1000 to hold for him.

RAY indicated that he had

saved approximately $3000 from various employments and

indicated

that on many occasions carried this cash on his person and..

stated that even to this date it is not unusual for him to

carry $500 or $600 on him. RAY denied any of the money saved

by him had been obtained in an unlawful manner. RAY supported

this statement by saying that in the operation of the Grape-

vine Tavern it is necessary to have an abundance of cash for

various bills and he also pays the employees at the tavern

in cash.

RAY stated that in early August of 1967, he had

decided to drive to San Francisco, California, in an attempt

to invest the money he had at that time in a bar or other:

profitable business. He indicated that he drove alone to

California, and while in San Francisco, stayed several days

Mexico.

He related that

he had

heard of the numerous dishonest people and thieves

in Mexico so while traveling through an unnamed town in Wyoming

he purchased $750 worth of travelers' checks. RAY stated

that he then drove to Tijuana and after his arrival there

stated it was extremely difficult for him to understand the

language, that he did not like the place, and within two

hours after his arrival departed en route to St. Louis, Mis-

souri.

RAY stated the entire trip required approximately

two weeks and he emphatically denied any. knowledge of or contact

with his brother, JAMES EARL RAY, during the trip or at any

time following JAMES' escape from the Missouri State Peniten-

tiary.

He stated he never knew that JAMeS RAY was in California,

him.

RAY added that upon his arrival in St. Louis during

the last

week of August, 1967, he opened bank accounts at

the Manufacturers Bank and also the Jefferson-Gravois Bank.

He indicated that both accounts were opened as the combined

business hours of both banks were suitable to his own hours.

RAY stated that deposits to open these accounts were made

with the remaining cash he had on hand and the travelers'

checks which he purchased in Wyoming.

RAY was questioned regarding the financial status

of his brother, JAMES RAY, while he was in the Missouri State

Penitentiary and RAY stated that he had no idea as. to how

recollection of statements made by JAMES during visits to

of income for his brother but he again assumed that. if his

brother was involved in the sale of amphetamine or in the.

Joan business while in the penitentiary he would then presumably

have made some money.

RAY denied any knowledge or informa-

tion that anyone outside the penitentiary owed money to his

brother or was hading money for him.

Date June 5, 1968

JOHN LARRY RAY was located and interviewed while he was

tending bar at the Grapevine Tavern at the intersection of Arsenal

and Illinois.

RAY stated that he has not had any contact with his brother,

JAMES EARL RAY, SinCe last Interviewed nor has he received any intor-

mation regarding the whereabouts of his brother since he escaped

from the Missouri State Penitentiary (MSP) • JOHN RAY Aid make the

comment that he did belive his brother was probably out of the

country or either he was deceased as he feels he would have been

apprehended by this time.

RAY denied any contact with his brother, JERRY RAY, since .

JERRY was in St. Louis, either telephonically or by mail.

JOHN RAY was questioned regarding the whereabouts of

CLARENCE HAYNES, at which time RAY stated that Hinds employed

with a local drayage firm and is extremely difficult to locate

during the daylight hours. He stated that HAYNES does reside at

1822 North 21st Street, however, it is unlikely that he normally

spends much time at that location. RAY explained this by saying

that. HAYNES' wife RUBY is currently in the hospital for treatment

of a

heart ailment.

RAY stated that NAOMI REGAZZI has returned to work at the

Grapevine Tavern since she worked the previous Saturday and several

nights during the past week. RAY could not explain if she would be

employed on a permanent or temporary basis since he had not discussed

work arrangements with her.

An extended interview with RAY was not possible due to the

entrance of several patrons into the tavern and, therefore, the inter-

view was terminated.

Dato June 10, 1968

JOHN LARRY RAY was interviewed at his place of bus-

iness, the Grape Vine Tavern, 1982 Arsenal Street, St. LOUiS,

Missouri.

He was questioned regarding his employment that

could be verified or his whereabouts that could be verified

during the month of April, 1967. After some thought, he

stated that to the best of his recollection, he worked for

a short time as a painter and maintenance man at a hotel be-

lieved to be 902 North Kingshighway, which is managed by a

woman.

he stated that he lelt this was aiter april, now

ever he could not recall specifically but did recall that he

sometime prior to that, put an ad in the paper believed to be

the St. Louis Post Dispatch, indicating that he was attempt-

ing to get workas a painter. As a result of this ad he was

contacted by an interior decorator or pairting contractor, whose

name he could not recall, but whose name he would attempt to

locate through records who he went to work for on a day to day

He stated this individual

operated from his residence which at that time was believed

to be in the 5700 block of Westminster about the middle of

the block on the north side of the street where there was

usually a painting truck parked.

He stated this individual

he recalls on one or two occasions, mentioned that he had just

returned from the Colorado area and usually did small house

painting jobs.

After delivering JOHN RAY to a given job

on a given day, he would then leave supposedly to make other

estimates on other jobs, therefore, JOHN LARRY RAY haû little

personal contact with him.

JOHN LARRY RAY stated that he would

attempt to locate any records that would show his employment

during the year of 1967..

After considerable thought he advised that he was

of the opinion that during April or May, 1967,

he was pro-

bably residing on the second floor at 1822 North 21st Street,

which building is owned by CLARENCE HAYNES.

got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and

JERRY would not "even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN

never met any relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that

JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the

RAy brothers to the Techny Road address.

which Mrs. OLSEN related to a time when GJERDIS had just

Who were then in Jefferson City, Missourt, prison with

JAMES.

JERRY said he visited his brother about three

or four times while he was in prison in Jeiferson City,

Hissouri, the last time being around 1964.

JAMES came

Menard prison to visit JERRY on one occasion. JERRY again

stated that the last time he saw his brother JAMES outside

of prison was in 1951 in Quincy, Illinois, and JERRY was

fifteen years old at that time. The father was still

living with his mother then.

.—-

He said that he believes that WALTER TERRY RIFE and

JAMES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE

never did time with JAMES. He said that if he had given

the Impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the

previous interviews, this was in error.

JERRY again stated

that he himself has

done time in Menard, Illinois, with

both RIFE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the presént

whereabouts of "BLACKIE" AUSTIN and doubts if his brother

has maintained contact with AUSTIN sor would be in contact

with him since his escape.

He said that of all of the

persons that he knows of,

JAMES was the friendliest and

closest with AUSTIN.

JERRY pointed out, however, that his

knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison

when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street.

He

does know that'BLACKIE" liked his brother and has always

talked about him.

In clarification, JERRY advised that his brother

JOHN first came to Chicago sometime around July, 1960, and

he, JERRY, came to this area around September, 1960.

JOHN

first worked at Murphy's Steak House,

He also worked at

the White Pines Country Club and JOHN's last employment ir

the Chicago area was the Indian Hills Country Club, Bloomingdale

Ill1nois. JERRY advised that he was employed with

his

brothers JOHN and FRANK at the Rolling Green Country Club

about sixteen months. and JOHN for eight or nine months.

time prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or

July, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,

Illinois, JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which he had

bought from the father, JERRY RAYNes. At this time, daRli

owned a 1962 air-conditioned Rambler. JOHN was having

trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they

switched cars.

He does recall that JOHN transierred some

clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler.

Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and sone

other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid

these items above the rafters in the garage. He said that

JOHN stayed a couple of days and was in either an apartment

or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY's residence

while here.

JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are

presently at his father's farm in Center, Missouri, JERRY

said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but.

did meet him at Christmas time, 1967, when JERRY and big:

wife went to st. Louis where they had dinner at CAROL

-;

PEPPER's house and JOHN was present. JERRY advised that

JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,

Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of

Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence.

JERRY also advised that his brother JAMES did not ever know

that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook.

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that be :.

borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother

JAUES While JAMES was in prison. He reiterated that state-

ment in this interview at which time the financial trans-.

actions from his brother's account at the Inmates Bank':::

Missourt State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missourt, were

discussed with JERRY. It was pointed out to him that this

list shows that his brother had sent him $266.25. JERRY

advised that this must be an error since the only amount

he recognized

was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,

1964. He stated that at this time, he, dorky, was in

Sto Louis, Missouri, and needed mom y to return to Chicago

to obtain

JAMES escaped.

JERRY suggested that the money listed to

him was instead paid to his brother's attorney, name unknown,

In Jefferson City, Missouri. JERRY advised that he himself

did not receive money from his brother to be sent to the

attorney or anyone else.

JERRY advised that this attorney

had been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that

he believed the attorney did visit with JAMEs while Janes

was in prison. JERRY said that his brother never mentioned

anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type of

"bennies" or dope. JAMES never mentioned being involved

1n any illegal drug selling while in prison sor did he..

ever mention that he was involved in any type of racket

with a guard.

He also never mentioned any guard that be

was particularly friendly with and in fact,

made no comment

whatsoever concerning the prison officials

that JERRY can

remember.

• 1.

JERRY also advised that his brother never

mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in ":

fact, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of a

"reader." The only location that he can recall his brother

making a comment as to how much he liked it was Tijuana,

Hexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime in

1951.

The brother made no mention to him at anytime as

to the identity of any persons with whom he

was acquainted

in Mexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Chicago on this •

latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JoHN for two

nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL

one night, at the St. Regis Hotel one night and at the

Hac Arthur Hotel one

night.

In conversations with his

brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they

belleve, from newspaper stories, that the subject is

victim of a frame up or being used as the "tall guy. „' He

also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper

articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has

that opinion. He said that JOHN told him that some people

came to the tavern at. the time of the KING funeral request-

21ng him to close down for that day which he did not do.

JOHN also said that if he himself receives any publicity,

he will close down the tavern and leave because he feels

that people will throw firebombs in his place. dERRY

related that one of the newspaper reporters located and

Interviewed a woman named RUBY who works for his brother

since JOHN had used that woman's address about three or

four years ago. RUBY told the newspaper people that she

did not know the whereabouts of JOHN.

JERRY also said that

in conversations with Join, John told him that the suoject

would be "crazy" to give himself up because even 1j he

is not guilty of the kinG murder, he still would have .

eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jefferson city.

JERRY explained this by stating that his brother has

thirteen years leit on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra five jears for the escape..

-tranges

JERRY again speculated that 1f his brother

was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid

because he could not see how his brother would have obtained

enough money to purchase the 1966 Mustang, take the trips

he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the

telescope used in the murder.

He said that there was just

too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques-

tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have

been able to steal this much

money because he would have had

"slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his

opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that

most of

his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing in

Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest, Illinois,,

which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's

Country Club by WAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic).

JERRY noted •

that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming

house. He said that he is not listed as a tenant and that

the rent of $60 per month is being paid by the country club.

He advised that there is no phone at the building with the

nearest one four blocks away.

was not his

father and reiterated that his father was JAMES GERALD RAY,

who died in 1951 at Hannibal, Missouri.

him that the FBI had combed a two-block area looking for a

JACK GAWRON, since it had been developed that GAWRON had

been acquainted with JAMES. JERRY

said that JOHN knows that

GAWRON has been interviewed by the FBI but JOHN did not

indicate to JERRY that GAWFON had ever stated what he had

told the FBI.

JERRY said that in the past, he had driven GAWRON

around looking at possible burglary scores at which time

GAWRON would pay the expenses.

TO JERRY'S knowledge, GAWRON

never committed any burglary in any of the places in

which

they had "cased" and in JERRY's opinion; GAWRON is "living on

past gloriès." JERRY then stated that GAWRON was a name that

he probably should have given to the Agents before since he,

JERRY, was aware that GAWRON had served time with his brother

JERRY expressed the opinion that JAMES would not contact.

GANRON but believes that JAMES does know GAWRON well, considering

him to be slightly "stir crazy."

JERRY did not mention whether

and made no comment as to the closeness of association between

them.

JERRY advised that WALTER RIFE WaS JAME's rap partner

in Leavenworth and that he, JERRY, has served time with both

what

he would do if his brother contacted him considerable thought.

him and also if he could be assured that every effort would be

At the time that RAY started his employment, he.

No dates of employment were listed for either of

the above two employments.

The last employment entered by

as a dishwasher for Keeshen's (phonetic); however, no address

or city was given for this employment. RAY's home address

was listed as 712 Shennadough (phonetic), Sto Louis, Missouri.

At the time that RAY started his employment as

a dishwasher, the maintenance work was done at the club on

a contract basis by

the Marx Maintenance service, Des Plaines,

Illinois.

an older couple was doing the

maintenance work for the

At this Ilnes: mars Company and resided at the club.

This arrangement was entirely for the convenience of the olub

and was employed again by the convenience of the club by the

Marx Maintenance Service, Eventually, Mi. CHAMBERLAIN

discontinued the Marx Maintenance Service and hired RAY on •

a direct basis and RAY is presently making approximately

$160 a week with a take-home pay averaging anywhere from

$113 to $145 a week.

Take none say aye

CHAMBERLAIN described GIRDIS OLSEN as a woman

still in her twenties, mentally retarded who he believes

is presently residing with her parents, possibly a hir. and

MrS. PAUL A. OLSEN, 1344 Hazel Avenue, Deerfield, Illinois.

This address and the name of her parents was given to the

club by OLSEN at the time she started her employment as

a waitress.

A review of RAY's cancelled checks appears that he

does his banking at the Wheeling Trust and Savings Bank,

Wheeling, Illinois.. All the checks observed were cashed at

this bank.

MI. CHAMBERLAIN advised that he has no objection io

the FBI using his parking lot to maintain a constant surveillance

on RAY.

He also stated that he will immediately contact

RAY and talk to him concerning the necessity of RAY's complete

cooperation with the FBI.

The patrol service used by the

sportsman Country Club is the Glenbrook Patrol Service,

Glenview, Illinois, a service operated by THOMAS BUCKLIN

with telephone number Park 4-3434.

RAY ;

according to CHAMBERLAIN, had a brother whose

first name was unknown to him who, according to RaY, was

employed as a bartender approximately one year ago at the

Indian Lake Country Club near Ebomingdale, Illinois.

The

club is owned by the braninger Organization.

This brother.

was also a bartender supposedly employed by the Green Bakers

Country Club which is located

a short distance east

of

the Sportsnan Country Club.

AS to RAY's divorced wife, GIRDIS OLSEN,

ME. CHAMBERLAIN was of the impression that. RAY had to marry

GUIRDIS. due to her being pregnant.

RAY has no close friends at the club, associates

with no one and seldom leaves the ciub other than on a

Tuesday which is his regular day off.

dishwasher.

He eventually became night. maintenance man at the club and

manner and was honest in every respect; however, she is of.

visits a theater, sometimes staying in Chicago and returning

the next day either for lunch or dinner.

RAY has spoken of a brother who she believes is

from the

St. Louis, Missouri area; however, he never provided

any.additional information concerning this brother other. than

the fact that he was a bartender.

RAY also had a child during

his marriage to GUIRDIS RAY; nee OLSEN, a former waitress

He mentioned the possibility that

If such a letter had been sent it very well could have been stolen

PEPPER waX asked 1f he would discuss this matter with his

wife CAROL and endeavor to determine whether or not she had ever

received any mail or any money mailed to her addressed to the Albert

75. Pepper Stationery Company, 712a Shenandoah, and he agreed to do

so. During the entire course of the intervier, PEPPER appeared

Iriendly, but obviously volunteered no information whatsoever.

It was pointed out to PEPPER that this matter would

undoubtedly be discussed with him again at some future date and

he was apparently agreeable to this suggestion.

HrS. PEPPER

then stated that she sould have no expectations whatever that

her brother would communicate with her in any vay, pointing

out that he did lot know her current address or her current

unpublished. telephone-number.

She added that she felt that

he did not believe that he could expect any help from her and she

said that, as a matter of fact, she rould not be at all

interested

or willing to help

him as she did not want herself

and particularly her children to be in any way involved mith

him.

She said that if she should hear Iron RAY and be convinced

of his innocence she might find it aifficult to furnish such

information to the FBI. It nas pointed out to Mrs. PEPPER that

in the event RAY should be innocent or there should be any .

be most readily resoived through locating RAT at the earliest

a couple of years and that their association was not a social

She

said that she was an instructor at the St. Joseph Church on

at least one parent of one of the children attending the program

to be present. She said CAROL was the parent present at this

She stated that she last saw CAROL sometime in August

JERRY again

stated that the last time he saw his brother

JAnEs outside

Illinois, and JERRY. was

fifteen years old at that time. The father was still

living with his mother then.

He said that he belleves that WALTER TERRY RIFE and

JAkES went to Leavenworth together but that LONNIE RIFE

never did time with JAMES. He said that if he had given

the impression that LONNIE did do time with JAMES in the

previous interviews, this was in error.

JERRY again stated

that he himself has

done time in lenard, Illinois, with

both RIFE brothers.

He stated that he has no idea as to the present

whereabouts of "BLACKIE" AUSTIN and doubts if his brother

has maintained contact with AUSTIN nor would be in contact

with him since his escape. He said that of all of the

persons that he knows of,

JAMES was the friendliest and

closest with AUSTIN. JERRY pointed out, however, that his

knowledge of this is limited since JERRY was in prison

when both AUSTIN and his brother were on the street.

He

does know that'BLACKIE" liled his brother and has always

talked about him.

In clarification, JERRY advised that his brother

ot time prior to his death in September, 1963.

JERRY advised that sometime during June or

July, 1967, when he was living at 2897 Techny Road, Northbrook,

Illinois, JOHN drove here in a 1961 Plymouth which he had

bought from the father, JERRY RAYNES. At this time, JERRY

owned & 1962 air-conditioned Rambler.

JOHN was having

trouble with the transmission in the Plymouth and they

switched cars.

He does recall that JOHN transferred some

Paynouth and td some

clothes and other items from the Plymouth to the Rambler.

Also, that JOHN left some old shirts and pants and some :

other papers in the garage at Techny Road and JERRY hid

these items above the rafters in the garage.

He said that

JOHN stayed a couple of days and was

in either an apartment

or a hotel in Chicago and did not reside at JERRY's residence

while here.

JOHN left with the Rambler and both cars are

presently at his father's farm in Center, Missouri. JERRY

said that his wife did not meet JOHN on this occasion but:

did meet him at Christmas time, 1967, when JERRY and his

"mis

wife went to St. Louis where they had dinner at CAROL •

PEPPER'S house and JOHN was present. JERRY advised that

JOHN did not know how to find his residence in Northbrook,

Illinois, and that he, JERRY, met him in the town of

Northbrook and then JOHN followed him to the residence.

JERRY also advised that his brother JAMES did not ever know

that JERRY resided at this address in Northbrook.

In previous interviews, JERRY advised that he :..'

borrowed somewhere between $40 and $50 from his brother

JAMES while JANES was in prison.

he reiterated that state

ment in this interview at which

time the financial trans-

actions from his brother's account at the Inmates Bank,:.

Missouri State Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri, Were

discussed with JERRY.

It was pointed out to him that this

list shows that his brother had sent him $266.25. JERRY

advised that this must be an error since the only amount

he recognized was $55.25 which was sent to him on June 22,

1964. He stated that at this time, he, JERRY, was in

St. Louis, Missouri,

and needed more y to return to Chicago

escaped.

JERRY suggested that the money listed to

him was instead paid to his

brother's attorney, name unknown,

1n Jefferson City, Missouri.

JERRY advised that he himself

did not receive money from

his brother to be sent to the

attorney or anyone else.

JERRY advised that this attorney

had been hired by his brother to handle his appeal and that

he believed the attorney did visit with JAMES while JAMEs

was in prison.

JERRY said that his brother never mentioned

anything concerning Benzedrine inhalers or any type ot

"bennies" or dope.

JAMES never mentioned being involved

1n any illegal drug selling while in prison sor did he

ever mention that he was involved in any type of racket

with a guard. He also never mentioned any guard that he

was particularly friendly with and in fact, made no comment

whatsoever concerning the prison officials that JERRY can

remember.

JERRY also advised that his brother never

mentioned reading any of the James Bond novels and in

ract, JERRY did not believe his brother was much of a

"reader."

The only location that he can recall his brother

making a comment as to how much he liked it was Tijuana,

Mexico, and he believes his brother was there sometime it

1951.

The brother made no mention to him at anytime as

to the identity of any persons with whom he was acquainted

in Mexico.

JERRY advised that when he left Chicago on this

latter occasion, he stayed with his brother JOHN for two

nights, with his father one night, with his sister CAROL

Hac Arthur Hotel one night.

In conversations with his

brother JOHN and sister CAROL, they both stated that they

believe, from nerspaper stories, that the subject is the

victim of a frame-up or being used as the "fall guy."

He

also stated that CAROL is concerned over the newspaper

articles speculating that the subject is dead and she has

that opinion.

He said that JOHN told him that some people

came to the tavern at the time of the KING funeral request-

Jing him to close down for that day which he did not do.

JOHN also said that if he himself receives any publicity,

he will close down the tavern and leave because he reels

that people will throw firebombs in his place. JERRY

related that one of the newspaper reporters located and

Interviewed a woman named RUBY who works for his brother

since JOHN had used that woman's address about three or

¡our years ago.

RUBY told the newspaper people that she

did not know the whereabouts of JOHN.

In conversations with John, dohn told him that the subject

would be "crazy" to give himself up because even 1I he

1s not guilty of the KING murder, he still would have

InG murder,

eighteen years to do in the penitentiary at Jefferson City.

JERRY explained this by stating that his brother has

thirteen years left on his previous sentence and that

he would get at least an extra live jears for the escajo..

JERRY again speculated that 11 his brother

was KING's murderer, he would have had to have been paid

because he could not see how his brother would have obtained

enough money to purchase the 1966 Mustang, take the trips

he was supposed to have taken and to pay $150 for the

telescope used in the murder.

too much money coming in and in response to a direct ques-

tion, he said that he did not think his brother would have

been

able to steal this much

money because he would have had

"slipped up and been caught." He explained that in his

opinion, his brother was not an accomplished thief and that

most of

his previous scores were "small time."

JERRY advised that he is presently residing in

Apartment 14, 314 Wisconsin Avenue, Lake Forest,

Illinois,,

which rooming house was recommended to the Sportsman's

Country Club by HAYNE CLANDENEN (phonetic).

JERRy noted

that his ex-wife DJERDIS also used to reside at this rooming

, house.

He said that he is not listed as a

tenant and that

the rent of $60 per month is being paid by the country club.

He advised that there is no phone at the building with the

nearest one four blocks away.

He said that he plans to

continue his employment at the Sportsman's Country Club

and mill contact SA RENE J. DUMAINE on a daily basis.

He advised that his ex-wife presently works at

a restaurant near the expressway and is living in a motel

in wheeling, Illinois.

He went on to say that yesterday

there was &

knock on the door of his apartment and when

he opened it, his ex-wife was there. She said that she

had found him by inquiring of the rooming house manager,

the room numbers of the last two tenants and then came to

talk with him.

He said that they talked of personal matters

with nothing of interest in this case.

JERRY advised that

he may have to move from this address

since his ex-wife

might inadvertently give out his whereabouts.

he was not concerned with the problem of people making that

threats against his safety because of what his brother did

but that he was most concerned of the people who would

attempt to barm him without making threats.

In explanation

he made the comment, 'Like that guy who shot King, he

did not make any threats."

JERRY advised that he will continue to cooperate

with the Bureau in furnishing information.

believed thai It was 1n January, 1968.

Miss FERNANDEZ remembered that the Subject's

white Hustang had a tire which was badly road-damaged

and he asted for a replacement, size 7.45 x 14.

Since

there were none of this size in stock, she said, he tool

a size 7.50 x 14 Firestone tire, but requested a discount

since it

Miss TERMANDEZ said she

spole to Hrs. FREGOCO, who was in the upstairs apartment,

and a ten percent discount was authorized.

the said

that, since the tire was slightly larger, and because the

use of tubes is alveys recommended due to the difficult

terrain, the rubject walked to the General Popo torc

and came baci: with a tube which he had purchased hinseli.

The tire yag mounted outside the store by Mrs. FREGOLO's

-

brother.

MiSs FERNAIDEZ searched for the sales slip

recording this transaction, but was unable to locate 1t.

The said that the subject did not give her his name,

and that, since he vas not a Mexican, she did not bother

to ask his name or to note the serial number of the tire

on the sales sile, since this in only done to gerate

purposes. (e)

Continuing, Kiss FREGOO said she lives near

the Casa Sueana and, efter she sold the tire, she

remembered seeing the same white Hustang parked on

Calle 31 de Cctubre around the corner from the casa

Lusana. The car was parked in Iront of a vacant lot

and she thought this strange since she saw it there

about 3 in the morning on several occasions while she

was walking to mort.

On one occasion as she was on her

she said she

never say him with any other person and that he was alone

the day he came to the etore to purchase the tire. (C)

SUBJECT:

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

REVEREND YOUNG AND REVEREND ABERNATHY

VISIT TO FBI HEADQUARTERS, JANUARY 11, 1965

In my memorandum of January 8th, it was pointed out that Reverend

Young wanted to come to Washington today together with Reverend Abernathy and see --

Mr. Hoover if possible. It was recommended and approved that the Director's regrets

be expressed and Leinbaugh and I saw these men at 2 p.m., today.

Both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy seemed to be highly

uncomfortable during the interview. Reverend Abernathy started out as the spokesman

liculate, carried most of the discussion.

Initially, Reverend Abernathy said that there were three points they

wished to discuss with the FBI and he said the first of these had to do with communist

infiltration into the civil rights movement. He said that they all realized that Reverend

King, as the leading civil rights spokesman, was subject to persecution. Ee mentione

the pamphlets which had been distributed showing a picture of King at a Highlander

Folk School meeting and he mentioned the constant problem of keeping communists out

of the civil rights movement. Reverend Abernathy said that Jack O'Dell had been

brought into Reverend King's organization but that O'Dell did have a bad background

and communist connections and that he had, therefore, been dismissed from the staff

of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). Reverend Abernathy said

that there had been statements made challenging Mr. King's loyalty but that the truth is

Reverend King has always attacked communism in his speeches, in his book, and that

their entire movement is "clean" in this respect.

1-1131.8÷00-758

Reverend Young then spoke up and mentioned that both O'Dell and

Levinson had been possible problems. and he said that in the past their organization

had tried to get assistance from the Department regarding the background of these

individuals but had been generally unsuccessful. Reverend Young said they had the

problem of evaluating such people and years hat could be done.

13 16: 22 1663

I pointed out that the answaties

Very simple, that the FBI can't give

out information and that our files are confidertial. He wanted to know wat the SCLC

-.

could do to protect itself or to get detailed information regarding individuals with

questionable background and he was informed that the House Committee on Un-

American Activities did have extensive records which were available to all citizens

and that this source could be of possible background assistance.

Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy said they hoped they could

come to the FBI privately and they were told that they should always feel free to come

to us at any time and they were reminded that Director Hoover had emphasized this

point when he had seen them with Reverend King in November. Reverend Young

-

made some comment about a press release. He was told that the FBI had no intention

o1 making a release concerning their visit.

Reverend Abernathy spoke very generally, pointing out that people

were always "making charges" and "innuendoes" against Mr. King. He said there

are claims that Dr. King is getting rich and he is using organizational funds-for

his personal use. Reverend Abernathy said the fact is Mr. King receives no salary

from the SCLC whatsoever. I took occasion here to point out that certainly matters

relating to the usage of funds within their organization were of no concern whatsoever

e); the FBI and that the FBI confined its activities strictly to its statutory limitations

I and toat we did not have time, let alone the authority to probe into other matters.

Reverend Young said it looked like there were some attempts to

smear and ruin the civil rights movement; that just lately there has been some new

evidence in this regard and that very obviously the activities of Mr. King and

the SCLC are under close surveillance. Young said that as a recent example, King

went to the home of Young's secretary while she was in the hospital so that he could

do some writing in private. Reverend Young said that shortly after King arrived in

the secretary's apartment he was tired, was taking pills that made him groggy and

went to sleep. Shortly afterwards he was awakened by a fireman who reported there

was a major fire at this address. King reported that after the fire trucks left, the

phone in the apartment began ringing but that no one would answer. Young said that

only he had known that King had gone to this apartment, but that he also had called

Reverend Abernathy and told him where King was and that as a result of this he was

certain someone had been tapping their phones.

Since Reverend Young had mentioned the possibility of surveillance,

he was asked if Reverend King believed he was being followed. Young said he had

no such information. He said he did feel though there must be some sort of con-

certed organized campaign that was being airected against King and the SCIC.

Young added that the SCLC takes for granted its phones are tapped and said he realized

e Government might have a legitimate interest in their official activities but

wondered about the governmental interest in people's private activities.

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

I very carefully pointed out that certainly the FBI was not interested

in any matter beyond the scope of our jurisdiction. I explained carefully the very

limited use made by the FBI of wire taps. I pointed out that wire taps were used

in certain major espionage cases, or in a kidnap case where a victim's life is at

stake, that there were very few such taps, and that each and every case required

the express authority of the Attorney General.

At this time both Reverend Young and Reverend Abernathy interrupted

to say that they, of course, knew better than to imply that the FBI would be involved.

Reverend Abernathy stated that there were three points they had

wanted to discuss; communist infiltration, allegations that King was getting rich

on the civil rights movement and the third point nad to do with allegations about

the personal life and moral character of King. Abernathy bogged down a bit at this

point and said that, "We all are human beings... We all make mistakes." I tried.

to bring out what he meant and asked why he was making such statements. Abernathy

said that he was not going to make allegations against the FBI but that some things

were gring on they just could not inderstand.

. .

Reverend Young said that King had been receiving some letters

charging him with immorality, that these letters attacked his personal life and he

pointed out rather lamely that "All humans make mistakes."

I told Reverend Abernathy and Reverend Young that a lot of people did

come to the FBI with rumors and stories and that as a matter of fact, we had heard

allegations reflecting on Dr. King's morality but that certainly we took no action on

such rumors. I emphasized that any prominent person or leader of a movement must

be most careful in his private life and that such a leader's reputation should be

above reproach. I also noted that these rumors regarding King were prevelant

outside the FBI.

Reverend Abernathy said there had been some problems in the past;

that when Reverend King goes to make a speech people always want to hold a little

party or reception for him and that there is alcohol at these parties. Abernathy

said as a Baptist minister King does not participate in drinking affairs but some-

times it is hard to avoid attending receptions where drinking does go on.

Reverend Young said that he was deeply concerned about irresponsible

usage of personal information on the part of scandalmongers and wondered if there

could be any "leaks" from the Government. He was assured that there were no leaks

fiom the f'Bl, that the Director ran a tight organization and that any irresponsibility

on the part of any Agent would not be tolerated. Young said he did not feel the F5I

was responsible and said that just the other day King had received a letter which

brought up the "female question," and added they have been getting 8 or 10 bad letters

i weeks

Re: Martin Luther King, JI.

Here again he was asked why he was telling us this and Young replied

that they were worried and concerned, that maybe they were overly concerned, but

that it seemed the campaign against King had been stepped up since he had received

the Nobel Prize. Young spoke about constant threats to ruin King and threats on

King's life. He was told that if any threats were made which would come within the

FBI's investigative authority, the full facts shoud be made available promptly so that

the matter could be thoroughly run out and investigated.

Reverend Abernathy brought up the fact again that all men make

| mistakes and blunders but that King had become the symbol of nonviolence and that

it would be tragic for both the North and South if King should be ruined and if some

demagogue like Malcolm & would move in and take over the civil rights movement. - ...

He said it would be tragic if Dr. King were destroyed. He was asked if there was

vulnerability on Dr. King's part or if he was being blackmailed. He said that every-

body has skeletons in their closets and he said that Di. King was really a moral

person, that he had a deep love for all of mankind--I refrained from commenting

here-dand that King was very moral and that in the last year Dr. King had been

especially careful to avoid ant actions which could be misconstrued by racists and

5 hers out to destroy King.

Reverend Young tried to get "down to brass tacks" but was unable

to do so. He spoke of the changing sex standards in the country, talked in general

terms about people being tempted and making bad judgments and spoke about the

spiritual nature of their movement and the fact that God uses "frail vessels" in

carrying out His precepts, knowing full well the weaknesses of men. I asked him,

as a minister of God, if he condoned sex degeneracy. He replied that people have

different standards and different ideas as to what the sex norm is.

I made a final attempt to pin down the precise nature of their problem

but neither man would come out with any specifics--only statements that "they" were

trying to ruin King and the civil rights movement and that this would be tragic for

the whole country. Both ministers said they knew and appreciated the fact that tine

FBI would not be a party to vilification of King and I said this was true, and that

while we naturally were aware of rumors concerning immorality on King's part;

we had no cause to look into such matters.

Reverend Abernathy said he wanted to be very frank and wanted to

raise a question as to whether some Agents might overstep their authority in the Souti

and might engage in actions which were not known to FBI Headquarters. I

emphasized this was absolutely impossible, that our Agents carried a very heavy

Base load, that we knew what our Agents were doing at all times and always knew

§their whereabouts.

Re: Martin Luther King, Jr.

Both visitors said, of course, they accepted and knew this to be

a fact. They mentioned one incident of a Georgia Bureau of Investigation man

checking on one of their meetings. They also mentioned the possibility that private

investigators may have been hired to probe their activities.

They said they had no other problems and I assured them that they

should always feel free to call on us if anything should occur within our investigative

authority. Both ministers agreed to do so and added they appreciated the

Lopportunity of stopping by.

Throughout the visit, both Young and Abernathy were ill at ease

and it was obvious that neither of them could bring themselves to discuss ans

ORSERVATIOUS:

Because of Olds' close association with Shriver, it would

not appear to be prudent to attenpi to deal with him.

It appERIS

fron our study that Senator Saltonstall is the most logical indi-

viduzl to deal with and that 1f he were personally approached by

Assistant Director Deloach and orally briefed, in the strictesi of

contidence, concerning King, he would be in a position to take the

recessary action to prevent king fxon receiving an honorary degree

fIon Springfield College.

RECOMMENDATION:

If approved, Deloach should personally orally briet

Senator Saltonstall in accordance with the attached "Top Secret"

summary indicating King's comnunist connections and degenerate

rake-up.. This is the same sunnary we previously used in the

Marquette University situation) It should be made clear to

Saltonstall that the information is being given hin in the stricte.

of confidence with the thought that he might desire to use it in

preventing King fron receiving an honorary degree fron Springfield

College and thus save that institution from embarrassuent beczuse

of King's connections and character.

It should be emphasized to

saltonstall that under no circumstances may this information.ever.

be attributed to the Bureau.

OBSBUNTION: Fron the above, it is apparent that King 15

in dire neea oi funds.

secondly, he dislikes going to

Hoffa because of Hoffa's unsavory reputation. King

undoubtedly feels that this association right reflect

unfavorably upon his public irage. On the other hanc,

It would appeai sofia might be concernca with the white

backlesh within his own union ranks should it becone

known that union funds may be expended to pronote Negro

objcctives.

It is therefore felt that both men have

just reason for keeping this meeting secret. Any

publicity concerning it rould probably be extremely

carrassing to both parties.

It would appear that the meeting may be virtually

spontaneous and time in this instance could be very critical.

RICO:MENDATIO%: A Bureau official be designated nor to

He told King that

Instance appears timely, in that it points out lioffa's

King to virtually enzage in extortion to obtain needed

It was previously recommended and approved that Crime

Records alert friendly news media regarding a proposed meeting between

King and Hofia 1/9/63.

:

Through a reliable source we learned late last night

that in view of publicity in the New York Daily News regarding this

unwise to meet with Hofa. It was further ascertained that King was

still que to arrive in Washington at 11:30 Aiv this morning, it being noted

that he had a speech scheduled at Howard University this evening.

We alerted Julian Morrison, a very friendly reporter with

the Washington News, and Sid Epstein of The Star regarding King's

arrival time in Washingion. The reporters cornered King as he came

off the plane and quizzed him about the meeting with Hoffa. King at

•first told the reporters that the meeting had been cancelled and he seemed

s to be flustered at the reporters' appearance. He then duckea into a

i mens' room at the airport with his aides and upon emerging told

the reporters that there had been discussion regarding his meeting Holfa

but that he had no further comment at this time, and he had decided to

hold a press conference later on this afternoon at the Statler Hotel.

King then left the airport with Clarence Jones who had come down earlier

from New Yorl:, and with an attorney with Jones by the name of Philip

Sipser, who identified himself as a labor lawyer.

Morrison advised at 3:15 PM this afternoon that he had

finally gotten through to King's party at the Statler and had talked to

King's aide Reverend Andrew Young. Young at this time informed Morrison

that the meeting between King and Holla was oil and he clumed that the

marting had been cancelled last night.

Re: liartin Luther King, Jr.

Security Matter - C

Proposed Meeting with James P.. Hoffa 11/9/65

Morrison pressed him for details and Young said that the

I proposed purpose of this meeting had been "misinterpreted." He said

King had wanted to have an ofi-the-record discussion with Holla regarding

the problems of the Negroes in the Teamsters and Young claimed that

King's outfit had worked closely with the Teamsters in Atlanta and

Chicago and they felt it was time for them to meet the Teamster head.

Young said it was difficult for King to have a private conversation with

anyone in view of his prominence and reiterated that the whole matter

had been "misinterpreted and distorted." Reporter Morrison continued

to press Young and Young finally acknowledged that King might try to

have a meeting with Hofia at some other time.

Morrison advises that The News will carry a picture tomorrow

of jing arriving in iown, iogeiner wiin ie iniormation sei vui above.

The Star is also going to report this meeting.

It is felt that our counterintelligence aim to thwart King

in receiving monej from the Teamsters has been quite successful to date.

entirely on public source information and we are recom

I'mending that it be referred to the Crime Records Division

with the idea that it can be given to a friendly newspaper

contact such as David Lawrence, who is Editor of the U. S

News and fiorld Report.:

The article was prepared because the cry

of "black power" is a nost timely issue in the country today.

This issue has split the civil rights movenent and has caused

civil rights leaders to take sides for and against-"black

power."

However, dartin Luther king has been attempting

to straddle the issue, based on advice given him by his

advisors with communist backgrounds. The attached article

indicts King for his failure to take a stand on the issue

and. at the same time exposes the degree of comnunist influence

on him

.

It is felt the public should again be .

reminded of this communist influence on King, and the

current controversy among civil rights leaders makes this

timely to do so.

The attached article has been prepared with

no letterhead relating it to the FBI and is on unwatermarked

bond paper.

President, Ford Foundation, had contacted dartin Luther King

olicring a grunt of s3, 000,000 to the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference (SCLC). "I. Bugas was grateful for the irformation I..

furnished hin yesterday. He expressed alarm and indicated that,.

arilouni die ford stor lougang had little contrel coer the Ferd

Foundation, he nevertheless would amneciately siieni iu bei

touch with

Bundy and do something about this matter.

HI. Bugas called me back at 11:30 this morning. He stated

he had contacted Bundy and had asked hin for an appointment within

the next sevoral days. Bundy aslied why he wanted to see hin..

Bugas replied he was in receipt of information concerning the l s

fact that the ford Founiation wanted to have dealings with the

SCLC.

Bundy aslied for tie source of his infornation.

Bugas told

hin his source did not want to be divulged. Bundy stated under

the circunstances he would refuse to talk to lugas and wouid

discuss the matter only with the source. Bundy then asked if

the source was the FBI. Bugas refused to reveal the source and

the conversation was terminated.

Bugas stated he thought Bundy had been rather high-handed

lan the conversation; horever, he wanted to request that the

Director give serious consideration to an FBI representative

contacting Bundy, inasruch as this matter represents one of

great inportance

to the ford dotor Company.

I company had had quite a number of "hard blors" from the ford

Foundation over the years and nost certainly a liaison between

I told Bugas that, In view of Bundy's attitude, it appeared

rather doubtful concerning the advisability of our going furthe:

in this natter. Sugas stated he realized this; however, he waszec

to express again the inportance of this natter to the Ford ¿oto-

Сомрапу.

He stated he did not know Bundy; however, Bundy had

apparently been rather snobbish in dealing wish tie Ford people.

He explained that when bundy first took this job, Bundy had beez

invited to Detroit to meet Henry Ford III and the top peopie of

the cospany. At that time Burdy was point-blank advised that he

11 should be careiul in adainistering the ford councation, anasaue:

as this Foundation had caused serious harm to the sales of the so=s

motor conrasy, Bundy allegedly stuck his nose in

the air and

istated "I have a social responsibility to fulfill."

HI. Bugas once again stated that any liaison between the

Ford Foundation and bartin luther King would "set his company bacis

t= b==t bell."

Be sevod darin that de consides contartine Bunty

directly and stated he would appreciate knowing of any action

taken in this regard.

ACTION:

I personally feel that Burdy 1s of the psuedo-intellectual:

Ivy' League group that has little respect for the FBI. He was

friendly on the surface while at the white House and I met hin

that, while we appreciate his concern, there is sume doubt that

contact by us with Bundy would amount

suggested to him that he might desire to bring this matter to

dI. ¡enry Ford's attention, in the event lit. Ford desires to aies?:

to exercise any control over Bundy. Mi. Bugas, during our

conversation, noted that sir. Ford was out of the country at the

present time.

The "Fashington Post and Times Herald" contained a small

article in today's edition stating that kartin Luther King, dr.,

had

aunounced through his oftice in atlanta that he had been grantec

audience with Pope Paul VI to take place on Friday, 9-18-64, at

which time he hopes to discuss the racial situation in the United

States with the Pope.

You will recall that several weeks ago, when we first

learned of King's intention to travel abroad, we anticipated the !

possibility of King's asking for an audience

with the Pope 'and

arranged to have Assistant Director Malone of the New York Office

contact Francis Cardinal Spellman to see if appropriate action could

not be taken to prevent such an audience.

Malone did brief Cardinal

Spellman in the matter and told us the Cardinal had in fact called the

Vatican immediately after being contacted by lalone.

Malone was contacted telephonically today to see if he

could shed any further light on the report that King was to have an

audience with the Pope. He contacted Cardinal Spellman's office and

was told that the Cardinal, who presently is recuperating from an

operation, had spoken personally several weeks ago by telephone to

the Secretary of State at the Vatican and had strongly recommended

that no audience be granted King because of very serious but highly

confidential information which had come to his attention but which he

could not discuss in detail over the telephone.

Malone was asked to determine if there possibly could have

peen a slip-up so that the pope did not actually receive Cardinal

Spellman's warning.

He was advised by Cardinal Spellman's office

that with the information being furnished to the Secretary of State

at the Vatican It would be mandatory for the Secretary of State to

furnish the information directly to the Pope and that there was every

assurance the Pope had received the information. Cardinal Spellnan's

office advised lalone today that it is possible that arrangements for

such an audience had already been made and could not be

Levison also told his associate that Rockefeller

yas disturbed

about fartin Luther King's position on Vietnam

and wanted to meet King to discuss it.

Levison told his

contact this pleased him because it would give King

g the

opportunity to present to Rockefeller King's views on Latín

next Vietnam.

According to Levison, King wanted to use the

opportunity to advise Rockefeller on the steps that should

and to John Howard Griffin, a writer. The award is in memory

of Pope John.

• You will recall that in August, 1964, we recommended,

and the Director approved, that Francis Cardinal Spellman be

orally briefed concerning King's communist connections and

moral degeneracy so that such information could be passed on

to the Pope as it was anticipated that King would seek an

audience with the Pope.

Such briefing of the Cardinal subsequentl:

was made by Assistant Director Malone in New York City.

It Is shocking Indeed that King continues to be

honored by religious groups.

Inasmuch as commitments have

apparently been made by the CIC for the award in Davenport,

there 1s little likelihood that anything can be done in this

Instance to prevent such an award. It is believed, however,

that it would be desirable to have Assistant Director Halone

recontact Cardinal Spellman and bring to his attention the

information we continue to receive about King being given

honors by Catholic groups, citing the Davenport CIC award

as

a current Instance.

It could be tactfully suggested that in

the end it might well be embarrassing to the Catholic Church

having given honors to King.

A discussion with the Cardinal

might well suggest to him the desirability for the Cardinal

to initiate such action as he deems appropriate, through church

circles, to alert Catholic institutions and organizations concernii

It would appear that the Cardinal would certainly be

apreciative for the information we are him.

the leading figure

In the civil rights novenent In this country today. He is of

vital interest to us because of the communist iniluences upon

nim. His actions and expressions (both private and public) are

of Importance in several different areas of the Bureau's

operations such.as relating to the communist influences in

racial matters, racial matters generally, civil rights matters,

and the like.

Because of King's position, we must be, in many

respects, extremely guarded in our efforts to gain information

concerning King's activities.

King frequently travels about

the country and speaks to public gatherings.

He often times

discusses the luture plans of himself and his organization, the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference. It is well, therefore,

to avail ourselves of the coverage which may be given King

through a revier of news media, sources and through contact with

established reliable sources.

We recently received information divulging à series

of King's appointments for the period 1/20/65 through 6/19/65.

These Include many public gatherings such as at universities and

colleges, churches, and the like. We are, therefore, recommending

a letter to the appropriate offices instructing that

they report

Information available from news media and established sources

concerning King's appearances in their respective territories.

By receiving letterhead memoranda with such information, we

are also able to make prompt aissemination to such interested

other agencies as the Department and the military Intelligence.

Attached for approval is a letter to the appropriate

This morning Mr. Ralph McGill, publisher of the "Atlanta

Constitution,

" Atlanta, Georgia, and a long-time adnirer of the Director;

dropped by the office to discuss with me Martin Luther King,

But neto

. Matill some

concer

intermin

caled told me that on being aavised of the tacts concerning king,

he has renained completely silent.

As a result, he is being questioned

by associates in Atlanta, Georgia, as to why he is not speaking out in

favor of King and why he is not taking an active part in the banquet

to be given King next Wednesday night. McGill:said that he would never

disclose a confidence and, therefore,

his only reply is that he no

"onger is an admirer of Martin Luther King.

Further, he has talked

ith some other men who have told him of their knowledge of King's

morality and their concern about it.

In view of this, he is free

can be attributed to the men with whom he has spoken.

McGil] said that these men are Adlai/ Stevenson, Ralph Bunche,

and Harry! Ashnore of the "Arkansas Gazette."

He told me that Adlai

advised him without being questioned about king that he is

aware of king's immoral activities.

Stevenson told McGill that he

considers King to be a "very dangerous man" to the civil rights movement

and that something should be done about it. Ralph Bunche told McGill

that he has never been an admirer of King's although he thinks King

has done some good things; that a few months ago he began hearing very

disturbing stories about King's Imnoral behavior. Bunche believes

King should be maneuvered

out of the civil rights field or else he

will do it serious damage.

Mr. Ashmore, likewise, informed McGill that

he had heard some time ago about King's incredibly imnoral activities.

Ashnore is very disturbed over it and wishes something could be done

Ibut he has no specific course to recommend.

100-106670-781

hir. McGill told me that following my first discussion with him

a few weeks ago he contacted a banker friend in Atlanta who was helping

to finance the banquet to be given King next Hednesday night.

The

banker was disturbed and said he would contact some other bankers also

involved and see if support could be quietly withdrawn. McGill's

friend and some of the bankers did take steps to withdraw but this was

very quickly relayed to bankers in Haiti who were on the threshold

of an Important financial deal with the Atlanta, Georgia, bankers.

They took the position that if the Atlanta bankers did not support the

Martin luther king party, their linancial deal with these Georgia

bankers was off. as lcGill said to me, the almighty dollar is still

extremely important and especially so with bankers, and as a result they

got cold feet and decided to go ahead with linancing King's party.

ücGill told me that Archbishop

Hallinan, Catholic leader in

He said that he is certain that not

one of these three is avare of King's immoral behavior. I told him

that in view of what Stevenson, Bunche, and Ashmore had told him, he

might want to explore very confidentially and discreetly the subject

matter with these three men. He said he would do this.

coill told me that he thinks it is too late now, especially in

lew of the financial interest of the Georgia bankers in the Haiti deal,

o prevent the banquet from taking place.

However, HicGill said he

could do what he could to encourage key people to limit their praise

and support of King as much as possible.

AcGill also told me that he is taking steps through RalphBunche

to get key Negro leaders to unite in opposition to king and to gradually

force hin out of the civil rights novement if at all possible.

It. licGill said that he would like to have President Johnson know

three things-- (1) that from diverse sources he has learned of the

incredibly innoral behavior of DI. Martin Luther King, dro, and his

deceiving of sincere, good people in this Nation who have been supportin:

King;@)that he regrets greatly that the banquet is being given in King's

honor next week in Atlanta but that it has gone so far that it is

probably not possible to head it off; and (3) that he believes that the

very best thing that could happen rould be to have king step completely

out of the civil rights movement and public life for he feels that if

licGill and others are so interested and have worked so hard for.

likewise, it will do injury to different citizens of the country who

have been

supporting King not knowing that he is of such low moral

character.

Memorandum to bir. Belmont

RE: MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

hir. McGill said that 11 he had had time to see President

three things, but that he wanted the Director to know that he is

free to quote him on these three points to the President and free

to put all three things in any communication that goes to the

White House Iron the bureau.

It Is very relreshing to meet & man of AcGilI's stature in

the field of journalism who is so sincere and honest and desirous

of doing the right thing. He is a very admirable man.

Repeatedly,

hir. McGill told me that he will continue to stay with

this problem

McGill told me in a visibly disturbed manner that this problem

centering around King has caused him to wake up at night from time

to time and he is very upset over it. licGill explained

that while

he has never been close to King or an active supporter thereor, he

nas been completely identified and very active in furthering civil

rights and better conditions for the Negroes.

He thinks that King's

¡behavior no known to him when publicly exposed will do irreparable

damage to such social causes that he and others have been

sponsoring

throughout a lifetime.

RECONLENDATION:

Enclosed will be found a letter to the White House setting

forth McGill's discussion for approval and forwarding. Inasmuch as

licGill mentioned only the President's getting this information, we

do not contemplate any further dissemination.

Reverend Abernathy expressed the appreciation of the Negro race for the Directoz's

He stated that the Negroes had problems,

Reverend King stated he personally appreciated the great work of the FE

which had Irin done in so many instances. He stated this was particularly true in

Mississippi. He added that FBI developments in that State have been very significant.

The FBI is is great restraining influence. Reverend King denied that he had ever statei

that Negrow should not report information to the FBI. He said he had actually encoura

such reporliig in many instances. He claimed there were good relationships in many

communiticis, especially Atlanta, Georgia, between Negrots and the FBI. He stated he

would continue to strongly urge all of his people to work closely with the FBL

Reverend King stated he has never made any personal attack upon

MI. Hoover. He stated he had merely tried to articulate the feelings of the Negroes in

the Soirch in order to keep a tradition of nonviolence rather than violence. He added tha

the Negro should never be transferred from a policy of nonviolence to one of violence ai

terror.

Reverend King said that the Director's report to the President this sumir

on rioting wits a very excellent analysis.

Reverend King advised that Negroes are currently laboring under a very

austrating slluation. He stated that, "We sometimes are on the verge of temporary

"pair. " In added that it was a challenge and a duty for him to keep the Negro from

coming to a liling point. He stated that sometimes the cries coming from the Negro

represent a real feeling of lonesomeness and despair. He, however, has pointed cut thi

the path to success is nonviolence rather than violence.

Reverend King stated he has been, and still is, very concerned regarding

the matter of communism in the civil rights movement. He stated he knew that the

Director was very concerned because he bore the responsibility of security in the Natio:

Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p.m., 12-1-64

The Director told King and his associates that the FBI shares the same

espair which the Negroes suffer when Negro leaders refused to accept the deep

esponsibility they have in the civil rights movement. He stated that when Negroes are

ncouraged not to cooperate with the FBI this sometimes frustrates or delays successful

olution of investigations. The Director told King that he had personally gone to

Kississippi to meet with Governor Paul Johnson inasmuch as there had been practically

lo Liaison between the Department of Justice, the President and the State of Mississippi

reforehand. The Director stated that upon meeting Governor Johnson the Governor

xplained honestly that he was a segregationist, however, abhorred violence. The

Director stated that he had told Governor Johnson they had a common meeting ground

nasmuch as he was in Mississippi to put an end to violence and hrutality. The Director

old Governor Johnson that he would like to do this in collaboration with the State Police,

lowever, if the FBI could not receive such cooperation we would do it on our own. The

Director then made reference to watermoccasins, rattlesnakes and redneck sheriffs, in

hat order, who still exist in Mississippi who represent the trashy type of characters wh:

re promoting civil rights riolations.

The Director told King thrt we had trained twenty

representatives of the Mississippi State Highway Patrol and that this had represented a

cood move to promote better cooperation and solution of civil rights cases.

The Director told Reverend King that the FPI had put the "fear of God" in

he Ku Klux Klan (KKK). He told King that'we knew of the identity of the murderers of

he three civil rights workers and that these murderers cald soon he brought to trial.

Che Director then spoke of the terror in Mississippi baciaoods and of the fact that

sheriffs and deputy sheriffs participate in crimes of violence. He summarized by ielling

Sing that we, therefore, are under the same strain that sincere Negro leaders are under

Che. Director added that the KKK constartly damns the FEl and thit we have currently

seen classified as the "Federal Bureau of Integration" in Mississippi.

The Director told King that many cases, which have been brought about as

L result of FBI investigation, must be tried in State Court. He spoke of the difficulty in

sbtaining a verdict of guilty in instances in which white juries are impaneled in cases

involving white men. The Director spoke of the KIK involvement in the Lemuel Penn ca

just outside of Athens, Georgia, He stated this was an outrageous miscarriage of justic

in that the defendants, despite the open and shut erience on the part of the FBI, had been

acquitted.

The Director made it clear to Reverend King and his associates that the

FBI could not state whether a conviction wold be obtained or not in the case involving th

murdered three civil rights victims. He stated, however, that the FBI has excellent

evidence in this case. The Director then explained that it was most necessary for the

FRi not to "jump the gun" unless we had sufficient evidence in which a case coud be

ght to trial.

Martin Luther King, Appointment With Director, 3:35 p. I. p

The Director made reference to Reverend King's allegation that the FBI

leals or associates with law enforcement officers who have been invol;ed in civil rights

iolations. He stated emphatically that, "I'll be damned if the FBI has associated with

ny of these people nor will we be associated with them in the future." The Director

splained that the FBI, not only because of the very nature of the law but also because of

he background of our investigative employees, was in full sympathy with the sincere

spects of the civil rights movement. He stated that the FBI constantly needs cooperatic

und assistance in order to solve cases. He added that he made it a point, several years

go, to transfer northern Special Agents to southern offices. He stated that, for the mo:

art, northern-born Agents are assigned civil rights cases in the South. The Director

laded that he feels that our Special Agents, regardiess of where they are born, will

nvestigate a case impartially and thoroughly. He mentioned, however, that it was unfai

o the Agent and the FBI to "have a strike against him" in that critcism had been leveied

over the fact that southern Agents would not give Negroes a "fair shake." The Director

stated that such criticism was entirely unjustifiable and that no case had ever been brou

o our attention proving such a fact.

The Director made reference to the recent case in McComb, Mississippi,

n which nine men had been charged with burning churches and violence against Negroes.

stated this again was a miscarriage of justice. He added that the judge's decision in

-casing the deiendants because they had learned their lesson and were merely youths

was entirely wrong and that it caused some people to question where youth really began.

Je explained that some of the defendants had been in their 40's. The Director added tha

I deal probably, of course, had been made, however, this would certainly not represent

any deterrent to future actions of violence by these men.

The Director explained that there is a great misunderstanding today amo..

he general public and particularly the Negro race as to what the FBI can and cannot do

in the way of investigations. The Director emphasized that the FBI cannot recommend

prosecution or declination of prosecution. He stated that Agents cannot make "on the sy

arrests. He stated that the FBI merely investigates and then the Department of Justice

jetermines whether prosecution be entertained or not. The Director added that the

question is sometimes raised why prosecution is not scheduled sooner. He statea this,

of course, was not the respunsibility of the FBI in any way whatsoever. He pointed out

hat our civil rights investigations are conducted in a very thorough and expectious

manner once the Department has authorized such investigations.

The Director spoke of the FBI's successful penetration of the KKK. He

stated that the FBI has interviewed all members of the KKK in Mississippi and has

served notice to these members that if trouble occurs we plan to come to them first. a

stated our penetration of the KISK has been as successful as the manner in which we

#!trated the communists and the Soviet espionage services. He stated that our progre

in infiltrating the KKK has been so rapid that Klan members now suspect each other anc

are fighting among themselves. The Director mentioned that we have two confessions i

third he da the ges civil rights workers. He added that the Klan in Mississippi has.

as to the identity of FBI informants in their midst. The Director stated he had personal

been an enemy of the KKK for a long time.

He spoke of the FBI's case in Louisiana in the late 1920's in which FBI

evidence suocessfully culminated in the conviction of the top Klan leader. He stated the

KKK fully concentrated on Negroes, Jews and Catholics, however, concentration now

is strictly on the Negro race..

The Director told the group that in the Lemuel Penn case the defendants

have recently been indicted and are to stand trial in Federal Court. He stated the trial

would begin sometime next week. He mentioned that the same defendants were

responsible for beating Negroes and participation in other acts of violerce. The Directo

added that the FBI's success in infiltrating the KKK has been so extensive that we now

sometimes know in advance what the KKK plans to do and take pretentive measures

accordingly.

The Director explained that in Alabama the FBI cannot deal with the

Highway Patrol because of the psychoneurotic tendencies of the Alabama Governor®

He

stated that the State of Georgia has a good Governor and that the Georgia Bureau of

astigation, while not comparable to the Mississippi Highway Patrol, has cooperated

a the FBL.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that FBI

representatives have held several thousand law enforcement conferences in which

southern police officers have been educated as to civil rights legislation. He siated this

ras clearly assisted law enforcement, particularly the FBI, however, acinittedly, this

represents slow progress, but progress nevertheless. He added that this ecucational

campaign will be continued and that it will eventually take hold. The Direcior gave the

example of a Mississippi Sheriff who recently brobe a case as a result of FBI Erzining.

The Director made it very clear to Reverend King and his associates that

FBI Agents conduct very thorough interviews in civil rights cases. He stated he would

ike to know immediately if any of our Special Agents ever act in a supercilious manner

or if they mishandle a compaint regarding civil rights. He stated that if the facts

reflect that our Agent is in the wrong he will be called on the carpet fast. The Direcior®

asked that Reverend King or any of his representatives feel free to call the FBI at any

ime they have such complaints.

The Director told Reverend King he desired to give him some advice. He

stated that one of the greatest things the Negro leaders could accomplish would be to

encourage voting registration among their people. Another thing would be to educate tie

Sale in the skills so that they could compete in the open market. The Director

nuntioned several professions in which Negroes could easily learn skills. The Director

so told King he wanted him to know that registrars in the South were now more careful

registering inasmuch as the FBI is watching such actions very carefully. The Director

told Reverend King that the FBI was maling progress in violations regarding

discrimination in eating places. He gave as a specific example a restaurant in Atlanta,

Georgia, in which surveillances have taken place to ascertain if out-of-state cars are

being served at this particular resaurant. The Director stated he personally was in

favor of equality in eating places and in schools. He stated emphatically, however, he

was not in favor of takirg Negro children 10 or 12 miles across town simply because

their parents wanted them to go to a school other than those in their specific

neighborhood. -

The Director told Reverend Fing thut in due time there will be a complet

Change in the mores of community thinking in the United States regarding the racial

problem. He stated that meanwhile the Fil will continue to handle its responsibilities

in a thorough and impartial manner. He reitzrite: that the FBI cannot encourage

prosecution in Federal Court despite the inc: list sorelocal courtcannot be trusted. He

added that some judges cannot be trusted.

8.

The Director praised the Erorgia pipers that declared the verdict of the

Penn case to be a travesty di justice. He adicá wat the Jackson, Mississippi, paper

a? contained several editorials deploring volene: rgainst Negroes and participation in

JIch burnings. The same editorials ductured ties was no way to solve racial

problems. The Director stated that his sirements made at a press conference in

Jackson, Mississippi, this summer to ist siect int he was in Mississippi to see to it

that an end was put to the violence of bombings and burning churches had had some affec

upon backwoods terrorists.

The Director told King that te wanted to make it very clear that the

question is often raised as to whether the FDI fil protect civil rights workers or Negr

He stated that he has in the past and will continue to answer such questions on the basis

that the FBI does not have the authority not the jazisdiction to protect anyone. He state

that when the Department of Justice desires that Regroes be protected this is the

responsibility of U. S. Marshals. The Director reiterated that the FBI is strictly an

investigative agency and cannot and will not estend itself beyond legislated jurisdiction.

The Director repeated very emphatically tiat while our investigations are very definitei

thorough and impartial he wanted to state once agnin that if Reverend King or any of his

associates ever knew of a Special Agent showing bias or prejudice he wanted to know

about this matter immediately.

The Director explained thet ie have civil rights cases not only in the

South but also in the northern cities. He gave examples of New York and Chicago. He

stated that there have been some cases in Miami, Florida.

Martin Luther King, Appointment with Director, 3:35 p.M., 12-1-64

The Director spoke once again of the necessity of the Negro educating

imself in order to compete in manual and professional skills. He mentioned the

sample of a shoeshine boy in Miami, Florida, who turned out to be, after questioning

y the Director, a gradiate of Howard University. This Shoeshine boy, a Negro,

splained to the Director that he could not get a job above the level of shoeshine boy

ecause of the color of his skin. The Director stated this, of course, was wrong and

at under no circumstances did he, -or anyone in the FBI, share the opinion that the

egro, or any other race, should be kept down. The Director spoke of his pride in •

egro Agents and particularly mentioned Special Agent Aubrey Lewis, the former

otre Dame track star who is currently assigned to the New York Division,

The Director spoke of a Miami Special Agent who was transferred to that

fice from St. Louis. This Agent explained to the Director on one occasion that he was

rst a little upset about being transferred to Miami because he felt that his race would -

against him. He stated, however, much to his surprise, that the white people in

iami treated him with the greatest of courtesy while people of his own race referred to

m as a "fink" simply because he was a representative of law enforcement.

Reverend King interrupted the Director at this point and asked if this same

egro Agent is still assigned to the Miami Division. The Director replied in the

native. The Director stated that at a recent dinner Father Hesburgh, the President

sutre Dame University, explained to the Director that his institution had difficalty

itting Negroes on the football team because their grades were never high enough. The

irector told Reverend King the same thing is true of Negroes who apply for the position

Special Agent. He stated in most instances they lack the qualifications, however, we

ere very happy to hire any Negro who was qualified for the position. The Director lid

iverend king that we, of course, could not let down our qualifications simply because

the color of a person's skin.

The Director told Reverend King and his associates that the problems that

and the Negro leaders have is a mutual problem. He stated in most instances in civil

ghts matters we have learned that "you are damned if you do and you are damned if you

n't." The Director stated nevertheless the FBI would continue to do its job. He stated

at we additionally are very proud of 10 or 11 Indian Special Agents and of a number of

ecial Agents who have Mexican blood in them. He stated that the color of a man's skin.

akes no difference to the FBI whatsoever, however, we do merit the cooperation and

sistance of all groups and it is most unfair when these groups are taught not to

operate with the FilL.

The Director mentioned that he wanted to make it very plain that the FBI

I not tolerate any of our personnel being slapped around. He gave an example of the

imbardozzi case in New York where one of our agents was jumped by five hocdiums

bie a church. He stated these hoodlums were immediately taught a lesson. The

rector mentioned that in the war with hoodlums, for every man we lose we make

rtain, through legal means of course, that the hoodlums lose the same number or more

The Director proudly spoke of the ability of Agents to outshoot and

utfight hoodlums and other individuals who attempted to take advantage of our personnel

le stated the KKK is afraid to "mis" with our Agents. He mentioned that the Klan was

'yellow. " He stated they are brave as long as they have the majority with them but

fraid when they face an equal number.,

The Director spoke of the Mack Charles Parker case in Poplarville,

Mississippi. He stated that our evidence in this case had been turned over to Governor

Coleman, the then Governor of that State. He mentioned that Governor Coleman was a

lecent type of individual who had immediately seen to it that a State Court received the

vidence contributed by the FBL The Director mentioned that our evidence in this case

as excellent, however, the Grand Jury refused to indict the subjects involved in the

ynching of Parker.

--.-

The Director told Reverend King that in many instances our Agents have

een spit upon, they have been refused food and lodging and many things are done to

hwart hard-hitting investigations by the FBI. He stated that nevertheless we continue

• gather

evidence in an expeditious and thorough manner.

Reverend Abernathy stated that the Negroes have a real problem in

ing down the current system of segregated voting tests in the South. He stated it was

just important that there be kept alive in the Negro communities a ray of hope. He

tated that the Negro people should not be allowed to fall into an atmosphere of despair.

The Director explained that this was a very important point. He stated

hat real progress has been made in higher wages, voting registration and housing

matters. The Director pointed out, however, that such progress has not been

mphasized by the rabblerousers who constantly attempt to stir up the Negroes against

he whites. The Director gave as an example the communist, Epton in New York City.

'he Director stated that Epton is sometimes pointed to as a person the Negro should

mulate because of his militancy. The Director stated this was wrong and it is also

rong to "mislead" Negroes. .

Reverend Abcrnathy stated that the SCLC does not want Negroes like

ipton in their movement. He stated that Reverend King, more than anyone else, has

revented people like Epton and the Muslims from taking over the civil rights movement

'everend Abernathy stated that actually the Negroes are a part of the Federal

overnment, therefore, anything that represents the Federal Government is an

ncouragement to the Negro. He added that even the side of a post office building or a

ederal courtroom is an encouragement to the Negro. He mentioned that when a Negro

eceives information that a case in which he has been brutally mistreated is going to

ederal Court he feels encouraged over the fact that he will get a fair trial. Reverend

nathy continued that the same problem is true when a Negro sees an FBI Agent. He

tated that the Negro feels open encouragement inasmuch as the FBI will not only fairly

The Director stated that the KKK today is represented by common white

trash. He stated that the Klan was actually worse than the Communist Party inasmuch

25 the Klan resorts to violence while the communists usually emulate termites in their

activities.

.

The Director reiterated that King and his associates should feel free to

call him at any time when they have knowledge of possible civil rights violations. King

replied that over the past few years he has noted amazing signs of progress in the civil

rights field. He stated he has been very surprised to see some communities comply

with the new civi rights statutes. He stated there still are some pockets of resistence

particularly in the South. He raded that the SCLC is planning to stimulate voting

registration activities in Selm, Alabama, in the near future. He mentioned that some

members of his organization have been successful in infiltrating this white community

and have learned there is a great potential for violence, in Selma. - ..-

The Director interrupted King and briefly detailed five cases in which the

FBI has gathered evidence in Salma, Alabama. The Director identified these cases

tuly, and specitically the case agains: Sheriti James Clark. The Director mentioned

that these cases came about as a resul of Fel investigation and that we were continuing

our intestigations in Selma, iJocame. He mentioned that one case would come to trial

C Jecember 9, 1964. The Director particularly made reference to the fact that we hav

three excellent cases in Selms zi the present time.

Reverend King inquired as to whether his representatives should notify

the FBI when they arrive in Scima, Alabama. He quickly corrected himself that he baler

his representatives shoula contact the 7.3I upon arrival, however, he asked the Directoi

what would be the possibilities oi f5s agents being in Selma, Alabama, inasmuch as

there appeared to be a potentil for vicierce. The Director specifically asked Reverend

King when his activities would take place. Reverend Abernathy indicated such activity

would take place around Januasy 1, 1305. The Director clearly explained that FBI

Agents would be in Selma, not for the purpose of "protecting" anyone, but for the

purpose of observing and reporting to the Department of Justice any possible violations

of civil rights that might occur. Reverend King expressed appreciation in this regard.

Reverend King stood up and stated he wished to express his personal

thanks for a most fruitful and necessary meeting. The Director told Reverend King thai

he should get in touch with us at anytime he felt it was necessary.

Reverend King mentined that there were representatives of the press in

the Director's reception root.. He turned to me and asked if the FBI planned to mare

any comment regarding the mesting. I told him that the Director had instructed thai we

make no comment whatsoever. Reverend King asked the Director if there would be any

doctions if he read a short prepared statement to the press. The Director told

Reverend King this, of course, was up to him.

In proceeding to the reception rcom, Reverend King pulled out a press

elease, haid-written in ink, out of his right coat pocket. This press release obviously

ad been prepared prior-to the time Reverend King arrived at FBI Headquarters. A

revious memorandum has been sent through reporting verbatim the comments by King

1 the Director's reception room.

;CTION:

It is suggested that the attached letter be sent to the President concerning

se meeting between the Director, Reverend King and his associates.

The General Investigative Division, Civil Rights Section, should take

ue note of the proposed activities in Selma, Alabama, and should instruct the

ppropriate office to make certain that Agents are on hand to observe activities in Selma

If an additional controversy arises with King. I see no necessity, however, in this

work being done at the present time inasmuch as the controversy has quieted down

considerably and we are not in need of transcriptions right now. In view of the

I would recommend that we hold off doing this tremendous amount of work until there

BAPTIST WORLD ALLIANCE CONGRESS

IN JUNE, 1965, MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA Space PRADeE

You will recall that shortly after the Directors interview with the

women reporters, Dr. Robert S./ Denny, Associate General Secretary of the

Baptist World Alliance (EV/A) and a personal friend of SA C. Benjamin Fuiton,

¿contacted Fulton concerning King. Dr. Denny pointed out that the Program

Committee of BIA had been encouraged by some members to invite King to

speal, at the 1965 Congress in June next year at Mimi Beach. About one half of

the Program Committee members biected, pointing out that it was their feeling

if Director Hoover had publicly identified King as a "notorious liar, " there most

certainly must be even worse derogaiory information concerning him which woule?

make his appearance on the program questionable. You instructed SA Fulton to

furnish Dr. Denny the general facts relating to King's

this basis and without revealing the details and source, Di. Denny was aüie to

get the King matter tabled at that time.

On 12-7-64, DI. Denny again contacted Fulton and advised that

the matter has been brought up again.

He pointed out that while he objects to

having King on the program and has made his position known, unless he is able

to share the information with at least Dr. Joseffsordenhaug, the General Secreiar

of BlA, and perhaps one other program official, either Dr. Theodore F. Adanis,

Program Committee Chairman and minister of the First Baptist Church of

Richmond, Virginia, or perhaps Dr. E. H. Pruden, minister of the First Sapist

Church of Washington, -D. C., and a prominent leader in the American Baptist

Convention, it is unlikely that he can keep the Program Committee frora extenden;

King an invitation.. He would like for us to make the general facts relating to

King's moral degeneracy, similar to what we told him, known to Dr. Nordenhaus

and either Dr. Adams or Dr. Pruden, whichever is available. Dr. Denny aávise.

BACKGROUND: King has been on a two-nonth vacation in Jamaica:

waiting a new book.

During this time he has been attempting

Di

to determine what direction be should take in regarag to

jaational issues.

Ris inclination 1s to direct his entire

elforts 1p opposicion to the sar in Vietnan.

During the past

‚tao weeks, he has started making public appearances again.

In California on 2/25/67 he attacked the war in Vietnan and

suggested cuitting Vietnam, according to an article in "The

New York Times." At one point he made a statement that

night be considered revolutionary. He stated in part,

"we

have got to get out and denonstrate and protest until

1t

rocks the very foundations of this Nation."

Also, while King was out of the country, the voter

registration drive in Chicago failed miserably.

He is very

sensitive about this failure and feels it hurt

his public

Image. He is also sensitive about allegations his persosal

apperl to the ghetto. Negro is waning.

Another thator that is inlluencing his decision

to question King concerning his sen book.

During the

intervien the above-interrelated activities could be

developed, particularly to bring out the political.

reorientation of King's najor efforts in relation to

United States foreign policy as contrasted to the position

taken by other civil rights lezders who have continued to

direct their efforts at civil rights.

This then could be

linked to shon that King's current policies renarkably

parallel comunist efforts.

This mould cause extreme

embarrassuent to King. Further, 1t 1s felt that since the

position and paths taken by King and his group closely

parallel that advocated by the Connunist Party, this fact

should be nade known to the public.

Georgia. It is noted that last week the Attorney General authorized

similar coverage on the residence of Nartin Luther King, JI., President

The Attorney General is apparently still vacillating in his

it being recalled that he had initially suggested such coerage and then

The Attorney General was contacted at his request this after -

noon. He had before him our memorandum of October 7, 1963, requesting

authority for technical surveillances on Martin Luther King at his residence

at Atlanta and at the office of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference,

of which he is president, at New York City.

The Attorney General said that he recognized the importance of

this coverage if substantial information is to be developed concerning the

relationship between King and the Communist Party. He said there was no

question in his mind as to the coverage in New York City but that he was

sworried about the security oi an installation covering a residence in Atlanta,

Georgia. He noted that the last thing we could afford to have would be a

discovery of a wire tap on King's residence.

I pointed out to the Attorney General the fact that a residencé

Qwas involved did not necessarily mean there was any added risk because of

the technical nature of the telephone system. He was informed that the

Bureau had had years of experience in this field and that we continually

Oreviewed our procedures to insure that every measure possible to secure

such installations was takeg. It was nevertheless noted that of necessity

Gwe had lo deal with established contacts in the telephone company to get the

¿unecessary leased lines, but once again we had procedures which minimized!

the risks to the nth degree.

Б NOY 7 1953

After this discussion the Attorney General said he felt we

should go ahead with the technical coverage on King on a trial-bäsis, and to

continue it i productive results were forthcoming. He said he was certain

that all Bureau representatives involved would recognize the delicacy of this

particular matter and would thus be even more cautious than ever in this

assignment. He asked to be kept advised of any pertinent information

developed regarding King's communist connections.

MARTIN LUTHER KNG, JR.

Nilari

The Attorney General orally informed me today that he had been

considering the request he made on July 16, 1963, for a technical surveil-

lance on Martin Luther King at his home and office and was now of the

opinion that this would be ill advised.

At the time the Attorney General initially asked for such a

surveillance, he was told there was considerable doubt that the

productirity of the surveillance would be worth the risk because King

travels most of the time and that there might be serious repercussions

should it ever becoine known the Government had instituted this coverage.

These were the very thoughts that the Attorney General expressed today

in withdrawing his request.

With reference to the other technical surveillance requested

at the same time, namely, the one on Clarence Benjamin Jones, the

Attorney General feli this was in a different fategory and we should go

forward with this coverage. It is noted that this was previously approved

in writing by the Attorney General.

The memorandum we sent to the Attorney General on

July 23, 1963, requesting authority for the King surveillance has been

retrieved and is attached.

. 311081

ALE IN

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

Dal S|20/80

We will take no further action to effect technical coverage on

Martin Luther King; either at his home or at his office at the Southern

Christian Leadership Conierence, in the absence of a further request

from the Attorney General.

had Information 1n late 1953 that the Gandhi Society vas negotiating

To date me have been most discreet and circunspect in our

hancling of the king investigation, as tell as corollary investiga-

tions such as revolving around organizations, beczuse of the position

King his not only as a clergican, but also as a "respected" legro

deader. It is therefore essential that our current requests of the

Secretary are in agreement that steps will be taken to insure

that no further contracts will be awarded to King's group.

Several weeks ago FORWARD TIMES

made an editorial expression which

stated, among other things, that Dr. Mar-

tin Luther King had strayed oft onto an

extremely dangerous course waich ran

jin the opposite direction Irom the civil

rights leadership course that vast!

numters of citizens.had come to know

and respect him for over a wide span ot

years.

Now, we wish to make it crystal clear.

that this newspaper, of course, respects

and upholds Dr. King's right to take &

position that is, what we think to be,

contrary to good judgement. If he wishes.

to be the spokesman for the 'peaceniks',

-that's his business. When, however, Dr.

King joins with others and tries to impose

that poor judgement upon the entire Negro

community which is already beset with?

more in-depth and complicated problems!

than can apparently be coped with, at that!

: point we call it our business.

• FORWARD TIMES takes the position

that Dr. King's visit to Houston next

Tuesday nigat is an imposition upon this

community of the first order. We aiso

think that the fact that he is shrouding

his "remarks" behind a big name popu-

• lar singer like Aretha Franklin suggests

subterfuge. It Aretha Franklin, who is

now at the peak of fame, permits this

group of "peaceniks' to use her name to

further their eftorts, all that we cay say?

is, "that's her business." If she wakes up.

flater and finds that she has acted just,

like tokyo rose and axis sally, all that

awe can say is that she broughtitall upon

herselt.

Our concern is not so much with what

course Dr. King and Miss Franklinelect

to 1011ow. boat concerns us is that the in.

= =

nocent public, it not properly fore-

warned, might be taken in by their visit

to Houston. We think that if wha: Dr. King

peas to say isn't within itselt meritorious

enough to draw a crowd, he shouldn't be

coming to town in the first place to say

It. As it stands now, Aretha Franklin'S!

name nas been added to the snow and many;

people will pay the lee expecting to heart

' her sing. She will be the "balt' to help

get the crowd inside the Coliseum. Once 1

inside, the trapped ticket purchasers will

have to sit quietly while Dr. King spews

about the "immorality" of the sat in

Viet Nam. Whether we like it or not, the :

United States of America is at war with

a determined aggressor. How we gotinto

this war matters little at this point. The

boid truth is that we are shooting 'live'

ammunition at them and they are shoot-

fing the same type back at us with re-!

"markable effectiveness.

Looking at the contlict logically andi:

"realstically, we cannot escape the fact

that we have absolutely no course open

to us but to disregard all of the babble

of weaklings. We, as bonafide American

cilizens, must take a stand with our

country. In our actions, in our conver.

sations and in our preachments, we must

give no ald and no comfort to the enemy.

• We must remember that all wars are

Mes. ALBERT B. (CAROL ANN) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue,

stated her new unpublished telephone number

is 645-9152.

She was interviewed on May 10, 1968, by SAs HOWARD C.

KENNEDY and ALBERT J. RUSHING at which time she furnished

the lollowing information:

MrS. PEPPER is the sister of subject, JAMES EARL

RAY, but is 13 years younger than subject and in all of her

life has had very little contact or association with the

subject having seen him only aproximately three or four

times in her life. These three or four times when she has

seen him all occurred in the City of St. Louis after Mrs.

PEPPER came to St. Louis when she was 16 years old to reside

with her lather in St. Louis and all of the occasions when.

she saw the subject were brief encounters such as when she

saw him on the street.

She believes the last time she saw'

the subject was probably in 1959 or earlier when. she en-

countered him on the street in South St. Louis at which time

she

in the surnames and she is aware that. various ones of her

brothers and sister have used the surname RAY. So far as

she knows they all had the same father although she expressed

uncertainty in that regard and she assumes that the varia-

tions of the name are simply because her brothers and sisters

decided to use the name RAY, a variation of the name RAYNs.

When Mrs. PEPPER was 16 years of age, she left

her mother's residence in Quincy and came to St. Louis where

Sometime after Mrs. PEPPER came to St. Louis at the

to st. Louis and resided with Mrs. PEPPER'S maternal grand-

mother, MARY MAHER, at 1913 Hickory, St. Louis.

Mr.s. PEPPER

her husband didnot ever visit him at the penitentiary.

She

advised she has understood from her husband that the latter

has never seen the subject in his life.

Mrs. PEPPER has not at any time had any contact

either direct of indirect with the subject since his escape

in 1967 from the Missouri State Penitentiary.

She has no

knowledge of any person who has had information regarding the

subject's whereabouts and stated she could furnish no such

information regarding his whereabouts.

She, herself, first

learned that he had escaped from the penitentiary when she

heard it on the radio and she knew nothing about any plans

for the escape. She stated she has had no indication that

anyone in her family or otherwise has been in any way in

contact with the subject or had information regarding his

• whereabouts since his escape.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER regarding whether.

she recalled anything about the receipt of a money order

in approximately January, 1967, which was reportedly in the

amount of $15.00 and was sent by an inmate at the Missouri

State Penitentiary to the ALBERT PEPPER Stationery Company,

712a Shenandoah, St. Louis. :

In response to direct questions concerning this

matter, she advised that she may have received a money order

occasion but to the best of her recollection, it was

for $2.00 or $3.00 and it may have been in payment for maga-

zines which her brother had requested she mail to him. It

was her recollection that if she received a money order it

was received earlier than January, 1967. She said she never

at any time mailed magazines to him and doesnot recall what.

was received. Later in the interview she said the money order.

may have been for as much as $15.00 but she does not recall.

She also acknowledged that she might have cashed such a money

order but she cannot specifically remember having done so.

In this connection, she said her memory is very vague.

In response to soliciting by interviering agents,

MrS. PEPPER stated that she would be entirely willing to notify

the St. Louls Office of the FBI if she should at any time in

on locating the subject.

She also stated that she would be

entirely willing to be interviewed further in the event there

should be any additional matters on which an interview with

her would be desired.

Mrs. PEPPER said that her first knowledge of the

subject's involvement in this matter was when she heard the

news announcement on the radio and she said she has never

had any information regarding the possible involvement other

than that which has apeared in the rews media.

She said she

had never known of anything in her brother's attitude or

associations which would suggest any motive for his involve-

ment in the killing of a Negro leader such as MARTIN LUTHER

KING.

Mrs. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER, 2025 Bellevue, Maplewood,

Missouri,

was

interviewed at her residence, at which time she.

furnished the following information:

Mrs. PEPPER has received no information regarding

her brother,

JAMES EARL RAY (whome she refers to as JIM),

since the last previous interview with her by the FBI.

Within the past several days, police officers from

the St. Louis Police Department came to see Mrs. PEPPER indi-

cating to her that they had received some inquiry from a

newspaper, possibly "The

Los Angeles Times" according to Mrs.

PEPPEr's recollection of what they said; this inquiry having

to do with the finances of the ray family.

The police officers

apparently came to see urs. PEPPIR just to iind out some general

Infornation about her, and they suggested to her that it people

wanted to talk to her about her finances, she might want to.

obtain a

lawyer.

A representative of "The St.. Louis Post

Dispatch" newspaper also came to see Mrs. PEPPER within the

preceding few days, but she refused to talk to him.

MrS.

PEPPER has heard from an acquaintance that there was an article

a few days ago in "The St. louis Post Dispatch" which seemed

to be a rehash of the erroneous information which appeared in

a "Life Magazine" article concerning the Rif family, but Mrs.

PEPPER herself did not read this newspaper article.

after his needs.

The farm which the father bought about six

months ago is believed to consist of about forty acres of

which a little is probably tillable, and she thinks her father

will grow corn on this part of the farz, but the remainder is

suitable only for livestock and grazing.

She thinks that he

paid some amount in the neighborhood of

$2,600 for this farm.

Mrs. PEPPER is uncertain in her recollection, but believes it.

may be correct that she gave him a check drawn on her account

someirme belore her father

purchased the farm, he sold the property 11 St. Louis which

he formerly owned at 1819 Park, this property consisting of

a two-story residential building. Mrs. PRODER, believes he

received something like $2,800 fron the saied this property.

The believe that the $1, 200 whier she may

have returned to

hir in the icim of her check represented part of the proceeds

of the sale of that property which he gave her to keep lot

his in ver account. In any event Mrs. PIPels, is certain that

she did not hersell pay for any part of the purchase of the

farm by her father, and if she gave him the check for $1,900,

this was a return of his money or a loan.

While Mrs. PEPPSR'S lather resided in 3t. Louis

before the purchase or lne larm at Center,

Missourt, he had

various jobs, such as, service station attendant, and he also

at one time operated a second-hand store there he soid junk.

This business was also located on Park Avenue, but was some-

where east of Twellth Street, a considerable distance fron

1519 Park. Her lather did not own the property where he con-

ducted this second-hand business.

Until Mr. and ars. PEPPeR nored to their present

residence in the fall or 1967, Mrs. PROPER yas always employed

ever since their marriage in December ol 1951.

During that

period of time, they have practiced thrift and econony and

have always endeavored so save something frem their income.

They opened a savings account several years ago at the

Bohemian Savings and loan Association on South Eighteenth

Street in St. Loris ir the same ares where they resided.

fow years ago when the Sohemian Savings and Loan Association

was noved to a remote section of the city, they transferred

their savings account to the

Manufacturers Bank and Trust

account. ALBERT PAPPER has been enployed ior more than three

years by the Ace Construction and Engineering Company, which

is alfilicated with the Her Karket Faraware Store.

there

by the Catholic Archdiocese being paid at the rate of $60 per

week.

She had this employnent for about a year until Mr. and

MI'S. PEPPER moved in the fall of 1967 to their present address.

Her

last employment

before that was in cleaning work at an

office building at 1015 Locust in St. Icuis. Because she and

her husband have always endeavored to be econonical and saving

In the handling of their family finances, they were able to

accumulate funds in their savings account.

When they con-

tracted in the fail of 1967 to purchase the house where they

now ilve for a purchase price of $19, 500, they withdrew the

necessary money for the downpayment fron

their savings account.

Mrs. PEPPER has no idea sad no krowledge as to whether

her father may ever have given Mrs. PEPPER'S brother, J0WN LARRY

RAY; any funds to hold for her father.

Mrs. PEPPER has so infornation regarding a trip to

California made by her brother, fOMy LARRY RAY, In the summer

of 1967 and never knew or heard that he made such a trip.

One of the places in St. Louis where Mrs. PEPPER

lived with her father prior to her marriage was 1727 South

Eleventh Street.

She believes her brother BUZZY lived with

them there part of the time,

but she is certain that her

brother JIM never lived with them there. Mrs. PEPPER never

had any knowledge of her brother JIM having used the name

O'CONNOR, and she never knew of any bank accounts he may have

had at any bank at any time. In fact, airs. PEPPER had so

little contact or kncwledge of her brother JIM that she can

now recall having seen him only on possibly a couple of occa

Sions when she was anall and shortly after he was discharged

from military service, and she recalls seeing rim on ore occa-

sion on the strest in South St. Louis at some later time after

she noved to St. Louis with her father.

Although Mrs. PEPPER

was known as CAROL RYAN as of 1959, she has no knowledge or

recollection of having received any checks from her brother

JIM or from any person under the name JAMES CARL O'CONNOR;

either in 1959 or any other time. She can think of no reason

why she might ever have received any such checks.

Mrs. PEPPER

is certain that she has never had any financial

MrS. ALBERT (CAROL) PEPPER,

2025 Bellevue,

Maplewood, Missouri, advised that she had received no

additional information whatever bearing on the possible.

location of her brother, JAMES EARL RAY, since she was last

interviewed.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER as to whether, in

the event she should receive some pertinent information

regarding her brother, she would furnish such information to

the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (FBI). His. PEPPER

then stated that she would have no expectations whatever that

her brother would communicate with her in any vay, pointing

out that he did not know her current address or her current

unpublished.telephone.number.

She added that she felt that

he did not believe that he could expect any help from her and she

said that, as a matter of fact, she mould not be at all

interested or willing to help

him as she did not want herself

and particularly her children to be in any way involved with

him.

She said that if she should hear from RAY and be convinced

of his innocence she might find it difficult to furnish such

information to the FBI.

It was pointed out to Mrs. PEPPER that

in the event RAY should be innocent or there should be any

extenuating circumstances the entire ratter would in any event

be most readily resolved through locating RAY at the earliest

possible time. Mrs. PEPPER expressed understanding and agree-

ment with this idea.

Inquiry was made of Mrs. PEPPER as to her whereabouts

and activities during the period between April and July, 196%.

She said she was living at that period of time with her

husband and two children at 712-a Sherancoah,

St. Louis. She

recalled that beginning in about the sumer

of 1966 and

ending in about July or august, 1957, she was employed as 2

teacher's aide or assistant teacher in the "Head Start Program"

at st. Joseph's School located at Twelfth and Russell Streets,

St. Louis.

In this employment she worked regularly during

that period on Monday through Friday, each week, during the

hours of 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 4:30 p.n. daily.

This work

Involved the teaching of children three to five years of age.

She was paid for her work by check from the Archdiocese,

although she understood that at least some of the funds

for

the "Head Start Program" were furnished the Archdiocese by.

the Euman Development Corporation.

Mrs. PEPPER recalled

that she missed only one day from work during the entire

period of her employment and that day was due to the illness-

of her youngest child.

Mrs. PEPPER said her first knowledge of the escape

of her brother, JAMES EARL RAY, from the Missouri State

Penitentiary was when she heard or read news reports regarding

the escape but she is unable to recall the approximate time

she heard such reports. However, since reported identification

of RAY as the alleged assassin of MARTIN LUTHER RING, MrS.

PEPPER

has heard or read reports to the effect that his

escape from the penitentiary was not officially reported or

given publicity for perhaps several weeks after the escape

occurred.

Mrs. PEPPER, therefore, assumed that she herself

would not have

learned of the escare from news reports, until

perhaps several weeks after the escape.

poor language, leading him, ARVIDSON, to believe that he had

achieved education no higher than high school.

GALT was very ill at ease in crowds and gave

her the impression that he prefers to be either alone or

with no more than one other individual. He was an

introvert and was very hard to converse with.

She stated

that in the approximate two months that she knew him,

only towards the last did he feel confident enough with

her that he would joke with her.

She stated that toward

the end he showed somewhat of a humor, which she believed

very few people knew he had. He was

always ill at ease

around others and could not relax while in conversation

with any other indiviaual.

direction but at the person with whom he was conversing.

She stated that he smiled with a one-sided smile and that

he smiled very infrequently.

He would never talk about himself, but in general

conversations she was led to believe that he came to Los

Angeles from Mexico, possibly around Mexico City, He told

her that he was unemployed; was a former merchant seaman;

that he wished to return to sea, and that he received

sufficient proceeds from the sale of a bar that he could

"get along without being gainfully employea."

actually doing so.

During the dancing lessons he always

centered his conversations around dancing techniques and

never talked in general terms about himself.

She believes

he was a Southerner, and she recalled that possibly the

first or second week during January 1968, he did not attend

dancing instriction, and upon his return,

stated that he had

visited a brother in the State of Louisiana.

RHOADS stated

that during

the two month period that she knew GALI, he

changed residences twice in Hollywood, california.

She

at no time associated wiüh GaLt socially.

She was not

acquainted with any of his associates, and through

conversations, GALT told her that he had no particular

She stated

mat Gall seemed to compensate for

his social inaptness by his attire and placing his

schedule on precise projects which he was participating in.

As an

example, she stated that GALI took dancing

lessons she believca to overcome some of his shyness.

He

pursued the dancing lessons quite vigorously, doubling up

on the nunber of lessons norrally taught per weel so as to

take the maximum number of lessons in the shostest possible

time.

He abruptly quit dancing, telling her that he had

enrolled in bartending school and was having a conflict in

his schedule.

RHOADS was of the opinion that he had toyed with

his dancing lessons sufficiently to satisfy himself and

"running off on another tangent.

She also stated

that GAit was not sufficiently busy she believed to have not

pursued both courses, because GALT told her that he slept

rather late, had lunch, took a nap in the early arternoon,

wenü to bartending sonool in the late afternoon, and would

then attend dancing lessons in the early evening.

This,

he explained to her, was his typical day, which was not

busy, productive, or strenuous one in her mind.

She stated that GALT was very slow in his mental

processes. He often did not understand jokes and did not

react favorably to a friendly gesture extended to him.

RHOADS stated that during one conversation with GAIT she

made mention that it was odd that he did not wear any

jewelry, that is ring or watch, since he was so well dressed

otherwise. GAIT replied that he detested jewelry of any sort,

and to her knowledge, she never saw him wear a watch, ring,

or cuit links, or any other items of jewelry.

RHOADS COUld remember nothing else of the

mannerisms, background, etc. of GALT. She stated that GALT

was a white male, weighing about 165 pounds. She stated

that he had brown hair; was in his middle 30s; heù a medium

complexion, and spoke with a Southern accent.

She stated

that from his diction she believed him to be high school

of the club, were contacted by SA HARRY A. WALKER on

the evening of April 24, 1968, and given the background

Of JERRY RAY'S visit to

"Life

Magazine," Chicago, Illinois.

Of JERRY RAY from the FBI.

The above people also advised that before JERRY

RAY left Sportsman Country Club voluntarily on April 24,

1968, for the Chicago Office of the FBI,

they talked to

him attempting to impress upon RAY the necessity of RAY

fully cooperating with the FBI at all times in this

investigation.

Both of the above people advised that one or the

other will know if JERRY RAY does not report for work and if

he does not, they will immediately contact the Chicago

Office of the FBI.

MrS. MARGUERITE WELCH, Who resides at 287 Crestwooc

Village, Northfield, Illinois,

home phone it 6-6087, Who is

in charge of personnel at the Sportsman Country Club located

on Dundee Road, Wheeling, Illinois,

advised SA HARRY A.

WALKER as fOllows on April 24, 1968:

she has been acquainted with JERRY RAY, the

maintenance man at the sportsman Country eluo, since approxi-

mately September,

1964, when he started employment as a

dishwasher at the country club coming to the club from the

Bell Employment Service, Chicago, Illinois. RAY left

shortly after his employment started; however, returned within

two months and continued his employment as a dishwasher.

He eventually became night maintenance man at the club and

has always in this capacity performed his work in a capable

manner and was honest in every respect; however, she is of

the opinion that RAY has a low mental capacity.

RAY at no time has ever visited her home at the

above address

and she has had no contact with RAY since he

left the Sportsman Country Club on April 23, 1968, which is

his day off, until the present time.

RAY on his day off

which falls

on a Tuesday usually takes a bus to Chicago,

visits a theater, sometimes staying in Chicago and returning

the next day either for lunch or dinner.

RAY has spoken of a brother who she believes is

from the St. Louis, Missouri area; however, he never provided

any additional information concerning this

brother other than

the fact

that he was a bartender.

RAY also had a child during

his marriage to GUIRDIS RAY, nee

OLSEN, a former waitress

at the country club; however, GIRDIS was pregnant by a former

husband whose last name she remembers as STRIET (phonetic)

and the baby was born shortly after RAY's marriage to GJIRDIS

To the best of her recollection, GIRDIS RAY

no longer has this baby turning it over to a welfare agency

for adoption.

RAY also has an ex-wife, possibly in Nashville,

Tennessee, and had a son and a daughter by this marriage who

should be in the vicinity of from eight to ten years old.

Approximately three years ago at Christmas during his employ-

ment at the club, RAY flew to Tennessee to visit these two

children; however, she knows nothing further concerning these

children

or their

mother or where the family is presently

residing in Tennessee•

RAY has no close friends at the club; however, in

the past has filled in for other employees of the club

in addition to his own duties when the employees wanted time

off and needed someone to work in their place. He at no time

spoke of other members of his family other than to say that

he had a brother that was a bartender in the St. Louis area

and she had no idea that RAY was incarcerated in the past.

Her records revealed that RAY worked steadily during

night at the Sportsman Country Club from Wednesday evening,

April 3, 1968, through Monday, April 8, 1968, Without

having any time off.

She is of the opinion that RAY is not cooperating

with the FBI in every respect, does not feel that some of the

questions asked of him are important enough for him to give

any thought in answering; however, it could be that due to

his low mental condition that he is not capable of

answering

the questions asked of him.

to RAY telling him that she "thinks", she is going to talk

that this is an extremely

important part of his life to cooperate with the FBI in

every respect.

She and JERRY separated six months ago, and she later got

a divorce.

She has since lived by herself and not at her:

"parental" home because Mr. and Mrs. OLSEN are "jed up"

and did not approve of her chasing around, staying out late,

etc.

Mr. and His. OLSEN had become attached to the baby,

and visited GuERDIS and the baby a few times at Northbrook,

at the place on Techny Road. OLSEN BAM JERRY RAY a fey

of those times but did not like him because once OLSEN

got stuck in the snow right outside the Techny address, and

JERRY would not "even bother to help push" him out. OLSEN

never met any relatives of JERRY RAY and first knew that

JERRY had a brother, JAMES RAY, when he read it in the

newspapers a few weeks 2go.. GJERDIS never mentioned having

wet JAnEs, and OLSEN was unaware of a visit by one of the

RAy brothers to the Techny Road address.

He recalled that

shortly alter they were married, JERRY RAY and GUERDIS went

to Missouri to see JERRy's relatives with the intention;

of living

there but he heard no more about this.

OLSEN concluded that he feels there is something

wrong mentally with GJERDIS, who just moved from Lake Forest

to a motel in Des Plaines and who istorking as a waitress..

a babysitter at the d. D. silmons residence, BLiz4 Blichwood

had said and added that GJERDIS is highly nervous and emotional,

takes pills and is under doctor's care, principally because

of the strain of having placed her baby out for adoption

last sumner in an attempt to preserve her marriage with

JERRY RAY.

She said GJERDIS, who was born April 12, 1948,

married JERRY RAY In Chicago

in about January, 1967, and they

first lived at Arlington Heights before moving to 2897 Techny

after the marriage, probably in

the early spring of 1967,

which Mrs. OLSEN related to a time when GIERDIS had just

quit working for Culligan's in Arlington or Northbrook.:

The other incident concerned a phone call GUERDIS

made to hrs. OLSEN Iron Northbrook, in which she said that

"something funny" was going on because she, GUERDIS, had

discovered some strange clothes left in the garage by

JERRY's brothr from St. Louis; further, that this brother

had taken JERRY'S car and left.

GUERDIS told Mrs. OLSEN

that she "just don't understand" and that she had not

really seen the brotber.

cautioned that. GJERDIS' mind would "wander" when agents.

As he unpacked the magazines, JERRY RAY said i

"Just between you and me, I saw my brother right after

he escaped.

He had a meeting place where he mould meet on my

days off."

RAy did not say if these alleged meetings occurred

after his escape from prison or after the murder of KING.

JERRY RAY also said he had visited his brother who

owns a tavern in St. Louls, Missouri, after the assassination

and before his first interview by the FBI. He stated that

he recognized this man as being identical with his brother JAMES

EARL RAY.

JERRY RAY said 11 he told the FBI everything he knows,

"with all of their resources" they mould be able to "track him

down." He stated, "I do not know where he is right now.

I do

not think I'll ever see him alive again." He explained his

brother would probably not permit himself to be captured alive.

JERRY RAY added that he did not want the subject apprehended

because of the additional bad publicity it would result in for

•the RAY fanily;

RAY further said he does not refer to tbe

subject since the assassination by his real name but calls him

STARVO or GALI. He did not explain way. he does this.

RAY also said, "I tell the FBI only enough to keep

them off my back."

On 6/5/68, RAY speculated fie

that the

subject would probably flee the country to Mexico or Canada.

He also said the subject was too hot for him to be in touch

with now.

On 6/6/68,

asked JERRY RAY 11 his brother

shot KING: He replied,

This is his business.

I didn't ask

him.

If I was in his position and had 18 years to serve and

someone offered me a lot of money to kill someone. I didn't like

anyhow and get me out of the country, I'd do 1t."

Later the same day JERRY RAY commended si

even if the subject confesses to committing the murder of KING,

ne, dERRY RAX, fould not agree wich him.

He did not further

explain this statement, mis

advised.

RAY said he now carries a gun from his room to his

car.

to his room from his car, he removes the gun from the car's

trunk and takes it with him., He said he carries the weapon

for personal protection.

RAY said the subject is a supporter of Presidential

Candidate GEORGE WALLACE.

He said the subject once drove a man

to Alabama from possibly the California area so he could vote

fOI HALLACE.

He then identified this man by his photograph

which appears In the 5/3/68, issue of "Life!" It is noted t

sald the magazine states this man's' name is CHARLES

St did not say when

the trip to alabama occurred.

JERRY RAY said he was considering moving his residence

again to a place where the press and possibly the FBI rould be

unaware of.

He also said he was thinking of beginning to use

the alias of JERRY RYAN. He then displayed a ner Illinois

driver's license in the name of JERRY RYAN. He said he recently

obtained that license for his own use. He did not further

explain why he might change his address and begin to. use an

allas. He did not say be intended to leave. his present job.

On 6/7/68, LiKE

Mass said on 6/6/68,

asked JERRY RAY if be thought his brother shot KING. RAY

replied by pointing out if he mere in his brother's position

of having an 18 year sentence to serve once he was apprehended

and someone offered him money to kill someone he did not 1lke

and thereafter be able to leave the country, he would do it.

RAy further volunteered at this point the subject might have

fled

to Canada or Mexico.

He did not say anything further

about where he thought the subject was.

Then

asked JERRY RAY where the subject

got the money to buy

instant white Mustang with.

JERRY RAY

replied,

"They gave him part of the money. He put the noney

in a saiety deposit box, but! when he left, he drew it all out.

It broke his heart to have to leave the white kustang."

On 6/9/68, PCI also said on 6/6/68,

or

$500,000.

Informant file was reviewed. This file contained a contact

memorandum dated March 19, 1974, which set forth information

relating to several criminal matters and also contained the

following paragraph:

"During the Fall of 1973, five or six months ago:

date not recalled, Beyers came to the shop inquiring as

to whether they could get together to talk,

and they later

did so at Pizza and Cream, Clayton, Missouri, in the area

of a Broad-Dugan Paint Store, where informant had traveled

on business.

Beyers talked freely about himself and his

business, and they later went to informant's house where

Beyers told a story about visiting a lawyer in St. Louis

county, now deceased, not urther identified, who hac

offered to sive him a contract to kill Martin Luther King.

He said that

also present was a short, stocky man: who

walked with à limo. (Later, with regard to the latter

individual, Zeyers commented that this man was actually

the

individual wno made the payoff of James Earl Pay after

the killing.)

Beyers said he had declined to accept this

contract.

He did remark that this lawyer had confederate

flags and other items about the house that might indicate

that he was 'a real rebel'. Beyers also cormented that

he had been offered either $10,000 or $20,000 to kill ling.

:Extensive further research in the St. Louis indices

and files failed to reveal this information was in any way

disseminated and the information simply reposes in the informant

file.

Reurairtels and letterhead memoranda concerning

this matter.

It is noted at the Bureau that in several of the

letterhead memoranda submitted in connection with this

metter Special Agents of the FBI have observed marches. and

demonstrations. It is assumed. at the Bureau that Agents

were at the scene of these demonstrations in connection

with other business inasnuch as there has been no

authority from the Bureau for Agents to be present

observing such activities. It is, of course, necessary

that your office maintain sufficient close liaison with

law enforcement agencies to be made currently aware of

all developments; however, without specific Bureau

authority, Agents should not observe demonstrations as

a part of intelligence-gathering activity.

COLMUNIST PARTY, USA

COUNTERINTELLIGENCE PROGRASI

INTERNAL SECURITY - COMMUNIST

(FREEDONWAYS ASSOCIATES)

This is to recommend release of the attached

article to sources in the mass news nedia field regarding

Martin Luther King, Jr., leader of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference,

who is scheduled to give the keynote

address at a fund-raising activity sponsored by Communist

Party-controlled freedomways Associates, publishers of the

magazine, "Freedomways," which is self-described as a

quarterly review of the Negro Freedom Movement.

The

objective is to show that king appears to be courting the

communists to bolster his forthcoming civil disobedience

campaign in Vashington, D. C., in the Spring of 1968.

• The communist publication, "National Guardian,"

recently publicized the

fact that King is to give the

keynote address at the 100th anniversary celebration of

the birth of the late W. E. B. DuBois, well-known Negro

educator who joined the Communist Party, USA, at the age

This affair is scheduled

to be held on 2/23/68 in

Carnegie Hall, New York City, and is sponsored by Freedomways

The main purpose of this affair is to raise

money to help finance "Freedomways" magazine, and informa-

tron has been received indicating that with King as the

keynote speaker the adfair will undoubtedly be a financial

success.

Although no information has been received as to

the contents of King's speech, it is reasonable to assume

that he will comment on the matter with which he is primarily

jaisabedience planned tor the spring

his campaign of civil

concerned at the present time, naia of 1963 in Washington, D. C-

RE: COSMUNIST PARTY, USA

100-3-10-1-35

It is belleved that the publicity given to King's appearançe

at Carnegie Hall on 2/23/68 In behall of the connunist

publication, "Freedomways," could serve to show king's

The attached proposed article goes directly to

the heart of this matter. It is proposed that this article

be released 'to appropriate sources in the mass news media

field through the Crime Records Division.

The proposed

article raises the questionas to whether king is courting

the communists, to bolster his civil disobedience campaige.

In this connection, it is pointed out that Hunter Pitts

(Jack) O'Dell, former close associate of King's in the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, is one of the

editors of "Freedomways.". iIn 1963, King reluctantly released

O'Dell from his post in the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference. when it became publicly known that O'Dell was a

leading figure in the Communist Party. It is further

pointed out in the proposed article that the Communist Party,

with its years of experience in agitation and fomenting

conflicts, would be a powerful ally for King in his efforts

to promote civil disobedience in Washington, D. C.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this memorandum and the attached article be

routed to the Crime Records Division for release to

appropriate sources in the mass news media field.

King's Fund-raising Activities:

King told Jones that he would be in California 2/25-27/65 to atten

a big fund-raising project.

It will include a showing of the movie "The

Greatest Story Ever Told" and It would "scare the house of about $28,000."

In addition, there are two or three wealthy people trying to get 50 couple

to give §1,000 (presumably each couple) and they have 26 connitments

already. King claimed that his organization, the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCIC), needs the money desperately.

They also

discussed a group in New Rochelle, New York, which King said already bad

$5,000 and desired to use it for a fund-raising project to earn even more.

Jones told King that the advertisement which appeared in "The New York

Times" 2/5/65 soliciting funds on behalf of the SCIC cost $2,000. king sa

that his office had already received $12,000 as a result of this advertise

ment. U

Friction Between King and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee •

(SNCC)

In discussing the current racial situation in Alabama, King told

Jones that SNCC was again saying that King likes to come into

a situation

ot, the last minute, get all the publicity and the benefit of contributions

3C claims that King makes "grandstand plays" after SNCC has done all the

eld work. King asked Jones if something could be done about this throug

Harry Belafonte (noted Negro singer).

According to Jones, Belafonte is

about the only person that SNCC will

listen to and that he has heard

Belafonte stop

'SNCC workers who tried to attack king's integrity. King

said that he did not like for SNCC to fight against the idea of having a

leader for the whole novement. King stated that the movement must have a

leader bécause any ideology is fostered around having a leader around whor

supporters can rally. Jones believes that he can arrange an unpublicized

meeting between sNCe,

SCIC and Belafonte. U •

Comment: The naked boldness of King's egotism is vividly reflecte

in his pronouncements about the movement needing a leader (obviously King

hinself). U

SPEAKER JOHN MC CORMACK

BRIEFING RE MARTIN LUTHER KING

SATURDAY, 8-14-65

AT 2 P.M

At his request, and with the Director's approval, I brieted

Speaker John McCormack regarding the backgrouná and activities of Martin

Luther King today in the Speaker's rooms.

The briefing lasted approximately 45 minutes. It covered King's

as well as his connections with members of the

-Communist Party. The identity of the members of the Communist Party ho

have had control over and association with King were brought out. The latest

incident ir which King has advised the press that he will write a letter to

General Ho Chih Minh of the North Vietnamese, in an attempt to establish

himself as a "peacemaker" was related to Speaker McCormack. The commurisis

efforts back of this incident, and those individuals perpetrating the incident were

mentioned,

Speaker McCormack was quite calm about the entire briefing. He

stated he had heard much in the way of rumor previously; however, he wanted

to know if the information he had received was accurate.

He stated he now

recognized the gravity of the situation and that something obviously must be dòne

about it. He inquired as to whether the President knew these facts. I replie in

the affirmative.

The Speaker stated that he thought that "Edgar Hoover did not

call King a notorious liar for nothing. " He stated he now recognized why the

Director branded King as he did He added that he was in complete sympathy

with the Director taking this action

100-106670-1782

The Speaker spoke lengthily concerning the desperate need to

educate Negroes today with the fact that they cannot defy the law and get away

with it.

for the latter part of April, 1968. King's organization, the

Hartin Luther ling, Jr., President of the Southers

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), today finds himself

In the embarrassing position of having too much money, or at

least the probability of too much money. The SCLC sent out a

huge malling to its contributors pleading for lunds for the

Yashington Spring Project, the "poor people's march on

Washington. "

Thousands of contributors were urged to support

the narch linancially in order to leed and house the demon-

strators. But the churches in the Fashington, D. C., srea

have olfered to house and leed the demonstrators.

Now the contributions are beginning to roll in from

the malling and King doesn't need the money. An embarrassment

of riches has befallen ling, who will only use the noney for.

other purposes. The churches had better cose through with

all the housing and support the demonstrators seed

there will be little noney left dos the "poor people"cy the

time the march rolls around.

SAN ITAT ION WORKERS STRIKE,

HEMPH IS, TENNESSEE

on February 16, 1968, Charles L. Cabbage

EATL

advised a representative of the Federal Bureau

of Investigation that he is the head of the Black

Organizing Power (BOP), & Student Nonviolent Coordina-

ting Committee (SNCC) oriented group in Menphis,

On March 5, 1968, Donnie Delaney advised

representatives of the Federal Bureau of Investigation

that he is a part of this same group.

Source one advised that Hosea L. Williams was

the main spokesman and stated that every effort would be

made by a task force of the SCLC which 'is in Memphis

during

the week beginning April 1, 1968, to escalate

strike support activity in Hemphis, Tennessee. James

Orange stated that he would set up a series of youth

workshops in the various churches in Memphis which would

be attended by youths and adults and that thes? persons

would be trained in SCLC techniques and would also be

trained as parade marshals for any subsequent marches

which would be held under the auspices of SCLC and the

COME group. James L. Bevel stated that Dr. Martin Luther

King, JI.,

President of the SCLC, would come into Memphis

• on Tuesday, April 2, 1968, and would probably remain until

Friday, April 5, 1968, and would probably march in a mass

march to be sponsored by coMs and SCLC on that date.

Source one stated that some of the press raised

the question as to whether SCLC was attempting to take over

the strike and related racial activity in lemphis, Tennessee,

and Bevel and Hosea Willlams emphatically denied this claiming

that they are operating in Memphis at their "own expense."

Hosea Williams stated that the SCLC would have to pet the

garbage men justice and that it would probably have to have

daily marches in this effort.

source further advised that Reverend Jesse Jackson

stated that SCLC and its supporters would start a concerted

drive to get all Negroes in Memphis, some 250,000, to transfer

their bant accounts and insurance policies fron white

institutions to Negro institutions.

He stated that this

group could alin attempt to see that Negro businessmen

obtained a greater portion of Negro business and that if they

did not "shape up" they would have to "ship out."

Source one interpreted this to mean that Negro

businessmen would have to prepare themselves to discharge

their business responsibilities should new business from

their own people be brought to them.

Source one advised that Williams, Bevel and Jackson

kept emphasizing that this is not a "takeover" on their part

and that they are in Memphis at the invitation of the COME

group.

They described themselves as a catalyst who are here

in Memphis to unite "black power."

Source one advised that Reverend James Morris

Lawson, of., stated that the leaders would nave to

recognize every black person in Memphis, including the

youth, as a'force in this movement."

Source one advised that in response to queries

from the press as to who is financing the obviously

expensive SCIC operation in Memphis, Hosea Williams replied

that SCLC is paying the bills from its treasury and that

any money raised as a result of SCLC activity in Nemphis

1111 go the sanitation workers.

Source one turther advised that Bevel answered

•a press inquiry relating to a recent statement by memphis

Police and Fire Director, Frank C. Hollonan, in which

Aro Holloman described the march 28, 1968, disruption on

Beale Street in Hemphis which spread into other Negro

neighborhoods of Memphis as in effect a "war."

comnenting on Holloman's statements stated, "We're here

as political psychiatrists.

He see the Mayor and hisgroup

as patients who are mentally sick." Bevel also stated

that all of the trouble in Memphis can be attributed not

to black militancy and irresponsibility, but to the

over-all white racism which he clained exists in Memphis.

He stated that bemghis Mayor Henry Loeb feels inferior

because he viviously does not understand black people.

He added that the city tried to settle its probiem with

the army and with tanks when the real problem was poverty.

He emphasized "poverty is the key issue."

questions with the ministers as to how they explained

He stated that it is obviously correct for the

white

race to steal; that they have been cheating and

stealing from the Negroes economically for centuries;

and he concluded by stating, "We believe in black power

and advocate its use.""

He did not elaborate as to what.

he meant.

On the late night of April 1, 1968, bemphis

Chier of police James c. hacdonald advised that the city.

of Memphis was giving serious consideration to legal

actions which could be taken to prevent future mass

marches.

He stated that the city was considering asking

for a court injunction preferably a Federal Court injunction,

prohibiting any mass marches led by Dr. Jartin Luther

King, fr., or other persons prominent in the march which

preceded violence on Thursday, harch 20, 1968,

in Memphis.

He stated that any such injunction would specify the

conditions under which a march could take place and

that the city is further considering the resumption of

the curfey which was originally Imposed on March 28, 1968,

and which mas lifted April 1, 1968. Chief Macdonald als

stated that the city was considering placing some of the

strike support leaders under peace and financial responsibility

bonds.

Judge Kenneth Turner was calling for an investigation of a

report that one or more ministers provided taxicabs to

take youths from their schools to the March 28, 1968, march

which would be in violation of the truancy laws. He

adults who were doing this could be charged with contributing

to the delinquency of a minor.

Chief Macdonald stated that Judge Turner's

decision came after remarks by & student, Alvin White,

of 1546 Orr who stated that he skipped school to take

part in the march and had told Judge Turner that a minister,

name not known to him, had provided taxicabs to take some

of his friends and himself to Clayborn Temple Alls Church

so they could be in the march.

Chief Hacdonald stated that approximately 31

Negro youths appeared

in Judge Turner's Court on April 1,

pastor of Centenary Methodist Church, Hemphis, and one of

the main leaders of the Community on the love for Equallty

(COME), the kemphis Negro Ministerial Group leading the

support of the sanitation workers, Kemphis, Tennessee, who

have been on strike since February 12, 1968, informed Lux

that a downtown sympathy march for the strikers was planned

Lawson stated that the narch would be restricted

to ganitation workers and adult sympathizers and that every

effort would be made to eliminate the young element which

created problems leading to window breaking, looting; and

general vandalism which disrupted the massive march on

Karch 28, 1968, led by Rev. Martin Luther King, dr., President,

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

Later on the afternoon of Harch 29, 1968,

Henry

Lux pointed out that no permit is required for marches of

any kind within the city of lemphis and that the Memphis

municipal authorities are considering the possibility of

passing an ordinance of this type.

Also, on March 29, 1968, Chief of Police James C.

machonald of hemphis advised that there have been no serious

troubles during March 29, 1968. He had instructed all of

his officers to disperse small groups of youngsters in various

sections of the city and that there were still sporadic out.

bursts of window breaking, minor looting, general vandalisi,

and the setting of trash tires. Ont squad car was fired on by

unknown. Negroes in the vicinity of Dison and Rile in south

Memphis early on the norning of Harch 28, 1968, according to

MacDonald, but the individuals firing the shots were not

identified. He stated that throughout the day the lemphis.

Police Department received numerous calls of reported looting,

vandalism, and fire settings and fire bombings, although in-

vestigation by representatives of the Hemphis Police Depart-.

ment and the kemphis Fire Department Indicated that most of

these incidents were minor.

He pointed out that the major

damage in connection with the arch 28, 1968, disturbance

was confined to a three to four block area on Beale Street

in downtown Hemphis with store fronts being damaged and

practically all of a three block area. He stated that liquor

stores are still closed, that National Guardsen are guarding

the stores which have been looted and where windows have been

broken, that the nerchants are boarding up the fronts of nost

of these establishments to preclude further vandalism and

looting and he feels that with the presence of the Tennessee

National Guard, along with the assistance of the shelby

County Sheriff's Office and his department, that the situation

Is well in hand and that, with the exception of sporadic

outbursts of vandalism, he does not anticipate any immediate

trouble in Hemphis.

On the night of March 29, 1968, Assistant Chief

Henry Lux advised that there were approximately 33 additional

arrests on March 29, 1968, by the Memphis Police Department

on charges including miscellaneous looting, disorderly con-

duct, resisting arrest, and threatened breach of peace. He

reported that in City Court, Division II, more than 200

persons charged in the past two days appeared before City

Judge BERNIE Reinman on charges ranging from drunkenness

to assault on police officers.. Judge Weinnan bound 40

defendants over to the state, dismissed 46 others, and cor-

tinued the cases against 118 until later in the month of .

April, 1968. The largest bond was $5,000 set for Gordon

degree burglary, this being set by City Judge Ray Churchill.

Other bonds he set ranged from $250 to 52,000-. L/ll

During the evening of Karch 29, 1968, the police

received numerous calls of reported fire bombings, vandalisi,

and looting over a wide area primarily in the Negro neighbor

hoods but many of these proved to be unfounded on investigation.

Lux advised that the curtew Imposed by layor Henry Loeb on the

stated that riot damage resulting from the March 28, 1968,

window breaking and looting was estimated by insurance

cellaneous fires. He pointed out fortunately none of the

fires were serious.

This would not, of course, include

losses due to interrupted business days bécause many office

managers, store owners, government agencies, including

federal, state and county, dismissed their employees earls

both on

Harch 28 and 29, 1968, in order to avoid trouble.

He pointed out that school absenteeism in the

predominantly Negro high schools.

Lux stated that the only injury reported during

the day was to Memphis Police Patrolman E. H. MAXWELL,

whose finger was severely cut while he was arresting a

drunk young Negro who was fighting with other officers on

Polk Street north of Chelsea, which is in a predominantly

The Memphis Commercial Appeal newspaper, saturday

norning issue, March 30, 1968, reported in detail con-

cerning activities of Rev. Hartin Luther King, Jr., on

March 29, 1968, and stated in a story on page l by Reporter

* King, " by se

Thomas BeVier that King came to Memphis to star in what was

billed as a "dress rehearsal" for his April 22, 1968,

"Poor People's Crusade" on Washington, D. C.. The story

continued,

"By his own non-violent standards, the rehearsal

was a tlop."

The story stated that King in a press interview

March 29, 1968, reported that he would be back in lemphis.

as early as April 3 and not later than April 5, 1968,. for

another nass march and was quoted as saying, "We are

going

to have a massive non-violent demonstration in lemphis."

The story stated that the question being asked in Memphis,

the nation, and the world is whether - with the increasing

militancy of black youth - anyone can say with certainty

that a non-violent demonstration will stay that way.

King stated in the interview,

"I am convinced

ve can have a non-violent demonstration" but was reported

as adding that it would be impossible to "guarantee" that

there would not be any violence. The story stated that it

was significant that King was more than a half hour late

for his 11:30_A.h. press conference because he was meeting

with three members of a Black Power group, which the paper

referred to as "The Invaders."

BeVier stated that these

three young men refused to give their, names and stated that

they would give their own press conference at a later time.

The story continued that King was staying in a

$29 a day room at the Holiday Inn Rivermont, also known as

the Rivermont Hotel. King claimed to the newspaper that he

did not realize when he came to Memphis that there were those.

In the Negro community who were "talking about violence."

He stated, "He (SCLC) had no part in the planning of the

march.

Our Intelligence was nil."

known there were persons likely to start violence, he would

have had them made parade marshals, a nove which he said had

been successful in other marches.

He was reported as being critical of the press

for reporting that he left the march in haste after the

trouble started on March 28, 1968.

He claimed that he left

calmLy because he said, "I will not lead a violent march."

He said that while he

"walked" with aides to a car, he was

"agonizing over what had happened." The story reported that

Assistant Police Chief Henry Lux had earlier said over the

police radio at approximately 11:27 s.X., Thursday,

Harch 28, 1968, that the march was apparently without leader-

ship as DI. King had asked for a police escort away Iron.

the narch a few minutes after the first report of violence

during the narch. King mas reported in the story as saying

he did not think the riot "ill in any way affect" his

Washington plans for his Poor People's Crusade to commence

April 22, 1968. He said he is undecided as to how nuch of

his SCLC staff he can spare to organize the next massive .

march in Memphis early in April 1968.

The story said that later in Washington,

D. C.,

for about two weeks and that steps would be taken to avoid

violence and that a "symbolic delegation," including King

would reach Mashington on April 22, 1968. The story continued

SANITATION HORKERS STRIKE

MEMPEIS, TENNESSEE

that King claimed that Thursday, March 28, 1968, narch wag

• "poorly planned" which the paper said amounts to criticism

of Rev. James K. Lawson, Jr., whom DI. King himself had called

"the leading non-violence theoretician in the country." The

paper reported that lawson is in charge of the strategy for

the Hemphis Negro ministers, also known as COlE, and is pastor

of the Centenary Methodist Church and continued that Lawson

did not entirely agree with King's assessments.

The story stated for instance that King had said

that the Black Power advocates with whom he met earlier had

said that there had been a lack of communication between them

and the ninisters and that they felt "rejected." Rev. Lawson

was quoted by the paper as saying, "There has been communication.

I don't accept that," referring to King's statement. The

paper said that it was Rev. Lawson who had originally asked

•King to come to Memphis and that for about 10 years Lawson

has served in an advisory capacity with SCLC. It stated that

Lawson agreed with King that a non-violent demonstration is • ..:

possible and pointed out that this was one of the reasons

King was asked to come to Hemphis. Lawson stated, "He didn't

bring in Rap Brown (national chairman of the Student Non-

Violent Coordinating Committee), we brought in King."

He

was reported to have jurther said that there were other

reasons for bringing in iing, one being to give the movement

in leaphis a "national image" and another was to strengthen

the leadership of the lemphis ministers.

The same March 30, 1968, issue of The Commercial

Appeal newspaper had a lead

editorial on page 6 entitled,

"King's Credibility Gap," which stated that"hartin Luther

King on the night of March 18, 1968, told an overflow crowd

at Mason Temple:

"You know what? He may have to escalate

• this struggle a bit.' Dr. King

then urged a total fork

stoppage in lemphis by Negroes 'in a few days' and called

for.all Negro public school students to cut classes

at. the

same time.

"Try it and they will hear you, '

said Dr. King.

The escalation came Thursday when Dr. King led a supposedly

non-violent protest march from Clayborn Temple to Beale

Street, west on Beale to. Main, and a block north on Main. Fe

got what he asked - to an embarrassing extent.

Negro students

did play truant by the thousands and were joined by hundreds

of other young Negroes in their 20's who turned the march

into a riot and left Beale Street and a short section of Main

in utter ruin. Photographs and eyewitness accounts identify

those who did the destruction and the looting - the children

and young people whom Dr. King had told to stay out of .

on his jacket but that this is merely a name which some of

them have adopted and that it 1s all part of the BOP organt-

As recontly as Harch 30, 1968, source 1 stated

that many teenagers in Hemphis have put the word "Invaders"

on backs of their jackets, although they are not necessarily

connected with the BOP organization. They do this more or

less as a symbol of their self-professed affinity with

Source I pointed out therefore that the mere

fact that one wears the word "Invaders" does not mean that

he is a part of any organized novement, that the only known

organized Black Power movement in Hemphis is that of BOP

governing body. He pointed that, for example, at LeMoyne

the strike supporters since February 12, 1968. Cabbage

was Insistent on seeing Ralph Jackson and that Jackson's

assistant, a Rev. Johnson, refused to allow lim to see Jackson

stating that Jackson was completely "fed up" with Cabbage and

his Black Power associates, that Jackson originally had

•attempted to have rapport and communication with them and

had even offered to get them financial support out of New

York City but that after the ruckus started on March 28, 1968,

Cabbage, John B. Smith, and their associates came back to

the temple after the ministers had attempted to get the

marchers to return and virtually took over the temple, took

over the nicrophone, and would not cease and dismiss when

some of the ministers asked them to do so.

Therefore, Jackson's assistant Rev. Johnson, who

lives at 5183 Horn Lake Road, refused to take them to see

DI. Jackson.

source I pointed out that since around March 1,

1968, the BOP group headed by Cabbage and smith has been

In close contact with the sanitation stiike and had been

working in cooperation with the CoME group that Rev. Lawson

and Dr.

Jackson, the two prime leaders of the COME group,

have allowed them to attend strategy meetings and have met

with them on numerous occasions. In fact, source 1 pointed

out it is significant that a mass strike support meeting

was held at Clayborn Temple, 280 Hernando on the night of

March 5, 1968, attended by some 500 to 600 individuals and

that one of the main speakers and masters of ceremony was

Rev. James Horris Lawson, Jr., and at this mass meeting

in charge of the meeting, passing out a 5 page mimeographed

pamphlet entitled, "Afro-American Brotherhood Speaks, Black

Thesis,

Black Power!!" which eulogized H. Rap Brown,

-national chairman of SNCC.

A portion of this document

stated that the civil rights tactics of 1963 are not sufficient

in the form of pressure on political structures and in dealing

with what 1t referred to as extreme violent reaction of city

powers in this community. It claimed that the so-called

self-appointed part-time civil rights and part-time preachers

Inevitably "quit the struggle too soon."

It said that "civil

disobedience implies an entirely new set of priorities and

responsibilities of which the current Negro leadership could

no longer accept."

It clained that the current strike support

movement in Memphis had turned into a big revival with the

preachers having the followers so busy singing, praying, and

marching that they do not do anything about the real issues.

Itasked the question, "Why has the community let the preachers

take over and try to lead in a fight which? There must be

• some real fighting.

He all know the preachers can't fight

or won't fight."

It then printed a letter dated Harch 21,

1968, Iron Parish Prison, New Orleans, Louisiana, from F.

Rap Brown in which he said, 'We must move. Iron resistance to

aggression, from revolt to revolution. For every Orangeburg

there must be 10 Detroits. For every lax Stanford and Huey

Newton, there must be 10 dead racist cops. And for every :

black death there must be a Dien Bien Phu."

It continued,

"Aggression is the order of the day" and concluded "America:

If It takes my death to organize my people against you, and

to organize your jails to revolt against you and God, your

poor, your country, and to organize mankind to rejoice in your

destruction and ruin, then here is my life!"

Following this was a detailed drawing captioned

"Holotov cocktail" showing in detail how á Molotov cocktail

can be made by inserting a plain rag into the neck of a

bottle which contains gasoline with a base of dirt or

washing powder. Source I pointed out that none of the

ministers present at this meeting made any effort whatsoever

to restrain Cabbage and his followers from distributing this

material nor did any of them make any statements

to the

audience that they should ignore such naterial.

On March 30, 1968, a second source advised that

he had reliably learned that the 3 so-called 'Invaders"

who were reported in the Commercial Appeal as having

of Harch 29, 1968, were the hereinbefore identified. Charles

Laverne Cabbage, the hereinbefore identified Charles Harrington,

and Calvin Leroy Taylor, a nale Negrowho resides at 347 lest

Waldorf and who 1s a senior at Memphis State University.

Taylor works part-time as a copy boy at the Commercial Appeal

newspaper. Taylor has recently told source & that he is a

part of the BoP group, which 1s artiliated with snee and

that he has been serving as 2 liaison representative of

• BOP with the CoMe group, with the Negro ministerial group,

which is coordinating the strike support.

Taylor further

stated that when Harrington, Cabbage, and Taylor had an.

audience with King that their purpose in seeing King was to

tell King that they wanted more of the "action" in Hemphig

feeling that they were not getting enough of the action.

• Taylor refused to elaborate but source 2 conjectured that

by this Taylor meant that the Black Power group wanted more

• of a position of leadership and nore policy making position

In the over-all Negro movement. In Hemphis.

Source 2 also advised that the newsmen in Hemphis

• and other officials will Interchangeably use the word

- "Invaders" when they are actually referring to BOP and pointed

• out that it had been ascertained that actually the Black

Power movement in lemphis uses several names, such as Afro-

American Brotherhood, Black Student Association, BOP, and

Invaders and that Taylor has told him confidentially that

actually there are only about 12 to 15 hard-core BOP

people in lemphis and that the others are merely followers

or people who tend to imitate them.

Source 2 also stated

that he had reliably. learned from several individuals who

in the Harch 28, 1968, march when the trouble began, that the

actual BOP people did not participate in any of the vandalisn

or looting although prior to the meeting several of thei,

exact identities not known to source 2, had been agitating

the young high school age Negroes who were preparing to

participate in the march by indicating that there should be .

trouble and that Hemphis was not worth saving and that 1t

should burn, and other inflanmatory utterances to this effect.

.

On the afternoon of Harch 29, 1968, a third

source advised that Rev. Martin Luther King,

Jr., President,

SCLC, Bernard Lee, Special Aide to King, and Rev. Ralph

D. Abernathy, Vice President at Large, SCLC, all departed

at 3:20 P.M. CST, Harch 29, 1968, their destination being

Atlanta, Georgia.

This source stated that to the best of

his knowledge

they went directly from the Rivermont Hotel

to the kemphis Metropolitan Airport,

source 1 on March 30, 1968, recalled that Rev.

Hartin Luther King, JI., obviously would have been aware

of the presence of a militant Black Power group in

Hemphis and based this opinion on the following Information:

King 1n his March 18, 1968, speech before the

strike supporters at Mason Temple had urged all high school

students to remain away Iron school to participate in the

massive narch which he planed to lead in the future and

urged all workers in Hemphis to stay away from their jobs

and march and at no time did he call for a completely non-

violent march.

Source:further recalled that Janes Bevel,

who for several years has been on King's staff and who was.

last known by source 1 to have the title of "in charge of

non-violent action, was in Hemphis with King's party on

Harch 18, 1968, and remained in Hemphis until at least

Harch 20, 1968.

Source I recalled that on March 20, 1968,

•Bevel along with Rev. Harold Hiddlebrook of 257 Walker,

, a former member of King's staff in Atlanta and now a resident

of kemphis and one of the leaders of the COME group appeared

at LeMoyne College, a Negro institution of some 600 students

1n Hemphis, being brought there by James Phillips and Clinton

Roy Jamerson, members of the governing body of BOP. There

Bevel and Middlebrook net with various Leloyne students at

the student center at noon on Harch 20, 1968, meeting with

approximately 75 to 10p sudents. Bevel was the main speaker

and gave what Informant described as a virulent Black Power :

talk claiming that the white power structure through economic

pressure will eventually attempt to exterminate the Negro

in the United. States in some form of genocide and pointed

out that the United States in its foreign aid program has

proven that it is a white supremacist country in that 1t

gives more to white nations in the form of foreign than it

does to black countries such as those making up the continent

of Africa. Bevel turther claimed, according to source 1,

that while Negroes or black men as he referred to them welcoue

the support given by the white clergy and white "do-gooders"

that these whites are not really sincere as they have no

"real soul feeling" toward the Negro and he suggested that

his listeners read several Black Revolutionary books, and

particularly urged them to read the book entitled, "The

Wretched of the Earth" by Frantz Fanon, which informant

described as a bible to revolutionary and militant Negro

activities. CU.

Source I stated that he personally knew that

John B. Smith of BOP, along with Charles Harrington and

Verdell Brooks of BOP and a new supporter of the group,

one Milton Mack and another BOP member Samuel Carter,

were all present with Middlebrook and Bevel at this

meeting. Bevel urged a11 of these listeners to actively

participate in the future scheduled march to be led by

Rev. Martin Luther Ring, Jr.

Furthermore, at this meeting

John B. Swith and his followers stated that they were

canvassing all of the Negro high schools with leaflets

urging a nass walkout at the schools and urging that these

walking students participate in the sanitation workers

• sympathy march to be led by King. On leaving LeMoyne

Middlebrook and Bevel stated that they also planned to

• canvass lemphis State University, Southwestern College,

: Christian Brothers College, and Owen Junior College, all

Institutions of higher learning in Hemphis, Tennessee,

.

In order to solicit support, not only for their organization

. but also for the proposed mass march to be led by King.

: John B. Smith bragged to Bevel that his BOP group

had

z1so

organized at most of the colleges in lemphis.

Source 1 recalled also that Bevel at the Leloyne

meeting urged the students to read"Wuhammad Speaks,"

official newspaper of the Nation of Islam' (NOĨ), headed in

Chicago, Illinois, by Elijah luhammad, pointing out that

in owe the 1

much of Muhammad's program fits his concept of Black Power

philosophy with the exception of the religious aspect whereby

Muhammad claimed Allah as his god. He told students to •

Ignore the religious aspects and merely follow the economic

and political aspects propounded in Muhammad's program.

Bevel also bragged that within the next year he hopes to

•form a new nationwide Black Power organization in the

• United States which would supersede SNCC and would take in

the remnants of the varied uncoordinated Black Power groups

now existing in the United States and wanted to build a

united black front effort having tentacles in all major

communities in the United States. Source I pointed out that

Bevel, will an ordained minister, was extremely vulgar and

obscene in his talk and shocked some of the wonen who were

• present resulting in some of the women leaving the meeting

Source. I pointed out that Hiddlebrook definitely is very close

• to the

SCLC, Bevel, and Rev. Martin Luther King, JI. Be

stated that Bevel is a most effective speaker particularly

with regard to influencing young people and that in his talk

he preyed on their feelings of avarice and envy claiming that

the white man would purposely not allow them to have enough

of the economic goods of this country and that the black man

must learn to assume power, to control property, and to control

saw materials and to utilize his talénts.

early Harch 1966 was observed to be

present at

the offices of the Mestside M.E.B. DuBois-

Club in Chicago (DCA).

Discussion took place at

this time centering around reaction to a recent

notification that the Attorney General of the United

States intended to label the DuBois Club as a

communist front. Bevel, in conversation, stated

that he would have ignored this notification and

kept about the work in which he was engaged. He

felt that 11 the DuBois Clubs have a real program

of help for the people, then the people would

answer for the clubs despite any labels appied to

them.

Host present agreed that the attaci on the

Dubois Clubs was a part of the plan by the "establish-

ment" to undermine the civil rights novement.

felt that the recent hearings into Klan activities

In this country were only a beginning which would

lead to a lull scale attack on the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference (SCLC), the real target.

of those present stated during the course of this

discussion that he was not a communist, and to this

Bevel was. overheard to reply that every thinking

American should be. Bevel stated that Negroes have

not begun to read

yet, but when they do, they will

•be socialists.

Wilkins how in the hell could he espect the FBI to believe his offers of friendship ar.

hung his head and stated he had no idea that King was carrying on such a campaign, ze

stated that this upset him greatly and made him all the more determined to initizie

Hartin-Ither-King,

Jr., is to be In West Berlin, Germany;

¡or the opening of that city's cultural festival 9/13/64.

We have

just obtained details of his itinerary for travel abroad

which reveals

that he will leave the United States oither 9/11 or 12/64 and not

return until 9/22/61. Included in his itinerary is a visit to Rome,

Italy. ¡e is to go there from Madrid, Spain, 9/18/04, and remain Ir

Rome until the morning of 9/20/64 mhen he will go to london, Englano.

He have not as yet obtained any information indicating the

purpose of his visit to Rome, but it is entirely likely that he may

seek and be given an audience with the Pope. This likelihood is

clearly evident when one considers that King is receiving more and

lore acclalm as a leader of the Negro people in this country, plus

the fact that he 1s a clergyman. Further, King we know is being con-

sidered for the Nobel Peace Prize andhis receiving an audience with

the Pope would likely receive considerable publicity, especially in

europe, further enhancing his chances for the Prize.

It mould be shocking indeed for such an unscrupulous character

as King to receive an audience with the Pope. It is believed that it

a plan to see the rope is in the making, it ought to be nipped in the.

bud.

Ve have considered difierent possibilItIes for meeting this

problem and believe that the best one would be to have Assistant

Director Halone of the New Jork Office personally contact Francis

Cardinal Spellman and on a highly confidential basis bring to the

Cardinal's attention (1) the fact that King is to visit Rome and the.

likelihood of his receiving an audience with the Pope and (2) the

unsavory nature of King's character, both from a subversive and moral

standpoint. Malone should be able to impress upon the Cardinal the

likely embarrassment that may result to the Pope should he grant King

an audience and King 1s later discredited. In this light it would

hardly even be necessary for Malone to "suggest" what the Cardinal

should do to forestall any possible audience. .

Malone should stress

the highly confidential nature of this matter with the Cardinal, who

is very, friendly to the Bureau, and insure that the Bureau is in no

Malone should also obtain from the Cardinal a commitment that he

will be able to block any attempt by King to gain an audience with

the Pope. If the Cardinal is not able to give such an assurance,

ve must innediately know this so that me may explore some other avenue.

RECOLMENDATION:

Ii approved, Assistant Director lalone should personally

orally brief Francis Cardinal Spellman in accordance with the attached

"Top Secret" summary indicating King's communist connections and

degenerate make-up.

This is the same summary me previously used

In preventing King's receiving an honorary degree from Harquette

University.)

The attached summary should also be used for telephon-

Ically briefing Malone.

This matter should receive most expeditious

handling because of the time element involved.

Through yr. ED FASTINGS, & SAC contact, and a perschal

friend of SAC PPICe, lo. PICE began a most discreet inquiry to

determine where the

Subject and his party vere to be located.

It was discovered that the hotel is booked up so full and has

so rany corratrerts on a continuous basis, that it ordinarily

making individual assignments to guests sho have nade reservations;

thus, it sould know that er a dertain day it would need, for

t by the

possible, the hotel be alloved to follow normal booking procedures.

In the meantime, Ses CLIFFORD and lYlfll proceeded to

establish their identities as tourists in the hotel and its

of which are relatively well known and all of which are equipped

with 2-vay radios.

of switching license plates on one of their cars and

utilizing it on tre special essigarent, but the considered opinion

slip same.

OESEPVATICAS AND PECOVERDATIONS:

(2) No ratter mat its size in population, Horolulu

is basically

a resort stall

town and

all the

Bureau personnel who participated in the investigation agreed

that the Bureau vas extremely wise in designating this operation

to be handled as a special assignert in a semi-undercover

capacity by special tgents fror. ancther territory who were not

snown as Special Agerts i. the Ficnolulu area.

Ine Honclulu Office

and the san francisco lgents are convinced that such an assign-

ment coul not reve beer. carried out with full security by the

Honchulu tgents trerselves because they are too well known in

this comparatively small tour. ?

(2) Flincugh using only five Agents to make technical

technical installations, provide their

own security, conduet discreet nearby fisurs of Subjects and

potential

subjects, and contact ancrymous scurces means that the

manponer is spread

very thin especially where two separate

hotels are involved,

it is believed that the use of an experienced

coordinated special

assigrrent crew mey very well be the best

may to attack this problem.

(3). The SAC and the local FEI Office are indispensable

to the successful speration of such a special

assigrrent. The two big questions that the local SAC has to be

in a position to answer are: (a) Exactly where is the Subject

goin? to le? and (1) Can we get a room next to him? Agents on

special assigment cannot walk in cold in any area, much less

a croided resort area, and accomplish this with full security.

It is recial assignant that me vould have been spared much anxiet

and lasterinute improvisation if the Honolulu SAC could have

been advised in advance,

with utnost security, that he would

be called upon to determine inere the subject was staying

and to obtain adjacent space for the Agents on special assignment.

This is a suggestzon for the Bureau to consider in the event

lit plans future special ass-erments of this sort. This ore

ricrked well due to the excerlence c= the contacts.

(4) The plägits of IV sets in the roca and the

operation of incividual air conditioning

units both uresented a considerable probler which nade sere of

the conversations alrost, ii not completely, unintellig-ale.

These particular Subjects seemed to have a tendercy to turn

in the evenine bours.

Martin Luther King, Jy., President of the Southern

Christian Leadership Conference, injected himself into the

sanitation workers' strike in Yemphis, Tennessee, and the

result of King's.famous espousal of nonviolence was vandalism,

looting, and riot.

•Previously, King involved hinself in this strike,

called for a general

strike, and called for a mass march.

Today he led the mass narch in an-autorobile at the head of

the line. Negroes began shouting "black power". and trouble

began.. King, apparently unable or unwilling to control the

marchers, absented himself from tre scene; window breaking and

looting broke out,

Police officers were forced to use gas to break up

the march and to control the crond. It was necessary to

activate the National Guard. Martin luther King clains his

much-hezalded maich on Washington, scheculed for April 22,

1968, will also be "nonviolent."

he says he has persuaded

militant black nationalists to abandon violent extremism In

Washington, D. C., during the march. Memphis may only be.the

prelude to civil

strife in our Nation's Capitol.

ALESS

Today, March 18th, Congressman John M. Ashbrook (R-Ohio)

who is a member of the House Committee on Internal Security advised

Mr. DeLoach that 30 bills have been introduced into Congress to declare a

holiday on Martin Luther King's birthday, January 15th. Ashbrook further

advised that a bill concerning this matter will soon be voted out of the Sub-

committee on the Judiciary.. In this connection he advised that Congressman

Charles E. Wiggins (R-California) and Byron G. Rogers (D-Colorado),

members of the Subcommittee, will be contacting the Bureau in the near

future to request an "off the record" briefing concerning King. They are in

a position to keep any such bill from being reported out of committee--if,

as stated by Congressman Ashbrook, they realize that King was a scoundrel.

sun Go Rogers

Rogers was born in Texas in 1900. He was U.S.' Attorney for the

District of Colorado 1934-36, and thereafter was Attorney General of the State

• of Colorado. He was elected to the 82nd Congress in 1950 and has been re-

elected to subsequent Congresses:

The Bureau investigated Rogers in 1933 and 1934 in connection

with his appointment as U.S.' Attorney for the District of Colorado and the

investigation was favorable. We have had cordial relations with him since he

has been in Congress.

SUBJECT: DR. ARCHIBALD J. CAREY, JR.

REVEREND MARTIN LUTHER KING

Pursuant to instructions, I saw DI. Carey, who is known to

MI. Tolson and the Director, at 12:30 p. m. today in my office.

.. DI. Carey told me that he knew that time was limited at FBI Headquarter

so he would come right to the point. He stated he had come to see us on behalf of

Martin Luther King. He added that King was in Chicago last weekend and stayed in

Carey's home, and at that time indicated every evidence of great disturbance. King

told Carey he had been reliably informed there was a massive effort to discredit him

by the' Federal Bureau of Investigation. This effort is to begin this week.

.

Carey told me that he wanted to enlist the sympathies of the FBT.In not

letting any effort to discredit King occur. He said he wanted to beg the usage of our

good offices to prevent such an occurrence from happening. He stated he was asking

for our assistance based upon good reasoning. He then mentioned those reasons as:

(1) Reverend King is a good man: (2) Reverend King stands as a "symbol" to the

Negro race today. (3) Reverend King is a "safety valve" at the present time. He

explained this by indicating that Reverend King's articulate voice was preventing more

of the militant and violent Negroes from committing serious acts in the United States..

.

I interrupted DI. Carey at this point and told him he had known us for a

long time and that I felt certain that he knew in his own mind that the FBI had plenty

to do without being responsible for a discrediting campaign against Reverend King.

DI. Carey agreed that he did know us better and stated that he had doubted King's

allegations from the very beginning. I told Carey that Reverend King had criticized

us very unfairly, particularly concerning the background and investigative actions of

our Southern Agents. I briefed Carey very thoroughly on this point. I further told

DI. Carey that King had later denied that he had made such allegations upon having an

appointment in Mr. Hoover's Office.• I told Dr. Carey that the Director had given

Reverend King some very good advice insofar as his moral responsibilities were

concerned.

DeLoach to Mohr Memo, 5/19/65

RE: DI. Archibald J. Carey, JI.

Reverend Martin Luther King

I went into the entire situation with Dr. Carey and told him not only of

the many successes we had enjoyed in this particular field, but also of the dis-

courageinents and humiliations that extremists on both sides attempted to subject us

lattempt to remedy met great interest and indicated that he would be one that would

Dr. Carey called me'at 3:35 p.mi. this afternoon and stated he wanted

to use about ten seconds in mentioning two additional things: (1) He stated that he

shad talked to King telephonically and remonstrated with King about the fact that King

should make a greater effort to praise the FBI for its excellent work inthe civil rights

field. (2) Dr. Carey stated he wanted to be very immodest for a second. He added

that he felt he had done a great deal for the current administration and that despite

the fact that he was the president of a savings and loan association; minister of a large

I Negro church; and head of other business interests, he would still appreciate it if the

Director would say a good word for him to the President. DI. Carey stated he knew

John Macy of the Civil Service Commission very well and felt that Macy would be on

2) is side if any appointment came up. I told DI. Carey that the Director, of course,

regarded him very highly and would naturally keep his request in mind, although it

might be presumptuous for the Director to make such recommendations to the White

House. Dr. Carey stated he could understand this. He again pledged his loyalty

and friendship.

ACTION:

DI. Carey is the third individual that King has had come see us relative

(to requesting that we not expose him. Roy Wilkins, Jim Farmer and Reverend

Abernathy have all been here for the same purpose. It is obvious that King is

becoming very disturbed and worried about his background, else he would not go to

such great efforts to have people approach the FBL. I did not commit the FBI in any

manner insofar as exposing King is concerned. To the contrary, I let Carey flatly

know of King's derelictions insofar as false allegations against us are concerned and

of the fact that King and other civil rights workers owed the FBI a debt of gratitude

they would never be abe to repay. For record purposes.

Well Sand!

As you know, King's "Washington Spring Project" was

originally scheduled for early April, 1968. However, our

The racial conference at the SiG discussed the

reconcended that the facts about the Project be brought to

the attention of possible participants through a rumor campaign.

He would use our informants, without their knowledge, to spread

the story about lack of funds and organization.

Fears of.

econonic reprisal and personal safcty sbould dissuade potential

participants. He would point out also that the Project is

Strichly fOI HARTIN LUTHER KING's benefit which is actually

the case. He thinks he can regain lost prestige by tais

deponstration. Some suggested rumors 10uld consist of.

The participants would be told that their nenes

Possible threats of violence and bodily haru to the

Also information showing that

respect tö:this narch on Washington by outzide negroes.

- The above are a few of the type of rumors that can be

used and you should tie in any rumor of this nature to your local

problem. Also think of other counterintelligence methods and

secure telephoric approval from the bureau prior to utilization.

Wiss Holmes

Pursuant to the Director's instructions, I showed a Miss Gane

the attached report concerning the

engaged in by Dr. King

to Walter Jenkins of the White House this morning at 11:00 a.m.

Jenkins read the entire report word for word. I told him that the Director thought

perhaps the President might like to know about this matter strictly in confidence.

Jenkins stated he would tell the President this afternoon about this incident. He

stated that it certainly opened his eyes and he felt it was one of the most repulsive

incidents that he knew of. I told Jenkins that the Director indicated I should leave

this attachment with him if he desired to let the President personally read it.

Jenkins mentioned that he was sufficiently aware of the facts that he could verbally

padvise the President of the matter. Jenkins was of the opinion that the FBI could

rform a good service to the country if this matter could somehow be confidentially

ven to members of the press. I told him the Director had this in mind, howeyer,

lalso believed we should obtain additional information prior to discussing it with

_certain friends.

Each of the above offices was: to designate a

Specíal Agent to coordinate this progran.

Replies to this

letter indicated an Interest in counterintelligence against

militant black nationalist groups that foment violence. and

several offices outlined procedures which had been effective

In the past.

for example, Washington Field Office had

furnished Information about a new Nation of Islan (NOI)

grade school to appropriate authorities in the District

...o1 Colunbia slio investigated to determine 11 the school

conformed to District regulations for private schools. In

the process IF obtained background information on the parents

of cach pup1l.

....

:.•

• The Revolutionary Action Movement (RAi), a pro-

Chinese connunist group; was active in philadelphia, Pa..

in-the summer

• of 1967.

The Philadelphia Office alerted

local police,

who then put RAl leaders under close scrutiny.

They were arrested in every possible charge until they.could

no longer make bail. As a result, RAll leaders spent nos of the

summer in jail and no violence traceable to Ral took place.

The Counterintclligence Progran is now being

expanded to include 1l otices.

Chicago has carefully reviewed the Nation of Islam (NOI)

By way of background, as the Bureau is aware, KING and

ELIJAH MUHANAD, head of the NOI, met briefly in Chicago during

2/66 under amicable circumstances, primarily as a result of MARTIN

LUTHER KING's then recent entry onto, the Chicago civil rights scene

The meeting produced no tangible results insofar as cooperation,

unity or program was concerned, however, did receive considerable

local publicity.

The meeting was basically for the purpose of

showing unity within the Negro community.

the white man.

in reaction to these remarks publicly,

KING

glossed over this criticism and to some degree capitalized on it,

indicating that in his efforts to build unified support for the

cause of the Negro, he was in contact with all segments of Negro .

opinion. Indeed, as recently as 8/67, MUHAMMAD indicated a desire

to again meet with KING to discuss the unity of the Negro.

As the Bureau and Atlanta are aware, KING and CASSIUS

CLAY were in personal contact in louisville, Kentucky, in 5/67,

In the course of open housing demonstrations held under StIC

auspices. A Chicago NOI source has advised that the meeting was

not pre-arranged, but resuited irom the fact that both KiNG and

CLAY were in Louisville at the same time: HERBERT MUHAMAD, SOn

of ELIJAH,, desired to enlist KING's support for CLAY in his

resistance

to the draft and arrarged this meeting, which was

characterized

as full of joking and horseplay.

In subsequent newspaper publicity concerning this meetings.

KING was quoted as having praised CLAY for his refusal to be

inducted into the armed forces, coupling this reference to attacks

on our policy in Vietnam. The NOI publication "Muhamnad Speaks"

was one of the papers which contained KING's favorable remarks,

including a comment that Clay had given up 51,000, 000 In order

to stand up for what his conscience dictated as right.

In short it would appear generally to be true that

contact between KING and the NOl is not a heretofore unknown happening

and it would appear that any effort to utilize this situation in

Baltinxe nust indicate more than casual associations or contacts,

but: In order to embarnass or inhibit WS? efforts should indicate

close working relationship or partnenship between the two groups.

It should be kept in mind also, however, that as the

above sources note, although CLAY is nationally known for his

adherance to the NOI, he is also somewhat universally acclaimed

and embraced by most groups within the Black Nationalist Movement,

CORE and SACC as examples, as well as the black community generally

and has achieved somewhat the status of a mortyred black folk hero.

As the Bureau is aware;

ELLIAR MUHAMAD has publicly

stated that the white man has given him a million dollars worth

of. free publicity. This comment was specifically prompted by a

television series about MUHANUAD,and the NOI which had nation-wide

exposure, as well as being generatly a ratleation of constant intimat

stated that HUrAllAD has been openly upset over a period of such

lack of publicity, given him and his organization by the white

It would appear, thereiafe, that any aisruption progran

as envisioned would in all probability, have no real éffect on the

NOI and the most that would be forthcoming from ELIJAH AUHANAD

or one of his spokesmen tould be a simple denial of such support

for the lSP.

"Wuhammad Speaks" is one of the principal sources

of finance for the NOI and its presence in WSP offices in Baltimore

is believed a reflection of NOI diligence in assuring wide-spread

circulation of this paper and would not in any way embarrass or

compromise 'the NOI.

of the Bureau and other offices interested in this matter.

This lanzuage alnost suggests some degree

I have considered this matter, discussed 1t with

appropriate agent and supervisory personnel of the Mobile

move on KING's Washington Spring Project.

KiNG has quite a following in and around the Selma,

Ala. area and has appeared recently in Selma on one occasion

at the church of Reverend I. I. ANDERSON, who, at the time of

KING's appearance, was running

for mayor of Selma.

ANDERSON

was tentatively endorsed by KING and was subsequently defeated

in his race for mayor of Selma.

Reverend FREDERICK DOUGLAS REESE, who 1s head of

the Dallas County Voters League and 1s quite influential among

the Negro community in the selma area, did not endorse ANDERSON

Ior mayor and informed sources indicate he more oraless con-

cributed to the defeat of ANDeRSoN.

REESE has been known to

make derogatory remarks concerning KING and was allegedly

miffed that KING did not advise him, REESE, of his, KING's,

contemplated visit to Selma.

In view of the above,

wide targets:

I. SOUTHERN CHRISTIAN LEADERSHIP

CONFERENCE (SCLC)

MARTIN LUTHER KING

A. KING has changed the date of his

Washington Spring Project (WSP) on several occasions;

he has, on occasion, announced his anticipated presence

at various locations, and then send a top aide instead

of appearing himself; he has periodically changed the

dates of his appearances in certain geographic areas.

Many times, announcements were made when KING was to be

at a specific WSP meeting in order to draw a crowd, when

actually it was known in advance by KING that he would

not attend.

JN 100-980

It Is felt the above considerations can

be exploited to cause confusion in the efforts of KING

and his group, and to cause Negro dissatisfaction with

his operating procedures.

This could be accomplished

by the following:

1) When KING is actually to

be at a gathering, have informants circulate false in-

formation as to time, date and location of KING's ap-

pearance, or variations of each, i.e., correct time and

place, but different location, correct location, but

different date, et cetera.

2) Have informants circulate

information that KING is to be at announced local meet-

Ings of SCLC groups when, in fact, he will not be present.

• 3) Announce, through informant,

when KING is to 'be at specific place, that this is only a

guise to draw a crowd, and only local leaders will be

present, excluding KING.

B. KING and his top aides dress expen-

sively, generally travel via first class means, and

stay at first class accommodations usually in predomi-

nately white areas of cities he visits. Recently, in

Memphis, KING ran from his followers when violence erupted

during a march he was leading there. It is felt the above

two considerations could be linked to discredit KING and

his aides with poor Negroes who he is seeking support from.

This could be accomplished by the preparation of a flyer

showing photographs of KING and aides dressed well, next

to photographs of Negroes poorly clothed; under the photo-

graph would be data concerning his expensive tates, ac-

conmodations, use of private airplane, and related data;

with this infornation would be information concerning

2

HH 55070 DocId:32989755 Page 935

---

## Page 936

JN 100-980

KING's deserting his followers during the Memphis riots.

The key note message would be that KING and his aides

are out for their own financial and physical welfare

primarily. Flyers could be prepared from newspaper

photographs of KING and his aides, or from some photo-

graphs available at various field offices. Distribution

could be by anonymous mailings to poor Negro leaders, :

or by placement of copies at Negro meeting places by

Informants.

II. STUDENT NON-VIOLENT COORDINATING

COMMITTEE (SNCC)

This group has discouraged its members

from associating with whites. Information has been de-

veloped that some leaders and top functionaries, since

the establishment of this policy; have periodically

maintained close associations, to include residing with

white girl friends. Information concerning these asso-

ciations could be capitalized on by counterintelligence

measures to show the hypocrisy of these leaders and to

discredit the individuals involved with their new "Black

only" oriented associates in the same organization, and

to discredit them with leaders of other Black Nationalist

organizations withhhom they may be seeking support or

rapport.

Specifically, efforts could be undertaken

to obtain photographs of the principals involved wịth

their white girl friends. The flyer could then be pre-

pared containing this photograph or photographs. Under

the photograph could be information regarding the princi-

pals' position with SNCC, followed by quotations of top

SNCC leaders regarding associations with whites or

Black Separatists statements. The flyers could be mailed.

anonymously to pertinent National and local leaders of

SNCC and/or to leaders of other Black Nationalist organiza-

tions advocating Black separatism, rather than simply

by

dissident group of top officials headed by Clay Blair, JI., Editor in Chief of "The

‹ year Senior Vice President in charge of the magazine division. In a nutshell,

Blair and Kantor have been fired; Normar fitter, Assistant Managing Editor, and

who has been actively looking for a top executive to assist him in running the afiairs

I Curtis for sometime, resigned as President while retaining his job as Chairman

i the Boara. It is expected that a new President will be named soon.

- . .

This top management revolt, which has been brewing for some months,

rupted openly during the early part of October when the press reported that fifteen

• officials in a letter to the Board of Directors accused Culligan of mismanagement.

at the present time, it appears that Culligan has retained the confidence of the Board

I Directors, has seized the initiative, and is making a thorough house cleaning.

Culligan has been a good triend of the Director and the Bureau for

•number of years. He has demonstrated his support and admiration on numerous

ccasions and has been most cooperative with us. It was he who offered to feature

lead article in a May issue of the "Post" concerning the Director's 40th Anniversary,

vith a photograph of Mr. Hoover on the cover.

Earlier, through Culligan, we

quelched the unfavorable article against the Bureau being written by free-lance

riter, Dan J. Marlowe, submitted to the "Post" concerning our investigation of

russbaum and Wilcoxson. More recently, through Culligan, we postponed publication

n the "Post" of an article based upon the assault of our Agent Foley in New York by

ne Lombardozzi family. Early in 1964, we received word of an article being

rublished in the "Post"' by Martin Luther King. Through Culligan, we forestalled

ublication of this article. More recently, with the Director's approval, I

ontacted Culligan on September 22, 1964,

concerning another article our sources

Culligan has

ivised that a contract did exist with King for the "Post" article and that the

ecalcitrant group within Curtis had insisted that publication of it be carried through

ecause of King's recent Nobel Peace Prize. Although he was completely sympathetic

pointed out that we should feel free to call upon him in the future if there is any

ay in which he can be of help to the Bureau. Culligan advised that the King article

as scheduled for early publication sometime after election.

In connection with this "Post" article by King, our sources have

dicated that since he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he has attempted through

one of his associates to change the "Post" article in an effort to soften criticism

ade by him against other civil rights groups and leaders. King feared that such

iticism would cause difficulties in the civil rights movement. The "Post"' however,

is resisted King's efforts to make these changes.

then thiS:

that, while there is connunist influence being exerted on Negroes

This historically has been the position of the Bureau

in this matter in light of file reviews going back ten to twenty

The Historical Position:

For example, in a detailed docuent prepared on Concurist.

Party and the Negro in 1953, we lind the statoront referring to "Che

"si)ste of the communist Party to attract croz a chanilicunt nundeï

of liegroes 1n the United States to 1ts nurjer."

Another exauple is

to bo found in as analysis 1s this same field prepared by the Bureas

1955 to the effect that communist efforts have been "unsuccessivi

¿, a state of national level" 1n infll&cating "legitivate legro-

fraternal, protest and improvement organizatious," although they race

Ited success in some "isolated chapters."

The Director's book,

Lasters of Deceit, published iI 1958, states: "It becane obvious

That the farty,

despite great efforts, had failed to win over ever

a Significant minority of legroes." In 1960 the Director's stateseri

to The Committee on the Judiciary. United States Serate, reads:

"It is no secret that one of the bitterest disapponiments of

comnunistic efforts in this Nation bas been their failure to lure

our kegro citizeus into the Party." In 1952 sinilar public statesents:

were made.

On page seven of the Brief subaitted to the Director

under the date of August 23, 1963,

this historical position ras

restzted and it was said, "One of the bitterest disappointments of

the communisis bas been their single failure to lure any significant

number of our legro citizens into the Party." This statement mas

set forth again in the cover menorandum which the Director marked.

Mr. Belmont's memorandum of November 26, l9c2, reflected the

Rev. King does not have a phone at his residence. We then attempted to

The further stated that Pev. King preferrea not to be disturbed and that it would be

That same day I called the S'C at Atianta and instructed

AC Atlanta advised the foilowing day, November 23, that Rev. King had left

noring around the country. The secretary further advised the SAC that Rev. King

sould call us wien he was willing to sit down for an interview. Rev. King has not

RE: RACIAL SITUATION

Howard Zinn, the author of the report for the Southern Regional

Council, was mentioned in my memorandum 1l/15/62 and has been the subject

of a security investigation by this Burezu (100-360217). Zin was reportedly

a member of the CP from 1949 through 1953 and attended CP meetings during

that period. Zinn is a history proiessor at Spellman College in Atlanta It

was the second slanted and biased document written by Zinn on the Albany

situation.

Reverend Mr. King is the President of the Southern Christian

Leadership Conference who zrose to prominence during the 1955 - 1956

successful boycott which ended bus segregation in Montgomery, Alacama.

He has been active in Negro segregation matters since that time.

advised that on the afternoon of that date

Clarence Jones, a member of the Labor Youth League in 1954 (a cited organization)

and Levison were discussing burning of churches in the South, both expressed the

opinion that King should not be silent in this matter but should send a hot wire to :

"Kennedy" expressing his indigance at the Government's failure to control one

small community. This was furnished to the Attorney General on 9/11/62.

RECOMMENDATION:

Consideration has been given to contacting King to straighten him out;

however, this seems undesirable in view of the above facts and it is recommended

he not be contacted.

The hackgrnund informe fion regarding King, Levison and Zion has

been iurnished to the Department.

Nothing would seem to be gained by contacting the "New York Times"

or the "Atlanta Constitution" as we obviously cannot give them background data

we possess on the CP intluence of King. (Q) U

The Department and the Attorney General have been publicly

criticized on many occasions by King and yet they are cooperating with him.

It is recommended that the Liaison Section of the Domestic Intelligence

He was shot by a policetan while Tooting a grocery

Tines added that a preliminary count of avallable

Arrest tickets, which is definitely not a complete list,

Indicates that at least ten Negroes arrested had pistols

or revolvers on their persons and that numerous others

had other lethal peapons such as knives.

Lieutenat Arkin advised that at approximately 1:20

P.t., Harch 28, 1968, the lemphis Transit Authority which

operates the Hemphis City Bus Systes, after receiving nunerous

complaints fron its bus drivers that they feared for their

personal well being due to the disorder, coupled with the .

fact that many of them had been individually robbed in the

past, decided as & safety measure to stop the novement of

City Buses for the remainder of Harch 28, 1968.

The Hemphis 'Commercial Appeal" Newspaper, issue of

BIch 4, 1968, in & front-page story, by an unidentitie

writer, reported that many of the looters and window breakers

vere black power advocates, and that several wore jackets of

the "Invaders," a local black power group.

This story did

not give any basis for its statement to this effect.

On March 28 and 29, 1968, source one and source

follovers have put the word "Invaders" on their jackets but

that many high school age students have done this for effect

and are not recessarily affiliated with the BOP novement.

Sources one and two, along with Arkin, added that

thus far there is so evidence

that any of the BOP group

participated in the looting and in fact source one who is

particularly close to this group advised that he say wany

that as sentioned heroinbefore thess individuals had

his conversations mith nuberous Negroes tho observed

their actions, that the looting sas not organized as such.

WFO 157-1292

In regard to SNCC, WFO is probing for weaknesses which

may be uncovered through sources in endeavoring to ascertain the

identity of individuals who may be dissatisfied because of

personality clashes and/or those who may be disenchanted with

volunteer services for SNCC and have sought a salary; and those

who may be suspect of "working for the man", 1. e., suspect of

being an informer.

In regard to STOKELY CARMICHAEL, WO has carefully - •

considered him from a counterintelligence standpoint since his

sedition investigation has been under active consideration from

a prosecutive standpoint, and it was felt that a similtaneous

counterintelligence program if operational against CARMICHAEL

might tend to aggravate possible future prosecution and possibly

lead to embarrassment.

WFO feels that a positive counterintelli-

gence program would be warranted against CARMICHAEL, especially

in the absence of any prosecutive action against him. In

assessing CARMICHAEL for potential counterintelligence, HO has

concluded that to be effective, such a program must discredit

him in the Negro community where he enjoys considerable popu-

larity, and would seemingly have to be stronger than alleged immoral

or un-American political inclinations.

Concerning the Southern Christian Leadership Conference

(SCIC) and the Washington Spring Project (WSP) office in HDC,

sources who are familiar with SCLC operations have been instructed

to l00k for opportunities to plant seeds of discontent and

dissension between the SCLC and the American Friends Service

Committee (AFSC) workers there, particularly in the realm of

funds; and to give rise to runors that KING seems to be getting

the lion's share of the funds, whereas the AFSC and the poor

people who are to participate are getting little or nothing

in the way of financial aid. It has been developed that WSP

recruiter J. I. JOHNSON; since transferred, was at the center

of a controversy concerning dissension in the office. WO is

in the process of developing further plans exploiting this

dissension.

• With regard to MARTIN LUTHER KING, HFO will continue

to be alert for all possibilities to secure information of value

in counterintelligence and for use in the program. It is felt,

however, that the office of origin in this matter is in a better

position to fully evaluate and be aware of possibilities to

exploit in this program.

There is no organized Revolutionary Action Movement

(RAM) activity in the WDC area which has risen to the surface;

however, in the event any situation should arise which would

lend itself to a counterintelligence move, steps will be taken

to fully pursue that matter.

A source has advised that the Congress of Racial

Equality (CORE) is not currently active in WDC; that it has

no organizational structure or planned progran of activity.

CORE has held no. meetings in the past year.

WO is also looking for opportunities to develop

positive information concerning H. RAP BROWN in this area in

order to possibly effect a workable counterintelligence operation.

5) As noted above, WFO will continue to exploit all

possibilities and opportunities to institute a successful

counterintelligence program on the mentioned targets and upon

the formulation of a specific plan on any particular organiza-

tion or individual, will submit same by separate letter for

the Bureau's approval.

With reference to Bulets of 3/18/68 and 4/2/68, in

the above caption outlining counterintelligence situations

with reference to SNCC and the Black United Front, these matters

will be taken up by separate letters to the Bureau.
