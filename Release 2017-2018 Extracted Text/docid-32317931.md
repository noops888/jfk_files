Re Seattle airtel to the Director, 1/5/77. 1

For information, during the early morning hours

of January 17, 1977, former SE 2434-PC attempted to commit

suicide by taking a combination of drugs and alcohol. Accord-

ing to the physician in charge of the emergency room where

the source was taken,

there is a 90 percent chance that the

source will die and if he does not die, it is probable that

he will have brain damage and will exist as a vegetable.

The suicide note left by the source indicated that he was in

fear of his nieces and nephews being harmed by the information

that he had and thus he felt it would be better to do himself

in than to have his relatives harmed.

The existence of a

suicide note is not common knowledge

at this point.

The above is for information purposes inasmuch as

extensive news media inquiries are being received due to the

notariety of the source.
