During August 1967

1co City survellance

informants MEX 42 and MEX 19646

stinued to make spot sur-

veillances in Cuernavaca at Rancho Tetela, the golt club, and

tourist centers with negative results.

Mr. HARRY. WRIGHT advised

that he had discreetly

and confidentially alerted a long-time friend of his who is

retired and who plays golf daily at Cuernavaca to the possibility

of subject's presence at the golf club there.

He said that

this individual is FRAINE/RHUBERRy whom he has known for

many years as an extremely responsible and reliable individual.

RHUBERRY is the former head of General Motors de Mexico and

is Mr. WRIGHT's neighbor (c)He is to immediately notify Mr.

MEXICO

WRIGHT or this office if he öbserves subject in

Cuernavaca

and is to take no further action in the matter.

On August 10, 1967, MEX 170, who has furnished

reliable information in the past, advised that there is

an

excellent possibility of securing long distance toll calls

from telephone 2-61-75 in Cuernavaca.

Mexican Immigration continues

to express interest

in the whereabouts and activities of the subject.

On August

14, 1967, Attorney JORGE VAZQUEZ ROBLES, Chief, Inspection

Service, Mexican

Immigration,

and a vital contact of this

office,

inquired as to the subject's whereabouts.

advised that we had no intormation at this time as to sub-

ject's exact whereabouts.

He was curious to know the results

of the information previously furnished by him indicati

that subject was traveling in the Mediterranean area

It is not believed that (Mexican Immigration will

take any affirmative action in this matter without consulting

this office.

However, high governmental

officials have fo

expressed interest in subject, and such interest may lead

precipitated action without advance notice to this office le

It is conjectured that subject's attorney has probably

offered substantial gratuities

at a fairly high level in

this matter, and the effects of such action cannot be foreseen.
