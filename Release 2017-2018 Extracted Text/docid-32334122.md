the Miami Office, advised that he was in contact with the

Security Officers in the BWI and although not positive,

NASSAU

-was probably .CARb

-Nassau, Security and Police officer, and had also done some

work for U. S. Customs in 1958 in the Miami area. CRASWELLER

said that he had no information re the DR. (QD(S)

On 9/17/59, CARI STEWART appeared voluntarily at

the Miami Office and

advised that he had furnished information

to U. S. Customs, Miami, concerning activities of the DR in

1958 and that he, STEWART, had been given a membership card

in the DR by LUIS BLANCA (DR-delegate abroad 1958). STEWART

stated that he helped Customs with understanding on his part

at least that his relatives in Israel would be assisted to

enter this country. After working awhile he found that he

had been mistaken in his assumption. He stated that he was

unable to get along with Customs and went to Nassau area where

he worked for MAURICE HILL (above mentioned) who is arranging

for help for STEWART's relatives to enter Nassau area. STEWART

stated that' he had furnished considerable information to HILL

about activities which were probably going on in Miami area.

However,

when he was specifically questioned for details,

names, places, etc., as to what was "going on" he was unable

to produce. (U)

In this respect it should be noted that SHANLEY

advised that STEWART had begun to furnish them with information

in 1958 but was not susceptible to direction and in SHANLEY's

opinion did not furnish complete information concerning the

matters

in question and when asked for specific instances to

back up information became vague on names of people and exact

times, although he did cooperate with Customs for awhile (e)

It was SHANLEY's confidential opinion that STEWART

evila run derRaguthority an order to proteck himself and

in Miami who is known to Customs and who is not involved

in any illegal activities, according

to SHANLEY.

SHANLEY stated confidentially that KEITH HEATON

is furnishing information to U. S. Customs on matters of

interest to that agency.

LEM POMEROY is personally known to SA CHARLES W.

EDMISTON of the Miami Office, and is not known to be engaged

in any illegal activities.

The Miami Office has pending cases on ROLANDO

ARCADIO MASFERRER ROJAS (Miami file 2-156) and PRUDENCIO

DUENAS ROBERT (Miami file 105-2027) IS-CUBA, and their

activities are being reported under those titles.

On 9/29/59, FRANK PEREZ PEREZ (protect), 1044 NW

2nd Street, Miami, who has furnished some reliable information

in the past and who is in contact with MASFERRER, stated that

he knows of no reactivation of the DR, MASFERRER is not™

connected with the DR and MASFERRER is not referred to as

General.

*On 12/3/59, MM 639-S advised/that he has no infon-

mation which would indicate that the DR has become reactivated

in Miami. &

The Miami Office has received no information which

would indicate that the DR has become active in the Miami

area at any time since the fall of BATISTA on 1/1/59.

It is pointed out that on occasion individuals

who

mention the Dominican Republic refer to it as the "DR."

is possible that one set of initials could he confused with

the other giving rise for example to mistaken impression

that the Directorio Revolucionario was behind the attempted

exportation of arms in May, 1959, in which individuals

connected with the Dominican Republic were arrested in Miami

attempting to fly arms out of the U. S. illegally.
