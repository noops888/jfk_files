MEMORANDUM FOR: DCD/OSG/OSS

ATTENTION

[raig Hale]

SUBJECT

:

Gordon Michael Duane Novel

REFERENCE : HH-27696, 10 Deceliber 1975

1. I have reviewed the allegations in reference that the

British, either British military or British intelligence (other-

wise not further specified), have cutfitted a converted World

War Il Liberty ship as a floating display case for British

military hardware.

I have further checked out the bizarre story

in paragraphs two and three of reference concerning use of the

British

ship by MI-6.

2. This office has absolutely no information to substantiate

the story told in reference and Africa Division also has no

corroborating information.

In short, I consider the story developed in paragraphs

two and three of reference highly suspect since I do not believe

the British would be able to mount such an operation without it

coming to the attention of this office.

RECORD

SUBJECT: Gordon Novel

1. Mr. Peter Houck resident officer for DCD in New Orleans,

telephoned to say that additional problems regarding Gordon Novel

had arisen and Mr. Houck requested that I call the Assistant U.S.

Attorney, Mr. Al Winters, telephone No. (AC 504) 589-2921. On

16 March I called Mr. Winters and he told me that Novel had posted

$40,000 bond and had been charged with possession of a destructive

device. However, as they investigated the case there seemed to be

more evidence of a conspiracy with other business associates of Gordon

Novel, particularly with regard to acquisition of fairly sizable parcels

of land in downtown New Orleans including land in the French Quarter.

Mr. Winters indicated that his office was beginning to collect evidence

of suspicious fires which had occurred on some of this property. Mr.

Winters estimated that the earliest trial date for Gordon Novel would be

late May or early June.

2. Mr. Winters asked that Mr. Houch not discuss the case with

Gordon Novel or any of his attorneys. Obviously, Mr. Winters is

concerned that such discussions could lead to "Jencks material"! and

I assured him that it was the Agency position that we did not want Mr.

Houck talking to any of the defendants or their counsel unless &

representative of the U.S. Attorney's Office was present.

3. It would appear at this time that Gordon Novel may subpoena

Peter Houck as a witness at which time Mr. Houch can deny the Agency's

approval of Novel's proposal "Project Morningstar.". A second possibility

is that CIA would have to provide a witness from the Office of Personnel

to show that Mr. Novel was never employed by CIA.

4.. On March 16, I called Mr. Houck and explained to him Mr. Winters'

request that he not talk to any lawyers or defendants and Mr. Houck readily

agreed to comply with this request and said that he would immediately call

Mr. Winters if any attempts were made to interview him.
