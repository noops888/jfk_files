Detective Chief Superintendent

The purpose of this report is that a request

be made

to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, via

Mr W. Kisch their representative at the Embassy of the

United States of America, for certain confidential

enquiries to be made relative to a contract murder

committed in this Country on 8th September, 1975.

Briefly, the details of the above are that

at approximately 5.15 Pal. on the day in question,

Mrs Beatrico (aiday) COLD, agod 17 years, was in the

basement office of her business premises situated at

361 Goswell Road, London, when she received fatal

gunshot wounds to the head and body.

Enquiries commenced and as a result

the following tio persons were arrested and charged

with murder :-

(a) •Errol Clive LEIBNER, born 16th June 1945...

La Capetown, south Africa, a painter and

decorator by trade, residing at 78 Letourel

Wa 115, Bow, London, and y

many years and up to the time of

his arrest

was residing. at 168, Rowley. Gardens, Harringay

and supplied the gun.

Both defendants have made verbal and written

adnissions of their guilt and have quite clearly stated

this was a contract murder, however, Rossi will not

and, it would appear, leibner cannot, name those who

wished

this woman's death and paid the £20,000 shared

between

the above two men for the murder, and despite

intense investigation this aspect remains unresolved.

?. In an endeavour to discover the background of

the defendants and their associates details have been

uncovered in respect of American contacts as follows: -

number FLA 33130) and Michaci WILLin of

2899 Collius Avenue, Miami Beach, Florida,

came to England and stayed at the Hilton

Slotel, Paris Iano, london. During this period

they came into contact with Rossi, and the

three men visited Ireland and purchased a number

of greyhounds for shipment to Florida.

(b)

It would appear that Rossi either knew De Marco

and Miller from past visits he made to America

or 6th February, 1966, and later, on 8th March,

1971, bearing a British Citizens passport number

40203 issued in London on 28th January, 1966,

in the name of Roberto FAUZZA, or the contact:

It would be

of great assistance if confidential

enquiries could be made in the U.S.A with a view to

ascertaining details of the antecedents, associates,

mode of life etc. of De Marco, Miller and Cellini

and, if possible,

the particulars of those with whon

the De Marco's travelled to England in August, 1975.
