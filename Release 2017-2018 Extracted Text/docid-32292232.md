Re Bureau letter dated 9/22/61.

In view of the important position in the criminal

organization in Chicago held by LESLIE EARL KRUSE, Aka.

LESTER KRUSE,

CG file 92-1037, and considering his close

association with various Chicago hoodlums Chicago recently

instituted investigation of KRUSE under the Criminal

Intelligence Program.

Although it is true KRUSE meets other top hoodlums

frequently, as of this time it has not been determined that a

regular meeting place is used.

KRUSE and others have been

observed in the basement restaurant of the Pittsfield Build-

ing in Chicago, but they utilize different tables and this

location would

not be considered feasible for the establish-

ment of highly confidential coverage on KRUSE at this time.

Inasmuch as Chicago investigation on KRUSE has just

been initiated, it is possible that his activities will

indicate a desirable location in which a highly confidential

source may be placed.

It is noted that CG 6443-C, an extremely valuable

REC- 47.
