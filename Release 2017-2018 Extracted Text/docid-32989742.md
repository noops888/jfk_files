information furnished by the Committee.

DETAILS: By letter dated 9-26-78 (attached) to the Attorney General,

Attention: Judge Webster, G. Robert Blakey, Chier Counsel and Director of

captioned Committee stated that the Committee furnished information to the

Bureau concerning "possible physical harm" to two Committee witnesses

and information regarding the planning of a bank robbery. He alleged

that during the course of the Bureau's interviews with Oliver Patterson, Jr.,.

and Clarence Haynes they were advised that the Committee was the source

of the information furnished about them.

The letter from the Committee

states that Patterson alleges that he was told by the Special Agents

interviewing him that the Committee was the source of the information

that Clarence Haynes was also in danger. The Committee further

alleged that contacts were made with media representatives by the FBI

stating that the Committee was the source of the information furnished and

regarded the information as frivolous.

It is to be noted that the Committee advised Patterson that the

Bureau would contact him prior to his

Mr. Blakey believes

GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON was contacted at his home,

Route 2, Box 179, Walla Walla, Washington (509-525-2126),

where he is living under the assumed name of ALEX P.

BORMANN and employed by the Boise Cascade Company.

EDMONDSON was advised of the Bureau policy requiring

its own Waiver for the release of information and that such a

Waiver would authorize the Bureau to release all information

concerning him, even that which had previously been considered

confidential. EDMONDSON

acknowledged that he understood the

Bureau policy and specifically stated that it was his under-

standing that his 1959 confidential FBI file would be released

to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, if so requested.

EDMONDSON also expressed concern that the House Select

Committee on Assassinations would not be able to maintain proper.

control of. the information in his file, pointing out that

investigators for the Committee, to whom he has spoken, appear

little young and lacking in experience. EDMONDSON

stated, however, that he would continue cooperate with the

Committee, and executed the following Waiver authorizing

"AUTHORITY TO RELEASE INFORMATION

"I hereby authorize any Special Agent or other

authorized representative of the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation bearing this release, to furnish to the House Select

October 3, 1978

I, JAMES T. MC MANUS, having been duly sworn by

Special Agent in Charge EDWARD D. HEGARTY, make the following

I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and have been employed in that capacity since

October 17, 1977.

On August 2, 1978, Special Agent PAUL BABUCHNA, JI.

requested that I accompany him on covering a lead of his

in

Granite City, Illinois.

SA BABUCHNA told me that he was

telephonically contacted by Supervisor EMMETT A. SCHMITT

and that Supervisor SCHMITT requested that he, along with

another agent, was to expeditiously contact CLARENCE HAYNES

at the Kirkpatrick Homes in Granite City, Illinois.

SA

BABUCHNA told me he was to inform HAYNES

that his life might

be in danger.

Being a high crime area, SA BABUCHNA requested

that I accompany him in case any trouble developed.

While accompanied by United States Parole Officer

(USPO) JAMES PARKER, SA PAUL BABUCHNA, Jr. and I contacted

CLARENCE HAYNES at 4205 Kirkpatrick Homes, Granite City,

Illinois. SA BABUCHNA told HAYNES that as a result of

his

(HAYNES) testimony before the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) there was a possibility that he would be

"hit".

HAYNES stated he never testified before the HSCA but

he was interviewed by PETE BAETZ, an investigator for that

Committee.

SA BABUCHNA then questioned HAYNES in regard to who

would want to "hit" him and HAYNES responded that he did not

know who would want to kill him.

Shortly thereafter, SA BABUCHNA and I proceeded to

the Granite City Police Department and contacted Detective

ANTHONY ECK.

Detective ECK was advised by SA BABUCHNA of

the possibility that HAYNES would be "hit".

At no time did I discuss the above matter with anyone

except SA BABUCHNA and USPO PARKER. More specifically, I never

discussed the above matter with any representative of the news

media. I never mentioned the name "PATTERSON" to CLARENCE HAYNES

and I have no recollection of hearing SA BABUCHNA mention that

name to HAYNES.

October 3, 1978

I, JAMES T. MC MANUS, having been duly sworn by

Special Agent in Charge EDWARD D. HEGARTY, make the following

statement:

I am a Special Agent of the lederal Bureau of

Investigation and have been employed in that capacity since

October 17, 1977.

On August 2, 1978, Special Agent PAUL BABUCHNA, JX.

requested that I accompany him on covering a lead of his

Granite City, Illinois.

SA BABUCHNA told me that he was

telephonically contacted by Supervisor EMMETT A. SCHMITT

and that Supervisor SCHMITT requested that he, along with

another agent, was to expeditiously contact CLARENCE HAYNES

at the Kirkpatrick Homes in Granite City, Illinois. SA

BABUCHNA told me he was to inform HAYNES

that his life might

be in danger.

Being a high crime area, SA BABUCHINA requested

that I accompany him in case any trouble developed.

While accompanied by United States Parole Officer

(USPO) JAMES PARKER, SA PAUL, BABUCHNA, JI. and I contacted

CLARENCE HAYNES at 4205 Kirkpatrick Homes, Granite City,

Illinois. SA BABUCHNA told HAYNES that as a result of

his

(HAYNES) testimony before the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) there was a possibility that he would be

"hit",

HAYNES stated he never testified before the HSCA but

he was interviewed by PETE BAETZ, an investigator for that

Committee.

SA BABUCHNA then questioned HAYNES in regard to who

would want to "hit" him and HAYNES responded that he did not

know who would want to kill him.

Shortly thereafter, SA BABUCHNA and I proceeded to

the Granite City Police Department and contacted Detective

ANTHONY ECK. Detective ECK was advised by SA BABUCENA of

the possibility that HAYNES would be "hit",

At no time did I discuss the above matter with anyone

except SA BABUCHNA and USPO PARKER. More specifically, I never

discussed the above matter with any representative of the news

media. I never mentioned the name "PATTERSON" to CLARENCE HAYNES

and I have no recollection of hearing SA BABUCHNA mention that

name to HAYNES.

• BAREN

On August 2, 1978, I received a telephone call from

SCHMITT directed

to contact CLARENCE HAYNES, Granite City,

Illinois, since his life could possibly be in danger.

Special Agent JAMES T. MC MANUS and I contacted U. S.

Probation Officer (USPO) JAMES PARKER at his residence in

Granite City, Illinois, in an attempt to determine the whereabouts

Of HAYNES.

At this point in time PARKER was apprised of the

possible threat against HAYNES.

USPO PARKER accompanied interviewing agents and pointed

out the residence of CLARENCE HAYNES, 4205 Kirkpatrick Homes,

Granite City, Illinois. Agents attempted to contact HAYNES at

his residence with no response.

Neighbors in the immediate

vicinity of the HAYNES residence advised HAYNES was at his

residence.

PARKER knocked on the residence door and verbally

identified himself. The door opened shortly afterwards and

HAYNES

acknowledged PARKER and PARKER in turn acknowledged HAYNES.

On August 4, 1978, at T p.m., CDT, interviewing agents

identified themselves to CLARENCE EDGAR HAYNES, 4205 Kirkpatrick

Homes, Granite City, Illinois, by a display of

credentials. I

advised HAYNES that

there might be some sort of retaliation taken

against him (HAYNES) in the form of a "hit" against his life due

to his testimony before the House Select Committee on Assassinations

(HSCA), Washington, D. C. HAYNES advised he did not appear or

testify before the HSCA,

Washington, D. C. HAYNES advised he was

interviewed by one CONRAD "PETE" BAETZ, former Madison County

Deputy sherill, currently associated with the hucA, washington,

D. C., and he (HAYNES) has not talked with anyone since that

time.

HAYNES advised he related to BAETZ that he (HAYNES) and

JOHN RAY robbed several banks years ago and split the bank

robbery loot. HAYNES advised BAETZ that he (HAYNES) has not seen

RAY since he (HAYNES) was sent to the penitentiary. HAYNES

advised he has not received a request to testify before the

HSCA or any other group. HAYNES advised he is unemployed and

drawing Social Security.

HAYNES was again advised at this time that some sort

of retaliation might be taken against him due to the interview

with CONRAD "PETE" BAETZ and JOHN RAY's parole revocation;

also that the FBI could not protect him.

HAYNES advised he

did not know who would make a "hit" on him, however, he did

not trust one ROBERT "BOB" MC QUIRE (phonetic) who shot his

(MC QUIRE) best friend and was sent to the Missouri State

Penitentiary, Jefferson City, Missouri. HAYNES advised he has

not seen MC QUIRE for eight years.

During the course of the interview with CLARENCE

HAYNES there was one other individual in attendance at the

residence. This was a 10-year old girl visiting CLARENCE HAYNES.

On August 2, 1978, at 7:40 p.m., CDT, Lt. ALBERT DIAK,

Patrol Division, and at 7:55 p.m., CDT, Detective ANTHONY ECK,

Granite City, Illinois, Police Department, were apprised of

the above situation.

At no time since the interview with CLARENCE HAYNES

has interviewing agent discussed this matter with anyone with

the exception of Special Agent JAMES T. MC MANUS and USPO PARKER;

nor has interviewing agent discussed this matter with the news

media.

At no time during the course of the interview with

HAYNES was the HSCA identified as the source of the information.

During the course of the interview HAYNES was asked

If he knew one OLIVER PATTERSON, Jr., St. Louis, Missouri.

HAYNES indicated that he did not

and no further questions were

asked regarding PATTERSON.

PATTERSON's name was mentioned to

HAYNES in an attempt to determine a common bond (connection)

between HAYNES and PATTERSON in an attempt to determine or

develop a suspect in this matter.

Upon sworn oath, this statement is true and correct

to the best of my knowledge and belief.

I am a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of

Investigation (IBI), St. Louis Division, St. Louis, Missouri.

On August 2, 1978, along with Special Agent Dennis D. Mattes,

FBI, St. Louis Division, St. Louis, Missouri, I interviewed Oliver

Patterson, Jr. aï his residence, 12350 Old Halls Ferry Road,

Black Jack, Missouri.

I have never had any contact with any media representatives

concerning the interview with Oliver Patterson, Jr., nor did I

reveal to Patterson that the House Select Committee on Assassinations

During the interview with Patterson, I did ask him if

he was familiar with, or have any knowledge of,

a man by the name

of Clarence Haynes.

This question was directed to Patterson in

order to ascertain Haynes' whereabouts in order to inform Haynes

and local. law enforcement agency, as expeditiously as possible,

RE:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

Sworn affidavits have been obtained from the

four FBI Agents who conducted the interviews of

Committee witnesses Oliver B. Patterson and

Clarence Haynes, namely, SA's Paul Babuchna and

James I. McManus of the Springfield Division, who

interviewed Haynes, and SA's Dennis D. Mattes and

John P. Joyce of the St. Louis Division, who

All four denied

revealing

the Committee as being the source of the pertinent

information or of furnishing information in this

matter to any outside source.

SA Joyce is now on

special assignment in the Louisville Division.

In addition, the SAC, Kansas City,

forwarded a teletype to the Bureau on 10/2/78, in

which he advised that Supervisor James V. Laughlin,

Relief Supervisor Parnell Miles, Jr., and

SA Larry D. Fink, the Bank Robbery Coordinator,

were the only employees of his office who utilized

information furnished by Blakey, and that all

three merely read and did not disseminate the

information outside the Kansas City Office. It

should be noted that the information furnished to

Kansas City was for intelligence purposes and

required no action.

Interviews of Division 6 Supervisors

Joseph A. Krahling, James D. Carey and others are

being held in abeyance pending

PURPOSE.

To furnish status of HSCA request for identity of a

Memphis informant; to obtain authority for FBI Headquarters

(FBIHQ) Supervisor to accompany Deputy Assistant Attorney

General Robert I. Keuch to Memphis at his request to discuss

this matter with Memphis personnel; and to get approval

situation.

ATT0'

SC WATHED

BACKGROUND.

In connection with the HSCA's investigation into the

assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and beginning in

April, 1978, the HSCA has submitted a series of requests to

obtain access to five (5) former Memphis informants and their

files.

The HSCA is trying to resolve an allegation that paid

FBI informants reporting on the Invaders, a Memphis youth gang

acted as

"Agent provocateurs"

and instigated violence in Memphis

during the Sanitation Worker's Strike, which caused King to

return to Memphis where he was killed.

In response to these requests, FBIHQ and Memphis

Field Office files of these five informants have been processed

for HSCA

access with all identifying data excised: Access to

these files was restricted only to G. Robert Blakey, Chief

Counsel and Director, HSCA. When contacted in July, 1978, and

asked if they would

agree to interview by the isCA, all five

of these informants declined.

After Mr. Blakey completed review of these informant

files on 10/6/78, he wrote the Attorney General a letter dated

10/17/78 (copy attached) requesting the name of one of these

informants be provided incorder that the HSCA could interview

him to resolve

"serious allegations involving the FBI and the

death of Dr. King. "

Basedson information in this letter, the

informant in question is former ME 338-R (Bureau file 137-4885

and

Memphis file 170-70).

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

This informant was operated as a PCI during 1958-1960,

and was reopened in 1963 as a racial source. He later became

an informant reporting on a wide range of racial activities

and organizations in Memphis and for a time was adult advisor

to the Invaders.

He was closed 9/29/76 as there were no

Extremist organizations in Memphis to target informant against.

In discussions concerning Mr. Blakey's request con-

tained in HSCA letter 10/17/78, it was agreed by representatives

of interested Divisions at FBIHQ and Mr. Keuch, that we should

not provide informant's identity. However, in order to

avoid a confrontation with the Committee and possible Congress-

ional subpoena for his identity, it was decided another effort

should be made to contact informant to determine if he was

willing to be interviewed by the HSCA. Mr. Keuch asked the

Committee to provide additional details stating circumstances

of the interview and any other information the Committee may

desire the informant be furnished at the time of FBI contact.

This additional information was received in HSCA letter to the

Attorney General dated 10/19/78 (copy attached).

A copy of both HSCA letters mentioned above was

furnished the Memphis Office by facsimile on 10/24/78.

CONFERENCE WITH MR. KEUCH 10/26/78.

On 10/26/78, a conference requested by Mr. Keuch was

held in his office, attended by SA D. 0. Coulson, Legal Liaison

and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,

SA J. J. Jamar, Top Echelon and Criminal Informant Unit, Criminal

Investigative Division,

and SA's T. W. Brekke and J. I.

Aldhizer,

Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management Division.

Mr. Keuch agreed that the points in HSCA letter of

10/19/78, as outlined in attached teletype to Memphis, should

be brought to the attention of the informant when contacted by

the Memphis Office.

He further agreed that the informant's

decision in this matter should be entirely his own. However,

Mr. Keuch believed this issue to be such a crucial one that he

should be present in Memphis on the day of contact. His purpose

there would be to brief contacting Agent on HSCA's position in

this matter, provide information concerning HSCA rules and

procedures,

and discuss HSCA interest surrounding interview of

informant if he agrees to same. Mr. Keuch believed that by

being present in Memphis at the time of informant contact, he

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

could answer any questions which arise during interview.

Mr. Keuch stated he has no desire to meet the informant or

to be present during contact but merely be available to answer

questions which may arise.

Mr. Keuch requested that an Agent

from FBIHO familiar with the individual informant situation

accompany him to Memphis to assist in introducing him to

appropriate personnel at the Memphis Office.

Mr. Keuch ex~

pressed the desire to travel to Memphis during the week of

10/30/78, and most likely on 10/31/78.

Mr. Keuch also agreed with instructions to Memphis,

as outlined in attached teletype, concerning actions to be

taken in this matter if informant consents or refuses to

cooperate with the HSCA.

MEMPHIS OFFICE CONTACT.

On 10/26/78, SAC Joseph H. Trimbach and ASAC

Richard H. Blay, were

telephonically furnished details as

outlined above.

They advised that appropriate personnel of

the Memphis Office and former ME 338-R would be made available

as requested.

OBSERVATIONS.

Since informant refused once to agree to HSCA inter-

view, it is unlikely he will change his mind. We must not

furnish his identity to the HSCA unless informant approves

of such action. It is also not desirable to confront the HSCA

on this issue. Therefore, the solution is to determine if

informant on his own will agree to interview by the Committee.

Prior to making this decision, he should be furnished a complete

balanced prospective of the issues involved.

This would include

information about the HSCA and all points the HSCA specifically

wants brought to his attention.

Depending upon informant's

attitude and decision, alternatives, such as an anonymous

telephone interview, or a seperate

room interview can be

discussed and subsequently presented to the HSCA for its con-

sideration.

In this regard, Mr. Keuch's presence in Memphis

could be of further assistance.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Dear MI. Attorney General:

In connection with this Committee's investigation into

the death of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., I write to reguest

that you make the name of a former Security informant available

to the Committee so that the person sight be interviewed in

order that serious allegations involving the Pederal Bureau of

Investigation and the death of Dr. Jing may be resolved.. The

Committee has had access to the relevant Bureau personnel and

the Headquarters and Pield Office files of the informant, duly

excised to protect the informant's identity; and it also con-

ducted extensive Interviews among others who are also the subject

of this aspect of the Committee's investigation. What the Com-

mittee now desires is to determine if the oral testimony of the

witnesses support or refute the written record as well as

Information obtained during previous interviews.

the person, whose identity the Committee seeks, was 8880-

ciated with the Invaders, a Black silitant group in Memphis,

Tennessee during 1968, who were apparently involved in the

violence that occurred in Memphis one week prior to DI. King's

He was an older person, and he had apparently been a

Bureau source since 1958. As a recognized community leader the

was able to move about freely within the Black community.

Committee knows independently that in the early months of 1968,

the Invaders were attempting to obtain influence in that same

community, and they initially attempted to do so, in part, by

approaching established organizations. They even went so far

as to Invite special agents of the lemphis office to meet with

them early in 1968, at which time they delineated their goals

and objectives. It the Bureau sought to shape the actions of

these individuals in ways detrimental to DI. King in connection

With the counterintelligence program being waged against him,

It would appear that this particular informant would have been

a logical vehicle for that effort.

As you know, with respect to the king investigation, the

Committee is, in effect, performing for the death of DI. King

the same function that the warren Commission performed for the

death of President Kennedy.

One of the most frequent criti

cisms of the Warren Commission is that in attempting to resolve

the issue of whether or not lee farvey Oswald was an FBI in-

formant, the Commission accepted suor affadavits from the

BureaU.

The Committee feels, therefore, that It would be

dereliet to rely on anything less than an opportunity to examine

and CrOss-eXaMine relevaNt MItMesses on this crucial Issue.

The Committee is not unmindful of the sensitive nature of

its request.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the

Committee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not

until our field interviews with former members of the Invaders

ana people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed, (1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

cause of the violence, and (2) that it is aniversally believed

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives, that the Committee requested access to any

Informant files.

By that time, the Committee had revieved the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders,

Ring and SCLC substantive files.

It had also.

reviewed the Memphis Police Department files, and it had inter-

viewed its undercover operative within the Invader organization.

The Committee had Initially hoped that the answers it

porner agents revealed, additionally, (1) that the Memphis Field

Office had prior knowledge of the impending violence (a fact

readying weapons from signposts la fact testified to under oath

by these agents.)

Further, while the Committee has insisted that the files

of all five of the informants said by the Department of Justice

to be involved with the Invaders should have been made available

to its staff pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding, it

made a good faith effort to work out a compromise proposal that

- permitted my exclusive review of the excised files. The

Committee has now reached a point, however, where the balance

between maintaining the integrity of the Bureau's informant

progian and the resolution of this critical issue rust be struck

in favor of the Committee's receiving the identity of that one

A request is not being made for all five, and absent

new developments, this request should resolve the outstanding

The burden of the Committee's mandate is largely a

reflection of the desire of the American public to learn the

true facts concerning the death of DI. King. Mat burden 15

perhaps never more apparent than in connection with the issues

that the Coumittee is now attempting to address here. The claim

that an FBI/Invader connection resulted in the violence on April

28 and contributed to DI. King's death has nou received nation-

wide attention.

It is recounted in existing literature and nas

broadcast nationally in a dramatic account of DI. Jing's life.

The Rev. Ralph Abernathy, close friend and successor of DI. King,

testified in public under oath and before Members of the Com-

mittee and the national news media, that he recalled members of

the Invaders acknowledging that they had caused the violence

on March 28, in return for compensation from the FEI. Indeed,

an inalvidual who was a recognized leader of the 1968 Sanitation

Strike and made the invitation to DI. Ring to come to Memphis,

is a leading exponent of the theory that the fEl, through its

informants, had a direct role in DI. King's assassination.

Finally, the Committee's Investigation has revealed that

the Bureau recommended that informants be used with or without

their knowledge to implement counterintelligence proposals

directed against DI. Ring, in 1968. With this backdrop, it is

clear that the committee has no choice but to satisfy itself

concerning the events which took place in Mempiig.

The public

interest in the death of DI. King cannot be met by less than a

full investigation.

Talking with this individual is essential

to the fair resolution of these most serious questions.

I would hope that it sight be possible to secure the

identity of this informant, either through his consent or para-.

graph I. B. (1) of the Memorandum of Understanding between the

Department and the Committee.

Nevertheless, I am authorized

to inform you that the Committee is prepared to seek this

Information through formal process 1f all other avenues are of

no avail.

Finally, I would note that this issue must be resolved

-well before the resumption of the Committee's pablic bearings

allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Investigation

and the death of DI. King may be resolved. The Committee

has had access to the relevant Bureau files concerning

this informant, but the files were duly excised to pro-

tect the informant's identity. The Committee now desires

to interview this informant to deterine if his oral

testimony would support or refute the written record.

In addition, the Committee would expect to obtain other

information from the informant to corroborate or refute

information the Committee has obtained from its other

BOUICES.

The Committee is extremely sensitive to your

concerns about preserving the confidentiality of your

informants. In addition, the Committee can certainly

appreciate the desire of most security informants to

remain unidentified.

Should the Carmittee learn the

identity of this informant, it will be used at the cur-

rent time solely to have counsel on the staff interview

and perhaps depose the informant. This would be done in

the Committee's offices in Washington, D.C. and without

the knowledge of any member of the pablic.

Indeed, not

even every member of the Committee staff will become aware.

of the informant's identity. The Committee is primarily

interested in the information the informant may provide

the Committee.

The Committee tas no desire to have the

informant's identity needlessly pablicly exposed. Absent

extraordinary circumstances, the Committee would not divulge

in its hearings or its final report the name of the informant.

As you are aware, the Committee has extensively pur-

sued its investigations into the Invaders.

The claim that

an FBI/Invader connection contributed to Dr. King's assassi-

nation has received nationwide attention. We have held

field interviews with many members of the Invaders and Ie-

viewed numerous files on them. In addition, the Committee

has interviewed current and forer agents of the Department

and Bureau on this issue. Our Committee has been mandated •

to conduct a "full and complete" investigation into the

Talking with this informant is

essential to enable us to fulfill our legislative mandate,

and our responsibilities to the American people. As I indi-

cated to you, I hope it will be possible for us to secure

the identity of the informant through his consent, or pur-

suant to Paragraph I, B. of our Memorandum of Understanding.

Nevertheless, I must inform you that the Committee is prepared

to seek the information through formal process if all other

avenues fail.

This latter alternative, in the event litigatio

ensued and the Committee won, night publically disclose the.....

identity of the informant:

Indeed, litigation would. only

attract undue attention to this issue, and the participants

involved.

I believe if you adequately express to the infor-

mant our sincere desire to avoid unnecessary disclosure of

publicity, he will consent to his identity being disclosea

and an interview with the staff.

Sincerely,

Stor Blabe

In view of the nature of the House Select Committee

on Assassinations (HSCA) interest in Russell George Byers

and the available facts concerning this matter, the TE&Cl

Unit, Organized Crime Section, Criminal Investigative Division,

does not interpose an objection to a review of the St. Louis

Field Office 137 file for Byers by a representative of the

HSCA in FBIHQ space.

It is recommended that at the time of the review

of this file, that G. Robert Blakey or his designated

representative be advised that Byers was not a paid informant

of the FBI, as well as the nature of the contacts with him

by Agents of the St. Louis Division. CID also recommends

that if not already done, that a determination be made as to

the relevance of the allegation involving the offer made to

Byers as cited in instant file, as well as his association

with any persons having any relevance whatever to the entire

matter pertaining to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

Attention: Mx. Robert Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the Select Committee's investigation

into the circumstances surrounding the death of Dr. Martin Luther

King, Jr., this letter formally requests that the Department of

Justice seek a modification of the court order entered by Judge

Smith that sealed both the inventory and the actual items of

the surveillance that was conducted by the FBI on Dr. King..

By formal resolution, the Committee has decided that it is

necessary for the Committee to examine some of these items dur-

ing the course of the investigation to fulfill its legislative

mandate.'

In particular, the Committee would like to examine at

the current time the complete inventory that has been sealed

ard the logs of the surveillance that was conducted.

It is my understanding that the logs will not reflect the

content of any conversation that was overheard. If the logs

contain transcripts of or notations about the content of the

conversation, the Committee would want these deleted from any

logs the Committee is given access to at the current time.

The

Committee would, examining the logs, expect that the place, time,

date and the names of the parties to the conversation would be

information that the Committee

Attention:

Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This letter supplements the request of this

Committee by letter of November 6, 1978, for all

information pertaining to Dallas Sebastian Barr, aka

Jerry Miller.

Information has been received by the Committee

which clearly reveals that Dallas Barr was a federal

narcotics informant who subsequently testified at

the trial of John Kauffmann and others in federal

court, Kansas City, Missouri in approximately 1967.

Barr's role as an informant was obviously disclosed.

Since the Committee is investigating the allegation

that John Kauffmann was the source of an offer to

Kill Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.

in 1966-1967, it is

significant to determine what, if any, information of

this nature was possessed by Barr and related to law

enforcement authöritigx-109

Therefore, the request of the Committee for all

FREE COMe 507221 - 1293

files of Dallas Barr should result in the provision

of all materials pertaining to him regardless of any

otherwise limiting provision of the Memorandum of

Understanding

between the FBI and the Committee.

at this time whether Serial 52

was inadvertently skipped in

the serializing process or was permanently charged out and

sent to the Bureau without a permanent charge-out being

submitted to the file.

Attention: Mr. Robert L. Keuch

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

On November 7, 1978 in response to a request by the

House Select Committee on Assassinations dated February

3, 1978 and modified by letter on

october 12, 1978, the

Federal Bureau of Investigation provided the Committee with

a two volume set of photographs of FBI agents who were assigned

to Atlanta in 1968. EX-109 REC 1662-117290-1307

Prior to the delivery of these volumes, representatives of

the FBI indicated that four (4) photographs were unobtainable

through the agents personal files. They further stated that

two of these four were pictures of agents assigned to the security

Squad. At that time, members of the Committee's staff were

informed that every effort would be made to obtain other photo-

graphs of these agents.

T] NOV 17 1978

At the time of delivery and in subsequent conversations,

-he Committee was assured that the two volumes contained, along

with "fillers", photographs of all agents assigned to Atlanta for

Thus the ominous noted in paragraph two

were corrected.

A troubling aspect of the pictures provided, however, was

that one photograph, number 16, is markedly different from the

rest both in quality and the age of the person at the time the

photograph was made.

If this picture was, in fact, that of a member of the security

segious, questions are raised about the fairness of the

to

effectively employ them for the purpose of identification.

The Honorable Griffin B. Belly

It is requested that the FBI state one (1) whether the

person who appears in the photograph was a member of the security

squad and two (2) if he is a former agent named Jack Rose.

addition, to complete the written record with respect to this

response, the Committee requests that the Bureau provide the

Committee with an unsealed list of names of the agents depicted

in the photographs, without any correlation to the numbers of

the photographs, as well as a statement that all of the photographs

sought by the above-referenced request were provided.

As the information sought by this request has already been

compiled, it is requested that a response to this request be

made immediately.

SYNOPSIS:

In connection with the investigation into the

assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., and resulting

Details set horth Ichapter-by-chapter summary of

Although investigation was pursued in search of a conspiracy,

investigation in this area was limited, with the issues of

Ray's finances and possible family involvement still undeter-

mined.

This resulted from the FBI's preoccupation with the

fugitive investigation.

Re:

House

Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

The HSCA believes that the grand jury, search

warrants, immunity grants and court-authorized electronic

surveillances could have been used to produce more effective

The FBI is criticized for its "one way street pos-

ture" and not fully utilizing local police expertise, failure

to pursue leads conflicting with protection of our public

image, and violating the constitutional rights of citizens and

the defendant. The HSCA found no evidence that any deficiences

in the investigation were directly or indirectly the result

of what the Committee describes as the "Bureau's well-docu-

mented hatred for Dr. King and his movement."

Our observations are that the HSCA summary of facts

regarding the Murkin investigation is accurate and well docu-

mented, but also contains other information and conclusions.

Major

observations which should be provided the Department

and the HSCA are: removal of identities of Agents in the in

vestigation below the level of Section Chief; that the

Attorney General left up to the FBI the decision on where to

file the complaint against Ray; that the FBI was restricted

in use of court-authorized electronic surveillance, contrary

to HSCA view; final determination if electronic surveillance

violates constitutional rights of individuals rests with the

Department, not the FBI; that our informant coverage of hate

groups would have been adequate to learn of any group's in-

volvement in King's assassination; that the HSCA fails to

objectively detail the extent of FBI interviews with Ray's

relatives; that the HSCA analysis fails to address the central

point as to whether or not it determined Ray's guilt or

innocence; and the use of inflammatory, nonessential language in

cern so the report

he report primarily designed to malien the "'bl. Items oi con-

ern in the report, as to informants, relations with the Roya.

Canadian Mounted Police, Privacy Act and classification are set

forth.Ke

Items in report likely to be subject of media

attention are general findings, such as FBI's preoccupation

with identifying and locating Ray, which resulted in a limited

effort to detect a conspiracy; the FBI's failure to pursue

investigation of Ray's family, involvement of hate groups, or

identification of Ray's financial sources; that HSCA review

has not disclosed basis for confidence in

• the official con-

clusion that Ray acted alone; that the FBI failed to pursue

leads which conflicted with protection of its public image;

that our investigation violated constitutional rights of Ray

and his attorney-client relationship; and that the HSCA found

no evidence that any deficiences in the investigation were

results of the

"Bureau's well-documented hatred for Dr. King

and his movement."

The report shows no final conclusions as to the

guilt or innocence of Ray or the involvement or non-

involvement of any persons. It is anticipated that additional

HSCA reports will be issued regarding our security investiga-

tion of King, the HSCA's investigation of the assassination,

and the HSCA's complete findings in both the security ana

assassination investigations of King.

DETAILS:

BACKGROUND:

For the past two years the HSCA has been conducting

investigation into the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.,

reviewing pertinent FBI files and interviewing present and

former Agents familiar with the aspects of our assassination

and security investigation of King. After holding several

days of public hearings in the King case during August, 1978,

the HSCA resumed hearings on 11/9/78 and issued a Staff Report

scheduled for release 11/27/78.

An advance copy of this report

(attached) was received by Legal Counsel Division on 11/7/78,

transmitted by HSCA Letter to the Attorney General dated

11/6/78. This letter advised that the report should be re-

viewed by appropriate officials of the Department of Justice

and unless notified otherwise within five days, the HSCA would

assume the Department has no objection to publication of the

report in its entirety.

Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations

THEY MMM

On 11/0/78 Mr. Robert L. Keuch, Deputy Assistant

Attorney General, Criminal Division, advised that HSCA Chief

Counsel and Director G. Robert Blakey agreed to extend the

deadline for review of captioned report and submission of

observations

of same to the close of business 11/16/78.

Copies of captioned report were furnished appropriate

officials at FBIHQ in order that the report could be reviewed

for classification, privacy rights, sensitive informants and

methods and inaccuracies.

Advance copies were also furnished

to the Director, Mr. Adams and Mr. McDermott.

Based upon

review at FBI Headquarters the following consists of a chapter

by chapter summary of captioned report with internal observations

where appropriate, highlighting portions of the report likely

Also set forth are our objections

and observations which should be furnished to the Department of

Justice and the HSCA within the HSCA deadline of 11/16/78.

I. INTRODUCTION

SUMMARY:

Because of counterintelligence operations against

King and SCLC during the 1960's, the HSCA faced the troubling

question as to whether or not the FBI could conduct a thorough

and far-reaching criminal investigation into the assassination.

Besides this over-riding issue, the AscA attempted to re-

solve if the Justice Department properly exercised its

authority

over the direction and conduct of the investigation, if

available investigative resources were committed to identify and

locate person(s) responsible, what was the nature of the

FBI's coordination with and use of local authorities and

was the investigation conducted with due regard for the con-

stitutional rights of citizens, investigative targets and

the defendant.

OBSERVATIONS: None.

II. THE COURSE OF THE INVESTIGATION

SUMMARY :

This chapter identifies Agents at various levels

0f

supervision in the King assassainaton (MURKIN) both in the

field and at FBIHQ. Their duties are described. Then follows a

narrative of the crime, the immediate response of the Department

and the FBI, details concerning the identification and location

of Ray, his

extradiction from England and his

guilty plea in

Memphis on 3/10/69.

OBSERVATIONS:

(1) The HSCA's narrative summary of facts regarding our

investigation to identify and apprehend Ray is accurate and well

documented.

This is based on a random comparison of selected

footnotes with material content.

This chapter is however,

supplemented with other information and HSCA conclusions.

(2) The identification of Agent names in this report

is a concern. In previous reviews of our King investigation the

Senate Select Committee in 1975 and a Task Force of the Department

of Justice in 1976-1977 agreed at our request not to publish

the identities of Special Agent personnel below the level of

Section Chief. Although no written verification was received

from the HSCA

on this point, Mr. Blakey has orally stated to

representatives of the Legal Counsel Division and the CIU

that the HSCA would also follow this practice. It is not done

so in this Chapter or in Chapter IX where the

security case

agent in Atlanta is identified by name. This matter should

be brought to the attention of the HSCA, particularly with

an Agent's identity could jeopardize his personal safety.

(3) On page 28 the FBI's investigation cost figures

show marked decrease in cost and miles driven on a nation-

wide basis after Rays's arrest. Although figures quoted

are accurate, it should be pointed out to the HSCA that in

any major investigation the cost and miles driven will be

reduced drastically after its initial stages. At first

the investigation is broadly based with leads in many areas.

As the investigation narrows, the cost and miles driven will

logically decrease.

role" the Department was furnished "sanitized and digested"

information by the FBI, which maintained the course and

direction of the investigation.

Excluded from the case

were U.S. Attorneys in large cities where major portions

of the investigation were conducted. Also discussed

are personnel relations between the Department and FBI

officials at the time, the "arrogant independence of the

Bureau", failure of the Department to supervise and control

the FBI and the Bureau's "apparent inbred fear" of Department

Cited are specific instances

of difficulty between the Bureau and the Department, such as

notifying the Department after the fact regarding filing the

complaint against Ray in Birmingham; criticism by the

Director of the Attorney General's public statements on the

case; and FBI resentment of a Department official being sent

to London to handle Ray's extradiction. Examination of these

and other instances helped gain an overall understanding

of the quality of the King assassination and the roles played

therein by the Bureau and the Department.

OBSERVATION:

With respect to the filing of the complaint against

Ray, on page 45 it states "there is no indication in FBI files

that the selection of a filing location was discussed with

the Attorney General in Washington until after the fact"

•

This criticism was also made by the filce of Professional

Responsibility (OPR) of the Department during its review of

the king case. However, according to an internal memorandum

of the Birmingham Office, the United States Attorney in

Birmingham informed the SAC that he had contacted the Attorney

General who stated that he authorized prosecution of Ray,

but he (Attorney General) was not aware where the process

was

to be filed since that was a decision for FBI officials.

The HSCA had access to this memorandum in Birmingham file

44-1740-1005. While it is true that no documents could be

found indicating a filing location was discussed with the

Attorney General before the fact, the Birmingham memorandum

indicates the Attorney General was willing to leave location

selection up to Bureau officials.

Re :

House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

IV. COORDINATION BETWEEN THE BUREAU AND OTHERS

SUMMARY:

Here the HSCA comments upon the FBI's relationship with

will gain

of the agency itself.

To the FBI the outside world was

divided into friends and foes and a "curious conflict" arose

When a potential witness had a "questionable or anti-Bureau

reputation" and thus was seen as

• a threat to the FBI's public

image.

The "one way street" posture of FBI

precluded possi-

bility of a close working relationship with local authorities

on matters within their expertise.

While cooperation between

the FBI and local

authorities in Memphis was harmonious, the

limited distribution of infomation from the FBI during the

on-going investigation remained an excellent example of the

extent to which the FBI guards the substance of its on-going

cases.

OBSERVATION:

On page 52 the above HSCA statement concerning the

"one way street"

posture of the FBI is unwarranted and should

be corrected.

Our relationship with local authorities in the

MURKIN investigation was highly satisfactory and productive.

The Committee report describes our relations with Memphis

authorities as "harmonious".

Further, in its own investigation

the HSCA asked the FBI on two occasions to mediate a matter

with a local police department.

This may not have been

possible if our one way relationship with local authorities

is described accurately by the HSCA.

V. PROTECTING THE BUREAU'S IMAGE

SUMMARY:

In this chapter the HSCA cites examples where con-

cern for our public image made us reluctant to pursue leads

in the Murkin investigation. These were: (1) Refusal to in-

terview am editor because he

was a "rabble-rouser and hate

monger" after he claimed Ray's brother told him of a conspiracy

in the assassination.

(2) Monitored activities of an investi-

gative reporter working on the assassination and avoiding inter-

view with him; (3) Restricted covering of several investigative.

leads which

were associated with District Attorney General

Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA).....

Jim Garrison in New Orleans, a controversal figure. Io support

its allegation that the FBI

supplied information to assist

friendly writers, the HSCA cites one article which was sub-

mitted to the Bureau only for editing and a proposal to assist

writer Gerold Frank. This proposal was initially approved,

but later rejected.

The HSCA then concluded Frank must have

received assistance because "striking similarities to the

FBI reports covering the same subject matter" appear in

his book.

OBSERVATIONS:

(1) Un page bo or this chapter paragraph two, the

late of Ray's guilty plea is 3/10/68. This date should be

3/10/69.

(2) The HSCA states on page 58, paragraph 1 that,

underlying memoranda regard the reporter

was a clear concern

on the part of the FBI that "a private

investigative reporter

would break the case before the nation's largest and most

famous investigative agency."

This statement is a good

example of pure conjecture by the Committee and removal of

the statement should be requested.

(3) In spite of the statement of former Assistant

Director Bishop that the Bureau did not cooperate with any

author on the King case and HSCA statement on pages 61-62 that

no evidence to that effect was found in FBI files, the HSCA

still attempts to leave that impression. It should also

be

pointed out to the HSCA that the "striking similarities" in

the author's book could have resulted from the data in possessior

of the Department or local prosecuting authorities, and not

the FBI.

VI. INVESTIGATIVE METHODOLOGY

SUMMARY:

The HSCA states that conspicuously absent in

Murkin were investigative methods such as search warrants,

electronic surveillance, immunity grants, and the gran

jury. The use and advantages of a federal grand jury in

an investigation are discussed along with the reasons.

HH 55039 DocId:32989742 Page 132

---

## Page 133

Ryan to Mr. Bassett Memorandum

Re:

House

Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

the FBI did not employ its use. Primarily, the HSCA believes

this method could have been useful in handling uncooperative

witnesses, Ray's brothers, suspects who were members of

hate groups or any other individuals who could not normally

be relied upon to be totally candid in interviews with FBI

Agents.

With respect to electronic surveillance the HSCA

faults our failure to utilize court authorized monitoring

upon passage on 6/19/68 of the Ominious Crime Control and

Safe Streets Acts of 1968 which permitted such use in certain

crimes, including murder. The Committee is critical of our

one request to conduct non-consensual electronic surveillance

of Ray's sister and brother-in-law, citing as "insubstantial"

our basis to apprehend Ray and reduce the stresses and tension

placed on the national

security subsequent to the death of

King: It further states that such surveillance, if installed,

would almost certainly be judged illegal under the 1968

constitutional standards and would violate the rights of

surveillance targets. Later withdrawal of this proposal

was a clear indication of the Bureau's

consider conspiratorial involvement of the family or the

damage this investigative approach could have done to any

prosecution of Ray's family.

OBSERVATIONS:

(1) As the HSCA points out in this chapter

officials of the Deartment and the Bureau interviewed by the

HSCA were

in general agreement that a grand jury investigation

was unnecessary and would not have aided the investigation. Ray

was offered an opportunity to appear before the Federal Grand

Jury in 1970, but he refused.

(2) On page 76 the HSCA notes that despite the

potential for imaginative investigative efforts offered by the

use of court authorized electronic surveillance in the Ominous

Crime Control and Safe Streets Acts of 1968, there were no

further attempts to implement same. It should be pointed out

to the HSCA that even after passge of this act, the FBI was

precluded by Departmental Order from using court authorized

electronic surveillance in criminal cases. On 6/19/68 when

President Johnson signed Title III of that statute into law, he

publicly stated "the policy of this administration has been

to confine wire tapping and eaves-dropping to national security

cases only... This policy, now in its third year, will continue

in force".

President Johnson went on to say that on that

date he instructed the Attorney General to assure this policy

Re: House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)f-

was followed by all law enforcement officers. Subsequent

attempts to obtain Attorney General approval to seek a court

order in criminal cases were disapproved, citing this policy.

Therefore,

the "potential for imagikative investigative efforts

offered by the act,"

according to the asCA, was not available

to the FBI. Also, the HSCA has personnel familiar with

passage of this act who can be consulted as to its application

concerning the FBI.

On page 74, the HSCA states that the willingness

of the FBI to propose electronic surveillance against Ray's

family, after recognizing internally its unconstitutional

nature, showed an absence of concern for the rights of sur

veillance targets.

This recognition of unconstitutionality

of this

surveillance was recorded in an internal FBI memorandum

discussing all legal aspects of the installation. It should

be pointed out to the HSCA the final determination as to such

legality rests not with the FBI, but the Department of Justice,

which can approve or disapprove

the request.

VII. JAMES EARL RAY - THE ULTIMATE SOURCE OF INFORMATION

SUMMARY:

This chapter explores steps taken by the Department

of Justice and the FBI to interview Ray, noting that he may

have information in his possession regarding a conspiracy.

In detail the report documents that no interview of Ray was

conducted in England or during his flight back to the United

States.

Following this guilty plea in March, 1969, con-

sideration was given to directly approaching Ray and, under

Department authority, interview was conducted 3/13/69 by

SAC Robert Jensen.

The report states, supported by Jensen's HSCA

interview, that an inadequate Miranda warning was given Ray.

Ray refused a second interview by Jensen on 3/14/69 and sub-

sequently refused to appear before the Grand Jury in 1970 and

to be interviewed by the Department of Justice Task Force in

1976.

This chapter relates that local authorities, in

violation of a court order, furnished the FBI copies of three

letters from Ray to his attorney,

Arthur Hanes.

These copies

were forwarded by the Memphis Field Office to FBI Headquarters.

SAC Jensen acknowledged in his HSCA interview initialing two

memoranda, but stated that the letters were volunteered to

Several other examples of mail intercepts were noted,

and the HSCA concludes that such activities were illegal and

potentially injurious to prosecution of Ray.

Ryan to Mr. Bassett Memorandum

Re: House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

OBSERVATIONS: None.

VIII. THE CONSPIRACY INVESTIGATION

SUMMARY:

This chapter gives the Department

and FBI view to

support the conclusions that Ray acted alone in killing King.

The HSCA believes, based on review of FBI files, that from the

start there was a

consciousness within the Bureau of a conspir-

acy possibility and memoranda to this effect are cited both

in early stages of the investigation and subsequent to Ray's

capture.

The HSCA concludes that its review of evidence

within FBI files and techniques employed by the Department

and FBI in the case has "not disclosed a basis for confidence

in the official conclusion that responsibility for Dr. King's

death does not extend beyond the triggerman."

The HSCA outlines the defects it found in our con-

spiracy investigation as

(1) conspiracy leads were resolved

solely by establishing alibis of potential co-conspirators

on the day of and several days before King's death. (2)

limited effort to investigate involvement of hate type

organizations. (3) total reliance on field interviews to

resolve conspiracy and funding questions, grand jury not

utilized.

(4) failure to focus on Ray's

family, noting

witnesses during significant pre-assassination periods and coin-

cidences between Ray's own story of Raoul and association

o on or got ang as on coden-

(5) no significant effort was made to

determine the extent of criminal involvement of Ray's brothers.

(6) failure to check alibis of John or Jerry

Ray at time of

the rifle purchase and John Ray's alibi on the day King was

killed.

(7) no efforts to investigate

Ray's brothers

through interviews of their associates.

OBSERVATIONS:

(1) Some of the HSCA's findings outlined above

closely parallel findings of the OPR Task Force and are there-

fore already in the public domain.

The Task Force determined

that more investigation could have been

conducted concerning

Ray's brothers and

that sources for Ray's funds are still a

mystery.

Re:

House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

(2) On page 92 the HSCA states, other than can-

vassing informants during various stages in the investigation,

the Bureau's investigation of possible hate groups involve-

ment was

"both limited and unimaginative." The HSCA fails to

note that regarding hate groups in 1968 our informant coverage

was more than adequate to detect information of such substance

as

a hate group plotting assassination of King. The HSCA

fails to take this into consideration. Further, alibis of key

hate group officials were checked out and ant any positive

information received alleging hate group involvement was

thoroughly investigated.

(3) The HSCA notes FBI emphasis on interviews of Ray's

relatives, but no objective effort was made to provide in

detail the extent of such contacts. The files reflects relatives

of Ray

were interviewed on approximately 102 separate occasions.

The majority of these, in the period of a few months, in-

volved verry ray, brother, 22 interviews; John kay, brother,

18 inverviews; Jerry Raynes, father, 15 interviews; Carol

repper, sister, 14 interviews; donr

Gawron, step-father, 16

interviews; Albert Pepper, brother-in-law,

4 interviews; and

Susan Donian, sister, 5 interviews.

IX. HOOVER, COINTELPRO, AND THE ASSASSINATION INVESTIGATION

SUMMARY :

One example of COINTELPRO activity against King is

outlined in this chapter.

There follows statements by Bureau

and Department officials interviewed by the HSCA that our

COINTELPRO efforts had the ironic effect of increasing the

intensity of our investigative efforts in the assassination.

Examples are given of Agents who worked on both the security

and assassination investigation. Regarding Mr. Hoover, the

HSCA implies that his scribbled

notes on memoranda indicate

closest attention to details of the investigation regarding

conduct of his Agents or image of the Bureau.

Files reflect

Hoover placed neither positive or negative additions or

restrictions on the scope of the investigation. In its

concluding paragraph, the HSCA states that while there were

serious problems with the investigation, both in the FBI's

failure to pursue conspiracy possibilities and disregard for

constitutional rights of citizens and the defendant, there

is no clear evidence that these deficiences or any others

were directly or indirectly caused by the Bureau's well

documented hatred of King and his movement.

## Page 137

Ryan to Mr. Bassett Memorandum

Re: House

Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA)

OBSERVATION:

(1) As outlined in observations in Chapter II, the

HSCA should be requested to remove identities of Agents

below the level of Section Chief. In this chapter two Agents

who handled the

security and assassination investigation of

King in Atlanta

are identified.

GENERAL COMMENTS:

(1) The analysis does not state whether or not the

HSCA determined if Ray actually killed King.

No doubt future

findings in this regard will be issued. However, it is believed

that any analysis of the Department and FBI's performanance

in the assassination

investigation cannot be complete without

an assessment of Ray's guilt or innocence. In this regard,

the HSCA's analysis fails to address this

central point and,

therefore, its value to the American people is weakened.

(2) It should be pointed out to the HSCA that the

FBI objects in some instances to the language in the report

which is considered inflammatory, nonessential to the facts

of the case, and obviously used to malign the

FBI. These

instances are: page 43, paragraph 1,

"agency's arrogance";

"reckless

"insatiable

curiosity"; page 80,

paragraph 2,

"no less than three Ietters";

page 92, paragraph 1, "a simplistic view of the law of

conspiracy"; and page 98, paragraph 3, "patently illegal."

(3) On page 81, the report discusses receipt of

information from an informant of the Memphis Field Office

on August 6, 1968.

This information, so specifically written,

tends to identify

this informant.

The HSCA should be re-

quested to delete the specific date and any reference to

information coming from a Memphis informant.

Unless this

action is taken, it will be necessary to classify this por-

tion of the report.

Also regarding informants, reference is made to

page 57 where it is stated that to monitor the activities

of an investigative reporter, Bureau sources were inter-

viewed in a variety of locations, including a Houston radic

station, The Houston Chronicle,

the Pacific lelephone com-

pany, the Sultan Room in Los Angeles, and the Rabbit's Foot

Lounge in Los Angeles.

While this passage does not tend to

identify any specific individuals, the FBI would prefer the

HSCA avoid such direct reference to the location of FBI

sources.

investigation of Ray's family more aggressively, inadequately

investigating possible involvement of hate groups, and

failure to identify

sources of Ray's finances.

2. A finding which may be of interest is that the

HSCA review

"has

not disclosed a basis for confidence in the

official conclusion that Ray acted alone." This finding

may alert media interest to the effect that the HSCA has come

up with

"something" which will be announced later.

3.

The FBI failed to pursue leads which conflicted

with protection of its public image.

4. The investigation violated the constitutional

rights of Ray and his attorney-client relationship.

This

resulted

from interception, in violation of a court-order,

by local

authorities of letters Ray wrote to his attorney

while in jail.

Copies of these letters were received from

local authorities by the SAC, Memphis, and forwarded to FBIHQ.

The HSCA found no evidence that any deficiences

in the assassination investigation were the results of the

well-documented hatred for Dr. King and his move-

Omnibus Crime Control anữ Sale Streets Acts of 1068,

thore

ware no further attempts to implement same. It should be

pointed

out to the HiSCA thut oven after passage of this act,

the FBI was precluded by Departmental Ordict from using

court-authosized clectionic survoillance in criminal cases.

On June 19, 1968, when Precident Joinson signed Title III

of that statute into law, he publicly stated "the policy of

this doministration has been to contine wiretapping and

cavasdropping to national security cacos only. .. this

policy, now in its third year, vill continuc in force,"

Prosidont johnson went on to say that on that date he

instructed the Attorney General to assure this policy vas

followed by all luv enforcement officors. Subsoquont

attempts to obtain Attorney General approval to cool a

court ordor in criminal cases vere disapproved, citing thio

policy.

Therefore, the "potential for imaginative investi-

gative

offorts offored by the act," accoruing to the ESCA,

was not avuilable to the FBI. Also, the HSCA has personnel

familiar with passage of this act who can be consulted as

to its application concorning the FBI.

On page 74, the ESCA states chat the willing

ness of the fbi to proposo electronic surveillance ¿guingt

Ray's family, alcor recognizing intornally its unconstitu

tional naturo, showed an absence of concocn for the rights

of surveillance targeto.

This rocognition of the unconutir

cutionality of this survoillance wus recorded in on

tion.

Upon review of the Mexico City file, it appears

that the information in question is set forth in an LiM

prepared in the Mexico City Office under the caption

"JAPES EARL RAY, aka;"

and dated 7/24/68. The information

provided by MANÚELA ÁCUIRRE MEDRANO begins at the bottom

of Page 12 and continues through the top of Page 10,

recalled, the version in the possession of the Staff

members,

which pertains to her information, is considerably

condensed and covers no more than three-quarters of a page.

This, presumably, was a decision made in the Memphis Office

for the sake of brevity. C

OBSERVATIONS

the interview lasted about one hour, and forty-

fivo minutes and the atnosphere was cordial throughout

It appears that the fiSCA representatives were trying to

establish a basis

for requesting that Bureau authority be

granted to interview MEX 24 and/or a copy of any report

prepared by the source atter he spoke with MANUSLA AGUIRRE.

• Staft members that under normal

destruction schedules, it would be unlikely that the

original information would still be retained in Mexico

may have been prepared by MEX 24 concerning this aspect

of the investigation is no longer available in our files. C

HOUSE SELECT CONMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Re Butel, 9/13/78.

By appointment, the writer met with Staff

members of HSCA at 10:00 AM on 9/28/78 at

the House

Washington, D.C.

MI. EVANS, Chies Investigator; LOUIS PARISI, Staff

Investigator, and GERALD HAMILTON. (O

Most of the questioning was handled by HAMILTON,

who began the interview by stating that HSCA had been

charged with the responsibility of determining all the

facts surrounding the assassination of Dr. MARTIN LUTHER

KING and that they were attempting to conduct an inpartial

and objective investigation, and were not "out to get"

any individual or agency in the U.S. Government, or

elsewhere.

The writer was asked to furnish a brief outline

of his Bureau services, which he did. C

Staff menbers pointed out that the author,

WILLIAM BRADFORD HUIE, had stated in a book that RAMON del

RIO of the Federal Judicial Police, had checked a hotel in

Guerrero, Where JAMES EARL RAY, using the name

had stayed during the fall of 1967.

Their information indicated that HUIE was told this

by the hotel manager and reported it as something which

took place prior to the assassination, and that HUlE ha‹

not chocked directly with Del RIO. They said that Del RIO C

had been interviewed by Staff members, and stated only

that he would not have made such an inquiry except upon the

orders of his superior in Mexico City, who at that time,

was General JIMENEZ DELGADO.

They said that they had not

been able to interview JIMENEZ DELGADO, and had been told

that he was aged and infirm.

The writer stated that he

had not seen JIMENEZ DELGADO for approximately ten years,

and that he was probably at least in his 60s at that time. &

Staff members showed an understandable degree

of confusion concerning the various police agencies which

function in Mexico, and asked for a

definition of the word

"Jefatura". They were told that this refers to the

Metropolitan Police of Mexico City,

They were familiar

with General RAUL MENDIOLEA and asked whether he would have

been involved in the investigation in 1968.

The response

was that MENDIOLEA, in 1968, was not connected with the

Federal Judicial Police, which he now heads, and was the

Chief of the Riot Police of the Mexico City

• Police

Departnent.

For this reason, it was considered unlikely

that MENDIOLEA would have been directly involved in the case. C

Some questioning dealt with the identities of

official agencies used by this office in handling the

investigation.

It was pointed out that official agencies

were used in connection with some aspects, and that they

were certainly all alerted regarding RAY's possible presence

in Mexico, and that appropriate record checks were undoubtedly

conducted

with the major Mexican agencies.

In addition,

Mexican agencies were helpful in some individual instances

when it became necessary to check out reports on "look-alikes"

in remote areas of the country. It was pointed out that

there was no single Mexican agency on which this office

relied for any major or substantive portion of the investigation. C

A question was asked as to whether RAY's alleged

interest in marijuana would have been reported by this office

to other agencies.

The response was that

it would normalLy

have been brought to the attention of the U.S. agency within

the Embassy handling narcotics matters at the

time, and may

also have been reported to the headquarters of that same

agency at the Washington level. C

One or two questions were addressed to the major

thrust of the investigation in Mexico, i, in resolving the

expended in locating RAY as a fugitive, or

questions which would normally present

themselves in a murder C

investigation.

The writer stated that our principal objoctive

was the location of the subject himselt, but that all personnel

were alert to information which might have been useful in

resolving questions concerning the assassination itself. &

Staff nembers made it clear that they had access

to Bureau reports concerning the investigation, and, after

a hurried conference, made available one such report, which

was apparently prepared by the Memphis Office.

They

explained

that it was part of their responsibility to attempt to resolve

the question of motive.

They said that the Bureau, when

presented with this question, had called attention to RAY's

reported statements in Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco, during an

encounter with some Negro sailors,

The Staff members pointed

out that they had located the woman to whom this account is

attributed,

in the town of Atotonilco, Jalisco, and she was

interviewed during their visit to Mexico during the summer

of 1978.

They said that this woman, MANUELA AGUIRRE MEDRANO,

not now support the version of

the incident which she

furnished to a source of this office in 1968, Specifically,

she now says that there were no racial overtones to the

incident, or to RAY's reaction or attitude toward the

Negroes.

She reportedly claims that

RAY, known to her

GALT, became incensed because he considered hor his girlfriend,

and believed

that one of the Negro sailors was trying to

occupy her time

and attention.

She allegedly stated to

Staff invostigators that she does not recall that RAY

expressed any antipathy or hostility toward Negroes, as a

race.c

The Staff menbers described this as a discrepancy

which they feel obliged to resolve.

identities of the first two, but that the third source is

unknown to them by name.

They did indicate that they know

the symbol number of this source.

They indicated that they

considered it important to their investigation to interview

the source, or at least, have access to the report furnished

by the source at the time.

They said they had been assured

by at least one other Agent that this source was considered

highly reliable, and that there was no reason for the source

to have fabricated or embellished the information furnished

to him by MANUELA AGUIRRE. The writer responded that he

could not be certain of the identity of the source, but

believed that he knew which source was being discussed, and

very fully endorsed the statements attributed to the other

Agent. C

CONFIDENYZAL

It should be noted that each Legal Attache that

has been interviewed by this Committee has been advised

that he is not to furnish the source of any information

concerning the assassination of President John F. Kennedy

or Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., where that information

originated from Mexico.

They were further advised that

if

questioning continues or they are pressed for sources

of information, they are free to leave the interview and

should immediately contact Legal Counsel at FBIHQ. It is

conceivable that Committee staffers have attempted to

solicit sources of information from our Legal Attaches.

In many instances, the Committee is aware from detailed

file reviews that the FBI obtained information from

sensitive sources.

It is Legal Counsel's view that the

potential harm to

• the FBI from these interviews could

result from the publication of this information by the

Committee and not from the interviews themselves.

It is

suggested that this publication problem again be dis-

cussed with Mr. Robert Keuch of DOJ to insure that the

Committee's report does not jeopardize our sensitive

investigative operations. (e)

SYNOPSIS: HSCA is scheduled to reconvene its public hearings on the

assassination of Dr. King on 11/9/78.

As the HSCA has done previously,.

copies of those documents which may be referred to or made public

during those hearings were furnished to Mr. Robert L. Keuch, Deputy

Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, by HSCA letter dated

10/30/78, with the request that the Department review them.

Mr. Keuch,

in turn, requested that the FBI ascertain whether there would be any

objection to the public release of those documents.

He requested that

the TBI advise him of the resilEt. 2? that review by 11/6/18.

assassination, including

photographs of various documents; FD-302's reflecting interviews of

witnesses and relatives; and investigation into the financial records of

those relatives. Group 2 contains documents from various security files

pertaining to King which appear to cover the gamut of the security

investigation of King. Because of the nature of these documents, they

were reviewed for classification by the Projects

Group 3

contained FD-302's reflecting the interviews of several witnesses ià DEC 5 1978

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re: House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

Mr. Blakey has been previously briefed regarding Legats and the necessity

to avoid public exposure of their operations. Group 4 contains material

related to the administration of the MURKIN case, including cooperation

between agencies, and those investigative techniques proposed and used.

Those techniques mentioned were elsur and misur, and the interception of

Ray's mail while incarcerated in Shelby County, Tennessee, jail.

A review of the material in the five groups reflects that,

generally, no objection should be made to its disclosure. Some of the

material in Groups 2 and 3 is either classified or reflects a sensitive

Investigative method or operation involving a Legat' and an objection to &)

possible disclosure of that information has been made to Mr. Keuch and

Michael Eberhardt, HSCA Staff Member. This material is being returned

to Mr. Keuch on 11/8/78, for transmittal to the HSCA. Mr. Keuch is

being advised of our specific objections to public disclosure of some of

DETAILS: The HSCA is scheduled to reconvene its public hearings per-

taining to the assassination of DI. Martin Luther King, JI., on 11/9/78.

Previous HSCA public hearings were held in August and September, 1978,

regarding the Martin Luther King,

Jr., and John F. Kennedy assassinations.

As expected, those hearings generated considerable media attention,

particularly with the appearance of James Earl Ray as a Committée

this, along with Mark Lane's (Ray's attorney) allegations of FBI

participation in a conspiracy to kill Dr. King and expected HSCA inquiry

into the Cointelpro program, is expected to rekindle media and public

interest in these hearings.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re: House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

Mr. Robert L. Keuch, Deputy Assistant Attorney General,

Criminal Division, made available a letter to the Attorney General from

G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, dated 10/30/78,

hearings. a number of documents that the HSCA may refer to in its public

A copy of this material is attachment one to this memorandum.

As was done prior to HSCA hearings in August, Mr. Keuch requested that

the FBI review the material to determine any objections to its release

during the hearings.

The Committee requested that the Department relate

the results of the review of the material by 11/6/78.

The material, contained in the attachment to the letter of

10/30/78, was arranged

in five groups. The following is a synopsis of

the subject matter found in each group with particular emphasis on Group

2 and part of Group 3, both of which contain material of a sensitive

nature.

Group 1: Contains photographs of documents which James Earl

Ray signed with his true name or aliases, including Alabama automobile

dance studio (Q 259); receipt from Aeromarine Supply (Q 74); contract

from Birmingham National Bank for safe deposit box (K 6); check from

Indian Trails restaurant (Q 405); bank robbery note from London, England

(Q 389); and two FD-302's of Grace Hayes Stevens, resident of the

Memphis boarding house from which Ray shot King.

Grace Stevens has

become part of Mark Lane's entourage and is expected to give testimony

refuting the information in those FD-302's.

Group 2: Documents in Group 2 are copies of material furnished

to the HSCA from various security files pertaining to King, Southern

Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), Communist Influence and Racial

Matters (CIRM), Sanitation Workers' Strike, Cointelpro, and others.

Some of the documents are the same ones furnished the Senate Select

Committee (SSC) during its review of the King case in 1975. At the

HSCA's request, copies of these documents were retrieved from the SSC

and processed for delivery to the HSCA.

In general, Group 2 consists of 138 serials relating to the

following aspects of our security investigation of King and the SCLC:

initiation of investigation of King and the SCLC; King's association

with Communist Party officials; authorization and installation of

telephone and microphone surveillances against King and SCLC; criticism

of the FBI by King; documents showing internal debate between Mr. Hoover

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re:

House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

and the Intelligence Division over the extent of communist influence in

the Civil Rights Movement during 1963-1964; counterintelligence and

discrediting actions taken against those carried out in the Black

Extremist and Communist Party-USA Cointelpro files; meeting between

Mr. Hoover and King in 1964; 1968 monograph concerning King disseminated

throughout the Executive Branch of Government; and Sanitation Workers'

Strike, Invaders and Poor People's Campaign documents, all of which

relate to activities of King in the latter months of his life and his

trip to Memphis where he was killed.

Based on a review of documents in Group 2, it appears obvious

the Committee in its public hearings and its final report plans to cover

the entire King security investigation and related cases, including

events which eventually brought him to Memphis in 1968. It is not clear

at this point if or how the HSCA plans to connect these documents with

the actual assassination. However, one aspect of the HSCA's investigation

has been to determine if the FBI was in any way responsible for or

involved in King's death.

On 10/29/78, HSCA Staff Member Michael Eberhardt was advised

that a number of documents in Group 2 contain classified information.

These documents were not reviewed for classification at time of delivery

to the HSCA.

Mr. Eberhardt was advised that these documents would now

be reviewed for classification and returned to the HSCA prior to public

hearings so the Committee will know which data in the documents is

classified and should not be publicly disclosed.

Documents in Group 2 were reviewed for classification by

personnel of Projects Unit, DERS

11/8/78, for delivery to the HSCA.

and see being resumed te in matton

surrounding the initiation of the King security investigation, mentione

in several documents referred to above, the possible use of this materia.

by the HSCA was discussed and coordinated with SA Michael J. Steinbeck,

Intelligence Division.

Group 3: Documents contained herein are a teletype from

Memphis, dated 3/13/68, reflecting the interview of James Earl Ray by

SAC Robert Jensen; several FD-302's of bartenders in Los Angeles,

California, who were acquainted with Ray; land a letterhead memorandum

which sets forth the results of investigation conducted in Mexico to

verify Ray's past activities there (e)

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re:

House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

"The letterhead memorandum in this group synopsizes investi-

gation conducted in Mexico and specifically mentions investigations

conducted by sources there. Due to the specificity of that investigation,

possible public disclosure could result in a negative impact on Legat

perations.

4/4/78 (copy attached),

and Mr. Blakey is receptive to the Bureau's

position in this area. Additionally, this letterhead memorandum was

reviewed for classification by personnel of the Projects Unit, and is

being returned with the other documents to Mr. Keuch on 11/8/78.

Group 4: Documents contained herein concern a variety of

topics related to the MURKIN investigation.

These documents pertain to

the following: the initial FBI interview of James Earl Ray (see Group .

3); FBI memoranda concerning cooperation between Department of Justice

and the FBI; the initial Department of Justice request to the FBI to

investigate the assassination; four documents related to possible elsur

and misur coverage of Ray's relatives, the Peppers, and his brother,

John Larry Ray; intra-Bureau communications regarding obtaining of Ray's

mail while incarcerated in the Shelby County, Tennessee, jail; Bureau

instructions to all field offices to pursue all leads; several memoranda

pertaining to dissemination policy of information to the Department of

Justice; several documents concerning Louis Emanuel Lomax, a writer

associated with Charles Stein; a Deloach memorandum regarding a meeting

with the U. S. Marshal; several documents setting forth NCIC and computer

application in solving MURKIN; a memorandum of Mr. Hoover reflecting a

meeting with the Attorney General; and a teletype to appropriate field

offices directing "full coverage" be given to Ray's relatives.

Based on the documents contained in Group 4, it appears that

he Committee plans on covering several sensitive areas regarding th

BI's policy and handling of the following: the operation and disseminatio

of information between the FBI, Department of Justice, and other related

agencies; possible illegal activities on the part of the FBI in the

proposed electronic surveillance of Ray's relatives; and the obtaining

of Ray's correspondence with his attorney and others while incarcerated.

The other documents contained in this group appear to be of an innocuous

nature.

Memorandum to Mr. Bassett

Re: House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA)

Group 5: Documents contained in this group are primarily

FD-302's reflecting interviews and investigation conducted of James Earl

Ray, Jerry William Ray, and his wife, and Albert and Carol Pepper.

Additionally, there are several FD-302's reflecting investigation into

the financial records of those relatives.

A review of the material contained in the five groups reveals

the material does not involve any intormants, classification, or

sensitive investigative methods or operations, with the exception of

previously mentioned material in Groups 2 and 3.

As was previously addressed in D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett memorandum

dated 8/11/78 (copy attached), the consideration of the privacy of

individuals mentioned in the material released to the HSCA under the

auspices of the Freedom of Information-Privacy Acts (FOI-PA), is the

responsibility of that Committee.

That memorandum dealt with an analysis

of the documents provided by the HSCA for review by the FBI prior to

their public hearings in August, 1978.

For the most part, no objection should be made to the release

of the information set out above, with the exception of that part of the

material contained in Groups 2 which is classified and the letterhead

memorandum in Group 3 which sets torth sensitive Legat operations in

Mexico Mr. Keuch is being furnished with a copy of the material

contained in Groups 1-5 for return to the HSCA. Our strenuous objection

to the public disclosure of any information that is classified or which

reveals sensitive investigative operations, as contained in Groups 2 and

3, has been pointed out to Mr. Keuch so that he can advise the Committee.

Also, Mr. Keuch has been advised that much of this material is similar

to that previously furnished by the HSCA for review prior to their

public hearings in August, and, as such, though much of the material has

been released under FOI-PA, only routine excisions have been made;

therefore, the documents are not, in their entirety, in the public

domain.

11-9-78

Subsequent to the submission of this memorandum, Mr. Keuch

advised on 11-8-78 that the HSCA contacted him, complaining that extensive

classification of documents in Group 2 and one document in Group 3

prevented desirable public disclosure and would adversely affect HSCA

plans for public hearings scheduled to reconvene 11-9-78.

Following a discussion between Mr. Keuch and Mr. David Ryan,

Bureau Security Officer, it was decided to send three classifiers

to the HSCA offices during the evening of 11-8-78 and recheck the

documents to determine if by removing certain words from the classified

portions, the document could be declassified and thus publicly released.

SAs J.W. Gerblick, K.I. Klossner, L.B. Strong and J.I. Aldhizer, Document

Classification and Review Section, met with HSCA officials between

is orate renant one got detest ceo one sane acoration

from a foreign government source

accomplished, although the HSCA insisted the document is essential to

its public hearings to be held 11-10-78. Mr. Keuch was telephonically

contacted on this document and agreed that no declassification was possible

and he will consult with Mr. Blakey on 11-9-78.

Regarding the remaining classified documents in Group 2,

it was agreed that the FBI would retrieve the HSCA copies, effect,

if feasible, a word-by-word review of the classified portions and

words which

could result in the declassification of the documents.

The revised version of each document, along with copies that were

classified originally, will be returned to the HSCA, which can compare

the two versions to determine if the unclassified documents are adequate

for use in public hearings. Hearings concerning the documents in

Group 2 are scheduled to commence 11-17-78. Prior to that date, HSCA

representatives will meet with FBIHQ classification personnel to

discuss documents as to any issues the word-by-word review fails to

resolve.

To advise you results of inquiry made of Headquarters and Field

Mr. Blakey's allegations.

DETAILS:

EX-IL4 REC5062-117290-1324

By letter dated 9/26/78, G. Robert Blakey, Chief Counsel and Director,

HSCA, directed a letter to Attorney General Bell in which he expressed concern

of possible physical endangerment to two committee witnesses, Oliver Patterson,

Jr., and Clarence Haynes. Mr. Blakey continued in his letter that the FBI

was notified that the committee had information indicating possible physical

harm to Mr. Patterson and Mr. Haynes by Jerry Ray, a St. Louis, Missouri,

area bank robber and brother of convicted assassin James Earl Ray.

Mr. Blakey stated that in his letter the FBI was apprised and in view of the

fact that the information had come from a confidential source of the committee,

it was absolutely necessary that neither Mr. Patterson nor Mr. Haynes learn

that the committee had ultimately provided this information; and it was under-

stood by the committee that the FBI would have the Agents advise Mr. Patterson

and Mr. Haynes of this possible endangerment to them without any indication

that the committee was the original source of the information.

NOV 27 ^7A

Mr. Blakey's letter continued that the committee had received informa-

tion that the FBI did not act responsibly in the treatment or dissemination of

this information and, as a result, a source of the committee may have been

compromised. The information allegedly regarding the endangerment was

cingular in nature and could be attributed only to a committee source a one

other person.

Mr. Haynes was also in danger.

above caption dated 9/29/78, these Field Divisions were requested to respond

to Mr. Blakey's allegations and have done-so by subsequent communications.

Oliver Patterson, Jr., was interviewed by sAs Dennis D. Mattes and John P.

Joyce of the St. Louis Office who in signed affidavits acknowledged the inter-

view with Mr. Patterson; however, denied identifying the HSCA as a source

of any information. SA Mattes states that during the interview with

Mr. Patterson, he asked Mr. Patterson if he (Patterson) knew Clarence Haynes,

to which Mr. Patterson replied in the negative. SA Joyce is currently on

special assignment in the Louisville Division. He also denied revealing to

Mr. Patterson during interview that the HSCA was the source of information

concerning or initiating the interview. Both SAs Mattes and Joyce advised

they did not inform Mr. Patterson directly that Mr. Haynes may be a victim

of a retaliatory act.

SAs Paul Babuchna, Jr., and James T. McManus, assigned to the

Alton, Illinois, Resident Agency, Springfield, Division, furnished sworn

affidavits denying the disclosure of the source of information (HSCA) during

their interviews with Clarence Haynes residing in Granite City, Illinois.

Both SAs Babuchna and McManus advised that they notified U. S. Probation

Officer James Parker of their desire to interview Haynes in order to locate

him. SA Babuchna also notified Granite City Police Department Detective

Anthony Eck of the possibility of physical harm to Haynes. Both SAs Babuchna

and McManus denied ever discussing this information with any representative

of the news media.

Legal Counsel John Mintz in contact with Supervisory SAs Ronald Heller

and Section Chief Danny O. Coulson determined that neither had divulged or

disclosed information concerning the committee to any news media representa-

tives.

Memorandum to Mr. Adams

Re:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE

ON ASSASSINATIONS (HSCA)

Assistant Director Donald W. Moore, Criminal Investigative Division,

advised that in interviews with Deputy Assistant Director James O. Ingram,

Supervisor Joseph A. Krahling and SA James D. Carey that each assured

Mr. Moore they had absolutely no contact with the news media regarding

this matter. SAs Krahling and Carey also advised that during their telephonic

contacts with the Field regarding this matter, each Field Office was cautioned

that in no way should the source of this HSCA information be attributed to the

HSCA.

It is noted that information was furnished to the Kansas City Field

Division for informational purposes only. This information was closely

held within the Kansas City Office and no investigative activity was generated

as a result of the aforementioned teletype of 9/29/78.

Inspector Boynton, Public Affairs Office, advised the following

personnel of his office, as well as himself, denied the unauthorized disclosure

of the HSCA information to anyone, including members of the news media, in

the Washington, D. C., area: Thomas B. Coll, Thomas J. Harrington,

David E. Cassens, Stephen D. Gladis and Jeffrey W. Maynard.

In summary, it has been determined through interviews of appropriate

personnel that no member of either the Fieldor Headquarters was responsible

for any unauthorized disclosure to the news media regarding HSCA information

nor was the HSCA source compromised by any of our personnel.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the aforementioned information be furnished by Mr. Adams to

Mr. Blakey in response to his letter of 9/28/78.

AFRIL 4, ATLANTA

by Mark Lane

Artaur Murtagi, the vetcran FBI agont, said:

Theday that King was shot, I was at the officc, Icav-

ing for the day, with an FBI agent who was at the

supcrvisory level. He was a young man, twenty-nine

to thirty-two years old, handsome, nice disser-

rcasonably intelligent and the women were crazy

about him in the office. Ic was friendly with me.

We heard the announcement, that King had been

shot, as we vero preparing to leave. This agent

jumped for joy, literally laped in the air, yelling,

'They got. Zorro! They got the son of a bitch! I hope

he dies!"

As we punched our salmon-colored cards out, the

agent explained to me how King was nothing but a

"Goddamn Communist" troubiemaker anyway. Then

wve heard that King had died. Again, he was elated.

He just went crazy with joy.

I said,

"For Christ's sake, they killed a gicat

icader," and as we walked to the parking lot, we had

158

HH. 55039 DocId: P46-792-9-9

CODE NAME "ZORRO"

• 159

a discussion. The agent told me how King had been

ruining the United States; that he was dividing our

people; that he was Communist-dominated; and that

"if the lazy goddamned niggers had worked,

in-

stead of demonstrating, they could make it just like

anybody eise in this country-for example, the Ital-

ians and the Irish!"

Following the murder of Dr. King a number of Ameri-

can cities were set on fire. The Attorney Goncral was able

to view part of the conflagration in Washington, D.C. A

federal

decision was made to investigate the crime.

Murtagh said that the Department of Justice called upon

the FBI to investigate. Hoover sent the request to the

SAC in Atlanta. The SAC there turned it over to the in-

telligence unit- the Destroy King Squad. The very people

who had illogally harassed him when he was alive, includ-

ing the agent who celcbrated when he died, were really

in charge of the investigation. Memphis had the early Icad

material. The Bureau in Washington directed the early

stages of the investigation. But it ivas directed out of At-

lanta by the Destroy King Squad after a day or two.

Telctype leads would come in, and the case supervisor

would assign the leads to various agents. "Now the assigu-

ing of leads would make a lot of difierence," said Murtagh.

"Up until civil rights were pushed hard in the sixties, I

was never assigned to civil rights work at all. Only when

they got to the point where they had to get some answers

would they assion anybody like me. They had been as

signing old-time Southera agents to handle civil rights

How did the fact that those assigned to investigate

King's death had been members of the get-King Squad

aflect that etiort? "I think they might not have gotten the

right answer on a lot of these things simply because there

was no will to get the right answer." said Murtagh. "They

didn't want to ask the right questions. The fecling against

King, in the Burcau, was so strog," said Murtagh, that

if the Burcau had had advance information of an assas-

sination plot against King,

and no onc else know about it they would sit on it.

And Ict King get killed

The Burcau wanted to get the investigation

wrapped up and get out of it. I think there was senti-

ment in the Bureau, also-an extreme sentiment, at

all costs, to keep the blacks from making any in-

roads.

I would not depend on an investigation, by the

people I knew, to be very accurate. Statements came

out from the Bureau, within twenty-four hours of

each killing, that there was no conspiracy involved in

the deaths of President Kennedy, Dr. King, and

Bobby Kennedy.

I talked about conspiracy in Atlanta regarding

King, and thought about it in the Kennedy case. I

was told that tve weren't to think about conspiracy.

Our jurisdiction was very flimsy anyway, since King

wasn't a government official. What were we doing

investigating it?

I feel it was a political decision. I don't think the

crime was ever investigated. In fact, I'm convinced it

was never investigated. It wasn't investigated like the

Mississippi killings, it wasn't investigated like

Hoffa disappearance. It wasn't even investigated as

well as King was, when he was alive. I think even-

tually, if everybody keeps pushing, eventually some

way, sometime, the whole thing will break open—

you'll probably find a conspiracy.

Maybe it's a movement. You've got to be able to

think in terms of the fiendish minds of people in

counterintelligence. If we're right, the King killing

was some kind of a counterintelligence scheme,

cooked up by somebody and it could be anybody.

It could be anyone who could manipulate things in

such & way to get them to happen. I think it can be

done, and I think it was done.

There are too many questions about Oswald and

Ray. How did they get all the way across the coun-

try? And where the hell did the money come from?

How did they have their identities covered? No guy

like Ray can do that sori of thing on his own. It jus!

didn't happen that way.

Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

On November 7, 1978 in response to a request by the

House Select Committee on Assassinations dated February

Federal Bureau of Investigation provided the Committee with

a two volume set of photographs of FBI agents who were assigned

to Atlanta in 1968.

Prior to the delivery of these volumes, representatives of

the FBI indicated that four (4) photographs were unobtainable

through the agents personal files.

They further stated that

said the eat me ence see coms assigne to the security

informed that every effort would be made to obtain other photo-

graphs of these agents.

At the time of delivery and in subsequent conversations,

the Committee was assured that the two volumes contained, along

with "fillers", photographs of all agents assigned to Atlanta for

the requested period.

Thus the ominous noted in paragraph two

were corrected.

A troubling aspect of the pictures provided, however, was

that one photograph, number 16, is markedly different from the

rest both in quality and the age of the person at the time the

photograph was made.

62

1117290-1351

If this picture was, in fact,

that of a member of the security

squad, serious questions are raised about the fairness of the

photographs supplied and the resulting ability of the Committee

to effectively employ them for the purpose of identification.

It is requested

that the FBI state one (1) whether the

person who appears in the photograph was a member of the security

squad

and two (2) if he is a former agent named Jack Rose.

In

addition, to complete the written record with respect to this

response, the Committee requests that the Bureau provide the

Committee with an unsealed list of names of the agents depicted

in the photographs, without any correlation to the numbers of

the photographs, as well as a

that the FBI provide the Committee with

the name of an agent

Mr. Blakey stated that in order to determine the credi-

bility of the witness who made these allegations, it was

necessary for the Committee to display to him the

to select any photograph as being identical to or

resembling any of the Special Agents assigned to the

Atlanta Division during that period and was requested to

furnish more details regarding the allegations.

declined to furnish any further information.

On 10/6/78 this matter was discussed with

Mr. Michael Shaheen, Office of Professional Responsibility

tions of misconduct or illegal activities by an employee

of the FBI, this matter should be brought to the attention

Of OPR, DOJ.

On 10/6/78 Mr. Keuch advised that he concurred

with Mr. Shaheen and instructed that before any photographs

were delivered to the Committee, they must first furnish

the nature and the details of the allegations to DOJ for

Division.

Mr. Blakey advised that the Committee was pursuing

mate inquiry fully within their Congressional mandate to

fully investigate the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King, JI.,

and stated that, if necessary, the Committee will secure a

On 10/25/78 Mr. Keuch advised that after

discussing this matter with Mr. Blakey, he believes that

ADDENDUM:

RECORDS MANAGEMENT DIVISION 11/6/78 TWB: jmn

On 11/3/78, members of the Congressional Inquiry Unit,

Records Management Division discussed the proposed use of

the list of Special Agents, possession of which is to be

given to Mr. Blakey. It is the position of this Unit that

Mr. Blakey being given this list serves no useful purpose,

and may tend to compromise the identity or privacy of those

Agents whose identity is of no interest to the Committee.

The only reason for the list to be retained by Mr. Blakey

Is to assure that all Special Agents of the Atlanta Office

were represented in the photo spread, however, as the

House Select Committee on Assassinations has not previously

requested or received a list of Atlanta Agents no means of

verification by comparision is possible.

It is recommended by the Congressional Inquiry Unit

Reference is made to your letter dated September 26,

1978, addressed to the Attorney General and marked for my

attention. You expressed concern regarding FBI handling of infor-

mation furnished by your Committee concerning possible physical

endangerment to two Committee witnesses, Oliver B. Patterson

and Clarence Haynes, and requested an internal inquiry be conducted

to ascertain if Patterson was advised that the Committee was the !

source of the information related to him and if he was advised that

Haynes was also endangered. You also requested that the appropriate

FBI personnel in Washington be interviewed to ascertain if informa-

tion concerning Patterson was improperly related to members of

the media.

An appropriate inquiry has been conducted and the Special

Agent personnel who conducted the interviews have furnished affidavits

attesting to the fact that they conformed to Bureau instructions and

did not advise either Patterson or Haynes of the fact that the Committee

was the source of the information that they might be in danger. It

should be noted in this regard that prior to the interview of Patterson

the Committee contacted him to inform him he would be contacted by

the FBI and he could have readily deduced the fact that the Committee

was the source of the information furnished him by the FBI, During

the interview with Patterson, he was asked if he knew Haynes, to

which he réplied in the negative. The Agents conducting the interview

have explained that Patterson was asked about Haynes in order to

ascertain Haynes' whereabouts as expeditiously as possible.

Patterson was not advised directly that Haynes may also be a victim

believed Patterson came to this conclusion.

Inquiries made at FBI Headquarters as well as in the

field of persons knowledgeable concerning this matter have not

concerning this matter,

I have been advised that Associate Director Adams orally

King probers

hear ex-agent

WASHINGTON (AP) - A former FBI agent tearful-

ly testified yesterday that the bureau conducted "a 10-

year vendetta" against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and

then botched its investigation of his assassination by

ignoring the possibility of conspiracy

But the House Assassinations Committee said there

is no evidence that the bureau played any direct role in

King's murder.

The panel's chief counsel said the only FBI role ir

King's death might be "possible indirect involvement:"

such as the possibility that the F BI's campaign to harass

and discredit King resulted in his presence in Memphis,

where he was assassinated.

The comments came as the committee began a four-

day public inquiry on allegations against the FBI.

*

Arthur Murtaugh, a former agent with the FBI in

Atlanta and now a college professor, testified that before

King was assassinated, the Atlanta FBI had 15 agents

assigned to electronic surveillance of the civil rights

After the murder, Murtaugh said, the investigation

was assigned to the intelligence division, not the criminal

division

. "It just defies reason to say that the same peopl

ho have engaged in a 10-year vendetta against Dr. King

should investigate his murder," Murtaugh told the com-

mittee.

He also said the investigation was made routine as

soon as James Earl Ray was identified as the assassin

and as a fugitive to be caught.

The idea that anyone beyond Ray was involved "was

pooh-poohed from the very beginning, Murtaugh said

'The bureau decided 24 hours after King was killed i

was not a conspiracy

Murtaugh broke into tears twice as he recounted the

campaign of wiretaps and dirty tricks designed to dis-

credit King and reduce his influence among blacks.

"It is not with pleasure that I, sit here and tell you

things about an organization I spent a lifetime in." he

said, as the committee room hushed.

Date of transcription

10/31/78

GEORGE BEN EDMONDSON was contacted at his home,

Route 2, Box 179, Walla Walla, Washington (509-525-2126),

where he is living under the assumed name of ALEX P.

BORMANN and employed by the Boise Cascade Company..

EDMONDSON was advised of the Bureau policy requiring

its own Waiver for the release of information and that such a

Waiver would authorize the Bureau to release all information

concerning him, even that which had previously been considered

confidential. EDMONDSON acknowledged that he understood the

Bureau policy and specifically stated that it was his under-

standing that his 1959 confidential FBI file would be released

to the House Select Committee on Assassinations, if so requested.

EDMONDSON also expressed concern that the House Select

Committee on Assassinations

would not be able to maintain proper

control of the information in his file, pointing out that

investigators for the Committee, to whom he has spoken, appear

to be a little young and lacking in experience.

EDMONDSON

stated,

however, that he would continue cooperate with the

Committee, and executed the following Waiver authorizing

release of information:

"AUTHORITY TO RELEASE INFORMATION

"I hereby authorize any Special Agent or other

authorized representative of

• the Federal Bureau of Investi-

gation bearing this release, to furnish to the House Select

Committee on Assassinations

all information in its possession

concerning me, including those records pertaining to my confi-

dential relationship with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

I realize that by authorizing this release I will disclose to

the House Select Committee on Assassinations any confidential

relationship I may have had with the FBI.
