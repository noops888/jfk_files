MEMORANDUM EOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: (S) Destruction of Surveillance Tapes

1. (S)

There has been a long standing interest in locating

the surveillance tapes that would have existed during the

period that Oswald visited Mexico City.

search has been conducted of the DO's record system as

well as the index to the retired records in an attempt to

locate the tapes in question.

We have discussed this

with operational experts and the professional opinion is

that it is most likely these tapes were never captured

and returned to Headquarters for retention. The normal

practice is to reuse the tapes and only save the

transcripts that are made

from the tapes.

The time

before the tapes are reused can be a very short.

Messages between field stations and Headquarters use

operational jargon and shortened sentence

structures that

can sometimes allow for misinterpretations.

Thus, the

reference to what was being sent to headquarters may not

have intended to refer to the fact that actual tapes were

being sent but rather the information from the tapes.

2. (S)

In our search efforts we did locate tapes

captured for the immediate time following the

assassination.

The fact that these tapes were captured

and returned could allow for the fact that a few people

recall that some tapes existed.
