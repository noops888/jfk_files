Title: SECURITY FOR THE JFK TASK FORCE'S

NEW LOCATION, ROOM 11144

Synopsis: The JFK Task Force (JFKTF) is relocating to room 11144

by mid July 1997. Due to the sensitive records maintained by the

JFKTE, a card key reader is being requested for access to room

11144.

Details: The JFKTF is relocating to room 11144 by mid July 1997.

The nature of the JEKTE work requires maintenance of over 200

file cabinets of FBI records including Special File Room and

Personnel records. The JFKTF maintains a large volume of

classified records as well as its own sensitive indices for

research purposes.

Due to the JEKTE having a personnel count of 70

employees and the impracticality of an employee watching the

entrance at all times, a card reader is being requested for the

entrance to room 11144.
