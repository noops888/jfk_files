SA 105-2886

Title:

John F. Kennedy Records Collection

Act of

1992

Synopsis: Original SA file 105-2886 enclosed to FBIHO to be made

available to the National Archives and Records Administration.

Enclosures: Original SA file 105-2886.

Details:

By EC dated 03/07/1997 FBIHQ requested San Antonio to

forward

files pertaining to a John Thomas Massen. A search of SA

indices was negative for this name.

on 03/10/1997 Debbie Beatty, JFK Task Force, FBIHQ,

advised she had records indicating the SA file number

for Massen

was either 105-1886 or 105-2886. Subsequently SA determined that

file 105-2886 is captioned "John Thomas Masen, IS - Cuba;

Neutrality Matter" which appears responsive to the FBIH request.

SA indices negative re John Thomas Masen except for above

decribed file.

A copy of the enclosed file has been made and will be

maintained by San Antonio for record purposes.

No further action being taken by San Antonio.
