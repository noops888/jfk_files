3. Proceasing of LIENVOY Information. The only change in the LlENVOY

processing during this period was the addition of another line!

J. Elena

VAZQUEZ Gomez, to those lines from which LIE:VOY transcribers provide

full Spaniah transcripts.

This was to support a Headquarters PBRUMEN/ AMROD

request and places a heavy burden on the three transcribers who are also doing

full transcripto of the eleven otner lines noted in reference. During June/July

1904, there were lazz tapes recorded from which 1:38 pages of text were

transcribed. In addition, 230 pages of lest were transcribed in the daily

"resumen" which consieted of only the significant conversating from lines

not fully transcribed.

1. Exploitalion of lIEt:VOY Information. In carly June tho Firel of a lask

frIce of lour persons from SR Division arrived at the Mexico Sration to begin

collating information on Soviet Embagay personnel. This daln was largely

collected from LIONVOY over the past four years and has remained in the

Station files in the absence of personnel for proper processing and exploitation.

MEXI-2705 provided information for a potential REDCOAT LCIMPROVE

recruitment.

MEX1-9757 reported travel uf Soviet officials to lie Mexican-United

States borier area to j'urchase à ew car jl May to - June. The information

on Soviet ind Suvict Satellite travel is reported eirruslaneously to the local

Embassy Political Section aud lo the Office uf the Legal Attache where it is

again reported by them to their respective Washington ricaiquariers ae well as

back to time Mexico Station.

NEXI-9710 reported that a PNG target, Naday Sergeyevich LEONOV,

was returning PCS to tne USSR.

MEXI-97us reported iravel 10 the USSR of Pascual GUTIERREL Roldan,

NEXI-9613. 9330 and 0412 reported U.S. citizen Ray SPEDDING Was

trying lo arrange through the Soviet knibassy la Moxico for permissio to Bo 1u

the USSR.. (Subsequently, in late August 190%, the Moxican prese reported that

SPEDDING had committed suicide in liverl Edison.)

LENVOY was of considerable value in monitoring the reaction to

AMSTRUT-? defection and also was of value in monitoring the activities of

AMSTET-L.

In addition to these roported individually, several othor U•S, Citizen

contacted both the Cuban and Soviet Embassies.

When identified, these names

were reported lo ileadquarters and in come cases to the Office of the Legal Attache.

MEXI-020• revealed a contact by Ana Luisa DURAND, Puerto Rican,

and the Cuban Embasay regarding a teaching position in Cuba.

MEXI-0327 and 042t reported that the Czechs intended to open an

Embassy in Costa Rica.

5. Liaison. CURTIS had several meetings during this period with LIENVOY-

and LIELEGANT. Subjects discusaed were reported by cabler.

viato perone y sly, re resenated he poeto General's Otice

outside the Station with Arnold E. AREMART. Thoy appeared to be pleased

with the project and recommended that Siall Agent AREHAR'T be given a promotion.

Thomae W. LUND, Mesico Branch Chief, visited the Mexico City

Station 16-19 July and was given a general briefing on LIENVOY.

MEXI-OZUe reported the desire of the wife of Orville 1IORSFALL 10

obtain employment as'the Belgian Embassy. As a result a this and for better

security in transporting the LIENVOY reels each day, HORSFALL was eliminaled

from LIENVOY as a courier. He still has tourist cover and it was felt unnecossary

to take the risk of an automobile accident or exposure of his early morning

meetings by accident or design should the Belgians conduct an investigation or

neighborhood check.

Such exposure could be most embarrasing uuring the pre-

election period d LITEMPO-?. RIGGS and AREHART again resumed the daily

deliveries of reels to the transcribers or their care officer. The risk of an

accident is always present but both RIGGS and AREHART have some cover which

should prevent examination of their briefcases.

The wife of Douglas J. FELGLASS was employed to assist with

LIENVOY translation and transcription duties, freeing FEINCLASS to concentrate

on assessment and characterization reports on Soviet Embasey persomel as well

as building up a library of voice recordings.
