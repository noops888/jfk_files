Of TRAFFICANTE and BRUNO at Junior's Restaurant on 5/15/63.

The Bureau has advised relative to MARTIN JONES, an eX-FBI

Agent being reportedly associated with MARK HAWES, Attorney at

St. Petersburg, Floria, that MARTIN JAMES JONES entered on duty as

a Special Agent 10/11/51 and his resignation (with prejudice) was

accepted 10/18/62 and therefore it was not desirable at this time

The New York Office has advised by referenced letter that in

view of the sensitive nature of the investigation of JOSEPH T.

ARCURI, members of the ARCURI family were not being interviewed
