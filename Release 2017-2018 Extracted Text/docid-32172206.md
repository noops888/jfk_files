(see attached column from the Washington Post of 26 June

1964); a complete statement of the Soviet line on Ken-

nedy's

death is to be found in a book called "Where do

the Tracks Lead?" [Kuda vedut sledyl by A. IORYSH and

B. SERGEYEV, which was submitted for publication on 2 Sep-

his book spells out the theory of a righ

ing conspiracy in great detail. HIt is interesting i

this connection that the surname of one of the two

authors,

SERGEYEV, is identical with the alias used by SITNIKOV

in his contacts with both Pierre Salinger and Donald

Brennan.

In any event, aside from the existence of a

KGB commission to consider the problem, none of the find

that the iden-

This Agency firmly believes

that NOSENKO did

between the KGB and OSWALD, and that NOSENKO's story on

OSWALD is a KGB-prepared message. Similarly, this Agency

believes that SHAMROCK'S
