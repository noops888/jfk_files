RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

' INCOME TAXES

'A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)

which will enable informants and sources to pay their Federal income tax on

monies received from the Bureau without jeopardizing their security. This plan

will go into effect immediately in the San Francisco and Philadelphia Offices for

a trial period of one year. Payments for services to certain security informants

and sources will be subject to a twenty per cent withholding tax. No tax is to be

withheld from payments made (1) to other than security informants and sources,

(2) for reimbursement of expenses, (3) under the authority of the SAC or (4) to

informants who have been able to report Bureau income on their Federal tax

returns without jeopardizing their security or without challenge from IRS. In

the latter instance, the Bureau must be advised as to the identity of each

informant and the method used by him to report his Bureau income.

Proper records must be maintained of amounts withheld and such

amounts must be placed in a special checking account. "At the end of the tax

year, the tax liability will be determined on money paid by the Bureau to those

informants from whom tax has been withheld. Necessary adjustments will be

worked out with the informants and the net amount withheld forwarded to the

Bureau.

This money will be turned over to a special representative of IRS

without disclosure as to identities of informants, except for coded numbers.

These numbers can later be used for identification purposes in the event it

becomes necessary to substantiate income tax payments.

Other offices may now utilize the withholding system where it

would be helpful; however, where it is not used, continue to instruct all informants

to pay their taxes on income received from the Bureau by such method as may

be proper and feasible.

Detailed instructions and exhibits are enclosed concerning the

procedure to be followed in the accounting and control of money withheld.

WITHHOLDING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX

FROM PAYMENTS TO INFORMANTS AND SOURCES

INSTRUCTIONS AND PROCEDURES

Introduction:

A system has been worked out with the Internal Revenue Service

(IRS) which will enable Informants and sources to pay their Federal

income tax on monies received from the Bureau without jeópardizing

their security. This will require the withholding of twenty per cent

of any payments being made to such individuals for services rendered.

Money so withheld will be immediately deposited to a special checking

account, to be used for this purpose only, set up in the name of the

SAC and ASAC. This account should, in possible, be in a different bank

than that in which the regular office Confidential Fund (blue slip) or

Double Agent (white slip) accounts are maintained. Any bank charges

incidental, to this special checking account are to be paid from the

regular office Confidential Fund. •Attached to these instructions are

10 Exhibits which are to be used as guides in setting up records for

the maintenance and operations of the withholding accounts. Hereafter,

any teference to informants refers to both informants and sources.

This plan will apply only to those informants or groups of

informants authorized by the Bureau.

Accounting Instructions:

When a payment is to be made to an informant subject to this

plan, the amount to be withheld for income tax purposes will be

twenty per cent of the total for services. A check will' be drawn on

the regular office Confidential Fund to cover the total amount of the

authorized payment.

This check will be cashed and the amount for taxes

Immediately deposited in the special checking account set up for this

purpose.

A duplicate deposit slip is to be obtained for use in posting

to the ledger accounts. Payment to the informant will then follow and

the receipt to be executed by the informant for such payment should show

not only the amount received as reimbursement for expenses and the

authorized payment for services, but also the amount withheld for

Enclosures (10)

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 35

## Page 36

Federal income tax purposes (Exhibit 1). A Record of Income Tax

Transactions (Exhibits 2 'and 3) will be maintained on a calendar-year

basis to record the informant's name, symbol number, period covered,

and the amounts'incidental to such transactions. Beginning with the

first payment to an informant involving tax withholding, a new

indiVidual ledger sheet (Exhibits 4 and 5) must be set up. The amount

of money withheld for income tax purposes should also be listed on

the Blue Slip, Form FD 37, prepared with respect to the payment

(Exhibit 6).

At the end of each month, entries in the Record of Income Tax

Transactions and the individual informant's ledgers will be totaled

and reconciled. A monthly report (Exhibit 7) is to be mailed to the

Bureau in the same manner as the reports for the regular office

Confidential Fund, no later than the 20th of the following month. All

payments involving the tax account must be vouchered prior to the

submission of this report.

In the event an informant subject to this plan is transferred

to another field division, all records must be forwarded to the new

field division, together with a check for the amount of income tax

withheld.

Determining Informant's Tax Obligation:

At the end of the tax year, the contacting Agent will obtain

from the informant his compieted Federal income tax return based on his

regular income, exclusive of money paid to him by the Bureau. The

contacting Agent will not question the accuracy of the return except to

point out obvious errors. The contacting Agent will furnish the

informant's tax return to a qualified Special Agent Accountant who will

prepare a separate return to include Bureau income. The accountant will

compute the tax owed by informant on the combined earnings. The

difference between the tax computed by the informant and that computed

by the accountant will represent the amount of tax to be paid by the

informant on money received from the Bureau. The accountant who

prepared the return will sign on the line "Signature of Preparer Other

Than the Taxpayer." The contacting Agent will have the informant sign

the return prepared by the accountant as a certification that the

informant has reviewed it and found it correct in every respect. The

informant will file his original tax return with the Internal Revenue .

Service (IRS). The return

prepared by the accountant, together with a

Photostat of the informant's original return, will be maintained in the

informant's subfile.

## Page 37

If the amount withheld from payments to the informant during

the year exceeds the amount of tax for his Bureau income, the refund

due the informant will be withdrawn from the special checking account

and paid to him at the time he signs the return prepared by the

accountant. A receipt (Exhibit 8) must be obtained from him. If the

amount withheld during the year is not sufficient to cover the tax on

Bureau income, the difference should be collected from the informant

and a statement (Exhibit 9)

obtained from him. Entries for any

adjustments, either refunds or additional payments, must be made in

both the informant's ledger (Exhibits 4 and 5) and the Record of

Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) for the calendar year involved.

Instructions to Informants:

The contacting Agent must, fully explain the withholding

procedure to any informant concerned. With regard to the informant's

original tax return, the informant should clearly understand that

(1) neither the contacting Agent nor the Special Agent Accountant is

In any way certifying to its accuracy, (2) if his original tax return

is questioned by IPS, it will be up to him to settle the matter with

IRs, and he cannot plead that it has been examined and approved by an

Agent of the FBI, since such"

statement'is false and the informant would

be uncovered.

Transmittal of Tax to Bureau:

After all adjustments have been made in the income tax

withholding or payments to informants, a report of Federal Income Tax

Deductions (Exhibit 10) will be prepared. The net amount of the tax

indicated on the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2) will

be withdrawn from the special checking account by means of a check made

payable to the Chief Clerk, FBI.

This report and check will be forwarded

to the Bureau, together with receipts for refunds that have been made

showing the transmittal of the tax funds to the Bureau should be made in

the Record of Income Tax Transactions (Exhibit 2). When received at

the Bureau, the tax money will be turned over to a special representative

of IRs with the amounts 'for each informant identified by a coded number;

thus, the informant's connection with the FBI will be protected.

However, the coded number can be used for identification purposes in

the event it becomes necessary to substantiate the informant's income tax

payment.

RE: SECURITY INFORMANTS AND SOURCES -

- INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 64-E dated July 6, 1964, advised that

effective January 1, 1965, all field divisions must utilize the Bureau

Federal income tax withholding plan for payments to security informants

and sources. In order to place the plan in effect, you were to discuss

the matter with each informant and source where circumstances warranted

using the procedure and advise the Bureau by November 1, 1964, of the

identity of each exempted informant and the, method used by each such

individual in reporting his Bureau income.

Communications being received from the field indicate that

the plan is being utilized for many informants but, at the same time,

there are a great many instances where the informant has not had any

difficulty in reporting his Bureau income in the past-and, therefore,

these informants are being exempted by the field from the withholding

plan. The procedure was devised by the Bureau to afford informants

a method of reporting Bureau income in a secure manner and should

be utilized wherever necessary to prevent any embarrassing situations

in the future such as those which occur when an informant finds it

necessary to disclose his receipt of income from the FBI in response

to inquiries from Internal Revenue Service or it is later found that

taxes have not been paid on Bureau income. There should be no further

instances of this type and you are reminded that if situations do arise

in the future where it is learned informants are not reporting Bureau

income and they have not used the withholding procedure, administrative

action will be considered by the Bureau in each such case.

This type informant includes members of the underworlds those who closely

are madams, prostitutes, pimps, fetces,

The listing of an individual as an approved Bureau informant is dependent

upon whether ue or

she can regularly furnish valuable crininal information.

In most instances

an individual will be approved who has:

Furnished worth-while information in two or more Bureau cases

Furnished worth-while information

in one Bureau case and betier

One of the most important responsibilities of an Agent is the identi-

fication of prospective

criminal informants and the developnent of pros

pective informants to the point where they will regularly contribute

information to the Bureau.

Criminal informants are used to:

juvaio jugiüires duu wainesses

Advise of general criminal

Informants are developed from those who volunteer to be of assistanca;

from subjects in cases investigated; from persons interviewed

during

investigations; and from selected prospects who are clearly in a posi

tion to obtain

worth-while information.

Their development fregently

requires patient, protracted effort to find a basis for persuadin.

Care must be exercised in

attempting to persuade individuals

informants to avoid any allegations of undue influence.

who is in custody and who offers to furnish information generally does

so in the hope that he will receive some consideration in return.

Bureau Agents cannot promise any immunity or any reduction in sentence

to a criminal who furnishes information and they must not put themselves

in a position where they might subsequently be accused of having done so.

5.

Once an individual has started to cooperate and furnishes information

. of value, his continued cooperation can freguently be assured through

payments

for services rendered and information furnished,

be no reluctance in recommending substantial payments to

supply substantial assistance, if such payments are necessary to obtain

the assistance.

60

Another impostant factor in the initial problem of getting a potential

informant started is the appreciation for fair and impartial treciment

sometimes generated during the handling of a case.

Agents must be alert

to recognize such feelings on the part of subjects and to capitalize

indicate in any manner that he is appreciative,

and should be be qualified to act as a real informant by virtue of his

background and associates, then affirnative action should be taken to re-

contact him at frequent intervals fully to explore his potentialities.

Department.

Any deviation from this policy should be immediately brought to

the Bureau's attention.

On 7-10-52 the Department furnished an opinion regarding the question whether

an informant could be prosecuted for technically violating the law while

attempting to ohtain evidence regarding a Federal violation.

The Department

"...If the intent throughout was

The top echelon criminal informant

following categories:

Informants who are

members of la Cosa Nostra (LCN)

Informants who can

furnish significant information

regarding other

organized criminal groups

Informants who can furnish information which will enable the Bureau

to prosecute the hoodlum hierarchy

The development of informants who can provide information of this caliber

is mandatory to insure the Bureau meets its commitments.

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disbursements being made by special agents for which reim-

bursement is claired by blue slip that in many instances the

receipt is executed in the name of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbursement.

It is desired that whenever possible the receipt

be made in the name of the agent who pays the bill and who

will claim reimbursement. It is understood. that in all

instances this will noù se practical, for instance, if Agent

Smith makes arrangemerts for the rental of an apartrent for

surveillance purposes and he is later transferred from this

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

who pays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per-

sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimbursement there-

for. If the receipt is made out in the aame of an alias

boing used by the agent this fust should be amplained in tho

blue slip.

In those instances waere, payment is made to an

informant for services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning ard ending of the period should be

indicated on the blue slir.

This matter should be brought to the attention of

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips

sibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they

conform irith the above instructions. Close attention to this

matter iill obviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

Very truly yours,

• .

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

Aguido in Camigo of angiovia concidential expenaltures wnich bay at some

time be subject to question.

The Sureau refers Darticularly to those ex-

penditures made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expanditures made when it appeared that tire

ex-

penditures rade were out of line in so far as necessity for the securing..

of the information ras concerned.

growing up in the field for Special Agents in Charge to approve conridential

expenditures for log and 15% and other very minor amounts wnich probabl

should be subject io further scrutiny by the Special Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditures but eust insist that each Special Agent in Charge personally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction.

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently being perforred by a great many Special Agents, certain

necessary. experditures must be made in connection with physical surveil-

lances and lika matters; horever, it shouid be understood that a Special

Agent, in so far as food and entertainment are concerned, is under certain

roDErnspexpense at the present time, even

though he is not assigned to conridential

survaillances and when any charge is made for reimbursezent ior experditure.

Buymade is him in connection with the suscessful handling of a surveillance

united matter, only that portion of the charge which would be over and above his

sses regular living expenses should be submittea.

For your information, the Sujeau must certify to all confidential

expenditures as follows:

NW 55320 DocId:32989712 Page 59

"The confidertial information iten as above was paid in the

senting expenditures incurred in making secret investigations

of alleged plots anà conspiracies against the United States

Government, and that the detailed information has been

sub-

mitted ana is now and will be held in the confidential files

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will be open to

inspection for any purpose by the representative of the Comp-

troller General at any time he may decire."

The Bureau will continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reimcursesent any confidential expenditure shich does not ap-

pear to be fully anè thoroughly justified. The Bureau must, of course, in-

sist on each Special agent in Charge making it his personal responsibility:

without delegation to other subordinate employees the review of confidential

expenditures:

to definitely ascertain that the expenditure has been proger

and that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bena-

fit and advantage to the Government.

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present tise

.of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

fund and the submission of monunly reports in connection theremin.

You are anare, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential fund in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursemenus which

have been made during the current accounting period. .

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such sonthly staterents promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to othermise maintain an accurate

record upon the casis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent

in Charge may be definitely determined.

In this connection,

a review of blue slip itens received at

the Bureau over a period of time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature

of so-called "advances" to confidential infore-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companics

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to $20.

At the time the monthly statement is submitted by the field

office involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the

expenditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances.they

are inproperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 61

---

## Page 62

-2.

an accurate accounting on the part of the sureau

in respect thereto.

For. your guidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which outlines briefly and succinctly

the manner in mhich discursements, advances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent

monthly statenents prepared by

your office should de submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being claimed through blue

slips.

For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

" odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured. It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt attached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dered by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obiaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily avare of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so.

Hereafter,

confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and .

related luems utilizes in the conduce or various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis -

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the

field office inventories.

Accordingly, it is

desired that you forwarà to the Burcau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity of such equipment purchased

and presently in lse in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the Bureau's recoras.

Such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each

of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of

such equipment.

With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices will

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate nor-expendable receiving slips.

Such slips should indi-

cate that the iten was purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted

and

suspensions from the youchars will be made in those instances

where field offices lail to submit non-expendable receiving slips.

Accordingly,

desired that the non-exper

bes of furniture, bedding, and

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

• your immediate personal attention and supervision: It is expected

that

in the future there will be strict compliance with the foré-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies

may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

to make experditures from the field office

when Bureau authority has been granted for an experditure

of this naware, une field office is required to give such auchorization on the

confidential item submitted to reclaim the expenditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expendituree.

In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is noted that in rany instances there

will be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. .

In the future when authorization is grented for expenditures of this

nature, the An'nistrative Division must be advised.

In the field office is

granted authority by letter, a copy of the leiter must be made for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517. If authority is grantea telephonically, it will be necessary

that the osficial or supervisor granting the authority notify the Administrative

Division by nenorandim, giving the name of the verson to whom payment is authorizea

and the field office involved.

The above instructions are to be placed into effect immediately in order

to preclude the delay which is now being experienced. in determining nether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices were properly authorized.

should be received at the Bureau no later than the 20th of the following month.

•For your guidance in the preparation of future monthly reporis concern-

Ing Confidential Fund expenditures, there is enclosed a sample form which outlines

briefly the proper method of preparing the report. In addition, there is enclosed

a sample form which outlines the metrod which should be used to

It has

noted that in a great numbei

instances Special Agents

have not been sucmitting receipts to justify the

experditwes for which re-

Imbursements are being claired through blue slips.

The Bureau is awere of the

fact that receipts cannot be secured in each and every irstance, due to

exigoncies peculiar to certain types of activities, nevertheless, receipts

should be obtained wherever possible.

In connection with the preparation of the blue slips it has been

noted that some are being prepared too ruch in detail. In those instances. where

the payrent is made to an authorized reguler paid infomant, the following

Infornation is sufficient to support the claim:

1. Amount of payrent

2.

Hame and symbol

number of informant

L. Dato of authortzation letter or teletype

5. Period of payment

A sample forn reflecting the proper method for preparing a blue slip

1s attached,

The Bureau has also noted in many instances that Agents, when re-

claiming suspended blue slips, are reflecting in the toucher that the item was

suspended fron a previous voucher. It is pointed out that no reference should

De made to the previous voucher nos should the igent state that the item was

suspended unless he forwards the original Statement of Difference with the

voucher.

Iour attention is directed to the fact that the Bureau has only a

limited amount of lunds available to operate the Confidential Funds of the

field divisions, therefore, you should rake every effort to operate on your

present fund.

It is pointed out that a more frequent submission of Confidential

Fund vouchers will help to maintain a higher balance in the fund.

In the future when an office desires to establish a Confidential

Fund, it will be necessary that the office urnish the Bureau full anà complete

justification.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein your

Immediate personal attention and supervision.

Tery truly yours,

John Edgar Hoover

Director

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 9, 1954

RASHINGTON 25, D.C.

RE: CONPIDENTIAL FUND

ACCOUNTING ERCCEDURES -

FBI. FORIT BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed by the various field divisions which were

förwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and

from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for handling

the operations of the confidential Funds maintained by the various

field divisions should be established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accpunting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

I. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall

be

used to reflect any transactions

that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field. division. Transactions that

muulù affeci unis runa are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau.

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from

the Informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures irom the confidential fund as the total amount to

be accounted for.

utilized to

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

reflect all cash transactions which affect the total

lund. This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached samole

(Exhibit Number To), which reflects examples of various transactions

which will arfect the Fund.

This ledger should be retained Indefi-

nitely and should be used as the basis for the preparation of the

monthly report.

All columns should

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward.

column Number

One should reflect all cash recelpts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the Fund except any refunds made to the Bureau.

All payments made

to criminal Informants and

sources should be reflected in the

column captioned "Criminal;" all payments to security informants

or sources should be reflected

in the column captioned

"Security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the afore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box rental, etc.

should be reflected in the column captioned "Miscellaneous.

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment. was of a criminal, security. or miscellaneous nature.

• Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases

should

be reflected in the

"Receipts" column; whereas any

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which •

must be returned to the Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the

"Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any temporary increase returned to the Bureau should

be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Iwo.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e., in either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column. Likewise, for every entry in the Casn Receipts

column, there

should

be a

corresponding entry in' one of the credit

columns, 1.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts from Bureau column.

_ It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "sum-

mary of payments to Informants" In connection with the monthly

report. The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the credit side of Column One

from the

total of the debit side of this column.

3. An Individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources. • This section

of the ledger should be divided into three parts; namely, Criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal informant and each paid

criminal confidential source. The security section should reflect

Under the Miscellaneous section, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,

regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the confidential

Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regular

• basis. Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on a

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization is made by

Bureau letter and the date of

the incoming letter when authorization

is made by stamping

"approved" on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the field division requesting authority.

Before making

any disbursements from the Confidential

Fund to an informant.

the authonization chould be chocked to 2o

sure that there 1s not a duplicate payment being made and that the

period covered by the payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization.

These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the

time they are received frcm

the Bureau.

In connection

with sAc authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

Is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July 1, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

f1le (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

•date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954,

form FD-228 should be removed from your form book and your supply

destroyed.

4. After a careful review of the many suggestions received

In response to SAC Letter Number 54-8, a form (FD-235) for request-

ing funas from the confidential Fund has been designed, a copy of

before any disbursement is made frcm the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the SAc and after the employee handling

the disburserents frcm the

fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

•form should be forwarded to the informant's file

and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be

divided into tro sections; namely, an unvouchered file ars a

vouchered file.

These fcrms can be used by the employee

responsible

for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue

slips for submission

io the Bureau.

Of course, these blue slips

should not be prepared until such

time as the receipt from the

informant 1s obtained from the Agent making the payment, and in

those cases where necessary, that FD-22i has been executed by the

Agent making the payment.

At the time the voucher is prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

ex that veuche

prepared

bursement is made, by the Bureau. At the time reimbursement is

received, the voucher should be

With regard to the summary of expenditures section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All Items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

C .

The explanation should reflect the

name and symbol number of the informant as

well as the period covered by the payment and

in case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted for

must be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.aum. An examole of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the Bureau. Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connestion with the summary of payments to informante.

you are advised that all miscellaneous payments must be listed

separately from payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion. This breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them should be included

under misceilaneous

expenditures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips. As was pointed out here-

tofore, the blue slip should be prepared from the Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment.to:the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the

payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant. A blue slip should be preparea at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the item

• have been

received from the Agent making the

payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

• proper review ol the expenditures. Samples are attached

(Exhibit Number Six), SAC authority (Exhibit Number Seven), and

miscellaneous expenditures (Exhibit Number Eight). These

samples

are general but should be used as a guide for precaring all blue

slips.

In addition to the attached samples, it is desired that

the following

be kept in mind in connection with the preparation

of blue slips:

a. One blue slip should be used for each

payment. It is not desired to have numerous

payments listed

on a single blue slip in view

of the possibility of error which would result

in the necessity of suspending the entire blue

s11p; whereas if only one payment were listed

on the blue sllp, It would

be possible to re-

turn only the one item and the remaining Items

could be processed for payment. "i

b.

The authority must be clearly reflected

on the blue slip.

When authority is based on

the letter from

the Bureaus

actual date of the

Bureau letter shall be used

as the date of the

Then the field office, by letter,

requests authorization and receives notice that

the date of the authorization in this instance

shall be the actual date of the field office let-

ter to the Bureau requesting the authorization.

The actual period of time covered by the

payment to the informant must be reflected in the

body of the blue slip.

For example, see

"Period"

six. It is

also essential that the period covered be carefully

compared with the Bureau authorization to prevent

exceeding the Bureau authorization, both by time

and amount.

Receipts should be obtained whenever

possible.

In instances where they are not obtained

either because of the

refusal of the informant to

execute one or when it is not advisable to obtain

one, the appropriate

notation should be reflected

on the blue slip.

d. FD-221 which is a receipt signed by the

Agent reflecting receipt of money from

only to be used when the receipt signed by the

informant reflects that payment was made by the Agent.

In all instances where the receipt signed

be claimed

on a voucher of the

Special Agent in

If the receipt reflects payment was made

to the informant by the Assistant Special Agent in

Charge, then reimbursement must be claimed on a

voucher of the Assistant Special Agent in Charge.

In instances where the receipt reflects that payment

was made to the informant by someone other than the

Special Agent in Charge or Assistant Special Agent

in Charge or where there is no payor designated, the

blue slip may be submitted for payment on the

voucher of either the Special Agent in Charge

approval of the Special Agent in Charge; however,

the Special Agent in Charge may delegate authority

to the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or an

approved field office supervisor to sign his name

as approving official followed by the initials of

the Assistant Special Agent in Charge or the

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A)

CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES -- I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing Manual

provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibility

of each Special Agent

• in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibility of Seat

of Government employees

to be judicious

in authorizing expenditures.

En ha mano and to practice propca euciving.

For your information, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine

the propriety of each expenditure and will trace

through the files information received and results obtainea,

following the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees Involved will reimburse the Government.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES

Reference is made to No Number SAC Letter 54-G which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau is now in receipt of a suggestion which it

felt will eliminate some duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug-

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants. It was suggested that the In

formants' files be checked and

the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954, be entered on the Informants' individual

ledger pages.

This would apply only to payments made under SAc authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will

save considerable

time and work in the field. and vou are accordinelv instructed

to put it in effect with the establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

the name used by the informant in signing a receipt for

payment must be explained

on the blue slip.

When a name

other than the Individual's full correct name is used in

Initial development as an Informant, his full correct name

should be used on the blue slip as soon as lt is known,

together with references to the previous names used in

contacts and payments by your office.

The above procedure 1s necessary to enable the

Bureau In mmert inviul carments and to make sure that

811 payments to one indiviaual are consolidated. It has

been noted in some instances that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the individual's middle name as a last

name. This is especially true in connection with Spanish

names.

This practice leads to the possibility of carrying

a separate account of payments under each name.

Make sure that the necessary employees of your

office are aware of this and the need for consistency.

In addition, where an Informant or Individual

lanown to have been formerly contacted by another division

18 pald by your division,

the blue slip claiming reimburse-

ment should refer to the fact that he is formerly from the

other division.

This 1s necessary to Insure that the

Eureau's accounts of payments are properly credited for

payments made.

(D) UTILIZATION OF FORM FD- 221a - INFORMANT MATTERS --

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

"the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and informant receipts.

The matter concerning security lor

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security.

You are, therefore, advised that it will not be neces-

sary to continue

Dear Sir:

It has been noted in connection with confidential

disbursements being made by special agents for which rein-

burserent is claired by blue slip that in many instances the

receipt is executed in the name of an agent or person other

than the agent claiming reirbarsement.

on ta do in to one

instances this mill noù se practical, for instance, if agent

Smith makes arrangerents for the rental of an apartment for

surveillance purposes

and he is later transferred from this

assignment the bill ordinarily will be continued in his name and

paid by another agent.

In instances such as this the agent

who pays the bill should certify on the receipt that he per

sonally paid same and that he is claiming reimbursement there-

for. If

the receipt is made out in the aame of an alias

boing used by the ugont this auct should be explainod in the

blue slip.

In those instances where, payment is made to an

informant for services rendered over a definite period the

date of the beginning ard ending of the period should be

indicated on the blue slir.

This natter should be brought to the attention of

all special agents under your supervision and the blue slips

sibmitted should be carefully checked by you to see that they

conform irich the above instructions.

Close attention to this

matter irill obviate the necessity for returning expense accounts

for correction.

QUANTICO

The Bureau has noted an increasing trend on the part of Special

time be subject to question.

The Bureas refars particularly to those ex-

penditures made by Special Agent personnel in the field service for enter-

tainment of confidential informants.

It has been necessary for the. Bureau in the past to refuse to re-

imburse certain Agents for expenditures made when it appeared that tre ex-

penditures made were out of line in so far as necessity for the secüring..

of the information ras concerned.

The Bureau has further noted a tendency

growing up in the field for Special Agents in Charge to approve confidential

expenditures for l0g and 15% and other very minor amounts which probably

should be subject io further scrutiny by the Spacial Agent in Charge.

The Bureau must not at any time routinely consider confidential

expenditures but eust insist that each Special Agent in Charge perscnally

review and approve such expenditures as are made by employees under his

jurisdiction.

It is understood that with the type of internal security

work presently being performed by a great lany Spacial Agents, certain

necessary. experditures must be made in connection with physical surveil-

lances and like maiters; however, it should be understood that a Special

Agent, in so far as food and entertainment are concerned, is under certain

I DErmisperpense at the present time, even

though he is not assigned to confidential

survaillances ard when any charge is mada for reimbursement for expenditira

BUymade by him in connection with the successful handling of a surveillance

united matter, only that portion of the charge which would be over and above his

Moros regular living expenses should be submittea.

..

"The confidantial information item as above was paid in the

interest of the Government service and that no other amount

has been paid lefore for the same purpose, the amount repre-

senting expenditures incurred in making

secret investigations

of alleged plots and conspiracies against the United States

Government, and that the detailed information has been sub-

mitted and is now and will be held in the confidential files

of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and will be open to

inspection for any purpose by the representative of the Comp-

troller General at any time he may desire."

The Bureau will continue its present policy of returning to any

Agent without reimcursesent any confidential expenditure which does not ap-

pear to be fully and thoroughly justified. The Bureau must, of course, in-

sist on each Social Agent in Charge making it his personal responsibility:

without delegation to other subordinate employees the review of confidential

expenditures: to definitsly ascertain that the ezpenditure has been proper

and

that the expenditure of the funds in question has been of material bena-

fit and advantage to the Government.

QUANTICO

The Bureau is particularly desirous at the present time

•of again bringing to your attention the absolute necessity for the

continued careful handling of expenditures from the confidential

jund and the submission of monthly reports in connection therewith.

You are

avare, of course, that under existing Bureau regu-

lations it is absolutely essential

that an appropriate statement be

submitted at the end of each month reflecting the condition of the

confidential fund in each field office, including therein its status

with respect to the cash balance on hand, plus disbursements which

have been made during the current accounting period.

Many of the field offices have in the past failed to sub-

mit such monthly statements promptly, as a consequence of which it

is becoming increasingly difficult to properly audit the Bureau's

records in connection therewith or to otherwise maintain an accurate

record upon the basis of which the accountability of each Special

Agent in Charge may be definitely determinea.

In this connection, a revier of blue slip items received at

the Bureau over a period of

time reflects an increasing number of pay-

ments in the nature of so-called "advances" to confidential inform-

ants.

The same is true of "deposits" with electric light companies

and other utilities, which deposits usually range in amounts from $10

to 920. At the time the monthly statement is subaitted by the field

office

involved, such statements invariably fail to indicate that the

experditures in question were "advances" or "deposits," the amounts

of which are to be subsequently refunded and returned. In other in-

stances.they are improperly recorded in such a manner as to preclude

NW 55320 Docid: 32989712

Page

---

## Page 135

an accurate accounting on the part of the sureau in respect thereto.

For. your gaidance in the preparation of future monthly

reports concerning confidential fund expenditures, there is being

enclosed herewith a sample form which ouulines briefly and succinctly

the manner in mhich disbursements, advances, refunds; or purchases

are to be listed. All subsequent

monthly statenents prepared by

your office should be submitted strictly in accordance therewith.

It is further noted that in a great number of cases

Special Agents have not been submitting receipts to justify the

expenditures for which reimbursement is being clained through blue

slips.

For instance, subscriptions to various newspapers and peri-

odicals subscribed to by the year have been observed with no re-

ceipts therefor having been secured.

It is believed that such

items, wherever practicable, should be paid for by the issuance of

a money order and the money order receipt autached.

In addition, the failure to obtain receipts has been par-

ticularly prevalent in respect to payments made for services ren-

dared by confidential informants, for expenses incident to the rental

of rooms, and the obtaining of keys, locks, et cetera, and other

items of

a related nature where a receipt could, reasonably be secured.

Although the bureau is necessarily aware of the fact that

receipts cannot be secured in each and every instance, due to exi-

gencies peculiar to certain types of investigative activities,

nevertheless, it must insist that such receipts be obtained for

confidential expenditures wherever it is possible and otherwise

practicable to do so.

Hereaîter, confidential items will be sus-

pended from the accounts in question unless the expenditures in-

volved are properly supported by the necessary receipts.

Likewise, the Bureau has noted with considerable concern

increased purchases in the form of furniture, beading, clothing, and

related items utilized in the conduct of various plants and other

confidential investigative activities. This is of particular sig-

nificance in that such items are being paid for through the submis-

sion of blue slips, and the non-expendable items are not being taken

up properly on the field office inventories.

Accordingly, it is

desired that you forward to the Burcau in the near future a detailed

report indicating the type and quantity oi such equipment purchased

and presently in use in order that same may be properly inventoried

on the Bureau's records.

such an inventory should, of course, be

maintained simultaneously by each of the respective field offices

having control, custody, or possession of such equipment.

With

reference to future purchases of this kind, the field offices vill

be held strictly accountable for the submission to the Bureau of

appropriate non-expendable receiving slips.

Such slips should indi-

cate that the item was purchased through the submission of blue

slips.

The Bureau will maintain a check on blue slips submitted.

and suspensions frow the vouchers will be made in those instances

where field offices lail to submit non-expendable receiving slips..

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 135

## Page 136

Accordingly,

desired that the non-exper

receiving slips

• covering pure

ses of furniture, bedding, and

scher equipment by

blue slips, be attached to the voucher when it is submitted for

payment.

It is desired that you give the matters outlined herein

••your immediate personal

attention and supervision: It is expected

that in the

future

there will be strict compliance with the fore-

going instructions in order that the correction of these delinquen-

cies may be logically concluded with a minimum of delay.

confidential expenditure made by any Special Agent of the Bureau unless such

an expenditure was made for the purpose of securing information relating to

matters under the investigative jurisdiction of the Bureau, it not being pos-

sible to secure such information in any other manner.

In making such expenditures, all Special Agents must bear in mind

that regarmont san bo naão only in the event the irrificnnior inis lu mido ilico

Government Service, and that the amount paid represented

the United States Government or for the purpose of securing confidential in-

formation pertaining to violations of the Federal Statutes which could not

otherwise nave been secured. Tre information contained on the confidential

iten submitted by the Agent in question

should be such that it will be readily

ascertainable at the Bureau that such expenditure was essential and recessary:

It has been noted that various officials and supervisors are granting.

authority to the fiela offices to make expenâitareg from the field office

Winen Bureau authority has been granted for an expenditure

of this nature, the field office is required to sive such auchorization on the

confidential iten submitted to recleim the exterditure.

Numerous vouchers are being received by the Bureau wherein a reclaim is.

made for authorized expenditures.

In checking the voucher against the file main-

tained in the Administrative Division, it is roted that in rany instances there

till be no recora of the expenditure having been euthorized. .

In the future when authorization is granted for expenditures of this

nature, the Administrative Division rust be advised. Ií the field office 1s

granted authority by letter, a copy of the letter must be rade for the Chief Clerk's

Office, Room 5517. If authority is granted telepnonically, it will be necessary

that the official or supervisor granting the authority notify the Administrative

Division by rchorendum, siving the name of the person to nom payment is authorized

and the field office involved.

The above instructions are to be placed into effect immediately in ordes

to preclude the delay which is now being experienced in determining whether the

expenditures claimed by the various offices were properly authorized.

TED STATES DEPART SERT OF

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

June 9, 1954

FASHINGION 25, D.C.

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND

ACCCUNTING PROCEDURES -

FBI FORM BOOK

After reviewing the reports of the accounting procedures

presently being followed by the various field aivisions which were

forwarded to the Bureau in response to SAC Letter 54-8, Paragraph D,

and from a review of the suggestions submitted along with these

reports, it has been determined that a uniform procedure for hanaling

che operations of the confidential Funds maintained dy the various

field divisions should be established.

Effective July 1, 1954, the following accpunting

procedures shall be placed into effect for each office maintaining

a Confidential Fund:

1. A ledger page similar to Exhibit Number Che shall be

used to reflect any transactions that would affect the amount of

the fund authorized for the field division. Transactions that

uüid afieco unis luna are:

a. Temporary or permanent increases in the fund.

b. Refunds of all or part of payments made to an

Informant for which the office has been reimbursed by

the Bureau,

Refunds to the Bureau of temporary increases

and refunds received from the informants in cases

similar to "b" above.

This ledger page should also reflect a rupning balance

of the total amount to be accounted for by the field division.

This is the amount that should be reflected on the monthly report

of expenditures from the confidential Fund as the total amount to

be accounted for.

2. A cash receipts and disbursements page shall be

utilized to reflect all cash transactions which affect the total

fund.

This ledger shall be in accordance with the attached sample

(Exhibit Number Two), which reflects examples of various transactions

which will affect the fund.

This ledger should be retained Indef1-

nitely and should be used

as the basis for the preparation of the

NW 55320 DooId: 32989712 Page 157

1n ..

monthly report. All columns should be ruled off at the end of the

calendar month and the cash balance brought forward. Column Number

One should reflect all cash receipts and disbursements.

The debit

side of Column Number Two (2a) should reflect all expenditures from

the fund except any refunds made to the bureau.

All payments made

to criminal informants and sources should be reflected in the

column captioned

"Criminal;" all payments to security Informants

or sources snould be reflected in the column captioned

"security;"

and all payments of the miscellaneous nature not covered by either

of the arore-mentioned categories, such as payments to telephone

companies, taverns, restaurants, post office box rental, etc.,

should be

neglected in the column contioned "iscellaneous.

credit side of Column Number Two (2b) should reflect all refunds

from payments previously made regardless of whether the previous

payment. was of a criminal, security or miscellaneous nature.

. Column Number Three should reflect all transactions with the Bureau;

checks in payment of vouchers and temporary or permanent increases

should be reflected in the "Receipts" column; whereas

any

refund from an informant, source or of a miscellaneous nature which

must be returned to the

Bureau because the payment has already

been vouchered, should be reflected in the

"Refunds" column.

Like-

wise, any

temporary increase returned to the Bureau should be

recorded here. (Note entries, Exhibit Number Iwo.)

In view of the foregoing, you will note that for every

entry in the cash Disbursements column, there should be a corre-

sponding entry in one of the debit columns, 1.e., in either the

Criminal, Security or Miscellaneous columns, or in the Refunds to

Bureau column.

Likewise, for every entry in the Cash Receipts

column, there

should be a

corresponding entry in' one of the credit

columns, 1.e., In either the Refunds of Payments column or in the

Receipts from Bureau column.

- It is to be further noted that the totals of column

Number 2a will be of assistance in the preparation of the "sum-

mary of payments to Informants" in connection with the monthly

report.

The amount of cash on hand can always be determined by

subtracting the total of the credit side of column one from the

total of the debit side of this column.

3. An Individual ledger page should be set up for each

paid informant and for each paid confidential sources.

This section

of the ledger should be divided Into three parts; namely, Criminal,

security and Miscellaneous.

The Criminal section of the ledger should contain a

separate page for each paid criminal Informant and each paid

criminal confidential scurce. The security section should reflect

6/9/54

NW 55320 DocId: 32989712 Page 158

## Page 159

a separate page for each paid security informant and each paid

confidential source.

Under the Miscellaneous section, pages

should be set up for rental of space for plants or surveillances,

regular monthly telephone bills that are paid from the Confidential

Fund and any other such payments that would be made on a regulai

basis.

Occasional payments, such as payments to taverns, restau-

rants, rental of safe deposit boxes, etc., may be included on a

single page as the expenaltures come up.

A sample of an informant

oage is attached Exhibit Number Three. It is to be noted that

this page reitects the following information:

a, the date of authorization

b. the authorization

c. period covered by payment

date of payment.

e. amount of payment

In connection with the date of authorization, you are

instructed that this date should be the date of the Bureau's letter

to the field division in cases where authorization is made by

Bureau letter and

the date of the Incoming letter when authorization

is made by stamping "approved" on a tickler copy of a letter

received from the field division requesting

authority.

Before making any disbursements from the confidential

Fund to an informant,

the authonization should to shocked

sure that there is not a duplicate payment being made and that the

period covered by the

payment is in agreement with the existing

authorization. These authorizations should be posted in the

ledger at the time they are received from the Bureau.

In conrection

with sAc authorized payments, a notation to the effect that payment

is being made under authority of the SAC will be sufficient.

After July I, 1954, the present serial in the informant's

file (FD-228) reflecting payments made to the informant up to that

•date should be maintained in the exhibit envelope. On July 1, 1954;

form FD-228 should be removed from your form book and your supply

destroyed.

4. After a careful review of the many suggestions received

in response to SAC Letter Number 54-0, a lorm (FD-235 Icr request

ine funds from the confidential Fund has been designed, a coDy oI

which is attached. You may print a supply of this form

for use in

your office. FD-235 is to replace any similar form that may have

been approved for your office.

A COpy of FD-235 is to be placed in

the FBI Form Book.

This form

should be prepared in duplicate by

the Agent requesting the funds, and after approval by the Agent

supervisor, the form should be forwarded to the SAC for his approval

before

any disbursement 1s made from the Confidential Fund. After

approval of the form by the sAc and aiter the employee handling

the disbursements frcm the fund has carefully verified that the

payment is in accordance with existing authority, one copy of the

• form should be forwarded to the informant's file and the second

copy retained in an accounts receivable file which should be

divided Into two sections; namely, an unvouchered file ari a

vouchered file.

These forms can be used by the employee responsible

for disbursements from the fund as the basis for preparing blue

slips for submission io the Bureau.

oi course, these blue slips

should

not be prepared until such time as the receipt from the

Informant is obtained from the Agent making the payment, and In

those cases where necessary, that FD-221 has been executed by the

Agent making

At the time the voucher is prepared, those

forms pertaining to the voucher that is being submitted should be

attached to the tickler copy of that voucher after it has been

prepared and retained in the accounts

receivable file until reim

bursement is made, by the Bureau.

At the time reimbursement 1s

received,

the voucher should be removed

together with the attach-

ments and

a notation made on the voucher of the date reimbursement

was received from the Bureau.

The Request for Funds forms attached

to the voucher may then be destroyed.

In the event an item has

been suspended from the voucher and

returned to the field office,

It would be necessary to remove

the unvouchered file until such time as it is resubmitted or It is

determined it will not be resubmittea.

5. Monthly Report.

As you are aware, the monthly report

of expenditures from the Confidential rund is presently prepared

and submitted to the bureau by the twentieth of the month following

the period during wnich the expenditures were made.

These reports

should continue to be submitted at this time; however, changes in

the present form for this report have been suggested

and after a

review of the various suggestions received, it is felt that the

reports should be prepared in accordance with the attached example

(Exhibit Number Five).

The monthly report submitted to the Bureau

should be prepared under

the airect supervision of the Special

Agent in Charge, Assistant Special Agent In Charge or a regularly

designated Field Supervisor.

The fund should be audited

once. each

six months, on June Ju and December 31. This audit shall be

personally periormed by a Special

Arent accountant.

report of

this audit shall be forwarded

to the eureau by the

twentieth day of

July and the twentieth day of January.

In those instances where

the Confidential Fund is audited by an Inspector from the Training

and

Inspection Division auring a, regular inspection, the next

• regular six months' audit shall be omitted by the Special Agent

Accountant of the fleld Division.

With regard to the summary of expenditures

section of

the Confidential Report, It 1s desired to illustrate the following

points:

a. All transactions during the calendar

month should be shown.

b.

All items should be listed in order by

date and by check number.

c .

The explanation should reflect the

name

and symbol number of the informant as

well as the period covered by the payment and

In case of miscellaneous expenditures, a brief

statement to describe the

expenditure.

d. Any transaction that affects the

total amount of the fund to be accounted for

musi be fully explained in a cover memoran-

.aum. An example of such a transaction would

be a refund received from an informant for

payment which had already been reimbursed by

the BureaU.

Any such refund, if not already

forwarded to the Bureau, should be transmitted

with the report.

In connostion with the summary sê paymente to infoamante.

you are advised that all miscellaneous

payments must be listed

separately frcm payments made to informants or sources of informa-

tion.

This

breakdown should include such payments as post office

box rental, telephone service, rental of space for plants, bank

charges, restaurants or taverns on surveillances, meals for

prisoners, etc. In other words, all payments not made to informants

or to sources for information furnished for services rendered or

expenses incurred by them should be included under miscellaneous

expenditures.

6. Preparation of Blue Slips.

As was pointed out here-

tofore, the

blue slip should be prepared from the

Request for Funds

form with the exception that the date of actual payment to:the

informant should be shown on the blue slip. This date should be

obtained either from the Agent making the payment or the receipt

obtained from the informant.

A blue slip should be prepared at

such time as all receipts necessary to support the item have been

received from the Agent making the

payment.

All blue slips should be as brief as possible, but

should contain sufficient information to allow the Bureau to make

a proper review of the expenditures.

MEMORANDUM FOR ALL BUREAU OFFICIALS AND SUPERVISORS

(A) CONFIDENTIAL EXPENDITURES - I want to draw to your attention

the absolute importance of making certain that any confidential

expenditure authorized by the Bureau complies with existing kanual

provisions and that the Bureau receives appropriate value for

every dollar expended. Although it is the personal responsibillty

of each Special Agent in Charge to make certain that full value

is received in the field, it is equally the responsibillty of Seat

o1 Goverrment employees

to be judicious in authorizing expenditures

En he mano ara to practice proger economy.

For your Information, Inspectors will, in each field

office inspection, review in the neighborhood of one hundred blue

slips to determine the propriety of each expenditure and will trace

through the files information received and results obtained,

folloring the expenditure and, if necessary, follow it through

with appropriate employee interviews with the understanding that

in the event an expenditure is encountered which is not proper

the employees involved will reimburse the Government.

very truly yours,

RE: CONFIDENTIAL FUND -

ACCCUNTING PROCEDURE'S

Reference 13 nade to No Number SAC Letter 54-0 which

set out accounting procedures to be followed in the operation of

the Confidential Fund.

The Bureau 1s now in receipt of a suggestion which 1t

is felt will eliminate sore duplication of work in connection

with the establishment. of these accounting procedures.

The sug

gestion was based upon the necessity of an employee's determining

whether payments to informants on SAC authority are in excess

of the $200.00 amount for criminal informants and the $100.00

amount for security informants. It was suggested that the

1n-

formants' files be checked and

the amount paid prior to July 1,

1954,

be entered on the Informants' individual ledger pages.

This would apply only to payments made under sAc authority.

It is felt that this suggestion will

save considerable

time and work in the field. and.vou are accordinglv instructed

to put it in effect with the

establishment of the new accounting

procedure.

been noted in some Instances that blue slips are submitted

showing the full name and on subsequent payments they are

submitted showing the individual's middle name

as a last

This 1s especially true in connection with Spanish

names. This practice leads to the possibility of carrying

Make sure that the necessary employees of your

In addition, where an Informant or individual

Analysis has been made of forms used in connection with informants

(racial, criminal, security) and it has been decided that in order to

give tighter security to these forms, form FD-221a be changed as

follows.

In the future in filling out the above form you will utilize

"the informant's symbol designation rather than his true name. No

change is being made in present procedures for handling Forms FD-37,

FD-221 and iniormant receipts. The matter concerning security lor

all informant forms is being given continuing analysis for the purpose

of instituting methods which will afford these matters top security.

RE:

SECURITY INFORMANTS AND

SOURCES - INCOME TAXES

No Number SAC Letter 63-E dated March 27, 1963, contained full

details and instructions for a withholding plan through which it was hoped

security informants could satisfy their Federal income tax obligations

arising from payments made to them for services without jeopardizing

their security. The plan was tried or a limited basis and has proven to be

sourd and effective. As a result, it will be expanded to include all field

divisions effective January 1, 1965. Under the plan, payments to certain

security informants and sources for services rerdered will be subject to a

20 per cent withholding tax.

There are four categories of circumstarces in which taxes will

not be withheld. Taxes are not to be withheld from payments made (1) to

other than security informants and sources, (2) for reimbursement of

expenses, (3) under SAC authority, or (4) to informants who have been able

to report Bureau income on thejr Federal tax returns without jeopardizing

their security or without challenge from the Internal Revenue Service.

To place the plan into effect, you should immediately review the

personal situation of each security informant and source. Where circumstances

warrant using the procedure, the matter should be discussed with each informant

or source involved. It should be explained to each that the withholding procedure

to be placed into effect January 1, 1965, is being adopted to afford a secure

method of meeting Federal income tax obligations in regard to money received

from the FBI for services. The Bureau must be adrised by November 1, 1964,

of the identity of each informant to be exempted from this program and the

method to be used by each in reporting his Bureau income.

In operating the plan, you should be alert to streamline the procedures.

For example, instructions call for a check to be drawn for the gross amount of

an authorized payment. After it is cashed, the amount to be withheld for taxes

is deducted and deposited in the special checking accourt; however, it is not

necessary to make a deposit in connection with each such transaction. If it

would simplify the matter, there would be no objection to making one deposit

at the end of each day for the total amount of money withheld that day from

payments to all informants.

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation outside your Committee.

(E) PAYMENTS TO COXFIDENTIAL INFORKANTS - The Bureau has received inquiries

regarding the amount a Special Agent in Charge may approve paying an informant

without prior Bureau authority.

You are advised you may approve payment of an amount up to $50 to an

informant in a specific instance for information subnitted.

The blue slips

submitted for clairing these paynents must clearly and adequately explain the

circumstances and summarize the infornation obtained so the Bureau will be in

a position to intelligently pass such

slips for payment, receipts to be attachea

wherever possible.

This does not change the present instructions that prior Bureau author-

ity must be obtained before paying an informant on a regular basis at a rate

exceeding S10 per month, but applies only to specific instances in wich it is

expedient or necessary to expend money to obtain information concerning matters

or persons under investigation which information is not otherwise obtainable.

This of course does not apply to expenditures for entertainment. You will be

held responsible to insure the Bureau receives full value for all the money

expended by you and such matters must receive your personal attention and ap-

proval.

(C) CONFIDENTIAL INFORNAÑTS - Full coverage of all our investigative activities

must be maintained

and the use of paid confidential informants is necessary. With-

out a constant ana

careful check of the production of these paid informants, it is

possible that full value will not be received for the

services rendared.

You are instructed, therefore, to personally review all reports submitted

by paid confidential informants either National Defense or General Investigative

to be certain that they are providing information commensurate with the amount of

money being paid to them.

If it is determined after a personal check of each paid

confidential informant that the Bureau is not receiving an adequate return, pay-

ments should be immediately discontirued and the Bureau advised. Likewise, if

you feel that any informant's compensation should be adjusted based upon a de-

crease of his activity, a summary should ce furnished to the Bureau together with

veer recommondations concerning i discagü ili jagauni iù inita.

After you have completed this check of all paid confidential informants,.

you should continue to afforà this matter your personal attention to insure the

Bureau at all times receiving a full return for any money paid to informants. •

SECURITY INTORMIANTS - As an economy measure, the Bureau will •

no longer prerare correspondence to the field granting authority 5o

continue raments to security informants when the paynents as re

quested by the fiold are approved. Elective immediately, the dubli

cate copy of your recermendation for authority to continue paymenus

will be stamped "Approved" at the Bureau, initialed with the auto

graphic initials of the Director and returned to you.

This will serve

as auchoity to continue payients at the requesiza rate.

ihenever

your recommendation is not aunloved, correspondence will be prepared

and transmitted to you, so indicating. In addition, the initial

payment authorization for an informant will be in the form of regular

correspondence.

In order that this system may function properly it is

essential that payment letter's be explicit and that ambiguity be

avoided:

Therefore, the last paragraph of your letter should read

as nearly as

possible as

follows:

"I therefore recommend that authority be granted to

to the above in-

Torant up ts

months, cifective

-(date):"

If payments are to be made on a C.O.D. basis, this fact

should be indicateu.

In order to insure prompt and efficient handling of this

Lupe of correspondenes, vou snould be. certain

that sufficient in-

formation is furniched

to the Bureau upon which to base a decision

as to the justifiability of the paymenüs and other detrils must be

correct, such

as amouni of previous paymerts, the effective date on

future payments, etc.

There is, of courses to be no larity shown in the super

vision of security

infomants and nayments made to informants, and

iü will be your perconal responsibility to see that the Burean is

receiving an alequate return for compensation paid to each and every

Informant.

In preparing blue slips reflecting payments to security

informants

In the ruture, you should show as the date of authority

the date of your Ictter to the Bureau requesting said payments,

provided approval has been received.

(D) "SECURITY INFCRMANTS - CRIMINAL INFORMANTS - PAYMENTS -- A SIt-

luation recently arose

whereby

• an informant complained that he signed

receipts for money which he did not receive from the contacting

Agent. It developed, that the Agent was in the habit of obtaining

a receipt for a specific Bureau-authorized amcunt, but li in the

opinion of the Agent the Informant did not deserve the full amount,

only a part of the authorized sum would be furnished to the informant

at the time the receipt was obtained. The Agent would then deposit

to his own personal account the sum which he had not given to the

informant with the idea in mind of later furnishing to the informant

from his personal account an appropriate sum when he felt the

Informant deserved the additional money.

As a result, confusion

arose as to whether the informant received the fully authorized sum.

This type of operation, of course, results in falsification

of records and. 1s highly improper. The handling of Government funds

1s a serious responsibility and all employees should exercise good

judgment at all times.

The above will not change any authorizations presently

in effect even though they may be for a six month period. When

submitting justification for continued payment for any of your

security informants, however, you should limt the pay period to

three months.

It is pointed out that requests for authority to con-

tinue payments to Informants should be submitted to the Bureau

at least

two weeks prior to the expiration of the current pay

period in order to prevent any lapse of

pay authority. Immediately

upon receipt of this letter, you should review the files on your

paid security informants in order to assure that the necessary

action will be taken so that these letters are submitted at the

appropriate time.

I have repeatedly emphasized the necessity for careful

examination of any and all payments from the confidential fund.

Your attention is directed in this regara to SAC Letter 54-33.

Payments to intormants are made only on the personal recommendation

of the Special Agent in Charge and must in every instance be

commensurate with the Information being received from the informant.

You should use very

careful Judgment in handling ex-

penditures froin your confidential fund and in requesting authority

to make payments to security informants and confidential

sources.

PAYMENTS ON SAC AUTHORITY

In specific instances in which it is necessary and ex-

pedient to expend money to obtain information concerning matters

or persons under investigation which is not otherwise obtainable

or to advance expense money to enable an individual to obtain such

information, SAC may now approve such payments to a single individual

of amounts up to $200 and totaling not more than $200 on a c.o.d.

basis regardless of the number of payments.

This applies only to

individuals who are not being regularly paid for services or expenses

on Bureau auchorization. An individual who is paid on SAC authorii:

should not be described

in correspondence as an informant or source

who is being paid on a

"regular basis" or on "Bureau authorization."

INFORMANTS - CONTROLS EXERCISED OVER PAYMENTS TO BUREAU

INFORMANTS - You are reminded of the need to closely follow matters

involving payments to informants to insure that the Bureau is getting full

value for money expended and that the record shows complete justification

for all payments made.

Requests for authority to pay informants must be supported

by a summary of the information previously furnished in sufficient detail

to allow an intelligent analysis at the Bureau. The communication should

also show anticipated future coverage informant will provide and an

appraisal of the informant's value. You should also outline the nature of

the expenses incurred by the informant for which payment is being

requested. Payments for services must be made on a strictly c.o.d.

basis, and parments for expenses can only cover expenses actually -

incurred by the informant in obtaining iniormation for the Bureau

The present Bureau system regarding the authorization

of payments to informants affords close supervisory control in the field

personnel to fully comply with Bureau regulations in these matters.

(H) RACIAL INFORMANTS - RACIAL MATTERS -- Recently there

were held at the Seat of Government specialized conferences concerning

militant black nationalist investigations and racial informant matters.

These conferences were attended by representatives from key field

offices handling the major portion of the Bureau's work in this field.

The conferees

were unanimous in their observation that

money is the primary motivating force in developing racial informants.

In view of this,

they recommended that each Special Agent in Charge be

given authority to expend up to $400 in the development of racial

informants instead of the $200 the majority of Special Agents in Charge

• may now expend on their own authority.

I concur with this recommendation of the conferees and .

effective March 15, 1968, the Special Agents in Charge of all field

divisions are authorized to expend the sum of $400 in the development

of racial informants. In this connection, you are reminded that money

expended for informant development must be on a c.o.d. basis and full

value must be received in proportion to the amount of money expended.

Appropriate Manual change will be forthcoming.

(D) SECURITY INFORAIANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS - As yOu

are aware, all security informants and sources receiving compensation

from the Bureau are paid on the basis of the value of information

furnished, services rendered and incurred expenses. Recently, it has

been noted that some informants and sources have been paid consistently

the same amount each month with no variation in payments during

periods when the informants or sources were less productive, which

leads to the illogical implication that information furnished or expenses

incurred or both seldom, it ever, vary. This pracuce must be

discontinued. Your informants and sources must understand they are

independent contractors remunerated on a C.O. D. basis, and they must

never be led to believe they are recipients of a fixed salary..

This matter will continue to receive careful consideration

al the Seat of Government and you will be held accountable to insure

that payments are for value received and no fixed patterns continue to

develop. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling security informants and

sources.

(B) SECURITY INFORMANTS - SUBMISSION OF JUSTIFICATION

LETTERS -- Effective immediately justification letters for security

informants should be submitted each six months instead of each four

months as was previously required. Current authorized payments for

four months should be considered extended to six months from the

effective date. Under item four, requiring a "summary of information

furnished and/or services rendered during pertinent period, " you

should henceforth include a brief statement as to what coverage or

information furnished is available only from that source. In the event

there is none, a specific statement to that effect should be set out..

As I have previously emphasized, it is the responsibility

of each Special Agent in Charge to insure all expenditures for information

are on a c.o.d. basis commensurate with the value of the information.

Excessive coverage of routine matters resulting in unwarranted

expenditures for the same incormation must not be approved. Good

judgment must be exercised and, where possible and warranted, efforts

of established informants must be directed into areas where increased

-sovorage is poored, ench ac tha Now teft andinther radical subversive

groups. You must not be complacent with mere numbers but take

positive steps to insure your coverage of subversive groups is suf-

ficiently flexible to adequately meet the Bureau's responsibilities in this

reminded of the necessity that automotive equipment used in surveillances

be sufficiently varied as to minimize the danger that persons under

amount of special surveillance equipment is located in the various offices.

Efforts will be made in the future to augment this equipment. Until

...procurcment of sufficiently raried automotive couipment can be obiined,

you are authorized io make appropriate use of rental equioment where

necessars; however. it is your responsibility to see that such rentai

equipment is completeir iusüted. Whenever such use will be extensive

and the cost is estimated io exceed S100, prior Bureau authority must be

obtained and may be obtained on an expedite basis. j You are reminded o1

the importance of maintaining special surveillance vehicles and equipment

in a secure manner to insure none of our surveillances are in any way

jeopardized. Existing regulations require that all radio-equipped

surveillance trucks be provided separate garage and storage treatment.

The desirability of maintaining other surveillance automotive equipment

separately from our normal equipment should be carefully evaluated.

Where circumstances dictate, such equipment should be provided the

same separate facilities as is now required of radio-equipped surveillance

trucks. Appropriate manual changes concerning the rental of surveillance

equipment will be forthcoming.

(B) INFORMANTS AND SOURCES - PAYMENTS -- As you are aware

informants and sources receiving compensation from the Bureau are

reimbursed on the basis of the value of the information reported,

services performed and expenses incurred. An increasing tendency

has been observed in fieid submissions to request special payments or

justify regular payments for informants or sources seemingly based

- on personal needs ci the informant as distinct from the value of infor-

mation furnished and legitimate and related expenses incurred.

The

personal needs of an informant, such as repair of a vehicle, illness

or other pressing necessity for funds, do not meet the basic criteria

of information furnished or related expenses. Informants should not

be influenced to believe we.will pay for such personal needs. The

basic concept that the informant is selling information of value on a

c.o.à. basis, much as an independent contractor, and is not an

employee must be adheredto and understood by contacting Agents and

the informants.

This does not, however, preclude use of imagination and in-

muraiûu tich u source of consiniorable potential value needs financial

inducement to engage in gathering of iniormation under conditions which

will take time to reach fruition and may involve considerable risk and

hardship. In such instances you should fully develop the facts and

present them to FBIHQ for approval prior to making any commitment.

This matter will continue to receive careful attention at FBIHQ

and you will be held accountable to insure that payments are for value

received. These instructions should be called to the attention of all

Special Agents in your office handling informants and sources.

order to exercise adequate control of the overall expenditures of the Bureau, :

is necessary that the Administrative Division have an opportunity to review
