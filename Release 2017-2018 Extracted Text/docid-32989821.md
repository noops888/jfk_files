SKETCHY, AND I TOLD THIS TO MR. EPSTEIN. AS I RECALLED THE

BROAD OVERALL SITUATION, I TOLD HIM THAT I WORKED WITH JOHN J.

CONNOLLY, JR., ON OUR PARTICULAR ASSIGNMENT, AND WE PROBABLY

RECEIVED OUR INSTRUCTIONS FROM SAC BACHMAN THROUGH OUR SUPER-

VISOR WILLIAM GAGNON. I HAD TO ASSUME THAT MR. BACHMAN

RECEIVED THESE INSTRUCTIONS FROM SOMEBODY AT BUREAU HEADQUARTERS.

OUR PURPOSE IN GOING TO ATLANTIC CITY WAS TO OBTAIN

WHATEVER INFORMATION WE COULD ABOUT PLANNED DISRUPTIVE TACTICS

OR DEMONSTRATIONS THAT WOULD THREATEN THE SAFETY OF PRESIDENT

JOHNSON OR THE SECURITY OF THE CONVENTION.

SINCE I WAS THE SOUND MAN FOR THE NEWARK OFFICE, MY

EFFORTS IN THIS REGARD WERE CONCENTRATED ON A TECHNICAL

SURVEILLANCE AS OPPOSED TO ANY PHYSICAL SURVEILLANCE OR OTHER

INVESTIGATIVE ACTIVITY CONDUCTED BY OTHER AGENTS FROM THE

NEWARK OFFICE IN ATLANTIC CITY AT THAT TIME.

MARTIN LUTHER KING WAS SELECTED AS THE TARGET OF OUR

SURVEILLANCE. BY WHOM, I DO NOT RECALL. HE WAS THE LEADER OF

THE GROUP OPPOSING PRESIDENT JOHNSON, SO I SUPPOSE HE WAS A

LIKELY TARGET.

1964 DEMOCRATIC PARTY

NOMINATING CONVENTION

ATLANTIC CITY, NEW JERSEY

On Friday, 4/25/75, I met with a MICHAEL T. EPSTEIN

of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities,

who was seeking information regarding my part in a technical

surveillance in Atlantic City, N.J., in the summer of 1964,

during the Democratic Party nominating convention, on the rooms

occupied by the late MARTIN LUTHER KING at the Claridge Hotel.

He stated his committee has a broad mandate to look into the

Intelligence investigation activities of the FBI.

In his questions, he covered the following points:

Who told me to go to Atlantic City?

Where did they get their instructions?

What was I told to do when I got to Atlantic City?

Was I told why I was going there, i.e., the purpose

or aim of this particular investigation?

Who gave further instructions in Atlantic City?

Who did I report to in Atlantic City?

What did I do there?

What did I do with any information obtained from my

efforts?

JPD: imt gues

just for

Who did I remember as being in contact with KING?

Who did I remember being in KING's hotel suite?

What did I hear about any plans for a Vice-Presidential

nominee?

Did I ever meet or talk to CARTHA DE LOACH?

Did I ever dictate any memoranda regarding this

surveillance to a stenographer in Atlantic City?

Did I know of any other technical surveillances in

Atlantic City at that time?

My recollection of details of this assignment,

without

benefit of any memoranda or files to review, is necessarily

sketchy, and' I told this to Mc. EPSTEIN.

As I recalled the

broad overall situation, I told him that I worked with JOHN J.

CONNOLLY, JR. on our particular assignment, and we probably

received our

instructions from SAC BACHMAN through our supervisor,

WILLIAM GAGNON. I had to assume that Mr. BACHMAN received these

instructions from somebody at Bureau Headquarters.

Our purpose in going to Atlantic City was to obtain

whatever information we could about planned disruptive

tactics

or demonstrations that would threaten the safety of President

JOHNSON or the security of the convention.

Since I was the sound man for the Newark Office, my

efforts in this regard were concentrated on a technical

surveillance as opposed to any physical surveillance or other

investigative activity conducted by other Agents from the

Newark Office in Atlantic City at that time.

MARTIN LUTHER KING was selected as the target of our

surveillance.

likely target.

Mr. EPSTEIN was interested in my opinion as to the

legitamacy of our investigation as a security measure.

I was

unable to impugn any other motives to this investigation other

than as set out above.

## Page 48

I do not recall details of our handling of the informa-

tion received over the technical surveillance.

SA BILLIE D.

WILLIAMS was liaison with CARTHA DE LOACH and arranged or handled

any contacts regarding the information or instructions we

received. Again, I was unable to identify any contacts or

associates of KING without reference to whatever notes we may have

kept on the surveillance.

In response to specific questions as

to whether or not HUBERT

in touch with or visited KING in his suite, I had to tell

MX. EPSTEIN that they may have been, but I could not state

positively one way or the other as there were many politicians

of the day in contact with him.

I recalled, in answer to his questions, that KING's

wife, CORETTA, was in

touch with him regarding her plans to

travel to the

convention and also that he was in contact with a

entertainer, MEHALIA JACKSON, who was appearing at some

club in Atlantic City at that time, and who was apparently an old

friend of KING's.

As to the question of what information was transmitted

to DE LOACH, I suppose we sent everything that would indicate

any action on the floor of the convention. I an vague on the

details of how we handled the transcription and reporting of

information we received. We may have written longhand summaries

or dictated via telephone to a stenographer.

I was aware of another installation, either attempted

or operated at a store front operation of some organization that

threatened disruption of the convention, but I had no details

concerning it.

Mr. EPSTEIN was unable to advise me as to whether or

not I would be contacted again regarding this matter.
