subject:

Debriefing of Father Bastarrica

Father Bastarrica recently arrived from Cuba as a political exile. At a

luncheon meeting, he reported as follows:

MRP formed in Cuba around 26 July 1960. Organizers were Dr. Amallo Fiallo

Gonzalez, DI. Antonio Fernandez Nuevo, Reynol Gonzalez, Humberto Perez Herrera.

All these men belonged to group called Accion Democratica.

The name of MRP

was suggested by Raul Chibas and in Itself 1t does not constitute a party

or group but rather a coalition of several small groups, which were the

following:

a. The 20 May group, led by Manuel Ray

b. Accion Democratica, led by Dr. Fiallo

c. Accion Verde Olivo, led by Dr. Rufo Lopez Fresquet

d. 30 November Movement, led by David Salvador (never really joined)

e. Chibas' group with Jorge Beruff and Felipe Pazos

I. Dr. Valdez Pino, in asylum in Embassy of Peru and belonged

to ACCiOn Democratica.

'ather Bastarrica's opinion of Ray is that he had no way of judging whethe:

Ray is Communist or Marxist.

Lacks quality of leadership because he

does not publically hold to a definite political, social and economic ideology.

or opposing them, all of which shows he has no ideology and makes him a

very dangerous man. Is extremely amitous for himself, with great desire

alleged plans of U.S. to overthrow Castro in which Ray was to play a

prominent part.

the discovery of arms

reporting that Ray involved in robbery U.S. Military installation and that

Governor Marin 1s misleading FBI investigation.

WAVE believes the C-3

explosive founds cache was provided Ray by WAVE as directed

by Hagtrs,

but WAVE did not provide any weapons. WAVE will tell loaal FBI that they

know nothing regarding background of cache discovery and assume Hagtrs will

coordinate case at Wash.D.C. level with FBI.

says RAY expected in Caracas, Venezuela middle of rebruary 1904 to establis

a guerrilla training base for JURE in venezuela. Will be a regional cente

Comments:

AMTAUP/2 reports have indicated Cisneros activities and statements

are directed against the CIA. Rodriguez discusses Amtaup/2's reporting with

Tony Sforza and Narren Frank.

If Cisneros is in fact directing a program

of denigration against the CIA, suggest agency follow the activities of

Dionisio Suarez Esquival, who reportedly has been selected to carry out such

a program in various Latin American univerities.

Cable to DIR from Panama City,

dated 22 Feo. 1954. The PUENTO BLANCO

Cable to JMVAVE from DIR, T May 1964 - After looking at AMTAUP material,

it is obvious much of conspiratorial talk in JURE is for internal consumption

only, the purpose being to protect myth that JURE is independent as basically

hostile to CIA.

Origin of Autonomous Operations

in June 1963, provided for

Concept was first voiced in Sept. 1962 in Walter

"Track Two" approach to Cuban operations.

Parallel to regular CIA-

controlled Cuban teams, CIA wo√ºld extend financial aid and some advice and

guidance to independent and uncontrolled

‚Ä¢ Cuban leaders such as Manuel Ray.

Rules of Engagement incorporated into June 1963 program.

"It is the keystone of autonomous operations that they will be

executed exclusively by Cuban nationals motivated by the conviction that the

overthrow of the Castro/Communist regime must be accomplished by Cubans,

both inside and outside Cuba acting in consonance.

The effort will probably cost many Cuban lives. If this cost

in lives becomes unacceptable to the U.S. conscience, autonomous operations

can be effectively halted by the withdrawal of U.S. support; but once halted,

they cannot be resumed.

All autonomous operations will be mounted outside the territory

of the United States.

4.

The United States Government must be prepared to deny publicly

any participation in these acts no matter how loud or even how accurate may

be the reports of US. complicity.

The United States presence and direct participation in the

operation would be kept to an absolute minimum.

Before entering into an

operational relationship with a group,

the U.S. representative will make it

clear that his Government has no intention of intervening militarily, except

to counter intervention by the Soviets.

An experienced CIA officer would be

assigned to work with the group in a liaison capacity.

He would provide

general advice as requested as well as funds and necessary material support.

He may be expected to influence but not control the conduct of operations.

Further,

that in April 1963, Ray had issued orders to infiltrate a JURE member into CIA
