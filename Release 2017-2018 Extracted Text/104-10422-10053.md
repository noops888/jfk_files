THE

FINAL PHASE (MOPPING UP) OF THE OSWALD REVIEW:

I.

COMPUTER PRINT OUT - RE-DECLASSIFICATION

II.

OFFICIAL FILE - documents that have been marked for

declassification or partial DC must be so noted for

future readers/reviewers.

We have suggested to Mr.

that a complete package of the sterile documents

be x-refed to the CS documents. This pakage will be

attached as another volume or bulky to the 201 file.

(Mr.

is supposed to be discussing thismatter.)

I1I.

NON-RELEASED DOCUMENTS:

must prepare a list of those documents which are

denied release--list should contain document symbol,

date, description and reason for non-release.

This can

probably be done in conjunction with review of computer

print-out. We also may have to attache an actual copy

of-each-document to this list-I will find out.

IV-d

RELEASED DOCUMENTS:

It may be necessary for us to attach to each document.

a FOIA check sheet (see attachment) indicating the

disposition of the document plus we must stamp the sterile

copy as downgraded. (NOTE: I am not sure that we have.

to do it or Ethel's shop--but I believe it has to be done.)

21MV

Along with the sterile copies of the documents going

to FOIA/Randall's office, there must be attached both

the "red-lined" copy and the "cut & pasted" copy of the

document. Aggain--perhaps Ethel's shop will do this.

These two items in IV must be decided_ whetter+nox

the task pouse does them or itte?
