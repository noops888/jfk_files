DETAILS:

A.

PERSONAL HISTORY AND BACKGROUND

SAMUEL MANNARINO

1. Status of Health

It has been reported previously that a source stated that

as of September 1, 1959, SAM MANNARINO was drinking to excess,

being drunk almost every day.

On December 11, 1959, PG T-], who has furnished reliable

information In

the past, advised that SAMUEL MANNARINO 1s

not drunk dally but is under the influence of narcotics

which he takes to minimize the pain he 1s suffering from

his spreading abdominal malignancy.

PG T-1 estimates that

this malignancy will result in SAM MANNARINO's death by

the

Sunner of 1960.

C. ASSOCIATES

1, JOSEPH MEROLA

It has been reported previously that JOSEPH MEROLA, Miami,

Florida, formerly of Pittsburgh, Pa., 1s a MANNARINO

underling.

On September 18; 1959, HANS G. MIETON,

845 Southwest Fourth

Street, Miani, Florida, advised SA GEORGE E. DAVIS as follows:

explained that JOE MEROLA, of Miami Beach, had a Cuban girl

friend who could arrange for the purchase

of this boat.

CASADA took MILTON to the Garden of

Allah Motel and Apartments,

Miami, Beach, where the boat "Menace" was docked.

MILTON tested

the engines and told CASADA that they would have to be fixed,

after which CASADA told MILTON that he might use this boat

within a short time for

an excursion into the Florida Keys.

CASADA then took MILTON to JOE MEROLA's apartment in the

Hgenace." Allah Wotel, WROLA told NETON that he owned the

CASADA then told MILTON that some Cuban friends of

the boat encountered more serious engine trouble.

The Cubans

went ashore in a

dinghy to obtain aid. In the meancine,a

Stori came up and the boat began to leak, forcing HiLtON to

beach it on a sand bar. Later that night, Agents of the

United states custons service, searched che.

"Menace" but found

no guns or other contraband.

MILION later learned that this

trip was actually intended to have

been a nilitary expedition

to Cuba and that the Agents of the U.S. Customs Service had

taken into eustody three of the individuals who had been-

passengers on the "Menace."

MILTON later attempted to contact

JOE MEROLA but could not locate him.

The following information relating to the revolutionary

activities of JOSEPH MEROLA was developed by the New York

Office as a result of contact with the Alcohol and Tobacco

Tax Division, New York City.

on August 5, 1959, RONALD MOSS, Special Investigator, Alcohol

and Tobacco Taz Division (ANID), New York City, advised that

Special Investigator RUDOLPH KALES conducted an investigation

in

September, 1958, concerning an attempt by JOSEPH VEROLA to

purchase firearms from an ATTD informant in the vicinity of

New Xoric.

On Septenber 26, 1958, the ATID informant contacted Special

Investigator KALES to

report that a representative of Cuban

revolutionary leader JOSE ALBILAN requested the informant to

meet with a leader of the Mafia named JOSEPH MEROLA.

Several

days later,

the informant met with MEROLA and two Cubans in

an apartment in the vicinity of 138th Street and Riverside

Orive, New York City, During the meeting, MEROLA pointed out

in purchasing large quantities of firearms, including machine

guns:

MERLA told the informant that he had been responsible

for supplying over a million dollars worth of arms during the

Cuban revolution and that he and his associates anticipated

extensive gambling concessions in Cuba fron the revolutionary

government.

on the

basis of this information, the ATTD, New York City,

temporarily loaned

i the informant

a number of confiscated weapons

in order that he would have a representative stock to show to

MEROLA-

On October 6, 1958, the informant reported to Special

Investigator KALES that NEROLA had been to Canada and Miami

the previous wee reportedly in comection with sone ars deal

and had

requested

the informant to accunulate

a large pile

of American

for him.

MEROLA also told the informant

at that time that he would have to postpone any purchase of

arms since the Miand area was swarming

with FBI Agents looking

for stolen weapons.

On August 10, 1959, the ATTD informant was intervlewed by

Special Agentsof the FBI in New York City.

During this

interview, the informant confirmed the foregoing information

and positively identified a photograph of JOSEPH MEROLA,

although he could not identify a photograph of Pittsburgh

national top hoodlum SAM MANNARENO.

ADMINISTRATIVE

It is noted that it was set out in rerep that PCIl

‚Ä¢ Springdale, Pa:, advised that Father

NICOLA FUSCO, Pastor of Mt. St. Peters Roman Catholic

Church,

New Kensington, Pa., was close to the MANNARINOs,

and in late 1958, hid SAMUEL MANNARINO in the church!s

apostulate house when SAMUEL MANNARINO was being sought

for service of a subpoena:

on July 23, 1959, PCI

advised SA THOMAS G. FORSYTH,

III, as

follows:

On about July 13, 1959; Father FUSCO asked PCI if he would

give SAM MANNARINO a thorough physical examination. PCI

replied that if cancer were indicated, he could do nothing

for MANNARINO, at which point Father FUSCO indicated he knew

that MANNARINO was suffering fron a malignancy. PCI feels

there are only two reasons why he should be approached to

examine MANNARINO: eithe SAM MANNARINO is frightened and

PCI-by having him subpoenaed

at a later date to testify that MANNARINO is too ill to appear

in any court proceeding.

PCI wanted to know if there was any

reason the fBi would not want him to examine SAM MANNARINO,

and ecs was advised that any decision along this line was his

‚Ä¢ alone.

On September 15, 1959, PCIL

advised that Father

FUSCO and his chauffeur departed on September 11, 1959, by

jet airline flight to Rome, Italy, purpose of visit unknown.

or V1ait¬∞

PCI stated that this trip was paid for in its entirety by

the MANNARINOs. PCI also advised that prior to Father

FUSCO's depature, Father FUSCO told PCI that it would not

be necessary for him to give a physical examination to

SAMUEL MANNARINO, inasmuch as MANNARINO has become more or

less resigned to the inevitability of his death from his

cancer.
