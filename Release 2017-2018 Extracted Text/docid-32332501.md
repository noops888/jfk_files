January 8, 1953

Havana, Cuba

In connection with the meeting mentioned above at which leaders

of the Orthodox Party and Sanchez Arango were allegedly present, it is

interesting to note that according to information received from local

of arms, is a member of the Orthodox Party and according to sources, was a

very outspoken advocate of violent action prior to his leaving Cuba.

Orthodox Party publicly follows a line of more or less complete isolation

from other political parties; but it would appear that within the party,

there are elements which desire direct action and who are not hesitating

to deal with representatives of other parties such as the Autentico Party

The above is for the Bureau's information. "No distribution has
