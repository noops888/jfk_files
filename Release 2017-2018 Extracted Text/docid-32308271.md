Re Philadelphia airtel to Director, 5/14/65.

DIAZ has been the subject of considerable inves-

tigation by the Miami Office and in the middle of Oct.,

1964, moved to Tulsa, Okla., and became a full time lecturer

for the Christian Crusade.

In Jan., 1965, Oklahoma City became office of

origin in this case.

By letter dated 12/31/64, Oklahoma City advised

Miami that subject was on a speaking tour, and Oklahoma

City planned to interview him on his return.

MM 635-S, who was previously associated with

the subject, on 5/18/65 advised he knew of no Cuban revo-

lutionary activity on the part of the subject since he

left Miami in Oct., 1964.
