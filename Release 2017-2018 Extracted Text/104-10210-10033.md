TRANSLATION

!

A. I thin': we will speal: in Russian

You do not object:

B. No.

On the contrary, better in Russian, because in English I ((am))

no so ((sure of)) nyself....

A.

Over the last three years, toyether with my colleaques wom you

already know and who have vorised with you here -- ((those who))

questioned (doprashivall) ((you)), ((and those with whom)) you net

and became friendly, I also have taken an active part in your case

B. J'es.

A. Fron the very beginning, as soon as your case had begun

B. Unhunh ((affirmation of understanding))

A. And, as you already have been told during the discussions and the

investigation, a large part of what you have said cannot be accepted

ag true (za chistuyu

nonetu).

And one cannot accept that which you sald in your statenents

(pokazaniya), etc , in just the way that (tais kak) you said or

testified (rasskazyvali ili pokazyvall).

I think, therefore, that you understand this perfectly.

But, as far as the people wo worked with you, questioned you, and

met with you ((are concerned)), all of them to some degree speak

Russian - sone well, some not so well - ((but)) some do not know

the Russian. language at all; it is the same in your case (tozhe

samoye s Vashey storony): although your English language is good,

SEGREI

## Page 5

104-10210-10033

still - quite understandably - there are sone expressions and

words which are difficult to understand.

And, as for as all of the persons no worked with you before this

((are concerned)), perhaps they do not know or understand Soviet

reality very well....

B. That is correct.

A.

... And therefore, perhaps, for then in some ((cases it was))....

B. ((Interrupts)) Not understood what I an explaining.

A. Not wholly understood; perhaps it was understandable to them, but....

B. ((interrupts)) But not in detail.

• - .

A. Not in detail.

I am here only for that reason -- in order to clear up all of

these misunderstandings which have arisen and existed.

I can tell you beforehand that at one time I worked in the KGB, 1n

Moscow, and lived there.

And I think that we, as forner colleagues and former Soviets, will

try to find a common language in our discussion and to clear up

everything that was not understandable to us and everything that

was not understandable to you.

If you have sufficient courage and understanding of what I will say,

I think that we will find a common language and finally we will

arrive at some conmon denoninator; we will not leave a single

puzzling question which would not have been answered or incorrectly

interpreted.

B. I agree with you absolutely.

I am wholly at your disposal.

A. Could you be precise:

---

## Page 6

104-10210-10033

B. I am ready to answer all questions.

It is another affair that everything

• I say, everything, is understood

((is viewed or treated)) from the position that it is incorrect and

that I... so to speas, ((am)) false (fal'shiv) and came with a

definite assignment (opredelennoye zadaniye).

A. But how do you

think -- since, so to speak, you yourself have

already raised this question:

"They think that ((I an)) false, that

((1 was)) sent with a definite assignment", ete. -- how can you

yourself answer: Why are you in such a position

How can you explain this yourself.

B. Absolute distrust... absolute distrust, and then I already have

been thinking to myself very much; it already ((has been)) a long

time (bol'shoy srok): 479 days today.

479 days - this is neither ((179)) hours nor minutes....

Here ((there is)) quite simply the deliberate -- so, perhaps, to

speak - desire... the deliberate desire of the people (u lyudey) :

to make a case that... "Well, here a double agent (dvoynik) sits

before us"

As if this were ((their)) alm, ((their)) task.

((It 1s)) not ((their)) aim-task (tsel' -zadacha) actually to know

the truth; but ((instead, it is)) their ain-task to make such a case.

A. Hell, speaking in a friendly way, how do you consider ((this)) as a

counterintelligence (kontrrazvedka) officer:

Do you think that all of the people who worked with you have mis-

understood you, etc., so much that - without reason and without

any basis (osnovaniye) - they have held (("are holding" - derzhat))

you for more than 400 days:

As a counterintelligence officer, tell ((me)).

B. I can say only one thing: that I have said, I say, and I will say

until the end that I have conferred with absolutely no one; I have

not heard a single word from anyone regarding ((my)) travel (poyezdka)

here, '(and)) I shared with no one ((the thought)) that I want to

stay abroad and not return to the Soviet tnion.

No one kinew about this.

A. Vell, anyway, I think you still have not completely understood what

I said....

B. ((Interrupts)) About what:

A.

.. About what I asked you.

What ("how" - kak) do you think:

There was and is sone basis - do you consider - for ((the fact))

that you were in such a position as you are now.

E. ... As I understood - the confusion of ny explanations and....

Hore, these monents, perhaps....

Ten....

I do not know, I do not know.

I have, strictly speaking - I cannot say why, why, what is the

reason ({'main point" - sut')).

I only know one thing -- that they do not believe me.

A. You yourself nentioned the word: "confusion of explanations"

(zaputannost' ob"yasneniy).

How do you explain this "confusion of explanations", if you see such

a "confusion of explanations"?

B. I do not see special:...

((you)) see -- when I... and your colleagues who preceded you (s

predydy shchini Vashimi kollegami) were talking together, even they

said to me: -"This here is a lie (vot zdes' nepravdu); this here is

a lie".

But the point is not in how I said ((it)) (A, ne v etom delo, kak ya

skazal).

I sald that "I took part"... "I did not participate".

The point is in that this fact took place or did not take place.

framel

In this, I absolutely nowhere, nowhere, made any mistake or 11e.

A. As a counterintelligence officer, I think, you understand perfectly

that, having

given (('said" - skazavshi)) one fact, a person must

say whence he knows this ((fact)), how this occurred....

B. Correct, correct.

Well, so you understand

vhat. (( thus, as" - ta's kal:)) I say ((to you))

but how does it turn out (a chto poluchayetsya):

For

exasple, this Paris

case; I tell them what ((as" - kak)) I know.

"From

where do I know ((chis", they ask me)).

"Nonsense, nonsense" ( (they say)).

((Laughs))

How do I know:

"But these fellows... from IONOV's section (otdeleniye) told me

((I say)).

"No. Not so" ((they reply)).

Hell, I cannot say anything more.

• I heard ((about this case)) only from them.

Or they supposed (predpolozhili) such a fact: From whom did I first

find out about DE JEAN?

So, believe me, believe me; I do not remember vio ((was)) first,

from where ((I)) first ((found out about this)).

First of all, working in the KGB - here, if you please, is the

problen: they do not believe me ((when I say)) that rumors, gossip,

etc., pass (khodyat) among the workers there.

You have worked !(there)); you know, if you worked ((there)), how

it is: the First Department (otdel) has (('makes" - delayet)) a

case, but 10 departments (otdel) know that the First department is

doing something, something, ((although)) they do not know exactly

((what it is)).

But friends, those who have friends in the First Department, they

know a little more:

that, ahah! ((there is)) a case against an

American, but they do not know the name ((of the American)).

A. I think that in this respect they understood you perfectly, and I do

not think....

B. ((Interrupts)) "Xo," they tell

me, "This cannot ie.

What you are telling us is nonsense."

A. Not in all cases was ((this)) so stated -- that....

B. ((Interrupts)) And... believe me -- well, how:

What kind of trust or distrust can ((there)) be, if they say to my

face: "You did not, work in the First Section (otdel) of the First

Otdel ((during)) these years":

I cannot say anything.

True (pravil'no), in the ABIDIAN Case, I did not look very good,

but I said so ((myself)), that I did not work on it, did not conduct

his development (razrabotka); the file was charged to me (delo za

mnoy chislilos').

But how was it run:

So they surveilled ((him)), waited for ABIDIAN to show his ta:l

(khvost).

They do not believe me.

A. Well, about this....

We still will return to the case of ABIDIAN.

I know everything that you nave said about ABIDIAN and so fortb;

and, of course, as a forner employee of the KGB, I never in any way

can believe that you were the case officer for ABIDIAN.

B. I was not the case officer, I was deputy chief of the section....

A. The more so....

в.

((Interrupts)) And they thrust the case upon me, but this was a

terrible nistake (('gross error" -- grubaya oshibka)), a terrible

mistake of the department, because it ((is)) necessary to sit and

work on ((a)) case.

A.

Well, 11.... Farlier you said that ((you ire)) prepared to discuss

A.

Everything which has not been understood

and so forth.

Let us suppose ((that there)) were very many questions ((about)) how

you began to work in the KGB, under what circumstances, etc.

I wish that we begin with (('fron" - s etogo voprosa)) this question,

starting - for example -- from the end of 1952 or the beginning. of

1953.

B. Good.

A. Thus we slowly will move further.

I have only one thing to discuss here; I hope that you will tell

the truth: you will explain, corroborate everything that you say,

and so forth.

B. ((Interrupts)) I ask that you put the questions to me.

I will try to answer for you everything that you will ask.

A. Also, ((be)) sufficiently accurate in your questions, etc., so that

there will be no misunderstandings of any kind....

B. ((Interrupts, repeating)) Misunderstandings.

• A. To me, for example, ((this is)) not wholly understandable -= you

yourself know that in the course of the long time you have been here

you have said several times that you went to work in the KGB - or,

as it was called then, the MGB; one time you said ((this took place))

in 1952, sometime in the autumn of winter; then you said ((this too!:

( 1G)

A.

Let us begin, even from the end of 1952; we will not go into details

((about)) what was before 1952.

Let us begin from 1952.

Whence and how did you show up (poyavilis') in the city of Moscow:

B. At the end of 1952 I arrived in Moscow from the city of Sovetsk,

Primorskiy Kray: this ((city)) is 10-15 kilometers from the city of

Baltiysk, formerly ((known as)) Pillau, ((a)) German ((city)) -- the

base of the Fourth Naval Fleet on the Baltic.

10-15 kilometers from this Baltiysk ((is)) the city of Sovetsk, where

my MRP - the Navy Intelligence Point (Horskoy Razvedyvatel'nyy

Punkst), at which I worked for several months in 1952 -- was located.

A. Good.

You arrived in Moscow from there.

When was this, and under what circumstances:

for what was it necessary for you to go to Moscow at this time:

B. I had a purpose (tsel').

A purpose stood before me: having come to Moscow, having come to

Moscow, to try - elther through the Ministry of the Navy, because

there still were woministries at that time, ((the Ministry)) of

the Navy and the Military ((Army - Voyennoye - Ministry)), separately,

not together.

A.

So.

B.

To try to get out of (uvil'nut') the work at this MRP and to think

of something new to transfer (pereyt1) ((to)) from ((this)) work.

Because this work absolutely did not suit me; I did not like it, I

did not receive any noral or other kind of satisfaction fron this

work.

SES

## Page 12

104-10210-10033

Here, at this point, I worked only several months in all.

A .

So.

B. I absolutely did not like this work.

And I went to Noscow, went to lloscow; I took leave (("got leave" --

dobilsya otpuska)) and went to hoscow.

I just took leave, so:

the MRP commander did not pernit me ((leave)).

A. Well, in what, when

was this, in what month did you arrive ((in

Moscow)):

D. In December, I arrived at the end of December 1952.

A. At the end of December:

B. Yes.

A. At the end of December 1952 you came to Moscow fron- Sovetsk:

B. ((In a low voice, not confidently)) From Sovetsk, yes..

A. In plain language (prostym yazykov), explain to ne wat you did

(chen Vy zanimalis') ((during)) the first 3-4 days, when you had

arrived.

B. Well, I just cannot tell you this.

I have forgotten now.

I rested; I did not do anything.

A. I have in mind ((what you did)) as any officer ((does)); you were an

officer - I made ((this)) conclusion on the basis of your statements

(pokazaniya).

You came to Moscow, and so forth; well, alright (nu khorosho) -

you did not do anything, but the officer's duty demands ((that you))

come to someone and report that you have arrived in Moscow.

## Page 13

104-10210-10033

. B.

((Interrupts)) Well, I did not come on ((an assigned)) business

trip (komandirovka) .

!

A. Upon

instruction

of

some (V ch'ye-to rasporyazhenlye)...:

B. ((Interrupts)) No.

A.

...On some kind of problems, etc.

You cannot just come, spit on everything and simply sit at home for

several

months.

B.

It is when you, ((when)) a person goes to Moscow on an ((assigned))

business trip (komandirovka), it is one case, but when a person goes

on leave (s otpusknyn svidetel'stvom), on leave I can -- not having

reported to anyone - spend ((my)) leave, return on time and report

to the unit (chast') commander, to whom I reported ((when)) leaving,

report that I have arrived ((i.e., returned)).

A.

Let. us assume you went to Moscow; how much time was given ((for))

your leave, a month or how much:

B. A month.

A. You went to Moscow; you do not report to anyone; you can live at

home, ((or)) wherever you wish, and so forth.

Good.

After three days, they announced a universal mobilization; what must

you do:

B. I must.

Here, in this case, I nust quickly, quickly - well, here, taking

into account the work at the MRP, ((tbe fact)) that I an in Moscow

and ((that)) the Ministry of the Navy is located in Moscow - I

quickly must telephone and say that I an en leave: I am to go back

to the unit or there will be some kind of instructions from you.

## Page 14

104-10210-10033

A. But, unon arrival in Moscow, do you not have to register suneplace:

And,

il you wished to be a deserter and did not want -- there

is a

war, and you do not want to go to war, then how must they find you:

Here is the most simple routine question.

B. Well, in these events, you ses, all military units imediately, you

know very well, in the presence (v nalichii) (1G).

Say (('Give" -- Davay)), he says, who of us is present, who is not....

Such and such officers are not present.

There are they:

((B; i.c., Subject's fanily name)) is in loscow.

A. Please, we will not 50

into such details.

B. You ((yourself)) asked for such details (('so" - tak)).

A. I think the question was completely clear: you have come to koscow

on a month's leave; what must you do, who must know that you are on

leave:

The affair is not set up so that you ,you understand, have come, and

you hang around for a month, and if there had been war, ((you would

have said)) I will go to report.

If 1t were so, there would have been a million deserters.

Because people are on the register somewhere, and they know them

and that he is here on leave, ((that)) this officer is here, and

so forth, and if he is needed, one can call him.

B. So, according to the regulations (po ustavu), any officer - In the

event of a declaration of war, in the event of some kind of critical

situation - quickly interrupts his leave and returns to ((his)) unit.

A. according to the regulations, it is that which is said in the

regulations which also will be written up in the plan for mobilization,

and so forth....

B. ((Interrupts)) (XG - ? He quickly interrupts his leave :)

1.

•..But apart from this, sonething else exists: some kind of rules,

which reguire that an officer do something upon arrival on leave in

any city of the Soviet Union, ((wether)) he goes home or he goes to

the Caucasus.

B.

About this, where I will be on leave is known to the commander of

the unit, the nilitary unit from which I departed, and....

This is understood...

B. Leave (otpusk), leave, and one goes where:

Such ((and such)) a city.

The Travel documents (proyezdnyye dokumenty) are written out in

the railway ((travel)) order (trebovaniye na zheleznuyu dorogu),

again to that city where you are going.

A. Let us stop here on this, the most simple question.

Even here, this little question: how did you go on leave (priyekhali

v otpusk):

And what did you do ((during)) the first days:

With your documents, etc., where ald you go, to tion did you report..?

B. ((Interrupts)) I did not report to anyone.

A. You have not explained articulately even to me.

B. I am explaining to you that I reported to no one.

A. The very same ((thing)) happened with all of the officers with whom

you have spoken previously (ran'she).

Sometines they did not stop yor:, they gave you an opportunity, you

talked and talked and talked.

But, believe ((me)), no one can buy ((it)) the way you say, that now

this is how it is.

Sovlet reality does not work that way, and the registration (uchet)

1s not carried on (ne vedetsya) in this way, and people do not travel

this way.

It is for this reason (Vot poetonu)

that I an here....

B. ((Interrupts)) But I au from there.

And I went.

I was

there, then

I cane, and I was located there.

You understand me; you say that

It is not this way (tak i ne byvayet),

but I went through (perezhil) this, had ((this experience)).

A. For me, what you are saying is only conversation.

You can say as

much as you wish....

B. I understand you, I understand.

A. But

for me it is important and wholly necessary that you tell me

how this was.

You went to Moscow, and you say that you lived at home a month and

did not report anywherc to anyone....

B. ((With sarcasm)) You asked me what I did ((during)) the first days,

the first days.

A. You do not rememberi

B. I told you, well, where - at home; I spent ((the time)) at home.

..*..

A. Well, to whon ((did)) you - as soon as you had arrived from Sovetsk,

where did you go, to whom did you report:

B. I absolutely did not report to anyone.

coho create abhushar

B. We will stop on this ((point))....

How much time did you spend on leave, if you arrived ((in Moscow))

at the end of December:

How much time were you on leave, approxinately, until what time:

## Page 17

104-10210-10033

B. I here... just..: it is hard to say.

Whether my leave was finished, or mayhe it vas interrupted....

On leave in Hoscow....:

The business arose that I would be taken to work in the MGB.

Through KOBULOV, Bogdan... Zakharovich, and I la turn announced in

the Ministry of the Navy, in Personnel, to Colonel KALOSHIN, Chief

of Personnel of Navy GRU, that I was processing (( an processing" -

oformlyayus')) and I would be (("will be" - budu)) processed (XG)

into the MGB: "I an announcing this to you."

A. Alright (khorosno) .

Let us begin from here, since -- I make my own conclusion -- you were

not of

a mind (ne v sostoyanii) or did not wish or ar. not wish to

explain truly and correctly how you came to Moscow, to whom you

reported, etc.

Because there is no way to worn out of this (ni kak eto ni v kakiye

vorota), there is no way to get around it ((same expression)); do

not think, you, that you are the only person who has come here.

Many Soviet defectors come, many officers, and the rules which a

person - a Soviet officer - must observe on leave are written in

his officer's identification (ofitserskaya: knizhka):

Rule (("point" - punkt)) l, 2, 3, 4, 5.

I even can imagine ((that it is)) not compulsory - and no one

insists - that one would come to Moscow and right away on the

second day must run ((to report)).

It happens (Byvayet) a person sits for three days, and....

B.

Yes.

But (XG) ((A and B talk at the same time))

Or the military commissariat (voyenkomat), or the military comnissariat,

1f this is a simple officer......

A. I do not want to put (postavit') "someone" ("kto-libo"), who did

you put when....

B. I did not put anyone.

When I had arrived, just after New Year's, after several days, I

went to (poyavilsya) the Ministry of the Navy.

Maybe after about ten days, seven, eight, and announced that I was

processing (("am

processing"' - ofornlyayus')); the problem of my

transfer from the system of the Navy to the system of the Ministry

for State Security was

resolved (("'is resolved" - reshayetsya)).

A. Good.

Let us leave this question....

He stili can return to

this ((later)).

.B. As you wish (pozhaluysta).

A. How, under what circumstances, and where did the conversation first

come up that you expressed the desire - or that someone proposed --

that you transfer to work in the organs....

B. 01 the MGB.

A. Of the MGB.

B. It was at KOBULOV's dacha ((country house)) .

Prior to this, father knew - I had spoken with father previously -

that I did not like this work.

More than that, when I left Baltiysk - I told you - the unit

commander, the conmander of our Navy Point, he of course did not

want to let me go on leave, and I turned (obratilsya) - at a

reception to Connander of the Fleet Arsenly Grigor'yevich GOLOVKO,

father's pal (priyatel'), and said.....

A. He will return to this.

And we will come back to GOLOVKO and to the Chief of your Intelligence

Point, and so forth....

B. No, as I....

A.

We have begun now to talk ((of)) how and under what circumstances -

so, not upset, calmly, simply -- they found yos, you found a person

sith whon to talk of coing to work in the MGB.

B. Thile a guest, with ny father and mother, at KOBULOV's -- it was on

the first or second of January at his dacha.

The conversation was hrought up: "And what are you doing."

I said what I was doing (('an doing" - delayu)), where I was working

(("am working" - rabotayu)).

A. One minute.

"The conversation was brought up: 'What are you doing: '"

I have one question here.

Why did you and your family happen to be at KODULO's dacha:

B. ((Smiling)) There was a phone call.

At this time, KOBULOV was working in the GUSIMZ, GUSIMZ system.

But maybe it was as cover ((that)) he was registered with (chislilsya)

GUSIMZ, as Deputy Chairman.

GUSIMZ -- that is, the Chief Directorate-of Soviet Property Abroad

(Glavnoye Upravleniye Sovetskim Imushchestvom Zagranitsey).

But he had been in Berlin, as chief of "BISIUTH". ((Soviet mining and

development concession, "Visnut"'; in Russian, Sovetskoye aktsionernoye

obshchestvo 'Vismut')) -- all uranium extraction. (("developuent" -

razrabotka; mining and processing)).

And he was in Moscow.

He knew father.

Hell, they, many knew.

He rang up father;

for what, why, I do not know; in any event, he

invited ((us)); or maybe father invited him to ((visit)) us at our

dacha, but he ((KOBULOV)) said: "I cannot; no, better, perhaps,

((1f you cone)) to me".

well, all in all, we went as guests, for a few hours (1G), to

KOBULOV's dacha.

A. ((In English)) Well.

I think you must say a little more:

what - had ((your)) father

and KOBULOY known

other long.

It does not nappeil.so

I cannot ring him up:

each

other long, or had you and kOBULO! known each

simply; if I, for example, do not know KOBULOV,

"Please come to ((visit)) ne!"

B. (: One minute; I will explain to you now.)

Father had orked, so to say, in such posts since 1933.

He knew the Minister

or Deputy ((Minister)) fron any Ministry.

KOBULOV also had worked

for nany years as a Deputy Minister and

also was anong the "higher-ups" all the time.

But they krow each other ((2G - A

and B speak at the same time.))

A. You understand that it is not important that your father had worked

in the Ministry of Ship-building or sone other Industry; specifically,

this -- I would say - had no relation of any kind to the NKVD, where

KOBULOV at one time was Deputy Minister.

Here there must be something linking their friendship, something

further on which it was built, either a simple acquaintance or as....

B. ((Interrupts)) I understand.

A. It could not have heppend just so, that he phoned and (1 vot)....

B. ((Interrupts)) They meet at receptions, they meet at conferences, they

know each other, then perhaps they run into each other on problems;

so to say; there were some kinds of common problems.

Let us assume, for very many years the MVD carried on construction;

the most secret and most complex ((construction work)) they carried

out with the bVD troops (silani voysk AVD': SPETSSTROY.

Perhaps on this ground; I do not know on what ground they are

acquainted, but they are acquainted,

and they have know each other

for a long time.

And not only ((that)); father knew many, many, just as those who-

were working "at the top (naverkhu)" knew him.

A. Let us begin from this.

---

## Page 21

104-10210-10033

They knew many, etc. - this is another question.

I wish to establish here only what mutual relations there were between

your fanily and the kODULOVs and thy it happened....

B. ((Interrupts)) Before this....

A .

... that you happened to be at KOBULOV's dacha, at a party and at

dinner or who-knovs-what.

B. Before this ((period)), I do not remember that our families were

associated, so to say.

KOBULOV's family or our family - I do not remember such a question.

They knew each other: KOBULOV and father.

Well, they addressed

each other by first nare: ((father addressed

KOBULOV as)) Bogdan, ((and)) he addressed father - Ivan.

Such ((was their form of)) address.

But by families I do not remember; there was no such event before

this.

Maybe, maybe, before New Year's they saw each other somewhere: in

the Krenlin, at a meeting, somewhere; and maybe therefore Bogdan

KOBULOV telephoned to congratulate ((father on New Year's)).

It is customary, you see: ((for)) New Year's, sone congratulate on

the thirty-first, ((those who)) who are not visiting (kto ne v

gostyakh), tho are at home; some send telegrams, but this is to

((those in)) other cities; but some call even on the first, phone

around to their acquaintances.

Hell (Vot), perhaps KOBULOV phoned, because I remember that there was

a call, namely, from KOBULOV.

KOBULOY himself phoned and congratulated father: "((I congratulate))

you on the New Year, Ivan; well, what are you doing?"

"Nothing nuch; the family is ((just)) sitting here; naybe we can get

together and have a drink."

A. But are you saing exactly how it was, or are you imagining and

presenting....

---

## Page 22

104-10210-10033

B.

NO.

... ((it)) as it nust have been (("must be" - dolchno byt')).

... I was not a witness ((as to)) how father talked with him on

the telephona; I an speaking ((of)) how it is in life, how it is and

how it was, judging by that meeting which took place (proshla).

A. In short, you were not present during this conversation....

B. ((Interrupts)) During father's telephone conversation, that (to chto)..

A.

... ((Mat which)) you are telling me about phone calls, etc. -- it

is only, so to speak, ((that which)) you offer or imagine....

B. ((Interrupts)) That Bogdan phoned....

A. (IG)

B. That KOBULOV phoned - exactly ((as it happened)).

He spoke with father - exactly.

But that he invited ((us)) - exactly, since we went.

A. How many times before this meeting, before this meeting, did your

family and KOBULOV's famiiy meet as families.

B. I am telling you that I do not know of one instance (ni odnogo fakta)

((in which)) they met (vstrechat'sya) as families, visited

(navashchat'sya) each other at their apartments (po kvartire) or

dachas.

Despite the fact that mother aiso knew KOBULOV's wife, exchanged

greetings with her - "Good day (Zdravstvuyte)

She saw ((her)) at a parade or reception or in a shop of the Council

of Ministers or another place.

A. But did you yourself see personally that they exchanged greetings,

TT.N

---

## Page 23

104-10210-10033

or are you again imagining and offering ((that which you have

1Jagined) ).

B.

I myself have exchanged greetings ((with her)), I know her — KOBULOV's

wife - by face.

Then, you see, the fact is that my acquaintance, VAKHRUSHEV, was

married to KOCULOV's daughter, and ((Pauses))....

A. lie will return to VAKHRUSHEV, also.

Today, I want only one thing - ((that it be made)) clear and

understood what kind of mutual relations there were at that time

((between)) KOBULOV's family and your family and ((between)) you

personally and Bogdan KOPULOY

=*-"

-

B. At that time I personally had none ((no mutual relationship)) with

Bogdan.

((XG; A and B speak at the sane time))

A. Personally met before this meeting?

B. There was no one time, either at his partment or at his dacha.

I could have seen (("could see" - mog viden')) him at a parade,

((or)) sonewhere else (1G) .

A. But you never talked ((with hin)):

В. Ло, по, по.

A. You did not calk ((with him)):

B. No.

A. Now let us go to the second stage of our talk.

How did the conversation come about that - there was a conversation

about work in the MGB; ((was it)) at this party at Bogdan's.

## Page 24

104-10210-10033

B.

Nell, there was a real dinner (deystvitel'nyy obed).

Who was present: KOZULOV himself, his wife, daughter, and the

daughter's husbad, Vasiliy VA'ARUSHEV •

Also

there with them - I have in mind Vasilly and the daughter -

((was)) a son, six or seven years old.

And there was

also ...•

A. Which VAHRUSIEV, the elder or the younger (("the lather or the son" -

otets ili syn)):

B. The younger (('the son" - syn)).

VAKRUSTEV elder died 1ong

ago.

A. Unhunh ((affirmation of understanding)).

+. 0 ..

B. And Bogdan KOBULOV's brother, Amayal KOBULOV, vas there.

Lieutenant General Amaya'‹ Zakharovich KOBULOV.

There was no one else.

A. But, on your part:

On your family's side:

B. I, mother, father.

A. The three ((of you)):

B.

Yes.

A .

Please continue.

B.

fell, how did the conversation come up?

Hell, it was afte: dinner.

He were sitting, laughing, Joking..

Well, let us suppose then that nother was talking (f'is talking" -

razgovarivayet)) with the wife, I was talking with Vasilly or with

them.

## Page 25

104-10210-10033

Well, you do soncthing.

I vas - I do not ronember - I had come in cither civilian clothes

or uniform; I do not even remember.

The conversation about me simply arose (<ashel): What was I doing.

Where

was I

working:

Perhaps Vasilly raised the question, because Vasiliy had studied at

the same institute as I, only he -- VAKIRUSIIEV -- had graduated two

years earlier.

I said that I was working in the GRU system of the Ministry of the

Navy.

In the beginning, my work (pervonachal'naya moya rabota) -- vork in

the Far East - satisfied me.

The work here - several months on the Baltic - absolutely did not

satisty (('does not satisfy")) me, and I have, I came here not so

nuch for the sake of leave, but took leave in order to think of

something, to find something, a place for work to which to go.

Hell, Bogdan Zakharovich was interested.

There father and I were sitting (( sit")); there sat Vasiliy and

Amayak; I do not remember whether or not mother was listening.

I said this and that, this and that (to, to, to, to).

"But what are you doing:'

I told what kind of vork, the preparation of so-called ANPS --

Agent-Surveillance Posts (Agenturno-Nablyudatel'nyye Posty) --

against the event of war in the future.

"Nell, that's all.

"by role, speaking generally, comes down to nothing, because I have

absolutely no experience in this work, and, as a matter of fact, I

am . in crude language - a second tail sewed ou a mare ((unnecessary)

"This work absolutely does not satisfy me, does not please me.

"To where: ((Where to go. ))

"I even do not know to where.

"To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to ((the Ministry of)) Foreign

Trade, I absolutely do not know where. ((to go)).

"I absolutely do not know." ((Pauses))

B. Nell, when Bogdan Zalharovich KOBULOV found out that I had had the

same education (obrazovanlye) as Vasilly VAISIRUSHEV, ((he said))

"Yell, where do you wish. Do you wish."

lell, I even do not know exactly how he said ((it)).

I cannot tell you word for word.

I cannot tell you word for word.

He suggested to me:

"How do you view work in the organs ((with

uncertainty)) of Security:"

((I replied,)) "Excuse me, i do not know this work, and ((Pauses) )

I have not worked ((there))."

-. :.

A. Do you remember exactly how and

what he said or not?

B. No, I do not remember word for word; no, no, до.

The conversation came up; he said to me: "How do you view work here:"

I sald to him that "I do not know; if it is interesting work, then

((I will accept 1t)) with pleasure."

A. He said the word, "here", or....

B. ((Interrupts)) Well, In the Ministry for State Security, ia the

linistry for State Security.

A. I do not wish to "hook" you (byt 'zakoryuchkoy), but....

B. ((Interrupts)) The Ministry for State Security was what was meant

(imelos' vvidu).

A: How did he say it: In the organs of State Security, or how.

B. This I, I absolutely do not ramember this.

Whether he said in the Hinistry for State Security (Gosbezopasnostl)

or in the organs of State Security, or he simply said in State

Security - I do not remember this.

Perhaps he said in Counterintelligence (Kontrrazvedka):

B. No.

There was no talk of intelligence or counterintelligence, absolutely

none (absolyutno ne bylo), and I - until the beginning, until I

began vorl: in March - I did not even know where I would (('will"

budu) work.

I did not know.

A. I, of course, would dot have wanted to remind you that, for example,

earlier you

said, for exanple, that when they questioned you in 1364

you explained

about KODULOV a couple or three tines

before this, etc.;

at two points (("'in two places" - v rivukh mestakh)) you emphasized

straight out that KOBULOV had said to you: "And how about work in

counterintelligence, in the organs of counterintelligence."

B. I do not remember the word, "counterintelligence"; I do not remember

the vord, "counterintelligence".

He could have said only one ((thing;): work on foreigners, or

against foreigners, or on foreigners.

He could have said that.

But the word, "counterintelligence", I do not remember.

But, you understand, working in counterintelligence, I of course

could have said this.

A. You must understand that this is a very inportant moment.

i.

B. I absolutely do not understand this.

It means I an so stupid that I consider this absolutely not the

important moment you say it to be (kak bylo skazano).

• It is absolutely not important ((whether)) it was said "in the

Ministry of State Security (v Ministerstve Gosbezopasnost1)",

because ((B's family nane)) wished to work, or "you will work in

the organs o! State Security (v organakh gosbezopasnosti)," or "you

will work in State Security (v gosbezopasnosti)".

It is, you know, one ((and the same)) Ministry.

A. The point is not in how it was said ((to you)), but in how you have

It was better for me, then, to say straight out: I sinply vas

working in the organs, I vas working in the organs, I tas working

in the organs (rabotal v organakh).

A. As far as I know, you at one tine enphasized that ((it was)) "ilow

about work in counterintelligence."

B. Understand me = I did not know there I would (("will" - budu)

works, in intelligence or in counterintelligerce.

I did not know - this I remember exactly.

I did not know.

B. Nell, I understood him, that he has broad connections at his disposal

and that he will help me in this problen.

position.

He said: "Do not worry about this.

They will do it; this will be the worl of Personnel ((Department)),

and they will. put your linistry in the know."

I asked: "But will you

set it for me or not. "

I do not remember what he answered, but to my mind he said,

"It is not your affair; they will handle this without you."

For all that, I soon, soon - well, maybe after several days - in

the Ministry of the Navy, I told about this (ob etom falte).

A. This conversation, then, took place on the first or second of

January 1953, with KOBULOV at his dacha.

case - because Personnel wis scattered (ifairy byli razbrosani), but

those, those with whom I tallied, the people - to my thinking, I

was on the sixth

floor (etash).

(i To my thinking:), they talked with me on the si:th floor.

Un the sixth floor.

ROZENKO's employee, fron NOMIENKO's section (otdeleniy.), talked

I do not even remember his me.

So both (. ROZHENKO:) and

the conversation and - as they say -- put your case in order, as

B. Well, the eighth entrance, well, I have in mind this last entrance

(konechnyy pod"yerd); generally speaking, there was no ninth in

Building 12.

Because, you see, from this, the front, side of Buiiding 2, Building

2, so, Building 2, opposite Building 12, from this side, then, the

last entrance (pod"yezd)

((is)) the fourth, the fourth, were the

Second Departnent (otdel) of the OrU was located (('sat" - sidel));

the Sixth Spocial Department (Spetsotdel); the Sixth, well, now this

Is the OTU, the Sisth, the Sixth Special Department, part (chast'!

of the Second Special Department, not all.

Now, you go around the corner, around the corner, no, Malaya

Lubyanka Street (ulitsa), here it is -- Malaya Lubyanka, around

the corner there is not one entrance (pod"yezd), but a small doorway

to the courtyard (a khodiks vo-dvor), a grille (reshetka), an iron

grille; you enter the courtyard, here ((is)) the fifth ((entrance)) --

I never ((''not once" - ni razu)) entered the fifth; the sixth

entrance - I ront in the sixth, it ((is)) FINO, there, concerning

money and travel documents; the seventh entrance -- whether I was

there or not I do not even remember; the eighth entrance - this

here is the last.

Well, then, here ((are)) the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth - the

last - ((that is)) all.

There are no more.

This is in one snall courtyard (dvoril:).

That ((is)) all of the entrances of Builging 12.

A. Hell, where is the ninth:*

B. There is no ninth.

I simply said (('say" - govoryu)) the eighth or the ninth.

This entrance is the eighth.

Because here from this side the fourth ((is the)) last, opposite

Building 2, but here -- around the corner -- there is the entrance

to the courtyard and these entrances: fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth.

I cannot in any way imagine that a person who has worked for 10 years

in counterintelligence can say, could try to state to a person

sorked at the ninth entrance that there is no ninth entrance.

I cannot in any way understand this.

B. I do not trow, I do not know, I do not know, I do not know.

I am telling (Ya bovoryu) ((you)) wat I know....

A. Listen, a person who has worked so many years probably knows how

many entrances ((there are)) in Building 2 and in Building 12.

B. I say that ((there)) is not.

There cannot be a ninth entrance there, because further on behind

this building is (( goes" - idetI) the Moscow Oblast and Moscow City

Directorate (Upravleniye Moskovskoy Oblasti i Goroda Moskvy) ((of

State Security)).

((That is)) all, and there is nothing more.

A. Correct, but where is the ninth entrance.

B. I do not know where the ninth ((is)).

There is no ninth.

I do not know the ninth entrance, because, right away, you see,

this small courtyard, so, the iron grille, the end, this little

courtyard ends here, here a part - the restaurant comes out here

onto Lubyanka and just (srazu zhe) after the restaurant, it comes

up nearby, here it is as Building 12, a continuation of Building 12,

the Directorate of the City of Moscow and of Moscow Oblast.

Departnent (Otdel Kadrov); whom did you first meet there:

Pass Bureau (Byuro Propuskov): you have arrived in the Pass Bureau;

((In English)) what next:

B. There is (Vot) a little window (oloshechko) .

I gave ((them my)) officer's identification (('officer's booklet" --

ofitserskaya knizhka)) .

I said that there is a pass (propusk) ior me.

They said, "Vait."

But, as usual, they take your document, close the little window, and

you wait.

The little vindow opens, the officer's identification is returned

with the pass, the pass.

In the pass it is indicated, then, Building 12, the entrance, such-

and-such a room.

A. But do you now remember. which entrance and which room this ((was))?

в. No, по, ко.

A. Do you still insist (Vy use nastaivayete) that this place was at the

eighth entrance (pod"yezd):

B. At the eighth; yes.

Yes, yes, yes.

I went (khodil) to this entrance, only to this entrance.

And when I talked with ROZENKO and with this person - to my

thinking, I talked with him two times.

A. Who ((was)) this person.

B. I do not know ((his)) surnane.

In my opinion, ((he was)) a case officer or senior case officer.

A. You went there.

To whom was ((your)) pass made out (byl vypisan):

B.

No, no.

The pass was

nade out, roon such-and-such six hundred... there, to

my thinking, six hundred... to my thinking, the sixth floor, but I

do not remember exactly.

Whether there was shown (ukazano) a name (faniliya) - ((it)) must

be show, but I do not remember - I do not remember, I do not

remember, I do not remember.

I cane to this - I remember, then, that when I came to this room,

I went up; I went in the eighth entranca, vent up... wait, where cid

I remove ((my coat)):'

I took off ((my coat)) here, downstairs (vnizu); correct.

Below (Vnizu), at the eighth ((entrance)), I renoved ((my coat)),

went up, knocked at ((the door to)) this room, and there sat several

people: three or four, all in civilian clothes.

They said, "Wait."

Alright (khorosho), I wait.

A. Let us begin from when you cane in the entrance.

You said that you removed ((your coat)).

Where did you remove ((your coat)):

B. Here, downstairs (Zdes' zhe vnizu), at the eighth ((entrance)).

((their coats)) dowstairs - on the first and second floors.

((There arc)) two places - tro cloak-rooms.

And when you go to eat at the dietetic restaurant (dietstolovaya),

you wear your coat to the second floor, where you remove ((it)).

If you go up ((above the second floor)) -- well, on business - then

you renove ((your coat)) here, below.

I removed ((iny coat)) belon, on the first floor, as I entered.

A. That ((ras)) there, cloa';-room attendants, nan and wonan (garderob-

shchik byl i garderobshchitsa).

B. Yes, there was a vonan, a cloal-oon attendant.

A. You went up.

Then (Dal'she)?

B. I went up to the floor indicated in the pass, found this room,

knocked, opened ((the door to)) the room; there, I, well - as far

as I remember, three or four officers were sitting there..

A. To thon did you speak (obratilis"):

B. I don't renember.

I said: "Here is the pass; my nant is ((B's surname)); I vas told

to come here."

But one of them said: "Tait; I will call you."

A. How do you think - I would not have wanted to remind ((you)) again

that a person who has worked so many years must know exactly - is

the name of the person who is visiting (("going" - idet)) and whom

show on the pass or not:

B. But I am explaining to you.

A. You could not....

104-10210-10033

B. ((Interrupts)) But I will explain to you.

I will tell you - thy.

Because I do not remember, I do not ronenber.

But usually it is shown

who orders the pass.

An ordinary case officer or a senior case officer cannot order a

pass; that is, he can wite out the pass, but soneone anong his

superiors (iz r'ukovodstva) signs ((it)).

Now, you have issued it, but still you must confirm if the deputy

chief of Department (otdel), the chief of Departnent, signs it by

hand (v pis mennon vide) - that is how it is (vot tak).

Now, orally (v ustion vide), the officer, now, here now....

A. We will come bacl: to this: the pass procedure (is poryalois propustion),

etc.; we will talk sore of this.

B. That is why I am here (Dals i ya).

You asks me; I explain to you.

A. I am talking to you about this case...

I cannot believe that a person has worked for so many years and

does not know exactly whether the name of the employee whom he was

visiting (k kotoroni on idet) was shown on the pass or not.

He goes up to the sixth floor and says:

"Who needs ((B's surname: ))

B. No, not to the sixth floor, but to room six hundred... such-and-such

and there some roon six hundred (XG›... I ((am)) ((B's surname)) and...:

I have appeared (yavilsya), I do not know to whon to speak (obratit'sya

who was sitting there, I do not know who, to whon must I turn

(obratit'sya).

To my thinking, to my thinking, to my thinking, a name was showa

there in the pass... I do not remember; let us suppose ((that the

name)) there ((was)) PUSTYSaKIN, PODUSHKIN.

I could have opened ((the door to)) the room and said: "My name is

((B's surname)); who here is Conrade PODUSHKIN or PUSTYSHKIN: •

He ((would have)) said: "I ((am he)); you wait for me; I will call

you. "

(And that would have been)) all.

A. An employee who had worked 10 years in the organs of the KGB -= ho

Isediately can say that a name is shown there or is not shown.

He will not hesitate, think up ((sonething)), and say: to ny thinking,

it was, or it was not; because the regulations (pravila)....

B. ((Interrupts; XG -- A and B speak at the same tine)) ... I know what

is shown and not shorn and I myself made out passes and I myself

signed ((thes)), as... deputy chief of departnent, and now one can

simply order ((passes)? by telephone, well, fron the chief rea

section (otdeleniye).

An ordinary enployee orders ((the pass)), but a chief of section

and higher confirms ((the order)), and it is loth with a nane and

without a nare.

A. You have arrived at the Pass Bureau (Byuro propuskov); you will

submit (otdayete) your document.

B. I said that there is a pass here for me; it must be a pass to

Building 12.

((That 1s)) all.

I gave my officer's identification (("officer's bocklet" - ofitser-

skaya knizhka)).

A. That else did he ask you in the Pass Office:

B. I don't remenber.

I do not remember what he asked.

I do not remember what (kak) I said, ((or)) what he asked.

A. You see, as they say, these are such small things on the face of it;

when a person has worked so many years and can not say exactly, but

how it is in

They wanted to receive 9 x 12, a large and snall ((ones)), as usual,

Again I talked with this ((person)) briefly; I was with this -

employce about 30 minutes, then I vas with ROZHENKO for the third

tine.

The third time with ROZIENKO.

With this, everything was completed, and I received a phone call,

the last phone call I received from them... in March, after STALIN

was buried.

After STALIN's burial they asked me to come, not to Building 12,

but to Building 2.

The pass was ordered for the

fourth entrance straight out, for the

principle, central entrance.

A. But when, then, from January to larch, what were you doing in Moscow:

B. Nothing.

I was, I was, this period of time, you understand, all January := I

still ((had)) leave, February and this

part of March before working,

this ((was)), so, at the disposal of Personnel; that is, until the

moment, until the apparance of the order that I was enrolled to

work in the MGB, I was, this period of time, period of time, but I

do not know, fron

the middle of January, from what time, I wag at

the disposal of Navy (VMF) Personnel, of the Ministry of the Navy,

but how it was here, no one explained to me.

I know only one ((thing)) - that Personnel of GRU, GRU of the

Ministry of the Navy, knew that it will be handled (provoditsya)

that... the problen of my enrollment in the MGB is resolved; they

knew that this question is decided and therefore put me at the

disposal of Porsonnel; that is, this so useless (boltayushcheyesya)

position which

is before the noment of assignment (naznacheniye).

It can be two and three months or

a month or a half-month or. four

months..

A. How did the Personnel Department of Navy GRU find out that you were

processing (('are processing" - oformlyayetes')) for work in the MGB:

B. KALOSHIN, whom I told, first heard ((it)) from me.

SCAREF

## Page 48

104-10210-10033

When

was this.

B. In January.

I told ((hin)) in January.

Maybe on the l0th, maybe on the 8th; I do not remember when I was

there first.

I told them that I was processing... the question of my, of my

enrollment, of taking me to work in the Ministry for State Security

is decided.

Because that work to which you sent me last time in Sovetsk, at the

Fourth... at the MRP of the Fourth Naval Fleet, does

not suit

me

at

all, because this work leto rabota) (1G).

- $

A. And what did you do for KALOSHIN at that time, when you stated

thet....

B. I did not do anything.

I said that, in all probability, as far as I understood, they will

put you in the know officially somehow.

This they themselves already ((had done)).

And, really, no one had told me, and, really, they already had put -

I have in mind the MGB Personnel (kadry NGB) -- they officially had

put the GRU Personnel of the Ministry of the Navy in the know, but

they quickly asked about this, "give ((us)) the personal file

(lichnoye delo)", that no one had explained to ((or)) showed ((or))

told me, but GRU Personnel (kadry GRU), KALOSHIN, knew officially,

KALOSHIN already knew, not from me, but GRU Personnel knew officially

that the question about me is resolved in MGB Personnel (v kadrakh

MGB), and they put me officially at the disp((osal))..., I became,

then, not as an officer of the MRP of the Fourth Naval Fleet in

Baltiysk, in Sovetsk, but ((an officer)) at the disposal of

Personnel (y rasporyazheniyem kadrov), at the disposal of Personnel.

A. But you rementer that... I again return to the old problem that

obscurities arise, of course more, not from ((our)) understanding

each other, but you said earlier what you are saying now, it is

---

## Page 49

104-10210-10033

true that earlier -- one or two times -- you said

that you

hao

filled out the questionnaire (anketa) at ROGIENKO's, etc., but

there ras a time (moment) when you said that they: told you in the

Personnel Department (otdel; of the MGB that "it ((is)) not necessary

to fill out any kind of questionnaire (anketa), we have requested

your personal file (lichnoye delo)."

B. And wholly understandably; it nay be that i ((did)) precisely ((that))

the second time, because - I am sitting and thinking, but why ((did))

I ((do so)) the second tine - perhaps they gave me a questionnaire

the second time....

I do not recember, do not r'emember.

A. Understand me; Counterintelligence (Kontrrazvedka) does not work

that way.

When a person has worked in Counterintelligence and tries "o explain

and state that white is black and black, white, of course it is

difficult for the pcople who have been talking with you -- including

me - to believe that you are telling how in fact it ras.

When a person once has sald that "it ((is)) not necessary to fill

out anything, we have requested your personal file"', and that is all

(1 konets); now, in order to find an answer, you are trying somehow

to explain: "Saybe it was so the first time, but perhaps, the

second iime."

I want to know the truth, in order that it be clear and definite --

that you went to ROZHENKO, that you filled out a questionnaire, what

you did, etc., or it was

that they requested your file from the GRU

and you did absolutely nothing there.

Because you told ((it)) one time thus, and then two times in another

way.

The truth must be somewhere, because: it cannot be this way.

B. I am telling you the truth as it is; I was ((there)), I talked in

Personnel two or three times, I filled out a questionnaire, I filled

out a questionnaire; when did I fill out the questionnaire:

God knows:

---

## Page 50

104-10210-10033

• ~

whether they gave it to me right away or gave it to me later, or

perhaps they gave it to me wen I already had gone to work, a

Personnel man (kadrovil) sitting in the Second Chief Directorate

(no Vtoroy Glarke) -- ((chief -=)) SAKHAROV, likolay Grigor'yevich

-

gave it to me - I do not remember, I do not resenher, I do not

remember.

Absolutely.

I know I filled out to autobiographies, two questionnaires, submitted

photos.

A. But why (("for what" - k chenu)) fill out two autobiographies and

two questionnaires:

B. Uh, two copies.

A. Why:

B. I do not know.

A. Here, of course, in this event....

B. ((Interrupts)) Well, then, where; it is in the personal file

(lichnoye delo); look: here is a personal file in him, on him, on

him, but what is there; a personal file, but there is also an insert

(vlozheniye) in the personal file, the special check (spetsproverka)

file, which also is kept (khranit'sya) here in the personal file, but

it ((can be)) taken out.

It 15, there is such a folder (korochka), the special check file is

sewn into the folder.

Probably here (Navernoye syuda).

A. To you, of course, every mortal man knows that there is a special

check file in the personal file, because without a special check they

do not take you into the MGB, but it also is true that even when now

employees are taken

on (dazhe pri postuplenil vnov' prinimayemykh)

they do not fill out two copies of the questionnaire.

---

## Page 51

104-10210-10033

B.

...And later

I filled out two more copies.

A.. It may be that you could have filled out one copy later, one more

after a year, perhaps anotier alter five years, and so forth, but

the Personnel Defartment needs only one good copy and absolutely

nothing more is

needed.

B. Two coples.

I married, my wife, they gave two copies again for completion on

my wife (dlya zapolneniya zheny).

A. We will be talking about this when we cose to this marriage, and

ve will return to this questionnaire.

I want you to understand what I am saying.

The next question - of which I had not wanted to remind you

((concerns the fact)) that the questionnaire both for new employees

(vnov' prininayemyye) and for KGB employees (sotrudniki FGB) is not

given to ((be taken)) home.

The biography, yes; you can write as much as you wish, even ten..

The questionnaire 1s

not given - and not because of distrust of a

Communist or of an employee - but only because it may be lost.

This is the only reason.

B. It may be.

It all may be.

But I took ((it)) home, and not ((just)) one time - ((my)! wife.

also filled ((it)) out at home.

A. Then you had begun work, later, this also must not be, but the

possibility is not excluded, that ((then)) you took ((it home)) --

I do not object to this so much; but when you had come for the first

time only and that they would have given ((it)) to you ((to take))

bome - this

question is completely ruled out.

Here is what

I want to understand -- you have told me that you took

((it)) or you did not take ((it))!

## Page 52

104-10210-10033

B. I do not remember, I do not remember.

Maybe I took ((1t)) .

A.

It is necessary then to say: I do not remenber, and I do not know.

B. But I know that I filled out a questionnaire... and wrote an auto-

biography... to my thinking, I wrote this at home, because I had,

I could not give the photos.

1.. I want to remind ((you of)) one ((thing)): that if ve will talk in

this way we will go slowly, we will go very slowly.

B. I cannot help you - forgive ne, please, forgive me - I cannot

help you, because I answer thus as I know, what I know, but you

want.

A. ... I do not at all need anyone's help....

B. I understand.

You know your business.

A. I need only the truth.

The fact was and is that the questionnaire is not given ((to be

taken)) home.

You told me that you took it houe.

I can in no way understand this.

I simply want to bear only one ‹(thing)) from you - that you tell

me that "I filled ((it)) out" either here or not here; if "I took

((1t)) home" - ((then you)) took ((it)) home; but they do not give

((it to be taken)) home; then you wrote it sonewhere else:

B. In that or another event, I filled it out immediately, or, after I

wag accepted, I filled it out at home.

In that or another event.

Only at home; the first questionnaire which was completed by me for

the MGB ((wife filled out)) only at home.

A. I do not vast to do it so that you, you understand, knowing exactly,

I think, not knowing where you filled ((it)) out, you insist now,

as far as they try to obtain from me, where vas this: - at home. -

and I say that ((it was)) at home.

If we will work this way, we will not find a common language very

soon.

I only want one ((thing)) -- that you answer just as it was.

If you do not know....

B. ((Interrupts)) I answer as I remember; the questionnaire was completed

at home.

Whether it was filled out immediately or later, I do not remember

this, but I filied it out at home.

... ..

A. ... It could not have been completed at home.

B. Hell, it ((matters)) Ilttle that it could not.

But I filled it out at home.

A. This answer will satisfy no one.

B. I cannot sit and lie to you, no, only for the sake of satisfying you.

A. I certainly do not want you to lie to me....

B. (XG)... I believe that you nant only the truth....

I am answering you that, yes, I completed the questionnaire, I do not

know wher, ((either)) immediately ((when)) they gave ((it to me)) or

later, but only at home, at home.

A. My only reply to this can be only one....

B. ((Interrupts)) And later I completed ((one)), also at hone, at home.

A. At home, in that year when you entered, you could not have filled

((it)) out.

104-10210-10033

That, aftervard ((you completed a questionnaire)), as you said, hen

you narrled, and so forth -- it goes without saying that this is

possible:

-...

B. It goes without saying.

It was later, when....

A. I even allow for (dopuskayu) an exception to the

regulations or

if the discussion is of such a case (esli rech idet) -- if a person

is working, then

sometimes such a

thing ((happens)), or lne possibility

((that)) it is given to employees whom they trust.

B. Understand; you were working ((there)); now you put the dots over

the "i"'s with such a funny question.

A. It is not a funny question.

B. It is a funny question.

Funny -

Fell, what; you know the regulation (polozhenlye) that an employee,

an operational worker (operativnyy rabotnik), let us say, must not

You know in real life they take ((them)):

They take ((them;).

I have finished work; I ((have)) two meets (yavka) in the evening; I

net the agent, but I have finished the last meet at 10 o'clock in

the evening, at 9 o'clock in the evening; I am ((too)) lazy to go

slich a distance to put in the report (polozhit' doneseniye); I go

home and ((keep the report)) in my pocket; right.

((XG - A and B speak at the sane time))

A. There must be some kind of foundations for this, true:

But you have not given them to me.

You say: "I really (tochno) completed ((it)) at home."

D. At home, at hone, at hone.

A. It does not happen so (('It is not so" - No byvayet tal:)).

Imagine - in no way ((docs it happen so)).

There must be some kind of foundations for your having filled it out

at home.

well, what kind of foundation.

Well, what kind of foundation can ((there)) be.

1. I do not know.

I want to understand, but I do not find ((any foundation)).

I would say to you even more....

B. Look here; if we continue further on this question I am afraid that

I myself will become confused; you will see ((this!) and say:

"Listen, ((B's surname)), what are you saying:

Now you told me one ((thing)); now you are telling me another, but

earlier, you told my colleagues -- a third."

You understand (vy poynite) that I will become confused.

• A. As soon as I came here today, I said that my task, together with

you....

B. To untangle....

A.

...To straighten out everything.

B. Right.

But, you see, you... me.

You say. "untangle", and at the sane tine you ask me such details

which I do not remember:

"So, tell ((me)), and how was this?" .

But I do not renember....

A. When I first asked you about the questionnaire and so on, you said,

"I de not remember", but then you said: "At home."

I saited a little and then I decided simply to say that it does not

happen so (ne byvayet tais) .

You could have answered me:

"Perhaps it hone, perhaps in the office,"

etc., but you are trying to stato that ((it vas)) definitely at

home.

Then I, knowing that this is not done at home, you must live me sone

kind of foundation ((for)) why, why this was so.

B. Why at home.

I can give the grounds -- because I even do not remember, mother,

this about relatives, and my nother, she was studying in the courses,

in the courses, in the period when she met father, in the courses,

but for the life of me; and then I do not remember what years she

was studying, where, what.

As concerns father, I know where he worked, there in Leningrad, the

street, the plant, such and such yea's, but I do not remember the

details about mother; therefore: I, I remember well that 1 filled

out the

questionnaire at home.

I asked mother, "But how ((shall I)) put ((about)) you here:"...

A. I agree with this completely.

More, I can tell you - if you do not know or, perhaps, do not wish

to say; there is no secret about this, the whole world knows about

It - for the person who fills out a questionnaire for the first

time for the KGB, it is rather difficult: there is quite a number

of questions about both nother and father, etc., ((the answers to))

which the son perhaps does not know at ajl....

B. And absolutely does not know.

And thererore I say....

A. This is done in the majority of ((such)) cases - the person sits.

reads the questionnaire, ((sees)) approximately what kind of questions

((there are)), and then collects the information from his father,

mother, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, or ((about)) who((ever))

else there was or was not, and then he

comes the next time and

finishes ((the questionnaire)), and so forth.

B.

And finishes ((it)), I understand this.

I filled ((it)) out at hone,

filled ((1t)) out at home.

A. What then...:

B. ((interrupts)) One minute; I do not renember, but I do not remenber

exactly whether this Personnel man (kadrovik) gave ne the questionnaire

to fill out.

((But) ) then what did I hand over to him.

I remember I vent over, rang him up, I gave hin some documents.

And at that time, you understand, I have recalled another detall,

when I already had begun work in March, on the first day I came

SHUENYAKOV talked with ne; SHUENYAKOV rang up GORBATENKO; GORBATENKO --

acting chief of the department (otdel) - took ne to his office, and

that day or the next the Personnel nan (kadrovik) who previously was

in the Second Chief Directorate (vo Vtorom Glavke) - the one, the.

Personnel man, who previously had been assigned (chislilsya) as an

officer of the Sccond Directorate (Vtoroye Upravleniye) - phoned me.

He called me ((to come)) to his office (('to hinself" - k sebe)),

here on the sixth floor in Building 2, the corridor, and gave me

the questionnaires and ((Without certainty)) the biographies to fill

out.

It may be that I am confused here; maybe I did not fill out anything

for Personnel there, but what I filled out -- what I am remembering --

is that which I received fron SAKHAROV.

Well, I cannot say.

I am afraid of tangling myself up, etc.

A. Of course, it is possible to believe what you have said - that it

happened the second time, etc, -- bit, you see, I do not want to

make any assumptions; you are a smart enough fellow and, having

thought for some time and with sone leading questions, I think ((you

are)) of a condition to give a more or less satisiactory answer.

Then it will be better if I say straight out that I do not remember

so, because I do not renember in detail ((the answer to)) this •

question.

A.

We are talking about the questionaire.

Of course, each KGB employee who has written it several times cannot,

of course, say that he doug not remember.

You understand that a person who has filled it out several times

cannot say that "I do not remember".

B. I do not remember how many times I filled it out.

((XG - A and B speak at the same time.))

1. Well ((in English)).

And therefore, of course, when you were talkiag with the other

when you stop in the middle of a sentence, ((then)) it raises a

question with me of whether you do not want to tell me ((something)),

when the whole world already knows this questionnaire, from the first

question to the last, and how many pages are in it; but when I am

talking with a former employee, one who was the same as I and worked

1. Well, let us begin lefore the berinning (pred nachalo:), when you

say

that your father ras a llinister and, of course, was in the

Kremlin many tines, etc., and procably was at conferences (soveshchani-

ye) of the Politbyure.

STALI''s death, as they say, ((was)) a very great rosent in the life

of the whole Russian or Soviet people.

They remenber all of this well, now it happened, etc.

Let us take a starting point before the death and at the time of

the death ((of STALIN)).

When did you first hear that STALTN ((was)) ill or that he ((was))

dead.

B. No.

((In an agitated voice)) It was announced that he ((was)) seriously

ill, that, it was announced even in the press and by radio that he

‹(was)) i1l....

A.

... Had you heard before this; for example, had you heard from

your father or irom someone in higher circles that he ((was)) 1ll

or sonething in this regard:

B. You understand how it ((was)) (Vy ponimayete v chen delo), literally

several hours, then they announced ((it)) inmediately.

It happened at night.

It happened at night with him, as far as I remember the details, I

heard ((of it)) fron father, well, then from father's circle

(okruzheniye) there and....

A. I an asking only that question; ve will not talk ((of)) then ((when)),

of course, there were many conversations afterward: of when he

becane ill, of wen his stroke (udar) seized him, and so forth.

This was

after everything already had becone known; I an speaking

now of before STALiN's illness; let us take ((for example)) the end

of February or the beginning of March.

that, sonething ((was)) not wholly in

order (ne sovses y poryadie),

with STALIN, in this line:

B. Well, could we not have heard ((of this)) fros anyone.

It happened with his at night.

In the norning it already had been announced by radio that he had

a stroke (udar).

A. Then I must make the conclusion that, before it was announced by

radio or in the newspapers, you had not heard fron aryone of his

illness.

B. No.

No, but I heard of his illness of some kind (o yego kakoy bolezai),

•of this illness - no.

I had heard that be ((had been)) rather (kakoy-to) strange of late,

((that)) he did not receive anyone; I had heard this:

A. Alright.

Let us cone back to this: he was rather strange, he did not receive

anyone.

Approximately when did this happen:

October 1952, the last during his lifetime and....

had some kind of strangeness, etc.

This is ny own (Eto u menya) ((interest)) -

I am not exanining you....

Le da dia ponder re

в. Но, до.

You see how it was, fron where I had heard.

Well, I had heard such things fron father, from father and from

father's group (obruzheniye otsa) -- HALESHEV, VINIKOV, KHRUNICTIEV,

OKOPOV - "Of late, 'The Boss (ihozyain)' is not receiving anyone;

he is a little strange, he has changed, he has changed extremely

in recent years"

Well, here was in mird. I kave in mind 1952, 1953, because in 1950 -

1951 I was not ((there)), I de not know, I was gone (ya byl v

ot'yezde), I arrived in 1952.

(1G) I have heard of strangeness (strannosti) of such a type, that

he was working (perenes rabotu) all night and in the morning, but

during the day, generally, they rarely see him, and he does not

permit ((anyone)) to approach him, ard it is rare that one sees him.

At that, fron my pal - Leonid PETROV, that is - I heard a little,

other details of ((STALIN's)) personal life, how he acts.

A.

But who is this PETROV?

B. His father, PETROV - Lieutenant Colonel PETROV - was Forking in

STALIN's guard (okhrana STALINA) .

A. In the guard around STALIN (V okhrane u STALINA):!

B. Yes.

And it was from him, from this Leonid I heard other details.

But this ((vas)), he, let us say (predpolozhim), he ((1.o., STALIN))

spent time in such a way.

he was about 30.

Because in the early years (osnovnyye gody) when he began work, I

B. IGNAT'YEV went to the Tatar ((Autononous Oblat)), as First

Secretary, to the Tatar ((Autonomous Oblast)); it was surprising that

his back.

A. Did you hear

from anyone what part the Second Chief Directorate

took in this Doctors' Plot and ((the case of)) the letters of Lidiya

when I cane, when I had arrived -- here is what r intcresting -

SHUBYYAKOY phonedme, he talkcd with me, he phoned CoRBATENKO,

GOREATENÃO talked with me, and this very day I saw the Chief of the

First Dopärtnert -- that is, you understand, he still was assigaed

((chislilsya), but was not vorking, chen was not working, as Chief

of the First Departnent -- Colonel &OZLOV, Anatolly Serceyevich.

1.

Everyone in the world knows him (Yego vse znayut, vo vsen wire);

ve do not need to talk about hin (ne sleduyet o nem razgorarivat').

B. No, here, he took part on the Docto!s' Plot (v dele vrachey); he

took part; they sent (brosill) hin to the Special Investigative,

Investigative Unit (chast') for Especially Important Cases; they

sent (biosili) him for (na) the Doctor's Plot, and he took what

part:

They cailed up all these doctors who had been arrested and persuaded

them to give testinony (pokazanly.:) thai everything that they had

said before this was untrue, that this was taken only by beating

(tol'ko hitven), that they had told lies (nepravda) .

And the poor doctors did not know whether to tell lies now or to

tell the truth.

A. But finally they agreed to tell the truth.

B. In general, they convinced the doctors to adait that the previous

testimony had been incorrect.

It was in this that XOZLOY took part.

And therefore I said, when GORBATENKO, bis Chief of Department

(yego nachal'nik otdela), because KOZLOV continued to be assigned

(chislit'sya) as Chief of the Departnent....

But, TIMASHUK, then, I heard that they took back the Order of Lenin,

that it ((the case)) was "manufactured (dutoye)".

TIMASHUK was an agent.

A. But not only heard.

He was ( (Chief)) at one time;

then, one time, RYASNOY.

Then RYASNOY was Deputy, then RYASNOY was Chief of the Hoscow

Directorate (Moskovskoye Upravleniye).

That is what I heard (Vot takoye, takoye, slyshal).

A. What happened to RYASNOY later.

B. He was retired (Y otstavke on).

He was retired, on pension, and did not work anywhere.

Why do I know:

Whom KOVSHUK worked; the dacha was near RYASNOY's (dacha byla ryadom

s RYASNYH) .

A. But what of SAVCHENKO:

B. SAVCHENKO (A SAVCHENKO) ....
