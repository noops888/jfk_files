ADMINISTRATIVE

This report is classified "Secret" in view of the fact

(1) it contains information from the New York Office fur-

nished byl

] PSI of the New

York Office, with possible double agent potential, dis-

closure of such information might possibly prejudice future

effectiveness of SANCHEZ (2)

The report contains informa-

tion furnished by ONI and the CIA, both of which agencie.

classified the Information submitted as "Secret."E

It is to be noted the San Antonio Office advised

in connection with its interview of the subject on Febru-

ary 14, 15; and 16, 1961, that the subject appeared com-

pletely co-operative during the interview and at no time

refused to answer questions. It was further stated by

San Antonio that it was the opinion of the interviewing Agents

that subject probably told the truth with regard to the bulk

of the information furnished by him and if he did distort any

information, it would have been in connection with his acti-

vities in Europe during the Summer of 1960 and his alleged

connections with anti-Franco and anti-SALAZAR activities.

Stunt:

San Antonio cautioned, however, that it did not

feel that it was possible to make a definite statement

as to the authenticity of the information furnished by

the subject or whether or not subject and his group are

bona fide defectors from the CASTRO regime. It is noted

by the San Antonio Office that subject and all members

of his group positively expressed their desire to actively

oppose CASTRO, not by forming political groups in the

United States, but by returning to Cuba and providing

actual military opposition to the present Cuban Government.

The San Antonio Office pointed out also that in

view of the fact that Captain WOODROW Y. CHIN, CIC, Fort

Hood, Texas, headed a special team of investigators inter.-

viewing the

subject for a period of almost three weeks con-

cerning military matters, the San Antonio Office did not

dwell upon these matters and Captain CHIN advised San

Antonio that results of his interrogation would be disseminat-

ed to the Bureau.

The name GALLEGO is a nickname given subject

GUTIERREZ claims his rank of Comandante was

accorded him by manimous vote of all of the Escambray

Mountain group on November 10, 1957. (The group numbered

twenty at the time.) (C)

GUTIERREZ has been on semi-inactive status

since January l, 1959, at which time the Second Front

was disbanded. However, he does not feel that he can

be considered a bonafide member of CASTRO's army,

since

the Second Front was never officially incorporated into

the rebel army. Accordingly, GUTIERREZ claims that as

of the time he departed Cuba (January, 1961), he had no

official title, position or standing in the CASTRO Regime•

GUTIERREZ said that although his name appeared on the Cuban

Revolutionary Army roster, he refused to accept any pay

checks and does not consider himself a member of the Cuban

Armed Forces. (1

GUTIERREZ said he arrived in Cuba from Spain

GUTIERREZ

claimed that he belongs to no political organization of

his only contact with politics was subsequent to his join-

ing revolutionary forces against BATISTA in 1952. Subject

claimed that during the early conflict against BATISTA, he

was a member of the underground and his mission included

sabotage and transportation of weapons to be used against

BATISTA. However, he stated that no incidents of any con-

sequence occurred

during the early years of 1952-53.

Subject mentions that weapons were stockpiled and later

placed in the hands of revolutionists, and that assaults on,

Moncada and Goicuria camps took place. FIDEL CASTRO directed

the assault on the Moncada camp and REYNO GARCIA directed Cir.

the assault on the Goicuria camp. It was around this time

forces.

GUTIERREZ' mission with these people was a fail-

ure,

and he returned to Cuba and organized the Second

Front. He asked the 26th of July Movement of FIDEL

CASTRO, the main fighting group in Cuba at the time, for

aid, but it was never granted. All the aid went to

CASTRO, who was in another mountain group in Cuba. Sub-

ject's group grew from fifteen individuals to approxi-.

mately three thousand in late 1958.

(e)

Upon CASTRO's taking power in Cuba after the

successful ousting of BATISTA, subject's Second Front

group was practically disbanded, which, according to

subject, was due to the fact that none of the members of

the Second Front were pro-Communist. Subject stated that

FIDEL CASTRO kept some of the high-ranking Second Front of-

ficers close to him, but they had no command position.

Subject said he attended official gatherings and had body-

guards, but had no coumand position.

In July, 1960, FIDEL CASTRO asked subject to

make a trip to the

socialist countries, but subject re-

fused. Subject stated that at this time he began plan-

ning his departure from Cuba, as he felt that FIDEL CASTRO

was beginning to work against him, and that eventully a

situation would occur whereby subject would be arrested

and

placed in jail.

He said that because of his opposition to

CASTRO's Communist actions, he was accused in newspapers,

on the radio, and by rumor, with being with counter-revolu-

tionary elements in bombings in Havana, and with involvement

with groups of anti-CASTRO individuals who fled to the

Escambray Mountains, and in GUTIERREZ' opinion, these were

CASTRO tactics to build up the image of the subject in the

minds of the Cuban people so that subject's incarceration

could be justified.

In view of this situation, subject fled Cuba

Subject stated that in 1959 he received a contract from the

CASTRO Government to demolish the old market place in

Havana. Subject said that he fled Cuba, since it appeared

to him that arrest, trial, and probable imprisonment by

the CASTRO Government seemed imminent, and that in order

to fight for survival and to reorganize opposition

forces here in the United States, it appeared necessary

to defect when he did. Subject said he feels he has

been misled by CASTRO, and that since his value in Cuba

had diminished, he felt he could be of more use in the

United States consolidating and mobilizing resistance

forces here to return to Cuba in a body. He said his

immediate plan was to organize a force of sufficient

strength and power to return to Cuba to overthrow CAStRo. (C)

Subject disclaimed any personal knowledge or

direct contact with foreign advisers of any type in

Cuba.

Subject also claimed that he has only hearsay in-

formation and information from unrecalled sources concern-

ing the military establishments and supplies in Cuba,

and that he is not aware of any command relationships

between foreign technicians and advisers in the Cuban

Government.

He did state that he believed there are about

two thousand foreign advisers and technicians who had

setup. The subject said that the primary function of the

Revolutionary Army appears to have been changed from a

fighting force to such tasks as operating labor battalions

and construction battalions, and that the primary function

of a fighting army has been

delegated to the militia,

which, according to the subject, could reach a mobilized

force of approximately two hundred thousand men. Sub-

ject stated the

militia is composed entirely of workers

all industry. Subject estimated that there was a per-

nanent minimum of thirty thousand militiamen bearing(©

all times.

It was subject's opinion that at the time of

his departure from Cuba, the only group which could be

considered loyal to the

CASTRO Regime was the civilian

militia, and that their loyalty stems more from CASTRO's

constant reminders that they are the principal force

to deter invasion from outsiders than from any deep-

seated allegiance to CASTRO of his regime.

Subject

stated that the Chief of the Cuban G-2, which is the

overall Cuban Intelligence Directorate, is RAMIRO

VALDES, and that G-2 supervises all military and civil-

lan agencies alike. He has unquestionable control over

all investigations, both within Cuba and abroad. G-2

personnel in Cuba have been likened to the Gestapo,

in both tactics, procedures and power. Subject said he

has no personal knowledge of key G-2 personnel, outside

of VALDES, but is aware that most of the key personali-

ttes have been recruited from the ranks of the Socialis

Youth of Cuba, a known Commmist youth organization.

Subject stated that the person who answers to
