SUMMARY

PCI|

advised SA JOHN W. REINHARD

that he received information from a source he considers

reliable and who would be in a position to obtain informa-

tion concerning subject,

to the effect that the subjec

luring 1961 was instrumental in bringing GEORGE TANZETTA.

a gambler from Massachusetts into the Scranton,

Pa., area.

This was done because BUFALINO at the time was in need of

LANZETTA, using information from track areas and

sure bets, hit the bookies in the Scranton area very badly.

Finally the bookies refused to accept any bets from LANZETTA.

LANZETTA left area at end of 1961 and reportedly has returned

to Massachusetts.

The activities of LANZETTA, according to

the informant, were with and on behalf of the subject.
