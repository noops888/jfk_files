" EMERGENCY CONFERENCE

TO DEFEND THE RIGHTS OF THE

BLACK PANTHER PARTY TO EXIST

Sizable Gathering

The so-called emergency conference to defend the

"rights" of the violence-prone,

Chicago, Illinois, on March 7 and 8. Because of the large

attendance-estimated at 1,000 the site of the conference

was changed from the Church of the Epiphany to the Malcolm X

University (formerly Richard T. Crane Jr. College), 2350 West

Van Buren Street.

The credentials committee reported that

there were 540 registered delegates from 23 states and that

• 128 organizations were represented.

Communist Sponsored

The Connunist Party, USA (CPUSA), maintained a low

profile throughout this conference, but there can be no doubt

that the CPUSA was the guiding force behind the conference.

National Chairman Henry Winstop and National Committee members

William L. Patterson,

Charlene Mitchell, Claude Lightfoot

and Jack T

Wing were named official CPUSA delegates to the

conference.

The Illinois District of the CPUSA reportedly

provided funds for salaries of staff workers in the temporary

office established for the conference.

In addition, CPUSA

functionaries in Boston, New York City, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis,

Denver, and other cities were in Chicago for the conference.

Welcoming Addresses

After the conference was opened by Father William

Hogan, Church of the Holy Angels, Chicago, Angie Dickerson

of the World Peace Council, New York, gave the welcoming

address.

Dickerson was a member of the CPUSA in the 1940's

and 1950's.

She was also Assistant National Executive

Secretary of the Civil Rights Congress, a communist front,

in the 1950's. She was in East Berlin last June to attend

the communist-sponsored World Assembly for Peace.

Short

welcoming speeches were also given by BPP Chief of Staff

David Hilliard, BPP attorney Charles Garry, and Dr. Quentin

Young, President of the Chicago Chapter of the Medical Committee
