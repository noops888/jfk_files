MENORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Manolo RAY

On 31 December 1964 I tried to phone RAY al

Puerto Rico.

was not at hom

(Charles Anderson) at 628-1899 in Washington between

â€¢1200 and 1400 on 1 January 1965.

He phoned promptly at noon on 1 January (collect).

I advised him that Andrews was not here,

but that I was

acting

In his stead. I did not give RAY & name during

this

conversation.

3. I said that I had.replies to the three questions

he had

put to Andrews as follows:

A.

If the U.S. Government is asked by a

friendly

government for an opinion as to whether

it should

import arms from the U.S. for RAY"s

benefit, we

would reply that our position is one

of neutrality.

If requested to give an opinion

of RAY, we would

reply that we consider him to

be a serious individual of

sound idcology.

RAY

said that this was

not all he wanted, but

felt

it would be adequate.

I said that the fact that

he has a commitment from us to permit the legal

fiction of the

arms export on his behalf is

probably the best argument he

can offer any

friendly government.

I pointed out we could go

no further than being neutral concerning the act

of exportation because me would

not want to apply

any implicit or explicit pressure on a friendly

government in this matter, since we feel that it

must judge the matter

in terms

of

its

own policies

" and national interests.

Government officials involved in the matter and

to the persons directly related to the particular

transaction.

I told him that it is not possible to give

him a definitive reply concerning the required

into which would appear on the commerclal shipping

documents, since this varles from destination to

destination. I said I had seen many shipping

documents covering arms which merely listed the

act that the shipment consisted of a given number

of firearms and listing the weight. I suggeste

that when he has a consignee in mind he arrange

what they contained, since in most cases, the

shipping documents are prepared to satisfy the

legal requirements of the country of destination.

which could embarrass a friendly government if

the arms are picked up by the Cuban Government and

eventually are traced to this particular

shipment.

I told him that we cannot give him i hard answer

on this question at this time, since & great deal

depends on the ostensible destination of the arms:

that we would have to insist that the shipmont

rollow normal legal patterns; but that since we

would have a list of all the arms in the export

permit application by serial number, the problem

He appeared to be

rcasombly well satisfied with

the replies given him and we signed off with mutual good

wishes for the New Year,
