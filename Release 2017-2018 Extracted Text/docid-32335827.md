there were two meetings of the above organization held at the

home of Delbert Ray in Midlothian, Texas.

held. He said he had been told that Otto (Duke) Koling had

attended both of the meetings.

Dallas

which occurred in Los Angeles, California, and the possibility

Dallas

I-I related that he did not know at present if any specific plans.

had been formulated concerning what steps might be taken 'by

captioned organization should similar riots occur in the Dallas,

Texas, area.
