Dear Mr. Hoover:

In regard to the columnist we discussed this

morning, I have learned that his

wife and daughter are

presently en route to Paris.

All three will be leaving

Paris on Monday, July 7, 1959, for a three-week vacation

touring Italy. Following this, he intends to go on io

Bucharest and to Moscow. It is assumed that the Bucharest,

Romania, visit will be in connection with President Nixon's

presence there. He intends to return to the United States

August 10, 1969, by way of Paris.

As of the moment, efforts are being made to get

the installation in. If the switchboard at the hotel

makes a

technical surveillance impossible, an effort will

be made to place a microphone in his room.

Dear Mr. Hoover:

I heard from Legat Philcox this morning.

regard to the man in Paris in whom we are interested, the

facts are these:

1) He registered at the hotel on June 29 and as

previously indicated plans to leave next Monday. He has

no regular assignment in Paris and comes and goes throughout

Europe.

!

2) Because of the hotel he is staying in and the

elaborate switchboard, it is not possible to put a telephone

surveillance on his room extension.

3) I told Philcox to push the French and see if

Than

we could get a microphone in his room. This they are trying

to do.

The question was raised as to whether they should

take anyone at the hotel into confidence should it be necessary

in order to place the installation. I said no do not take

anyone into confidence at the hotel.

I am following this matter very closely and you

will be kept advised.

On 11-4-69 the Attorney General asked that surveillances

be conducted of Joseph Kraft. On 11-5-69 we requested the Attorney

General for approval for a telephone surveillance and instituted a

spot physical surveillance on the Director's approval. The Attorney

General has not yet responded to our memorandum of 11-5-69 and nothing

of significance has been received as a result of the physical

surveillance. However, other coverage of the Washington Field Office

suggests that Kraft [has close contacts at the Polish Embassy. A

confidential source advised that Kraft contacted Jerzy Michalowski,

Polish Ambassador to the U.S., 10-29-69, and indicated that he had

Dear Mr. Ehrlichman:

With reference to your interest in Joseph Krast, it

might be significant to note that he has contacts in the Polish

Embassy, Washington, D. C., as indicated by information from a

confidential source that on October 29, 1969, he contacted Jerzy

Michalowski, Polish Ambassador to the United

State's, stating he

had a luncheon appointment with the Counselor of the Polish

Embassy, and suggesting that Michalowski join them.

Mi chalovski, 1am

however, said he was busy on that date, but countered with an

invitation for Kraft to visit him at the Polish Embassy on

October 31, 1969, at

3:30 poll. for a drink. Kraft accepted the

Invitation and Kraft's secretary subsequently confirmed

the

meeting for between 3:30 poll. and 4 poll. that date. (5)

It might also be observed in this connection that

(s)

Michalowsk has indicated friendship for other Washington

newspapermen in addition to Kraft. These include Charles Bartlett,

Chalmers Roberts, Murray Marder, and Max Frankel.

Dear Mr. Cutler:

Pursuant to our discussions. concerning the disposition of

is making the following

temporary arrangements:

your Committee and the content may nut be disclosed to unauthorized person-

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi.

l. Pending further Departmental action relating

to the policies which will govern records of the

type involved in Mr. Kraft's case, all documents,

recordings, or other records of any type in the

Department's custody or control which constitute,

summarize, or describe the contents of the over-

hearings obtained as the result of any electronic

surveillance directed against Mr. Kraft and mem-

bers of his family will be placed under seal.

As long as the items described above remain

ment will have access to them for any purpose, and

no official or employee of the Department will

allow any person outside of the Department to nave

any such access, except as described below. The

only material referring to these items will be a

single index cara needed to locate the sealed items.

The index card will bear only Mi. Kraft's name and

a file number.

3. Should some future need which we do not now

foresee require any official or employee of the

Department to obtain or permit access to the

aforesaid items, the decision on such access shall

be made personally by the Attorney General. The

Attorney General shall not grant any access without

notifying Mr. Kraft or his counsel in writing at

55279 DocId: 32989671 Page 18

.=2-

them

an opportunity to discuss the matter per-

sonally with the Attorney General before the

grant is made.

The notice shall set forth the

date upon which access will be permitted if it is

granted, and the purpose for which and person by

whom access is sought. The Attorney General will

personally inform Mr. Kraft or his counsel of a

decision to grant access as soon as practicable

after it is made, but in any event at least five

business days before access occurs.

14.

Although this arrangement is not intended

to

constitute a permanent solution to the questions

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney

General or his successors unless the Attorney

Gen-

eral gives Mr. Kraft or his.counsel ten days'

prior notice and affords him or them an opportun-

ity to discuss the matter personally with the

Attorney General before he rescinds or modifies

the agreement. If the Attorney General then

decides to rescind or modify this agreement he

shall personally inform Mr. Kraft or his counsel

of that decision at least five business days before

it is implemented.

AS

a result of our discussions, I understand that this

temporary arrangement is acceptable to Mr. Kraft, of course

without waiver of any legal rights he may have as a result

of prior surveillances.

As I advised you, we are working

, now on general policy determinations which, we hope, will

offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp~

•orarily. Of course, under the teims of this agreement we

will notify you of any policy determination which would

involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement should

assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use

these documents in any manner so long as they remain under

the seal arrangement.

Sincerely,

Bavara yu evi

ALL INFORMATION CONTAY AD

HEREIN IS UNCLASSIFIT

A United Press International (UPI) bulletin dated 6/6/73

which quoted "The New York Times, " said that John D. Ehrlichman

in 1969 directed that a wiretap be placed on the syndicated columnist,

Joseph Kraft, while the writer was away on vacation. The bulletin

said that the tap was removed before his return, when Ehrlichman

told former White House aide, John Caulfield, to call it off. Caulfield,

according to the bulletin, assumed that the "bug" was ordered removed

because The White House convinced the FBI to put a tap of its own on

Kraft. The Acting Director inquired, "Did we?"

Subject to

Among

the records recovered at The White House on 5/12/73,

by the Acting Director and Section Chief Thomas J. Smith, were two

folders which were unquestionabiy related to the same individual. One

was marked CATO (Top Secret) Sensitive Material - W. C. Sullivan"

and the other was marked "Joseph Kraft." For the most part, material

in the "CATO'' folder consisted of thin copies of informal memoranda

from W. C. Sullivan to Mr. Hoover. Also contained in the folder,

however, were nineteen pages (in duplicate) amounting to a transcript

Re: SPECOV

also sent to the Attorney General. The 7/15/69 letter to Ehrlichman was

a report of the microphone coverage of Krait in Paris. The 11/7/69

letter reported a contact by Kraft with Jerzy Michalowski, Polish

Ambassador to the United States and an invitation to Kraft to visit the

Polish Embassy for a drink. This was likely from coverage of the

Polish Embassy. (s)

With specific reference, however, to the question of whether

the FBI ever had a wiretap on Kraft in the United States, the material

in the Joseph Kraft folder indicates that consideration was given to

installing a wiretap on Kraft, but due to failure of the Attorney General

to provide (written) approval, it was never installed.

A W. C. Sullivan to DeLoach memorandum 11/4/69, captioned

"Joseph Kraft, Information Concerning" recited that a DeLoach

memorandum of the same date set out the Attorney General's request

for coverage of Kraft. The Attorney General, according to Sullivan's

memorandum (DeLoach's memorandum is not in this folder or elsewhere

in the records) asked the Bureau's views as to type of coverage which

should be instituted. Sullivan said that it was the feeling of the Domestic

Intelligence Division that a close physical surveillance of Kraft would

be too dangerous; that it was believed a selective spot surveillance

in the evening relative to Kraft's social contacts would be safe and

would be productive. Sullivan's memorandum also related that a

technical installation on his telephone might produce the information

desired by the Attorney General. Authority was given on this memorandum

for the Washington Field Office to conduct a survey to determine

feasibility of placing a technical surveillance (wiretap) on Kraft's

phone, both at his office and his residence.

A Sullivan to DeLoach memorandum dated 11/5/69 reported

that the Washington Field Office determined that a technical surveillance

was feasible. Accordingly, a memorandum consisting of only the

original was attached requesting approval of the Attorney General

for a technical surveillance on Kraft. This was sent from the Director's

office 11/5/69.

Memorandum to Mr. E. S. Miller

Re: SPECOV

The most recent memorandum in the Kraft folder was a

Sullivan to DeLoach memorandum dated 12/11/69, which stated that

a spot (physical) surveillance had been unproductive from an

intelligence standpoint and that we had not received an answer from

the Attorney General on our request for a technical surveillance.

Attached to this memorandum was a memorandum for the Attorney

General which stated that a spot surveillance on Kraft had been

unproductive and that no authority was received from him for the

installation of a telephone surveillance and, therefore, no such

surveillance was installed. The memorandum also informed the

Attorney General that under the circumstances and unless he

advised otherwise, the spot surveillance would be discontinued

12/12/69. No subsequent documents were contained in either folder.

As a matter of interest, the Kraft folder contains a

SENSITIVE

yellow file copy of a letter from Mr. Hoover to Mr. Jean Rochet-

• FORGIEN

Director, Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire, Paris, France, SouRcE

INTELLIGENCE

expressing appreciation for the unprecedented and remarkably

efficient assistance rendered to the FBI. This letter of appreciation,

bearing the dictator's initials of W. C. Sullivan, no doubt referred

to assistance relative to installation of microphone coverage on

Kraft in Paris.

A check of our electronic surveillance indices was made

on 6/7/73. However, there is no record that Joseph Kraft was

ever the subject of either a telephone or microphone surveillance

in the United States. It would appear that if any wiretap was

placed on Kraft in the United States, as alleged in the UPI bulletin,

it would have been by the group in The White House associated

with Ehrlichman, Caulfield, et al. None were placed on Kraft

by the FBI, according to the records available to us.

ACTION:

In response to the Acting Director's inquiry.

JOSEPE KRAFT

A United Press International bulletin dated June 6, 1973, which quoted

"The New York Times' said that John D. Ehrlichran in 1063 directed that a

•Wiretap: be placed on the syndicated columnist Joseph srait while he was

away on vacation. The balletin said that the tap was removed belore his retur

when Ahrlichman told former white House alde John Caulfield to cuil it on.

Caulfield, according to the bulletin, assumed that the "bug" was ordered

removed because The White House convinced the EBi to put 2 tap oi its cwn

on Kraft.

The files of the FBi do not reveal that Joseph Kraft was ever the

subject a direct telephone surveillance by the FBI in the United States,

However, on way 12, 1973, certain secords were recovered iromThe White

related to the same individual. One'folder was marked "CATO (Top Secret)

JOSEPH KRAFT

Joseph Krait while Kraft was in Paris. Tape recordings were turned over to

the Legal Attache who furnished them to I'BI Headquarters for transcription

and review. Documents in the folders reveal it was not possible to install

& telephone tap in Paris.

With specific reference as to the question whether the FBI ever had a

Wiretap on Krait in the United States, the material in the Joseph Kraft folder

Indicates that consideration was given to installing a wiretap on Krait but due

to the failure of the Attorney General to provide written approval it was never

"instituted.

Ic..

-.....-

i - - A memorandum dated November 4, 1969, in the Kraft folder Indicates

the then Attorney General requested coverage oi Krait. As a result, a selective

physical "spot surveillance" was initiated on krait during the evenings; however,

this was determined to be unproductive from an intelligence standpoint and the

Attorney General was advised by memorandum dated December 12, 1869, that

this surveillance would be discontinued unless advised to the contrary. No

] :

subsequent documents were contained in either folder.

÷

On September 4, 1959, Joseph Kraft advised the Washington Field Office

of the FBI that he leit his home (0021 N Street, N. W., Washington, D. C.) at

approximately 9:20 P.M. on September 3, 1959, to visit with former Governor

Averell Harriman who resided a few doors from the Kraft residence. "At

approximately 9:45 P.M. Mrs. Krait, who was in the second floor bedroom

of the residence, came down the stairs and found the front door open.

-

Subsequently, It was discovered by Mr. and Mrs. Kraft several items

of sterling silver were missing from the dining 100m and the pantry which items,

according to the Kraits, had an estimated value of approximately $10, 000.

A crime scene search and processing of the crime scene by the

Metropolitan Police Department produced negative results. No forcible entry

was noted and Mr. Kraft advised investigative officers of the Metropoiltan

Polica Department that he had probably left the front door ajar when he departed

- the residence.

On the morning of September 4, 1969, the Metropolitan Police Departinent

was advised by the Washington National Airport Police that some silverwara

had been found near one of the entrances to the terminal at the Washington

National Airport. The surerware was recovered by the Metropolitan Police

information concerning a burglary allegedly committed against Krait. In addition

to the data set forth in the enclosed memorandum to Cox, EBI files set forth

information indicating Kraft was overheard on wiretap coverage of several

Joseph Kraft Matter

SUBJECT:

w. pertine

DE

Lloydhutler, an attorney with Wilmer, Cutler and Pickering,

had requested Mr. Ruckelshaus to write a letter declaring that

any surveillance of Joseph Kraft, the columnist, had not been

conducted pursuant to national security reasons.

Mr. Ruckelshaus

was unable to send this letter because of his departure on

October 20, and, as you and I have discussed and Mr. Saxbe has

concurred, in our opinion it is impossible for us to send that

letter. In addition, Mr. Cutler requested that the Department

form

issue a policy declaring that no journalist would ever be tapped

for national security reasons. Pursuant to our discussion, it

was concluded that this was impossible for us to do also.

I called Mr. Cutler today to advise him that (1) we would

not be sending the letter he requested and (2) we would not be

issuing the policy statement he requested.

He was, of course,

concerned that we were not complying with his original request.

He suggested that the only reasonable alternative left for

Mr. Kraft was to litigate the issue. At that point we concluded

our telephone conversation and hung up.

BACKGROUND MEMORANDUM

Facts:

According to the sketchy avail

asle

information, it appears that a wiretap was placed upon

the telephone at the residence of Joseph Kraft some time

during June 1969. In his public testimony. before the

Ervin Committee, John Erhlichman admitted that he ordered

John Caulfield to install the tap, but he claimed that

Caulfield's attempt to comply with his order "never came

to anything." He also claimed that he had discussed the

tap with the President, and that the operation was ordered

for reasons of the

"national security." other availabie

information seems to indicate that the wiretap was installed

• at Caulfield's direction by John Ragan. It also appears

that the

tap was operative for a short period, and that

it was subsequently removed.

According to former Attorney General Richardson's

testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on November

8, 1973, after Caulfield's operation was terminated, the

matter was referred to the FBI. Other information indicates

that during the fall and winter months of 1969, the FBI

arranged for electronic surveillance of Mr. Kraft during a

visit to Paris, and it conducted physical surveillance of

Mr. Kraft's activities in Washington. The FBI denies

placing any subsequent wiretap at Mr. Kraft's residence

in

washington.

"While it appears that former FBI Director Hoover

may have ordered the FBI surveillances on instructions from

:

the White House, DI. Kissinger has

informed Mr. Kraft that he

knew nothing about any such orders and that the results of the

surveillances were never brought to his attention. Moreover,

it is understood that the FBI files on the matter state no

national security reasons for these surveillances. Under these

circunstances, it is difficult to see how a claim of national

security justification could reasonably be advanced.

Discussions with Department of Justice:

During

the summer and early fall of 1973, counsel for Mr. Kraft

conducted discussions with Attorney General Richardson and

Deputy Attorney. General Ruckelshaus. These discussions

were initiated with a view toward accomplishing two basic

purposes, without the need for extensive litigation:

--

I. Establishing as a matter of record that in . .

the opinion of the Attorney General the 1969 surveillance

activities were not reasonably justified as necessary

to obtain information vital to the national security,

either in its domestic.or. foreign aspects, and that

these surveillances disclosed no activities of Mr.

Kraft which posed any national security danger; and

2. Establishing a governmental policy for the

future which would prohibit warrantless electronic

surveillance of journalists engaged in gathering news

in the pursuit of their profession, whether or not the

government claims

a legal right to engage in such

in 55279 aCEtY 45989671 Page 34

---

## Page 35

While counsel believes that litigation could

accomplish both: of the above objectives, and that the under-

lying principles could be established as a matter of law,

counsel has been endeavoring, on Mr. Kraft's instructions,

to explore the possibility. of establishing both points

administratively before litigation is commenced. Prior to

the resignations of Mr. Richardson and Mr. Rückelshausi..

substantial progress was being made on both points. Mr.

Ruckelshaus had reviewed the available factual information

concerning the surveillances, and both he and Mr. Richardson

reported that they were working on departmental regulations

limiting warrantless "national security" surveillances.

Attorney General Richardson also informed the Senäte

Foreign Relations Committee during the confirmation hearing

for the Secretary.of State that he and Mr. Ruckelshaus were

engaged in a "full-scale effort" to establish new standards

Uin this area and the connice has established a secial

subcommittee to monitor these efforts. It is our hope that

this progress can

continue and that both the Department of

State and the Department of Justice will promptly support

efforts to clarify the facts concerning the surveillances

of Mr. Kraft and to issue definitive regulations prohibiting

similar activities, without a judicial warrant, in the future.

RETN IS UNCLASSIFIED

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

As counsel for Mr. Joseph Kraft, I am writing

about the disposition of the files relating to the results

of the personal and electronic surveillance of Mr. Kraft

and the members of his family and household, conducted

by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and by officials

lor employees of the White House in 1969.

Testimony before

the Senate Select Committee on Presidential Campaign •

Activities, the House Judiciary Committee, and three

Senate subcommittees

investigating warrantless wiretapping

and electronic surveillance has indicated that the files

concerning these activities are now in the possession of

the Department of Justice.

As you are probably aware, evidence made public

by these congressional committees has indicated that a

wiretap was placed on the telephone at Mr. Kraft's residence

in June, 1969, by persons employed by the White House.

The orders for the tap apparently came from Mr. John

Ehrlichman, who has testified that he discussed the matter

with former President Nixon. The tap was subsequently

removed, apparently because Mr. Kraft was out of the

country at the time. Shortly thereafter, Mr. William

Sullivan, a special assistant to the Director of the

Federal Bureau of Investigation, acting on the instruc-

tions of the Director and apparently of MI. Erhlichman,

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

nation artside your Committee.

nel without the express approval of the FBl.

## Page 39

•2=

went to Paris and arranged for an electronic listening

device to be placed in Mr.' Kraft's hotel room.

Later,

in the fall of 1969, Mr.

Sullivan also arranged for spot

surveillance of Mr.

Kraft's activities in Washington and

requested the Attorney General's approval for another

wiretap. That approval was apparently not given.

Files containing logs of the Paris surveillance

and other documents relating to the activities described

above, including summaries and internal memoranda consti-

tuting requests for various investigative activities, are

apparently contained within several files labeled with

Mr. Kraft's name or with the code word "CATO."

These files

were originally F.B.I. files, and were temporarily in the

custody of the White House until they were recovered by

Mr. William D. Ruckelshaus when he was serving as Acting

Director of the ?.B.I.

They are apparently presently being

held by either the F.B. I. of the Department of Justice.

Mr. Kraft has asked that we formally request

from you that the original files and all copies which have

been made be destroyed.

The record developed during the

House Judiciary Committee's' impeachment proceedings, as

well as the evidence gathered by other congressional

committees, raises grave questions about the legality of

• these surveillances.

Mr. Ruckelshaus, who has examined

the files, has testified publicly that in Mr. Kraft's case

there was not an adequate national security justification

for the surveillances,

and that the files did not indicate

that anything Mr. Kraft did posed any danger to the national

security. Hearings on Warrantless Wiretapping and Electronic

Surveillance, Senate Subcommittee on Administrative Practice

and Procedure, Committee on the Judiciary, May 9, 1974, at

316.

However the legal issues might be resolved, President

Ford's recent statement on the subject confirms that at the

very least such activities are improper and not to be

Accordingly, on behalf of Mr. Kraft, we request

accomplished. So far as we know,

there is no law enforce-

improper and unproductive surveillances should be retained,

My memorandum of september 46, 1974, advised concerning

a letter we received from Mr. Cutler representing Joseph Kraft in which

they requested destruction of certain surveillance files they alleged were in

the possession of the FBI concerning Mr. 'Kraft. Our letter to the Attorney

General dated October 15, 1974, enclosed a proposed letter for the

Attorney General's signature addressed to Mr. Cutler advising him that

• his request for the destruction of certain files must be denied. The

Attorney General signed the letter and it was sent dated October 21, 1974.

On October 24, 1974, the Director's Office received a copy

• of a letter Mr. Cutler prepared in response to the Attorney General's

letter of October 21st. A copy of the October 24th letter from Mr. Cutler

is attached and indicates a renewal of their request to have the files

destroyed. The letter furnishes additional arguments for destruction

of the files and insists on a meeting with the Attorney General and the

Deputy Attorney General.

We received only a copy of the letter addressed to the Attorney

General and no immediate action is required on the part of the FBI. However,

this matter is being pursued by a contact with the Department.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

This is in reply to your letter of October 21, 1974

in response to my letter of September 23, 1974 concerning

the records resulting from the 1969 surveillances of Mr.

Joseph Kraft.

With deference I must say that I find your letter

at variance with the efforts made by your predecessor,

Mr. Richardson, and his Deputy, Mr.

REuckelEnaus, to pi/ - 46

right the wrong done to MI. Kraft.

and Foreign Relations on May 9, 1974, that in his judgment,

• .

after reviewing the files, there was no valid national

security justification for the surveillances. In so doing,

he was confirming statements previously made by him directly

to Mx.. Kraft and me while he was Deputy Attorney General

or Acting Director of the Bureau.

Lacking any valid national security justification,

the surveillances were wholly illegal. They were conducted.

on a United States citizen - a journalist entitled to the

most scrupulous official regard for his First Amendment

rights - without a warrant, and in the case of the wiretap

at Mr. Kraft's home, without even a written authorization

from the Attorney General or the Director of the Bureau.

• Under these circumstances

we can see no justifica-

tion for the Department of Justice or the Bureaú to retain

the fruits of illegal surveillances, involving a detailed

record of Mr. Kraft's .contacts and conversations in the

pursuit of his profession over an extended period of time,

as well as personal conversations within the Kraft family

and between Mr. Kraft or his wife and their friends.

Insisting on retaining these fruits seems particularly

difficult to understand in a new Administration that is not

responsible for the illegal surveillances and that is pub-

licly dedicated to defending the right of individual privacy

against official intrusion.

We recognize that various clearances and waivers

may be necessary if the records of even illegal surveil-

lances are destroyed. This is why Mr. Kraft and I requested

an opportunity to meet with you and with the Deputy Attorney

General before you replied to our letter. We have every

reason to believe that the problems of clearances and waivers

could be worked out.. In such a meeting, it should be possible

find a practicable solution that would free the Department

from the embarrassment of holding the unwanted fruits of an

illegal surveillance, while. at the same time assuring Mr.

Kraft and his family that, even within government intelli-

gence circles, these illegally obtained records of their

•conversations can never be disclosed.

Mr. Kraft and I therefore respectfully but insistently

renew our request for a meeting.

Thic letter will respond to your recent letters to the

Dircetor of the E I and to me concerning Mr. Joseph Krait.

It is the general policy of the Department of Justice to

decline to confirm or deny allegations of electoric surveillance

except as may he necassary for liligation. 'Theretore, my reply to

yone request that certain files be destroyed must be drawn in terms

of the general polloy concoming all clectronie surveillance files of

the Department including files of the Fat.

It is also our policy that any information secured from

an electionio surveillance, whether pursuant to a statute and a court

order or an authorization of the Attorney General for national security

purposes, is banciled in tie strictest confidence, restricted on an

abaolute need to know bosts and retained in accordance with the law,

In this connection, the Federal law concerning court-authorized

electronic surveillance strictly limits the uses to which such informa-

tion may be put and requires that recorcings of any overheard conver-

sations be maintained fos at least ton years. While all of these

requirements are not logally applicable to national socurity surveillances,

we lave nonetheless sought to follow a practice of retaining records or

such electronic surveillances so that we would be in a position to

appropriately respond to court orders issued in connecton with criminal

or civil litigation. Lestruction of records such as these could operate

Con-

inappropriate as well as possibly unlawful.

This Department is aware of the problem of invasion of

privacy that is involved in national security surveiliances, and it is

our policy to insure that such overhearings are unlised only for

legitimate and strictly limited governmental purposes. I am sure

that you will appreciate tant retention of ail such electronic curveillance

records, under appropriate safeguards, is the best protection against

Dear Mc. Cutler:

Pursuant to our discussions concerning the disposition of

is making the following temporary arrangements:

This document is prepared in response to your request and is not for dissemi-

to the policies which will govern records of the

type involved in Mr. Kraft's case, all documents,

recordings, or other records of any type in the

Department's custody or control which constitute,

sunmarize, or describe the contents of the over-

hearings obtained as the result of any electronic

surveillance directed against Mr. Kraft and mem-

bers of his family will be placed under seal.

2.

As long as the items described above remain

under seal, no official or employee of the Depart-

ment will have access to them for any purpose, and

no official or employee of the Department will

allow any person outside of the Department to have

any such access, except as described below.

The

only material referring to these items will be a

single index card needed to locate the sealed items.

The index card will bear only Mr. Kraft's name and

a file number.

3.

Should some future need which we do not now

foresee require any official or employee of the

Department to obtain or permit access to the

aforesaid items, the decision on such access shall

be made personally by the Attorney General. The

Attorney General shall not grant any access without

notifying Mr. Kraft or his counsel in writing at

least ten days prior thereto, and providing him or

them an opportinity to discuss the matter per-

sonally with the Attorney General before the

grant is made.

The notice shall set forth the

date upon which access will be permitted if it is

granted, and the purpose for which and person by

whom access is sought. The Attorney General will

personally inform Mr. Kraft or his counsel of a

decision to grant access as soon as practicable

after it is made, but in any event at least five

business days before access occurs.

4.

Although this arrangement is not intended to

constitute a permanent solution to the questions

you have raised concerning these documents, it

will not be rescinded or modified by the Attorney •

General or his successors unless the Attorney Gen-

eral gives Mr. Kraft or his counsel ten days'

prior notice and affords him or them an opportun-

ity to discuss the matter personally with the

Attorney General before he rescinds or modifies

the agreement.

If the Attorney General then

decides to rescind or modify this agreement he

shall personally inform Mr.

Kraft or his counsel

of

that decision at least five business days before

it is implemented.

As a result of our discussions, I understand that this

temporary arrangement is acceptable to Mr. Kraft, of course

without waiver of any legal rights he may

have as a result

of prior surveillances.

As I advised you, we are working

now on general.

- policy determinations which, we hope, will

offer a permanent solution to the problem this settles temp-

orarily.

Of course, under the terms of this agreement we

will notify you of any policy determination which woula

involve a modification of this agreement.

Until a final policy is determined, this agreement should

assure Mr. Kraft that no person will read or otherwise use

these documents in any manner so long as they remain under

the seal arrangement.

Sincerely,
