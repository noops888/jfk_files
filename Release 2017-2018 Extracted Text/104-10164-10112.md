# 3 DEC 1963

Lo I recently spent approximately three days in Halts (9-12 Dec 68) and

whale there had extended vimits with Clears Joseph Charles, President,

Banque Coerciale d'Initi, and also owner of a sisal plantation and n111.

Present during my visits with Charlen was his personal assistant and con-

Sidant, Ludovich Celestines.

Charles, & devout Catholic, personally told

me that he intended to attempt to overthrow Duvalier. He bas made specifia

plans for this overthrow In late February or early March 1969.

He claims

that he definitely has the Army and the Catholic Church with him, and

that the overthrow will be without bloodshed.

I had not intended to contaot other officials or individuals in Halt.

&" However, on the laat day. of my stay I was invited to vloit with Clovlo

N. Desinor, formerly Haiti's representative to the UN and currently Dr.

Duvaller a Minister of Finance. He 1a said to be the do. 2 man in Haiti -

next to Duvalier.

Present at the meeting with Desinor was his assistant,

Dio Herve Boyer and reportadly the No. 3 man.

So I firet met the individuala mentioned above in 1965-66 while on en

extended stay in Haiti: for busineos purposes.

I was introduced to Charles

§* In a period just prior to June 1967 Duvalier was convinced by Desinor and

Boyer that Charles was, or at least had been, plotting Duvaliers' over-

throwe

Together with & large group Charles was imprisoned In Port-au-Fringe

from June 1907 to June 1968. .

6. Just prior to the arrest of Charles, Max Rowe's wife, Raymonde, took

US$200, 000 out of the bank and hid 1t near Cap Haltien In the north and

advised Charles' wife of the location. ' In addition, Max Rovelalma

ZANK S FINANCIAL CONDITION*

7o Although Charles has the bank, his position at present 1a difficult. I

saw the bank balance sheet which shows aisets of USse.9 million but orly

U3$29,000 (a8 of 10 Dec 68) cash on hand.

With this; amll amount of cash

he can no longer make loans. He says that he has found It necessary to

mke sireable loans to Unitians who have in turn made highly speculative

Joans to others at exorbitant rtes of interest: Very ninor amounts of

these loans have been repald to the bank and thua his current l'inactal

position®

&. Charles 1s hopeful that when Duvalier's overthrow has been completed he

w1ll be able to get private finanoial assiutance from the US.

According

to Charles, US financial organizations have almost completely stopped

their asstatance because of the oppressive Duralfer Goverment.

9. Charles saye that Max Rove 1s avre of his plans to overthrow Duvaller :

which vere communicated to Rowe by a In Bonte Jean, who ta also In the

US.

Charles says that the Army Is unhappy with Divaller because of the

execution of fourteen officers after the abortive May 1968 Invasion,

which Included MaJor Tona, who was popular and povertul in his position a

„ censor and in control of all foreigners coming into haiti.

Nos pulssants amis commns tant à New York, Washington, Miant et ailleurs ont

tous manifesté un désir sérioux de lud venir en aide dana len Linites de leurs

possibilités respectives.

Port-aimPrisce

Ha1t1

la chère Sophie,

Cette lettr est pour t'accuser réception des tiennes des 17 et 26 m

beaules et du l juin en cours.

SI tu n'as pas eu de mes nouvelles depuis non départ d'falti le 7 mal dernier,

elost que premièrement, je me proposais de retoumer voir Clénard la senaine

suivante.

Le vojage a dl ltre différé lorsque j'al su que Clémard avalt, a

nouveau, été srrête le 1i mal.

Jul annoscer mon arrivée et je suis sûr qu'il a dû t'en Informer.

Duelèrement, l'arrestation de Clémari sinal que les nouvelles der derniers

Avênements en Halti on eu des effets négatifs sur les néguciations en cours

que j'avals entamées pour Clémard et qui semblaient vouloir aboutir. Je n'al

• pas besoin de te dire combien j'en al été bouleversé. Alors que nos enis

d'el et nos pensions pouvoir aider Clémard que nous éstimons conne un frère,

ma nouvelle arrestation est venue nous assommer avec une rigueur dont nous

moun remettona a peine.

Avant d'aller plus loin, je dois te dire que tu ne dois point douter de notre

dévouement pour coman.

1 salt, et tu dois aussi le savoir, que nous ne

saurions jamals marchander notre concours à un and pour qui nous avons a plus

grande affection et pour qui noua sonmes prêts à consentir tous les sacritices

personnnis que les circonstances peuvent exiger. Je crois devoir te dire que

11, en dehore c'Halti, je n'arrive a'le tirer de l'impasze dans laquelle 11 se

trouve, je doute fort, sans fausse modestie, que quelqu'un d'autre julese

a le faire.

Nos puissants anla commns tant à New York, Weslington, Miami et ailleurs ont

tous manifesté un déstr sérieux de lui venir en aide dans les limites de leurs

possibilités respectives.

Depuie non retour d'faits je me suis mis en action à cette fin et ai personelle

ment vu plusteurs personnalités du monde financier qui n'ont pas hésité à

consacrer une grando partie un leur tenpe précieux à la concrétisation des plans

que j'a en à envisage? avec clémard en vue de la tirer d'embarras le plus

rapidement possible.

Nes espoirs de réusaite ainsi que ceux de tous les amis contactés se sont

heurtés aux effets négatifs Inévitables provenant tant de la nouvelle arres

tation de Clémerd que des derniers événements survenus en Halti depuis le

20 mas écoulé.

Je t'envole, pour preuve, cople d'une lettre d'un de ces

rands anis, Mr. Howard Burris de Washington, D.C. Je te demande de garder

cette lettre strictement confidenticlle car je n'gurais pas alnê que le nom

de ltr. Burris so1t mentionné & quiconque en Haltl.. S1 cela arrivalt, nous.

pourrions perdre un très bon ami.

Pour ton Informiation, Je te diral que Mr. Burris est un colonel retraité du

Corps de Génie de l'arnée andricaine, ant personnel et conselller du Président

Johnson et extrêmement influent & Washingtor. tant dans le monde politique que

Iinancler.

J'al eu & faire deux voyages à Washington entre le 8 et 11 mal ou

cours desquels lu1 et mol ervisazions ies moyens d'aider Cifnard selon le "modua"

envisagé.

La cople de sa lettre du 7 juin en cours saura te conilrmer ce qui

précède.

J'al aussi vu personnellement et lul al causé maintes fois au téléphone,

Joseph Dryer, qui devalt se rendre en Hait1 le 24 nai pour te vois mais qui a

dl:renvoyer son voyage après les nsuvelles de la dernière tentative d'invasion.

Je lul al encore causé récemment au téléphone et 11 a eu à me faire part des

resultats negatifs de sed errorts, t

toujours en f'onction des mèmes circonstances.

Le lettres adressées aux autres anie de l'étranger, dont Dabinovick, par example,

mont restées jusqu'ici sans réponses.

Je vais une nouvelle fois ecrire longue

ment & Dabinovick pour luf tranemettre ta dernière communication avec l'eapolr

-d'evolr un mot encourageant de lu1.

Conme tu

dole le comprendre, ma chère Sophie, nos efforts, malgré toute notre

bonne volonté, re sauralent, se concrétiser à brève échéance, cor les valeura en

question qu'1l noua faut trouver ne sont pas insignifiantes. Je te atgnaleral en

passant un point qui e été soulevé au cours des négociations et qui falt ressortir.

que mêne s1 nos amin seraient en mesure d'avancer à Clémard les valeurs nécesnaires,

1le ont des doutes serioux non pas sur le sincórité de Clémara à faire face aux

obligatione qui devront être contractées, male A la possibilité matérielle de ra

patrler, en dollars anéricains, les valeurs avançées.

j'al personnellement assitte

& des contacta avec des banquieru d'ic1 qui alfirment qu'avant longtenpe, Haltd

n'aura presque plus de devisos-dollars pour solder ses camptes à l'étranger, Autant

d'obatacles que je sula malheureusoment obligé, de te signaler pour que tu saches

D. quos t'en tenta.

Concernant maintenant le zrand banouler noit dont j'al eu mol-uême l dire A

clénard que je croyala pouvoir, nous aider, celu1-el a eu a me falro comprendre

qu'11 ne pouvalt an l'occurrence intéreuser son inatitution à une affaire de ee

cante qui comporte trop de riaques. Da au cûtá la la nly a dond pas grand aspo1r:

Ceel dit, malgré tous ces obstacles qui senbleraient Insuruntables, je n'al

pas totalement perdu l'espoir de pouvoir t'aider à sortir Clémard, sain et

sauf, de la prison où sa santé se détériore rapidement, Je le anis. L'essentiel

est que le Chef lui reme soit percuadé que l'inhabilité que nous éprouvons a

satisfaire les exigences du moment, ne sont en aucune façon Imputables & Cltard

mais plutôt. A des circonstances totalement indépendantes de notre volonté.

je prie Dieu Tout puissant pour que l'on finiase par réalsaer que Cllmard, en

bon patriote haltien, a eu fo1 en son pays et n'a pas cru bon d'expatrier, comm

plus d'un l'a fait,

le fruit de ses durs labeurs et de son interigence pro

duetive.

Je me proposais d'ferire 'personnellement à Son Excellence le Prénident & Vie

d'Halti, pour implorer sa clémence et an générosité pour un ami qui nous est cher.

Je me suis alors demandé si c'étalt la un geste sage qui pourralt avois le vertu

de l'épargner et, dans le doute, j'al préférer m'abstenir.

Pour revenir maintenant aux roseibilités de féaliser au moins partiellement, In

valeur exigée, je dols te dire que je suis heureux de savoir que tu détiens une

procuration générale en bonne et due forme t'habilitant & ratlfier tout ce que

nous pourrions entreprendre à cette fin.

Séparément, par cette mêne vole, je te comminiqueral toutes les formelités A

remplir pour nous mettre en mesure de réaliser dans un délas raisonable au moine

le tlera de la sonne róclanée:

Il serait souhaitable que tu sois mise en mesure

de venir iel & New Yori, co qui Inciliteralt beaucoup les choses, male dans 11

posa1b1l1t€ d'une pareille alternative, tu devras done agréer aux conditions .

stipulées.

Il faudra donc 815

avec dilligence pour nous permettre d'aller lu

plue vite.

Ma chère Sophie; je termineral cette lettre deja lorgue et ardue en te renou

velant mon dévouement le plus entier & la cause de notre an! Clonard et en te:

prient une nouvelle foie de ne jamale douter de mes sentiments propres et ceu

de ma fanille pour clêmerd, tol et les tiens.

able to control the situatici and outlive Duvalier, it was better to be

"In" than "out" or to put it another way to be alive than dead., I can

say that on several occasions, was it not for Mr. Charles' Influence on

Duvalier, this latter would have done more ham to the poor pelple of

Haiti, in general, than he has done so far.

"I have always maintained a dialogue with fir. Charles and passed on to

DUVALIER HIMSELF WAS IN THE

WHEN HE GETS RID OF MILITARY MEN OR CIVILIANS FROM

IT IS BECAUSE AS CHIEF OF STATE. HE IS FULLY AWARE OF.

THE REALITIES OF HAITIAN POLITICS. CLEMARD JOSEPH

CHARLES, WHO GAINED MUCH OF WHAT HE HAS UNDER MAGLOIRE,

WAS AMONG THOSE WHO FINANCED DUVALIER'S CAMPAIGN.

IT IS ONLY LOGICAL THAT DUVALIER WOULD RESENT THAT

FACT. FURTHERMORE, SINCE CHARLES IS ACTUALLY A

CANDIDATE FOR-THE PRESIDENCY AND MANEUVERING

AGAINST DUVALIER; DUVALIER WILL DISCOVER SOME "EVIDENCE"

LINKING CHARLES WITH THE NINETEEN EXECUTED OFFICERS.

ARRANGED THIS FOR HIS OWN PURPOSES. HE NEEDED TO HAVE

A BANK TO RECEIVE. NON-FISCAL DEPOSITS FROM WHICH HE

GREW ANOTHER REASON WHY DUVALIER IS ANGRY AT CHARLES.

WHEN THE NON-FISCAL ACCOUNTS IN THE COMMERCIAL BANK RAN

CHARLES USED THESE BONDS IN HIS FINANCIAL MANIPULATIONS

BASED ON TERROR AND INTIMIDATION. THE BOLD STROKE IS

The following le ny humble appraisal of the politirel situation

now provallIng in Haltl.

As 1 repeatedly stard. to enyons who may have asted ne, ry noti-

vations are purely patriotic wille I en also noved by s sincese desire

tó see initi amorse as a dinerable independent ration friendly to the

United States.

Strec I Left lalt1 vith my fantly ten years ago to later become en

Ameruin citizen, I have made several trirs to Haiti and have ruintained.

close contaets with people in all walke of life both in laits and wit

those

who were forced out of the country for political reasons or other

•wise.

My latcet visit to Haiti took place on June 5th of this year and I

stayed tro, days In Port-au-Prince, Altnough the purpose of my trips

were mostly buniness I also had the opportunity to discuss the Haitian

political situation with politicians,

as well as with average Haltian

eitizens concerned with the situation.

ly personal conclusions are as

follows:

The fact le that the Duvallor regine 16, at present, in a state os :

Interial polltient contusion in which so one direcaly or Indircetiy.con

nected with it con prediet the outcome. There 1s strung evidence showing

that his son ininw, Colorel lar Deninique, has in fact tried to overthrow

Astairs, Yow Duvaller becane aware of Colonel Dominique's Intentions 18

the question everybody 10 trying to sind the answas to. Neverthelose,

Duvaller rounded up the alledged associntes of Colonel Doninique and,

after a nock cous. martial secusing and convincing IS young arny officers

of treason they were 'all killed by a firing squad on sure 8, 1967 at

Fort Dinanche on the outskirts of Port angrince, Duraller himself was

present at the slaughter and he ordered Col, Dominique to be A member of

Indicates that several other persors, low failing military personaci,

allitio mcn

and civilians were also executed or sinilar charges, without

fanfare.

It is alsn the general concensus of opinion that the "purge"

vill continue at a rate that no one can yet determine.

i jo one ignores that there has been and still are very hostile feelings

between two groups within the President's family and close associates.

One 18 headed by Colonel Da-inique and his wife Marle-Denise Duvalier,

and another is led by irs. Yvon St. Victor, the President's private se

erctary and confidante. The names of the President's wife, Simone, his

son Jean-Claude and his younger daighter Sinone, are being mentioned as

being part of the first crup. In the second group, Mrs. 'St. Victor's

brother, the present Head of the Department of Tourism, Nr. lue-Abert

Foucard, who is also married to one of the President's daughter, 18 among

other names such as Henri Siclalt, head of the Regle, Minister Lebert .

In.Pierre, etc. mentioned to be siding with irs. St. lictor. So far, the

President has shown signs that he lavers the latter group. The ramifica-

•tions of both grosps extend to people who were considered the most fanatic

supporters of Duvaller hinself. The fact 1s that none of the remainina

so called strong nen of Duvalier in the militii, the Tonton Macoutes or

the Army know for sure how the president feels towards them and are very

mich concerned about their own future and survival... In other vords,.

confusion and insecurity are wide spread amonget Duvalier's follovers.

ling belleve that in spite of the actual confusion and senes of Insecurity

Provalling In governent circles, there 18 no real organized opposition

de such against Duvaller at this moment, except for what I will point out

later in this paper.

iw-i,

f. "There 18, however, strong anti-Duvaller feelinge in the middle and

upper elansen of Haiti, representing only e anall percentage of the whole

population.

radically leftist oriented Governent. If allowed tine, Duvaller may

well succeed to turn the country Into a now communiat satcllite and work

out some agreements with communist countries. Here again, se should not

fall to mention the new exchange of diplomatie representations between

Halts and some communist countries.

The most 81en1sicant one 1s the nur

appointent in Halts of an Ambassador from Poland With won, I was told,.

Duvaller 1s closely working with.

Taking everything Into consideration:

!. The non existence of ary organized opposition In Halts;

2. The state of non cohesiveness and distrust anongst the exiled

political elements abroad, therefore nullifying any positive action from

outalde Hatti;

3. The fear of local politicians that, 1l' outalde forces were to come

In, their safety and security would be very much at stake, therefore they

should resist such intervention and do whatever la necessary to prevent

1t at all cost;

t. The fear of Duvalier's so-called followers that they may be eliminated

upon mere suspicior, Just or unjust denonciations;

l, The middle and upper classes sentiment that the U.3. is not working

an It should to bring about the downfall of Duvaller and that the U.S. 1a

even supporting the rogime Intentionally or unintentionally by not en

couraging or allowing the opposition to organize' 1tuelt;

6. The Interpretation of the above classes which are at a loss to under

stand the allence of the U.S. press in general for not having raised the

unal Indignation about the recent mass killings, therafore making room.

Sor the beller of a possible collusion by meane of money or othervise of

Duvalier with said press, particularly the New York Timed, to refrain Iron

bringing these frete to the attention of International publie opinion;

It would be childian, however, to formulate an opinion only on the.

basts of the mentioned facts, althouch on the surface, they appear

logieal enough to confim these conclusiors.

I az convenced in my own mind, that then some politicians close to

Duvalier will feel that their lives are. In real danger, some of then

Will successfully attempt to eliulnate him even though thay mey not be,

therselves, in a position to control the chaotle situation that will ne

cessarily follow. This 18 where the real danger 18. If any such uri

planned action was allowed to take place, the U.S. will then find 1tself

with a real "not potato", reguiring such drastic action sintlar to those

takin in 1965 during the recent crisis in the Dominicon Rerublic. Such

actions are not to be desired, not only because they are costly to the

American taxpayers, but because they Inevitably provoke strong anti-

American feelings bused on the opinion that the U.S. did nothing to help

bring about the collapse, but le merely there to Impose Ite choice and

decisions against the will of the people. If the U.S, 1s t0 walt for the

OAS to decide

on joint action in the eventuallty of chaos, we are afraid

that communist influence and even control of the situation by forces

based in Cuba and other countries, will make 1t much more difescult to

cope with within the contest of our national security. It 10, therefore,

Imperative, in our opinion; that the U.S. take some steps towarde working

vith local politicians to take ine Initiative of a coup which, when per.

formed, would receive the strong backing of this country, militarily,

financially and otherwise; to sucure an orderly succession of the present

ragine. As far as Halti 18 concerned, I feel that I have the most adequate

aclution for the proporad action. I fool that whenever the recurity os

anda nation or any nation 1e concerned, there 10 no time for wait and sed

conasderations: In the case of Haltl, In particular, where the political

mene 1e really deprived of Individuals of strong convictions; one vay or

the other, we feed that the U.8, should not have any problem in findina

nomeone that they can build poistically and work with in a aincere and

doyl effort to help that small nation solve some of 140 perennial probient.

In conncetion with tho possibility of finding a political leader,

ne indicutod above, I must say thint I have been in contact with a man

whom, I foes, could very voll i: 1 the pusition. H1s none is clenard

Joseph Charles, President of In: i Commerciale d'llaiti, President of

Halti'& Chanber of Commerce, A an'cetor of several other business and

Industrial organizations in Holts.

I have known 8r. Charles since 1951. We have been friends and

businesa associates eversince. To me, vi. Charles 16 a true and sincere

patriot. Of course, today, a number of people question his patriotisn

on the basia of hia close cooperation with the Duvalier regime. I have

myself; sometimes, felt that he went too far. I have also told him so,

many tines. His answers. on such occasions have, nost of the tize, satisay

my own judrement. In fact, Mr. Charles told me that, knowing Duvalier,

as he knows him, it would have been e question of life or death 1, he

wore to behave in a different mannes. What would his death serve 1f he

had taken a position of nor compromise? He feels that in order to be.

able to control the altuation and outlive Duvaller, 1t was better to be

"In" than "out"' or to put it another way to be alive than dead... I can

"ay that on several occasions, was 1t not for Mi. Charles! Influence on

Duvalder, this latter would have done nore har to the poor pelple of

Haiti, in general, then he hau done so ser.

I have always maintained A dielogue with Mr. Charles and passed on to

hin as mich as possible the judgenents of Haitians and others with who

he had no direct contact. I must say that I have alwaye find hin f

coptive to their opiniona.

Everiince I have know Mr. Charles, he has alvays told me of his

ambitiona and determination to be a Broat Hastian. He asked no to never

let him down and to stay with him to hoip him carry out his dream. Though

•I5 has 800t me sno of my friends, I have extended to him everything that

I could posalbly offer to help him rouch nlo 800l8.

Unlike the majority of luttian politioiano, Mi. Charles hao an 18-

mumontable faith In the suture of hlu country. He feele that 14 Halt,

under Divator, has conelderably recrauned in evory way, the time War 60n0

the U.S.. 18 I statod before, vr. Charles feeld that without United

States backing, no government con possibly exiat in Halti except undor

the very some conditione of Duvalier'a Goverment.

There would be no

season to precipitate a change 11 laiti vere to ramain under a tyranical

dictatorahip like Duvaller's...

What Mr. Charlos 1a asking as a prereguisite of any setion to be

sponsorod or initiated by him 1s the assurance from a person of established

authorsty in the U.S. Govemment that the United States will support the

provisional government that vill necessarily have to assure pover after

Duvalier.

The dispositions taken by Me. Charles are that e military coup by a

Junta will take over and stay in power until free eloctions are held. the

nonbers of that military junta have been already selected by Mr. Charles,

Vho has their commitments to that effect. Mr. Charles boldave that 11

Should the United States consent to his request in the form mentioned

concerned:

Why should the United States gamble on any other caloulated riek,

Ms, Charles feels that althouch it will probably be impossibie to pre

vent acts of reprisals during the firat 72 hours of the mill'ary take.

over, strong efforts should be made to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

Ma. Charles, in my opinion, is one of the few indivituals around whom

a reconciliation of all the social divisions and subdiviaiona of the

Hastian fonily can be achleved.. I will mention some of the baolo reasons

behind this opinion:

1. He 1s of nodest rural extraction, therefore is what 1e called In

Masts a "son of the sasses";

2. He is black, therefore representing the vast majority of the

Hastian people vho, at this point, considor: the 11cht-akin laltian as

& threat for the retur of the domination of the mulatto minority;

3. He 1a deprived of the prejudice of color, therefore the mulatto

minority will find in him a certain feeling of socuriss and can be ai

mged that 1t will not be persecuted solely on the basio of the color. os

THE CASTROITE HAITIANS HAVE A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF SEIZING POWER. )

2. (HEADQUARTERS COMMENT: THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT OF

CLEMARD JOSEPH CHARLES HAS BEEN DRAWN FROM INFORMATION FROM

VARIOUS RELIABLE SOURCES: SINCE ABOUT 1983, CHARLES HAS TRIED

TO GAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR HIMSELF AS THE SUCCESSOR:

TO PRESIDENT DUVALIER; HE HAS THE REPUTATION OF BEING AN

OPPORTUNIST, SHREWD, CAPABLE, AND UNSCRUPULOUS, AND HAS DUVALIER'S

CONFIDENCE WHICH HE HAS USED TO FURTHER HIS OWN EFFORTS AGAINST

DUVALIER. THE INTORMATION WHICH FOLLOWS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING

MORE THAN AN EXTENSION OF CHARLES' ATTEMPTS TO PANIC THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND THEREBY GAIN THE SUPPORT OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT

WHICH MAY CONSIDER CHARLES AS THE LESSER OF A NUNBER OF EVILS.

HIS ALLEGED SUPPORTERS, LISTED BELOW, ARE BELIEVED TO BE

IXBIGXIFICANT AND HIS ALLEGED ARAT SUPPORTERS ARE SUSPECT.

CHARLES' REFERENCE TO FIDEL CASTRO AND DOMINICAN PRESIDENT

JOAQUIN ENAQUIR AS HIS COMPITITORS IN A RACE TO OVERTHROW

DUVALIER IS CONSIDERED TO BE WITHOUT BASIS " A CALCULATION BY
