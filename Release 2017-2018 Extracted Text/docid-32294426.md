That information from MM 1298-C-TE

which has been used within the body of this report

has been paraphrased and only that portion which

has been confirmed and reported by other

informants

has been used.

on October 8;

1968, MM: 1298-C-TE advised

that on October 3, 1968, SANTO TRAFFICANTE, his

attorney, FRANK RAGANO and HUMBERTO TRUEBA ROJAS,

traveled to Quito, Ecuador, leaving Miami at 4:00 AM;

October 3, 1968, via Braniff International Airways.

RAGANO was accompanied by a woman named

PATRICIA OSBORNE, who had been recently widowed within

the past twenty days when her husband was killed in an

airplanecrash in Quito, Ecuador

RAGANO was traveling as

her

attorney and allegedly, OSBORNE was paying the full

expenses of

RAGANO and TRAFFICANTE to Ecuador.

On the trip, TRAFFICANTE mentioned that he

originally had intended to deplane in Panama, but

changed his plans for unexplained reasons.

On arrival in Quito, Ecuador,

the party flew

immediately to Guayaquil, and they checked into the

Hotel Humboldt in Ecuador, Room 212, on Thursday,:

October 3, 1968. Shortly thereafter, RAGANO and Mrs

OSBORNE left the Humboldt and moved into the Hotel Cima;

In Guayaquit, TRAFFICANTE and TRUEBA: made

contact with an Ecuadorian attorney, JOSE ORDENANA

who has offices in Guayaquil. ORDENANA WaS placedin

charre of handling the Ecuadorian interests whach involved

the construction of a new hotel, Hotel

Continental,

to be constructed immediately in Guayaquil, and which

will cost two million Us. dollars.

Construction

on this hotel, which has been licensed by the government

and a casino license obtained by TRAFFICANTE and his

associates, will begin within forty days, and is

expected to take a considerable length of time in

construction.

On October 22, 1968, MM 1298-C-TE furnished

the following information:

Plans are continuing for the construction of

the hotel - casino in Guayaquil, Ecuador.: Construction

will begin in less than two months

Some of the

financing will

come from

the Quito hotel owner,

EMILIO BRUSONI (phonetic) who TRAFFICANTE met in Ecuador.

TRAFFICANTE plans to retain 51% of the ownership of the

corporation and plans to sell the remainder. LAZARO

MILIAN DID and EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL both want to buy

into the deal and will probably buy separate interests:

TRAFFICANTE plans to give HUMBERTO TRUEBA ROJAS an

undefined interest for his work in setting up the Ecuadorian

contacts.

FRANK RAGANO; TRAFFICANTE attorney who accompanied

TRAFFICANTE and TRUEBA to Ecuador, has recently taker

an apartment in the Sheraton Four

Ambassadors in Miami

TRAFFICANTE has advised TRUEBA to contact him through

RAGANO rather than through EVARISTO GẠRCIA VIDAL because

of all of the recent publicity over the bribery arrest

of LAZARO MILIAN DID.

TRAFFICANTE also worries over

the fact that GARCIA VIDAL talks too much about his

interests with TRAFFICANTE.:

attorney who daise then that woMAn AN entito local

worry about over his arrest on bribery charges. The

lawyer allegedly advised them that as long as no money

changed hands, the state would not have a good

case.,

MILIAN has, therefore,

changed his plans to flee the

U.S. and is now talking about returning to the local

bolita business. EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and his son,

EVARISTO GARCIA SARMIENTO, still are operating their

bolita lay-off business,

and since the arrest of MILIAN,

GARCIA SARMIENTO. is running

some

of the errands for his

father

EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL cashes his shylock loan

checks in the Varadero Market located on Flagler Street

where the owner will take the checks daily and deposit

them through his personal account in the Republic National

Bank, Flagler Street and LeJeune Road, Miami, Florida

TRAFFICANTE and TRUEBA ROJAS are interested

in obtaining the concession to operate the Jamaican

National Lottery:: A friend of TRUEBA from Cuba;

DAYTON HEDGES, is a close personal friend of the

Prime Minister of Jamaica.

HEDGES is a wealthy Cuban

exile who owned the Ariguanabo Textile factor in Cuba

On November 14; 1968, MM 1298-C-TE advised

that TRAFFICANTE plans to meet with HUMBERTO TRUEBA

ROJA and FRANK RAGANO some time during the coming

week to discuss the Ecuadorian hotel - casino deal.

There has been

no change in TRAFFICANTE's plans for

Ecuador at this time. RAGANO has been in New York

for several weeks and is due back sometime after

November 15th.

Source was contacted on November 20, 21, and 25,

1968,

at which time he stated the meeting between TRAFFICANTE,

RAGANO,

, and TRUEBA had has yet not occurred.

On December 3, 1968, MM. 1298-C-TE advised

that TRÄFFICANTE had

met with HUMBERTO TRUEBA at the

wake of EVARISTO GARCIA's mother-in-law on Saturday,

November 30, 1968:

After the wake, TRUEBA and

TRAFFICANTE

left together and had dinner together at

Prila's Restaurant, 37th Avenue and Southwest 8th

Street., Miami. TRAFFICANTE advised that he was returning

the next day to Tampa and would be out of the Miami area

indefinitely because of the local law enforcement pressure

on EVARISTO GARCIA VIDAL and his bolita organization.

TRAFFICANTE complains continually about the

constant

surveillances by law enforcement officials and

continually reminds his associates never to talk business

over the telephone or while riding in an automobile.

He

tells them also to continually be alert for surveillance

vehicles and as an example TRAFFICANTE states that when

arriving at an airport he will never take the first taxi

in line but will always take the second or third taxi..

TRAFFICANTE has mentioned that he is suspicious about his

Ecuadorian trip that he took with FRANK RAGANO and HUMBERTO

TRUEBA because on his return to the U.S. he was not subjected

to his usual strip search by Customs officials.
