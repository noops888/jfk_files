MONGOOSE

The Attorney General's assistant says his afternoon

1s

free Thursday.

Therefore, we have set up Mongoose for 4:00

o'clock. Ed Murrow will be on hand.

Herewith are the following papers:

1. The Lansdale schedule.

He has talked to State (Goodwin and Hurwitch). Somewhat

to everyone's surprise they seemed to have no substantive suggestions,

being simply a little unhappy they hadn't been consulted.

All others have concurred (CIA with some reservations).

Suggest you ask for formal concurrence.

2. USIA Report on Broadcasting.

This memorandum was addressed to Lansdale and this is a

bootleg copy. However, I've now asked for one for our file, and

Murrow will bring other copies to pass out.

It is a curious memo. It is difficult to figure out what

they are saying - whether they are for stepped-up broadcasting, or

not. Actually, they've played it cozy by saying what can be done

but at the same time saying we shouldn't ask for trouble.

Marked paragraph on page 5 is particularly interesting.

My general conclusion is that, given the situation today,

there is too much on the negative side of all this to justify going

ahead now.

3. Cubans for U.S. Army.

Memo from Lansdale, attaching Gilpatric paper sent to JCS.

Suggest you needle on progress.

4.

Intelligence reports.

You wanted to mention report in Weekly Summary of 22 May,

officlal. Also over-optimistic report of 21 May.

Arrangements could be made to buy time on one of

seventeen U.S, "clear channel" stations in the event a short-

term tactical situation should arise which would justify such

an operation.

3. Recruitment of Cubans into the U.S. Army

General Craig reported that the JCS had established a

deadline of June

8th for developing a plan.

The Group agreed

that this is now a matter of considerable urgency, especially

since it has been the object of very high level attention, and

therefore General Craig was asked to move this deadline up.

4. Progress Report of 31 May

The Group came to the following decisions on General

Lansdale's memorandum:

Task 7, "Voice of Free Cuba," is approved with the

understanding that it will be handled in a

low key and that CLA

w111 maintain very close coordination with State.

b.

10, con loaflet belloons, yes nog approved

Then Coper lioner

That more detalle on abjectlyes, feestorytes

visibility, etc., be developed.

On Task 19 - Training of 20-Men Teams - the Group

directed that a detailed plan be prepared, with particular emphasis

on covete

d.

Task 29 Countertete Currency a che Seoup

dpected that an evaluation de prepated on exactly that could be

sagospitaged and now is would be done, as well as why this is

good time to consider such an operation.
