purpose of affording the Government's witness, CARL NOLL,

a psychiatric examination.

has been maintaining an aerial surveillance oi the area knowr

as Churchill Farms which is a large track of swamp land owned

by CARLOS MARCELLO.

This area is an excellent duck hunting

area and there are numerous duck blinds maintained on the

property.

determined that the area in the vicinity of the duck blinds

have been baited.

ing and charging the individuals who are hunting from baited
