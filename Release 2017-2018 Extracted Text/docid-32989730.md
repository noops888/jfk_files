Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Criminal Investigative Division

Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

JAMES EARL RAY - INFORMATION CONCERNING

advised that the Committee did not instruct or direct

the informant to obtain this information.

Mr. Blakey

allowed SAs Coulson and Stearns to look at the map and

to compare it with an aerial photograph of the prison.

The map corresponds fairly accurately to the aerial

photograph; however, it should be noted that the may

depicts an additional guard tower on the north wall of

the prison that was not in place at the time of James

Earl Ray's previous escape attempt.

There are nota-

tions on the map with instructions

to toss or throw

an

unidentified item into an area within the prison wall at

an area near the

east bluff that borders the prison

property.

There is another notation indicating that

another

unidentified item or items should be buried near

a large tree adjacent to the northeast corner of the

wall.

There are further notations indicating that it is

possible to walk along the bluff that adjoins the east

wall of the prison.

Mr. Blakey advised that the informant had gone

to considerable trouble to have his name placed on

James Earl Ray's visiting list. It had been contemplated

that the informant and Jerry Ray would be visiting with

James Earl Ray prior to doing some "legwork" for Mark

Lane, attorney for Ray, and for captioned Committee. The

informant has been advised by Jerry Ray that this

"legwork" will possibly not be necessary.

This causes

the Committee to opine that it may not be necessary

because James Earl Ray plans to escape and additional

work will not be necessary. On one visit to the prison,

James Earl Ray and the informant walked along the bluff

that overlooks the area where the item is to be thrown

into the prison compound.

Mr. Blakey further advised

that the informant has not been apprised of any escape

attempt, but bases his belief in the validity of the

escape attempt on the fact that the map and accompanying

instructions appear to be legitimate, Jerry Ray's

examination of the area overlooking the compound and

the fact that the informant has been told that they

may not be doing "legwork" for Ray's attorney.

Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Re:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

JAMES EARL RAY - INFORMATION CONCERNING

Mr. Blakey further stated that their investi-

gation has determined that prior to escape attempts by

James Earl Ray, he has been visited by a member of his

family shortly before the escape attempt took place.

Jerry Ray is scheduled to visit James Earl Ray on 5/15/78.

He is scheduled to testify before captioned Committee on

5/10/78.

The Committee staff feels that the escape attempt,

if it takes place, will occur sometime after 5/15/78.

Mr. Blakey advised that the Committee is very

reluctant to bring this matter to the attention of prison

officials inasmuch as

they fear the officials will

place James Earl Ray in solitary confinement and change

existing procedures to prevent escape, thus compromising

their informant.

The Committee is obviously concerned

not only with preventing Ray's escape, but with the

possibility of apprehending Jerry Ray

for his part in

the conspiracy to assist in the escape attempt.

Mr. Blakey stated that he did not know what, if any,

involvement prison personnel may have in the escape

attempt and was therefore reluctant to take the matter up

with prison officials.

Mr. Blakey stated that he does not know anyone

in the Tennessee State Police to refer this matter to and

does not know their capabilities for handling this type of

He feels that based on the FBI's involve-

ment in the prior escape of James Earl Ray, there is

a potential violation of the Unlawful Flight Statute and

a conspiracy to violate the Unlawful Flight Statute.

Mr. Blakey feels that this is a very sensitive

situation. If the Committee were known to furnish this

information to prison authorities, and James Earl Ray is

placed in solitary confinement, it could be looked upon

as an attempt by the Committee to harrass Ray in order to

have him cooperate with the Committee.

Memorandum to the Assistant Director

Criminal Investigative Division

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS:

JAMES EARL RAY - INFORMATION CONCERNING

It should be noted that James Earl Ray and

five other individuals escaped from this prison on

6/10/77 and were apprehended within a few days. The

Attorney General authorized the issuance of an

Unlawful

Flight Statute warrant based on

United States Code, Section 371, Conspiracy to Commit

Offenses Against the United States, and Title 18,

United States 'Code, Section 1073, Unlawful Flight to

Avoid Confinement.

On 5/26/78 Mr. Blakey advised that the informant

could be contacted by the FBI, working through the

Committee staff.

RECOMMENDATION:

In view of the sensitive nature of this informa-

tion and the notoriety attached to this case, it is

recommended that it be discussed with the Director and

the Attorney General.

ADDENDUM: CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIVE DIVISION (CID) FXO:WSS 4/27/78

While James Earl Ray has achieved notoriety as the

convicted killer of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he remains

incarcerated at a Tennessee prison based

on his conviction in

state court. In 1977 when Ray and others escaped from Brushy

Mountain State Prison, we did get involved in the effort to

apprehend him based on his alleged conspiracy to violate

Title 18, U. S. Code, Section 1973 (Unlawful Flight).

In the present circumstances, no escape has occurred

and no real jurisdictional basis appears to exist to support

any investigative activity by the FBI. Inasmuch as Mr. Blakely

has seen fit to bring this matter to our attention, we believe

that we have a distinct obligation to see that prison and state

officials are made aware of the alleged plan. If a criminal

act is underway, it is entirely a matter for prison and state

officials to address at this point.

CID recommends that a representative of Legal Counsel

Division advise Mr. Blakely that the FBI will not initiate

investigtion and that he should disclose information in his

possession to appropriate Tennessee authorities. If he is

reluctant to make such disclosure, he should be advised that

the FBI will do so on his behalf

and will make every effort

to act in such a manner as not to jeopardize the source of the

information.

Department's extradition file on Ray (95-100-473) • The DOJ/FBI

communications were omitted due to a prior agreement not to

process documents contained in the Bureau's MURKIN file; the

extradition file was not processed because it was felt to lie

outside the scope of our 12/13/77 request.

In light of the limited amount of material produced in

response to the initial HSCA request, it is hereby requested

that the Department of Justice provide, on an expedited basis,

the following additional material:

1) Copies of all memoranda, records and documents genera-

ted by the Department of Justice in connection with

the MURKIN investigation, including all correspondence

or communications from the Department of Justice to

the FBI, and all correspondence or communications

from the FBI

to the Department of Justice.

It is

assumed that the vast majority of documents produced

in response to this request will be located in DOJ

file #144-72-662.

2)

3)

Copies of all memoranda, records and documents,

located in DOJ file #95-100-473 or elsewhere, genera-

ted during the course of proceedings relating to Ray's

extradition from England in the summer of 1968.

Copies of all documents contained in the folder

entitled "Martin Luther King Daily Reports"

, referred

to in a February, 1976 memorandum from Stephen Horn,

Attorney, Criminal Section, Civil Rights Division, to

Walter W. Barnett,

Deputy Chief,

Appellate Section,

Civil Rights Division. Mr. Horn's memorandum, which

was included in those documents recently provided. to

the HSCA, indicates that the reports contained in

this folder cover a period between 2/4/65 and 3/14/68-

4)

Copies of all memos from Hoover to the AAG concerning

the progress of the

investigation. These memos,

included as item "7" of Mr. Horn's above-referenced

memorandum, were apparently located in a filing

cabinet in the Civil Rights Division at the time of

Mr. Horn's memorandum.

In addition, it is hereby requested that copies of the

two additional files listed below, (and referenced in Mr. Horn's

pliance with the December 13, 1977 HSCA request, we ask that

SUBJECT:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (HSCA)

PURPOSE: To advise that the HSCA has requested access to

five (5) informant files and to recommend that access to these

Miles by the HSCA be restricted only to Mr. S, Robert Blakey,

Chief Counsel and Director, ASCA.

DETAILS: In connection with its investigation into the

assassination of Martin Luther King, Jf.;

the HSCA, by letter

to the Attorney General dated April

12, 1978, requested access

to FBI Headquarters (FBIHQ) files of 5 informants, who reported

on activities of the Invaders, a Memphis youth group involved in

violence during the Sanitation

Workers Strike in Memphis during

March-April, 1968.

Through review of the Invaders' file at FBIHQ, the

HSCA learned that the Memphis Office had 5 informants who

were providing coverage of the Invaders.

Mr. G. Robert Blakey,

Chief Counsel and Director, HSCA, has advised Legal Counsel

Division that the HSCA is trying

to resolve the issue as to

whether or not the Invaders fomented racial violence to get

King to return from Atlanta to Memphis where he was killed.

The HSCA desires to review these informant files to determine

if any of them acted as "agent provacators" in starting this

violence.

EX-I01 REGES 62-117250-757

To date the only informant files made available to

the HSCA have been in instances where the informant has been

publicly identified or where an informant, during interview by

the HSCA, has admitted his relationship with the Bureau and

signed a

waiver authorizing release to the HSCA all FBI

information concerning him. The latter has occurred on three

occasions.

12 MAY 23 1978

Discussions concerning release of these informant

files have been conducted by representatives of the Legal Liaison

and Congressional Affairs Unit, Legal Counsel Division,

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES (SCA)

Division and Congressional Inquiry Unit, Records Management

Division. Conclusions are as follows:

(1) Protection of our

informants and sources throughout the course of the HSCA

investigation is of paramount importance. (2) If release of

these safey the is A met armants de net responsible

for violence which occurred in Memphis at the time King was

killed, then the best interests of the FBI are served; (3) Io

avoid precedent of the HSCA's staff reviewing informant files,

only Mr. Blakey should be given access to these 5 informant files.

at fBIHQ.

On April 26, 1978, Mr. Blakey advised that It would

be acceptable that only he be given access to the Invader

informant files.

If approved, files will be processed by the Congressional

Inquiry Unit and prior to being made available to Mr. Blakey,

excisions will be reviewed by the Top Echelon and Criminal

Informant Unit.

RECOMMENDATION: That approval be granted to process these

5 individual informant files for access of Mr. Blakey in

order to comply with HSCA request of April 12, 1978.

Memorandum

: Mr. Moore Dund TEM

UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE

FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

DATE: 5/16/78

FROM : E. J, Sharp EASTEM

SUBJECT:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

U. S. HOUSE OF RE PRESENTATIVES

1E7

PURPOSE:

To state the position of the Organized Crime Section, Criminal

Investigative Division (CID), regarding the confidentiality of informant files

in cooperating with captioned Committee. See D. Ryan to Mr. Bassett

memorandum dated April 27, 1978.-239

DETAILS:

CID is aware of the issue which the House Select Committee on

Assassinations (HSCA) is attempting to resolve by review of the five informant

files in question. Moreover, CID agrees that limiting the review of excised

versions of the five files solely to G. Robert Blakey is a reasonable response

to the Committee's request. However, the Organized Crime Section, CID,

wishes to go on record with the following concerns in this matter:

1. Any request which exceeds the agreed manner of review, such as

a request to review the complete informant file should be strenuously challenged

and refused.

EX-101

REC@562-117290-

160

2. Requests for copies of any portions of the excised informant files

should also be declined as it is obvious that access to both the contents of the

substantive case files and even excised versions of the informant files would

permit identification of the applicable informants.

MAY 23.1978

IND

CID is sensitive to the continued and real need to take every effort to

maintain the confidentiality of the identity of an informant and Bureau records.

maintained on his behalf. As in the past, any subsequent requests from the

Committee concerning informant records should be referred to CID.

The HSCA desired to interview

informants providing that information, if informants would be

agreeable.

This information is furnished by the above two

By teletype

these offices

informants initiate contact with the HSCA was the best method

of handling this situation.
