ADMINISTRATIVE

Delay in handling this matter is due

to the fact

that Agents who have had this case assigned have been used

in connection with the racial matter special at Bogalusa,

Louisiana in the case captioned "THOMAS HARVEY ROBINSON,

Aka.,

CAA - PIRACY; INTERFERENCE WITH

FLIGHT CREW MEMBERS OR

FLIGHT CREW ATTENDANTS; JDA"and the case captioned DOUGLAS

CHARLES EMERICK; NANCY GEORGETTE KELLER - VICTIM, KIDNAPING.

It is noted that based on investigation in this

matter a new case has been opened concerning JAMES B. ESPOSITO,

who has been selected as a target under

the Top Echelon

Criminal Informant Program.

Photograph of subject obtained from his Louisiana

Drivers License was

forwarded to

the Bureau by relet.

Due to information furnished by reliable sources

reflecting subject has apparently disassociated himself from

former hoodlum friends, this matter is being placed in a

closed status and will be reopened in six months for further

investigation.
