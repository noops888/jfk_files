NOTES

Cuba

The U-2 which flew yesterday's mission over

Cuba crashed while returning, about 40 miles north

of Key West. Air and sea rescue craft were sent to

the scene.

An air rescue unit sighted an unopened

parachute, a life raft, and oil slick in the crash

area.

The pilot is presumed lost.

There is no 1n-

dication that the plane was attacked.

Berlin Local East German troops acting without

higher authority appear to have been responsible

for turning high powered searchlights on pilots tak-

ing off from Hest Berlin's Tempelhof airfield on

14-16 November. There were five such incidents. A

message of 16 November instructed border guard ele-

ments to discontinue such acts.

There have been no

further incidents reported since.

ALbania-USSR

A Radio Tirana broadcast has accused

Khrushchev of personally releasing Barghoorn for

fear that Moscow's wheat deal with the US might col-

lapse.

The Albanians are on record as preferring

to eat grass rather than to kowtow to the fest, but

they are not above eating Chinese wheat acquired from

regine stayed in high gear this

week.

b. The number of armed attacks

was off from the high of the previous

week but still sone 50% above the

year's weekly average.

C. These attacks have been,

for the sost part, small-scale efforts

directed against the government's

paramilitary forces in the villages.

They have been designed more for

their psychological impact than for

immediate nilitary gain.

d. & high volume of nessages

cosmunications nets indicates a prob-

able continuation of this effort.

There

are, however, a few signs of dissen-

sion within this group and between

it and civilian politicians.

g. One of the more ambitious

and troublesome figures is the able

but opportunistic General Ton That

Dinh, the new Minister of Security.

He has been travelling about the

country spreading the idea that the

coup was largely his doing and seems

bent on developing his own independ-

ent base of power. He is a man to

watch.

h.

The new regine has also

embarked on a purge of high military

officers who sided with Diem during

the Buddhist crisis and failed to

get on the right side soon enough.

C. Moscow has tried on a num-

Soviets attempted to reserve "blocks"

of air space for their own use. They

This sort of harassment

stopped in the spring of 1962 when

Soviet leaders became convinced

that the US was interested in a

serious discussion of a Berlin settle-

ment. Moscow may hope that the

threat of more of this sort of har-

assment will jog the US into talks

on Berlin.

a.

North Vietnamese leaders

are pressing their campaign for neu-

tralization of South Vietnam.

b. They can count on Cambodia's

support. Prince Sihanouk has said

he believes neutralization of South

vietnam to be the only way to keep

his country and the rest of the area

from falling eventually into Commu-

nist hands.

c. The French feel the same

way.

Indeed, Souvanna Phouma re-

portedly told a closed session of

the Laotian National Assembly that

the French were urging him to sup-

port Hanoi in this.

d. Moreover, according to one

botan lan

of our clandestine sources, the North

Vietnamese have talked Souvanna into

backing the neutralization proposi-

tion in the UN.

The troublesome Polish ICC

delegate in Laos, Marek Thee (who

will be going home soon), has just

returned to Vientiane fron Hanoi and

is trying, with somewhat less suc-

cess, to enlist British support too.

1. As part of the same campaign,

the North Vietnamese have told the

French they believe sentiment is

growing in the US for withdrawal of

us forces.

They reportedly plan to

keep the heat on to encourage it.

Hanoi is at the same time

trying quietly to encourage the belief

that it is ready to be reasonable.

h. To hear Thee tell it, North

Vietnamese leaders feel that neutral-

ity for South Vietnam and eventual

reunification is the only way they,

too, can escape from Peiping's clutches.

South Vietnam

2.

Vietnamese Communist forces

kept up their high post-coup level

of

activity over the weekend.

b. The most significant action

was an attack early yesterday morn-

ing against a US special forces train-

ing camp some 30 miles from Saigon.

c.

When the smoke cleared after

a sharp fight, four US soldiers were

missing and at least 35 South Vietnamese

were dead.

d. Late yesterday morning, the

Viet Cong shot down two aircraft sup-

porting a government operation in

the extreme south, and damaged twelve

more.

Two more Americans are missing

in this action.

e. Back in Saigon, the new re-

gime's

troubles with the ambitious

General Ton That Dinh continue.

f. He is still angling to get

control of the important strategic

hamlet program and has yet to give

up command of the Third Corps, which

the generals assigned to another of

their number earlier in the month.

This corps is of particular signifi-

cance in that it surrounds Saigon.

We have a report from a good clandestine

source that a group of army officers is plotting

with Defense Minister Boumedienne to overthrow Sen

Bella. A growing estrangement between the two has

been apparent for some time, but this is the firs

good indication that Boumedienne is making commor

cause with those who wish to turn Ben Bella out of

office.

a. According to press reports,

Viet Cong attacks on Sunday wiped

out two of the government's strategic

hamlets in the central highlands about

250 miles north of

Saigon.

b.

More than 1,000 inhabitants

in the hamlets--who are minority

tribesmen--are missing and possibly

have fled into the mountains.

They

abandoned a significant quantity of

weapons to the Viet Cong.

c. These attacks not only sug-

gest continued erosion of the govern-

ment's programs to win over tribal

support, but also signal that stepped-.

up Viet Cong pressure against the new

regime is spreading to the north.

USSR-Berlin

Embassy Bonn feels that

the Soviet Union may be seeking at

least a temporary modus vivendi on

the autobahn without prejudicing

its juridical position, which can

be used to cause difficulties there

in the future.

The embassy bases this on

the Soviet replies to the Western

notification to the USSR on 29

October regarding harmonized convoy

procedures--two oral statements on

16 November and a note

of 21 Novem-

ber.

C. The Soviet note was designed

to make a record, showing that the

USSR exercises "control" of the auto-

bahn and that the recent incidents

resulted from US refusal to comply

with

"existing procedures."

d. On the other hand, the Soviet

procedures described in the oral re-

plies seem to reflect actual Allied

practices, though there is enough

ambiguity to afford the USSR flexi-

bility in any future actions.

tinues to make its way to the south

Czech President and party

boss Novoty has gone to Moscow,

evidently for economic talks, judg-

ing by the composition of his dele-

gation.

b. Novotny's background of

Stalinist excesses have put him on

the wrong side of Khrushchev. They

also have given rise to control

problems, particularly in the frac-

tious Slovak party where pressures

for liberalization have made their

mark.

C.

Party problems and Novotny's

leadership may thus also come under

review.

d. A curious sign of the times

is the fact that, although president

Novotny is in Moscow, the presidential

flag has remained up

at the official

residence.

It might simply have been

an oversight, but the symbolism will

not be lost to the people in Prague.

We now have a fuller ac-

count from official US sources of

the Viet Cong attack on two mountain

villages mentioned in Tuesday's

Checklist.

b. This account makes it clear

that the earlier press versions,

which spoke of 1,000 missing vil-

lagers, were highly colored.

C .

Our present information

is that the attack, in company

strength, was successfully repulsed.

The Viet

Cong suffered some 30 cas-

ualties; government losses were six

killed, three wounded and 39 missing.

d. As is usual in these cases,

the villagers began to trickle back

once the Viet Cong left.

e. This episode aside, we see

• a number of indications that the

Communists will try to sustain the

higher level of military activity

they have kept up since the coup.

The Communist radio has

called for more attacks in an effort

to destroy strategic hamlets and

"develop" Viet Cong forces. In sup-

• port of this, Viet Cong communica-

has been unusually

heavy and has involved a large vol-

ume of high priority traffic and

special alert patterns.

CiB

The discovery of a large

cache of weapons of Cuban origin,

announced by Venezuelan authorities

yesterday, provides the best evidence

to date of major Cuban support for

Latin American subversives.

b. There is definite proof

to support the Venezuelan claim.

The three tons of weapons found in-

clude light automatic rifles and

submachine guns identified as among

those shipped to Cuba from Belgium

in 1959 and 1960. There were also

mortars, bazookas, recoilless rifles,

and ammunition of US manufacture.

Communist documents seized

by Venezuelan authorities earlier

this month reveal that the equipment

was destined for the Venezuelan

Communists' paramilitary arm, the

Armed Forces of National Liberation

(FALN) •

d. The cache was found on 1

November on a beach in Falcon State

in the north, scene of the most

active guerrilla effort.

The Vene-

zuelan government assumes that the

weapons were sent from Cuba by sea.

e..

Caracas will lay formal

charges concerning the arms cache

before a special meeting of Latin

America Foreign Ministers scheduled

for December.. After that it will

ask that the Council of the Organi-

zation of American States be con-

voked for consultation on the matter.

c. Papadakis is probably ask-

ing the same price for its action as

Basil Mavrolean did recently--removal

of its ships from the US blacklist.

Papadakis operates 19 ships totalling

more than 200,000 tons.

d. Mavrolean's vessels account

for almost half the present British

tonnage calling at Cuban ports and

are the largest single element of

free world shipping to Cuba.

e. The outcome of Mavrolean's

offer is not yet clear.

South Vietnam

Plans are now afoot to shuffle

South Vietnam's Corps commanders so that General

Khanh, considered by General Harkins to be the best

of the lot, will take over in the crucial delta (IV

Corps)

area.

General Dinh, the ambitious Minister

still resisting pressure to relin-

luish command of the III Corps area, and is not In-

volved in the current shuffle.

Cuba-USSR

There are about 8,000 Soviets in Cuba,

5, 000 of these military, according to a bloc offi

cial in close touch with Soviets in Havana.

The

figures are close to our own estimate of 4,000 to

7, 000.

Some withdrawals continue.
