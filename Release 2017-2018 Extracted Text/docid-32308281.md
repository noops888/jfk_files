SA WILLIAM MAYO DREW, JR.

During contact set out in enclosed LHM, DIAZ

LANZ furnished an eight-page leaflet captioned "Major

Diaz

And the Press".

This leaflet, a reprint of an "American

Opinion" article, sets out alleged

press distortions.of

testimony given by DIAZ LANZ before the Senate Internal

Security subcommittee in July, 1959, following his

defection from Cuba. He also

furnished a paperback copy

of "Its Very Simple", subcaptioned "The True Story of

Civil Rights".

This 1965 book by ALAN STANG seeks to

substantiate the author's charge that "the Civil Rights

Movement is for the most part a Communist operation under

the cloak of which the Communists hope to capture this

country", DIAZ LANZ also furnished a one page Spanish

language handout

warning Cuban exiles not to participate

in a "Replica"-sponsored street protest on behalf of

ORLANDO BOSCH and other arrested Cuban Power members.

The

handout asserted that this public activity, like Negro

street demonstrations in various cities, was initiated

by Communists in the hope of provoking violence between

marchers and civil authorities.

"PEDRO LUIS DIAZ LANZ".

DIAZ LANZ indicated that he has

ideas for more such handouts and owns a duplicating machine,

but lacks paper and does not presently have the funds to

purchase same.

The above-mentioned

paperback is a newsstand

item and has no significance in this matter. It is therefore

not being maintained.

page handout are being maintained in the 1-A section of

are dete montaine

The eight-page leaflet and one

the MM 105-1598 file.

DIAZ LANZ during contact set out in endosed

LEM, gave no indication that he is deranged or emotionally

unstable; however, as DIAZ LANZ has renewed his right

wing lectures and

has shown himself eager to participate
