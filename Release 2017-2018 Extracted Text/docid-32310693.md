the city of Santiago de Cuba is located in the eastern part

of the island of Cuba and 1s approximately 700 miles fron

Havana.

With reference to the possibility that gambling

in Cuba is controlled by a syndicate headed by MEYER LANSKY or

other individuals, it is noted that DINO CELLINI, who has

operated the gambling casino at the Tropicana for many years,

is also running the gambling casino at Oriental Park Race Track.

of the Cuban National Police that the license for operating

in the gambling casino at the Sans Souci had been issued by

the Cuban Government to OSCAR_H ECHEMENDARIA, who is an associate

and director of the Topicana Night club.

It appears likely,

therefore, that there is some sort of tie-in between at least

four of Havana's gambling casinos.

This matter is being followed,

and the Bureau will be kept advised.

31, 1956, that at the present time, two gangs control all

He said one of

these gangs which is headed by VITO GENOVESE controls the

Italian element in this area.

The informant stated VITO GENOVESE is one of the biggest

hoodlums in the United States, and

that only one man is

stronger than GENOVESE in the

United States, and that man 1:

FISCHETTI of Chicago, Illinois.

Je stated that because of the

vast power that GENOVESE presently holds in the United States, he

cannot adequately place too much control in one area.

Hence,

his control in the Garment Area of New York City is rather loose,

and the Jewish Gangs apparently at the present time, have a

stricter enforcement code to control this specific area.

On March 31, 1956, NY 1449-C advised that

MEYER LANSKY was in control of one of the two gangs

which controllea all criminal activities in the garment

cerns the shooting of SAPERSTEIN in Newark, New

their underworld protectors from coast-to-coast.. He

did business under the protection of one of the

Revenue Service cracked down.

Like FRANKIE COSTELLO,

when a high mogul of the mob gets hot, he loses prestige

in the underworld.

"With ZWILIMAN for the moment otherwise occupied,

the mob started after some of his friends in the labor

section of the underworld."

On July 6, 1956, NY 99-C furnished the following
