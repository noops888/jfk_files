SU"JECT:

Nelay in sending the first cable about

OSWALD

1.

Much has been written about the delay (by. the Mexico

Station) ins ending the first cable reques ting traces

on the

name Lee OSWALD.

It was discussed in Dave Phillips

book as

case of lazines on the part of the Soviet case officer (which

in my

view was

unjust and unnecess ary

and indicates that Dave

didn't know what he was talking about).

2. Normally,

the Spanish transcript for the 1 October

conversation would have been picked up on the morning of the

2nd of October.

The Russian

language portion would have gone

to the Russian/English transcriber on the 3rd of October.

The

translation would have

returned the follewing day

(4th )

at which time,

the Soviet case officer would have as ked for

the photographic coverage.

hat coverage would not have been

in the station before the

Ith since the n

was still in the

camera on the 3rd of October and itas picked up probably on

the 4th, processed and passed torerStation on the next work

day which

would have been

Manifectober.

Later the film

was taken out of the camera every day

but at that time,

the film stayed in the camera

until a full

roil was completed which might take three or four days.

A name trace could have been reques ted on the bas is

of the name alone

wasn't the way

Win Scott ran that

He wanted the photograph ic coverage tied in with the

teleph one coverage. sometimes there was a U.S. automobile

licens e number.

was also part of the "numbers

game" of

reperty ing a project by the number of dis patches, cables or

produced.

Mexico Station Coverage of Soviet and Cuban Embassies (1963)

1. Unilateral Coverage:

From the time the Mexico Station was opened in April 1947 until

the arrival of Mr. Win Scott as Chief of Station in 1955, the Station had

developed a support apparatus to exploit leads from the Soviet Embassy in

Mexico City. This umbrella type project (LIPSTICK)

Sisted of multiline

phone taps, three photographic sites, a mobis

Aveillance. team and a

mail intercept operation.

Telephone taps (LIFEA

telephone company who

of lines tapped wa

stited only by the availability of a listening post

nearby and the availability of langauge (English, Spanish, Soviet, Polish,

Czech, etc.) transcribers. Generally, these were Mexican or Mexican-

assisted by technicians on TDY from Headquarters who advised the Station

on the best types of cameras, films, and concealment devices. These

operations had sub-crypts under project LIPSTICK (namely: LIMITED, LILYRIC

and LICALLA). LIMITED was a fixed site directly opposite the Soviet Em-

bassy (across the street) which had both a vehicle and a pedestrian en-

trance. The gate

to the Soviet Embassy was on the northwest corner of the

• Soviet compound and the LIMITED site was diagonally across a double laned

street on the southeast corner of that block. (See attached diagram).

LIMITED was the first photo base and operated strictly on an experimental

basis in the early stages. This base, however, was closed when the Sta-

tion received word that the photograph of the "unidentified man" was

being released by the Warren Commission. LILYRIC was an alternate photo-

graphic base. It was located in an upper story of an apartment building

on the same side of the street as the LIMITED site bu

the middle of

the block south. It had a planted view of the

gate of the Soviet

Embassy. LICALLA, the third photograph

was located in one of a

row of four houses on the south

othe Soviet Embassy compound.

This site overlooked the

gerden of the Soviet Embassy compound. The

purpose of this operat

onawas to get good identification photographs of

Soviet personnel. The three photographic sites were managed by a re-

cruited agent who was a Mexican citizen, the son of an American mother

and Mexican father (deceased). This agent collected the film from the

LIMITED and LILYRIC sites three times a week. The film was then de-

veloped and printed into 8 x 10 contact print strips. LICALLA film was

originally processed in the Station but in early 1959, due to the resig-

nation of a technician, this film like that of LIMITED and LILYRIC was

processed

on the outside by a recruited agent.

Mobile surveillance was conducted by two American staff officers.

These two officers organized a surveillance team of six recruited agents

which used late model cars and a panel truck for surveillance. The team

could be activated by radio from the LIMITED site whenever someone of

interest left the gate of the Soviet Embassy. These agents were aware of

the LIMITED site since they had been issued LIMITED photographs for

identification purposes.

The Station also conducted a unilateral

was unreliable and insecure as characterized by

the nature of the Mexican

services at that time. The Mexican Direction

of Federal Security (DFS), with which we conducted liaison, was a hip-

pocket group run out of the Mexican Ministry of Government. This Ministry

was principally occupied with political investigations and control of

foreigners. Their agents were wish retrift, and corrupt.

A Station

officer trained a number of them in name tracing and travel control. In

1958, at the instigation of a Mexican official, a joint telephone tap

operation came into existence.

LIENVOY, was run by a Mexican officer. The listening post had 30 lines

connected at one time. The transcription room was staffed by Mexican

Army officers. In 1961, because of mismanagement by the Mexican prin-

cipals, the Station chief, himself, became the project case officer. A

Station officer assisted him in the daily supervision of the listening

post, and in picking up the

transcripts and the tapes.

There was also

an American technician inside the listening post.

3. Oswald Coverage:

In mid-1962, the Mexican officer in charge of LIENVOY (the

joint tap operation) asked

At the listening post, a live monitor made short summaries of

conversations of interest which were then included in a daily resume

for the Chief of Station. Later, when a reel was completely recorded,

full transcripts were typed and passed to the Station; however, there

was usually a time lag of a day or two. Reels which contained Russian

usually ran about a week behind the date of the conversation.

were conscientious. The Cuban Embassy coverage had more sophisticated

equipment using a pulse camera which frequently developed mechanical dif-

ficulties.

It was in an upper storey (3rd floor -check) on the sare side of the street

the Soviet Embassy conpourd. The purpose of this operation was to get good

identification photographs of the Soviet personnel (sho at thet time were largely

unidentified in Mexico Station records). The three photo sites were handled by

Remon Alvarez (Mexican citizen of U.S: mother who taught elerentary level at

the American School). Ramon collected the film gall

to accumulate, the inside CO. (l'ahoney) becane disgusted and took the film out

During 1958,

I Scott met socially some of the chronies of the

During this period, the U.S.

manipulated control over the principal agent of LIBIGHT mail intercept. The

These reels were taken to another location where

they

were translated

about a week ber su ino da feeling on atio bedaise or the volute of

Boris Tarasoff usually ran

Russian conversations amo

he-lembers of the Soviet Elbassy. During this

period (fall of 1963) the reels were probably being brought into the station

and carried to Boris by one of the people from the Soviet Section or they nay

have been carried to him by Flick but I think I brought the reel in and gave

it to Herbert Manell to take to Boris. Herbert lanell and his wife Barbara

handled all of the processi g of Soviet transcripts. Hy job involved

screening

the photographs as soon as we learned that the man calling hinself. Oswald was

probably an Anerican. However, here again there was a backlag because the

photos were picked up three tines a week but the ones picked up were usually

for dates a few days previously because the doctor processed the film on a

night time basis. Photographs were made usually until one roll vas used but

later ve got it changed to one day coverage on each roll - in other vords the

The Cuban

embassy coverage had more sophisticated equipment (a pulse ca-era) but it

frequently develored nechanical difficulties. Bob Zambarnerdi and

(I think) handled this film - pick.up and delivery. Lorne lackay screered

the film inside the station.

I am certain that the Oswald call came to our attention from the

Soviet line. It was picked u; and taken to Boris for a translation because

the caller was trying to speak Russian. Any delay was caused by waiting to

compare the photographs with the typed transcript. There were no copies of

27 September 1963, Soviet Embassy Chancery 15-61-55

Item 295, page 3

At 1626 hours, A Soviet calls from the Soviet Embassy Chancery

to the Cuban Consulate and asks for Sylvia DURAN.

DURAN if the american has been there.

the letters that he showed them from the (Soviet)

in Washington, he wants to go to the USSR to stay

a long time with his wife who is Russian, but also the

answer had not been received (by him) regarding his problem.

that accordingly these transactions take 4 or 5 months bui

without prior approval from the USSR, they have to request

and even then, they could not issue the visa here (in Mexico

City) without asking Washington.

Yet accordingly

(the American) ,

i showed him a letter in which he (the man

American) is a member of an organization in favor of Cuba

and said that the Cubans could not give him the visa without

when him, because he has the a for the ansker what to do

with him, because he has to wait

Washington.

also, becaise

the problem with him (the American)

is that he doesn

ere anyone in Cuba and in that case it

is very diffia

It to give him a visa, because he was

thinking of p

cessing his visa, because he knew it was

going to take glong time waiting for the Russian visa

cuba, and then go on to the UssR.

..that the thing is that if his (the American) wife were

now in Washington (and) going to receive the visa right now

or the permission from the USSR to return to her country, (1f)

she is going

to receive her visa in Washington, then having

this visa, she can communicate to whatever place, this

permission,

for example, here or in any other place (he) can

receive it,

but right now they do not have them.

and neither can (the Cubans) give him a letter

because they do not know if the visa will be approved.

They can only give the visa according to instructions.

Then that is what she will put on his application.

can I give him any letter of recommendation because

I don't know him and

pardon me for bothering you.

DURAN: It was no bother, thank you very much.

27 September 1963, Sovict Embassy Consulate 15-60-55

Item 74, page 2

An unidentified man (speaking Spanish) calls the Soviet Embassy

Consulate at 1037 hours and asks

for the Consul. He is told that

the Consul is not there.

The unidentified man asked what is needed

to get visas to go to Odessa. He is told to call back at 1130 hours.

Item 137, page 2

At 1235 hours a man named ALATRISTE (not a Soviet) from inside the

Soviet Embassy Consulate calls out to number 45-37-72 (Colonial

America, probably a pension or hotel but number not listed in the

telephone directory) and speaks with a man named SAN ROMAN.

ALATRISTE says that he is

in the Russian Embassy and they need to

know what day the boat "KALONIA" will arrive in Odessa, that the

Soviets will also need copies of the passenger manifest..

(One concludes that ALATRISTE and SAN ROMAN are shipping representatives

for the boat "KALONIA", and needed routine visa information, First

a call was made to the first listing for the Soviet Embassy in the

Mexican telephone directory (which turned out-to be the Military Attache) •

They got the phone number for the Consulate and the address.

making a call to the Consulate and learning that it would not be open

until 1130 hours, ALATRISTE went. daythes address to get the needed

information.)

• Item 395, pages 7 and 8

Just after 1600 hours,

REPRODU

the Soviet Consulate received a call from the

Cuban Consulate (Sylvia DURAN) who said she had

there a U.S. citizen

who had requested a transit visa to Cuba because he

is going to the

USSR. DURAN wants to know with whom he spoke at the Soviet Embassy

because she sent him over to them telling him that if the Soviets

approved

the visa then the Cubans would

give him one without anything

more, advising the (Department of) Immigration in Cuba. She wants

to know with whom he spoke because he says that he doesn't know

either with what person and who told him that certainly there would

be no problem.

The Soviet asks DURAN to wait a minute.

After a

short wait DURAN explains the same thing to another Soviet.

This

Soviet tells her to leave her telephone (number) and her name and

someone will return the call.

DURAN gives her nane and telephone

number 11-28-47 then says as a personal thing,

she has moved

and

has not advised them of a change of address

so will not receive their

Bulletin and can give it to them now.

The Soviet asks her to call

KOUKHARENKO in order to change that address and

asks

for the name

of the (Cuban) Cultural Attache. DURAN says it is Teresa PROENZA

whose number is 14-13-26.

The Soviet thanks her.

ACTION REQUIRED • REFERENCES

Action Required: Please advise re negatives

In view of recent reopening of the publicity regarding

Lee Harvey OSWALD and WOFACT evidence, Headquarters would

like to determine whether the Station still has on hand

the negatives from which the prints available at Headquarters

were made of the unidentified "mystery man" coming out of

both the Soviet and Cuban Embassies.

If they are still

on file, it is requested that they remain so, and that they

be forwarded Headquarters for retention rather than

destroyed if the latter action is ever contemplated.

This refers to your letter of February 12, 1964

addressed to the Director of Central Intelligence which has

been passed to me for reply.

Paragraph three of your letter requested the Agency

to supply the Commission with a report on information in the

Agency's possession regarding Lee Harvey OSWALD prior to

November 22, 1963. The request was predicated upon the

footnote on page two of CIA's report to the Commission dated

31 January 1964, entitled: "Information Developed by CIA on

the Activity of Lee Harvey OSWALD in Mexico City, 28 Sep-

tember • 3 October 1963"

3.

There is attached an exact reproduction of the

Agency's official dossier on Lee Harvey OSWALD beginning

with the opening sheet dated 9 December 1960. The entire

dossier carries the security classification of Secret and

consists of thirty documents arranged in chronological order.

On the basis of clearances from the Federal Bureau of

Investigation, the Department of State, the Department of

Navy, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, who

were queried by us after the receipt of your letter, we are

able to make available exact copies of all materials in the

THE DIRECTOR OF INTELLIGENCE AND RESEARCH

SECRET

OCT 25 1960

Dear Dick:

Our efforts to answer recent informal inquiries, including some

from the White House

Staff, have revealed that,

though CIA and the

FET have detailed records concerning Americans who have been recruited

as Intelligence agents by Bloc

countries,

there does not appear to be

a complete listing of those Americans now living in Bloc countries

who might be called "defectors".

Using the definitions of DODD 4/2,

these persons might be described as those who have either been

capable of providing useful intelligence to the Bloc or those whose

desire to resettle in Bloc countries has been significantly exploited

for communist propaganda purposes.

This would mean that no attention

need be paid to Americans whose resettlement within the Bloc had no

counter-intelligence implications or had attracted no particular

attention; for instance, this definition would not cover individual

US citizens of East European or Chinese origin who retured to the

"homeland" because they had never been completely assimilated into

the American society®

There is attached a list of such persons, covering the last 18

months,

and it would be appreciated if the Agency could verify and

possibly expand this list for the use of interested Bureaus of, the

Department.

Sincerely yours,

Hugh S. Cumming, Jr.

The wife is being interrogated. I don't know if that took place yesterd

or is still going on. You are getting a teletype answer on that. I am

just giving you a preview.

Wot"

With regard to that, Nicaraguan's, allegations that the man was in the

Cuban Embassy on 18 September, I understand we do have information that

he applied for a tourist card about the 15th of Segtember. There 1s a

record showing entry into Mexico on September 26. On about the 15th be

applied In New Orleans for a tourist cafd.

We do know he was in -

I may even have some later infgation which came i during the rigat -

As you know, he was in ten anean.

sir, 'real: He left there tide, suns day.

P

; He was seen on the

age the landlady said be slipped during the night.

He was last seen by the landlady

then.

Now we have immigration records showing him

entering Mexico on the 26th which very strongly suggests that be was not in Mexico

on the l8th. What we are trying to find out is where he was every single day

the 25th, 24th, and all the way back.

I think the Nicaraguan story is fabricated
