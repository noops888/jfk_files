AR

On 6/15/61 PO 612-C advised SA THOMAS Q. FORSYTH, III:

The area of Monroeville, Pa., along U. S. Route 22, is now

commonly referred to by gamblers from New Kensington, Pa.,

and from other sections of Western Pennsylvania as "The Strip."

The reason for this is that much of the highway commerce is mare

up of nightclubs and cocktail lounges, usually operated in

connection with a motel these places have become hangouts and

ostensibly casual meeting places for racket figures, large and

small, and the MANNARINO underling and associates are frequenting

these

estabilanments more and nore, GAERIEL hANNARIND showd winetend

or twice a week, and SAM MANNARINO appears less frequently.

among the places visited are the Holiday House, the Town House and

the

Phoenix Motel.

BOTH SUBJECTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ARMED AND DANGEROUS.
