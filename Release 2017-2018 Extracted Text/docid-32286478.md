It is noted that both STALLARD and BENNER opined

that the telephone at Nubes No. 2 would still be the telephone

originally issued in the name of ALBERT ANDREAS years ago,

number 2-28-65.

This is the usual local custom.

The installa-

tion of a telephone requires a purchase of a substantial.

block of stock in the telephone company, and a person buying

property normally buys the stock in the

telephone alread

insta_led.

that «elephone number 2-28-65 is now issued to DANIEL DIAZ

address Lazaro Cardenas 21-A, Cuernavaca. DIAZ has had this

telephone for about a year.

He believed the telephone at Nubes No. 2 is now

2-01-02, and was attempting to check long-distance calls

for this number. (Fu)

He personally identified photographs of Subject as

a person he often observed in Cuernavaca at the Hosteria Las

Quintas and at the Cafeteria Universal in the central plaza

of Cuernavaca. However, he advised he had not seen this

individual in several months. He was

seen him if he were in Cuernavaca.

he recalled seeing this individual in a white

Oldsmobile convertible.fl)

It is considered that he may be over-imaginative

in this point, since the description of the Oldsmobile in

Mexico received some publicity,.

whereas circumstances

indicate that Subject actually

most recently had been using

a Mercedes in Mexico. & (4)
