request) has requested that the FBI identify all information in FBI

the documents may be opened to the public as established by. the JFK

In accordance with the ARRB letter, the FBI must identify

which jurisdictions/judges placed these records under court seal.

In the case of electronic surveillance, the ARRB also seeks the

location and the duration of
