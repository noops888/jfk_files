Informant said that while he could not

say SYCHEV is an employee of Department D, he feels

that the operation which SYCHEN described to him,

as set out above, was originated or approved by Depart-

ment D of KGB.

Informant's Comments Concerning

Colonel (FNU) SITNIKOV and a

New

"Active Action" Department in

the central Committee of the CP (CCCP)

of the Soviet Union

(5)

in connection with the "WOLF #3" operation,

Informant recalled that on the preceding day;

11/25/65,

he had on one occasion visited the "PR"

room

• in the KGB

space at the soviet Mission.

Informant said

that when he

walked In YURIY GERMASH, VSEVOLOD GAPON, and IVAN BELOV

were engaged in conversation.

Informant said that as

he joined

them

these three individuals began to speak

about a Colonel (FNU) SITNIKOV, who used to be a deputy

to the chief of the former 16th Department, First Main

Directorate, KGB.

Informant said that as he has told us

In the past, this department is now known as Service

Number 1 (Information Department). Informant added that

at the present time Colonel SKRYABIN is Chief of Service

Number 1.

Informant said that YURIY GERMASH mentioned

the fact that for the past eight months, Colonel SITNIKOV

nas not been working in KGB Headquarters proper, but has

in fact become the chief of a new department which has

been created in the CCCP of the Soviet

department is known as "Active Action. „Undon, which new

Informant said

he personally asked GERMASH to describe to him the

functions of Active Action, Inasmuch as he did not

understand its nature. GERMASH replied that when KGB

now wishes to carry sh

, an unusual or complicated action,

such as the (WOLF #3" Operation, it is necessary for KGI

to secure the authority of the cccP.

GERMASH said that

It can readily be seen that most of the members of

the CCCP are not knowledgeable in intelligence matters.

He said at the present time when a plan for an unusual

or complicated intelligence operation has been formulated

and approved in KGB, 1t is sent directly to Colonel

SITNIKOV who studies it and becomes thoroughly familiar

with the operation. GERMASH said that after SITNIKOV

has done this, he, as Chief of Active Action, takes the

plan to the appropriate person or persons in

the CCCP

for approval. GERMASH said that on many occasions 1t

is necessary for SITNIKOV to go directly to LEONID

BREZHNEV, (First secretary and member of the presidium, CP, SU).

GERMASH told the informant that at the

present time there are seven or eight employees in the

Active Action Department.

GERNASH also said that

SITNIKOV was chosen for this position inasmuch as

he is noted for his

"brillant memory" and his reputation

as a "thinking man."

Informant said that this'

was the first time

that he had ever heard of the Active Action Department of

the CCCP.

He said that although he has never seen the

Colonel SITNIKOV, referred to by GERMASH, IVAN BELOV

claims to be personally acquainted with him.

Informant

said BELOV told him, in addition,

SIt, personally, the test dot insole ement

that informant had received from his agent ([XTRA." (6)

Informant said he feels that because SINIKOV is an old

and experienced KGB employee, YURI NOSENKO undoubtedly

must know him.
