This reviews an article concerning the assassination of

President Kennedy in the March, 1964, issue of "Saga" magazine by

former Special Agent William W. Turner (E.O.D. 2-5-51 - Dismissed

7-19-61 > who is presently appealing his dismissal before the Circuit:

Court in the District.

Turner's seif-centered, embittered, illogical

attitude is well known to us and his article is what we might expect

fron him.

unless sterest masked.

Mion Indefinate

should be laid to FBI bungling by way of not prewarning the Secret Service

of Oswald's potential as an assassin and that the cause of this was a

lack of cooperation and communication between the Bureau and the

Secret Service. In the lead paragraph of the article, Turner claims

that he went to Dallas "just a few hours" after the assassination to

conduct a personal FBI-type inquiry as he sensed that "there were too

many questions unanswered, too much information concealed."

This is

patently crystal-ball nonsense and at the outset shows his true

motivation.

In light of his stated conviction that Oswald was indeed

the assassin and that he acted on his own without left wing, right

FILED

or crime syndicate plotting, the article is particularly vicious in its

suggestion that someone other than Oswald is basically to be blamed for

the deed.

Turner's case is pure sophistry the inaccuracies: of/which

lare hereinafter reviewed point by point.

His argument consistsof part

fact, largely inaccurate and irresponsible newspaper reports: and

outright falsehoods.

He endeavors to lend credence to his argument

by trading on his past experience as a Bureau Agent and it is in this

realn that he clearly lies in discussing Bureau investigative techniques

in this case.

He concludes his article with a four-point appeal to

effect that 1. Presidential appearances henceforth not be in open cars

and that the President be required to wear a bullet-proof vest when

appearing in public.:2.

That an attempt on the President's life be

made a Federal offense.

3.

That President's route in and out of city

not be publicized

and

4.

That a permanent Federal Connission be

established to insure proper cooperation and communication between

agencies' such as Bureau and Secret Service and that

the Commission

Memorandum to Mr. Sullivan

Re: LEE HARVEY OSWALD

105-82555

Statement: Oswald prudently transferred his political activities to

New Orleans (date not indicated) as Dallas is a city that

leans to the right and because of local Dallas police

vigilance against communist-type activity.

Fact: Oswald left Dallas and traveled to New Orleans in late April,

1963, as he was out of work and at the urging of his wife due to

his having attempted to assassinate General Walker on April 10,

1963. The inference that Oswald feared Dallas police vigilance

is nonsense for be returned to the Dallas area five months later

to live.

Statement:

It is FBI responsibility to make dissemination to

Secret Service but there is historical evidence that proper

dissemination is not always made at the Washington level.

In support he cites; that in 1945 the Royal Canadian

Mounted Police (RCMP) told the Bureau about Klaus Fuchs

who they suspected was a Soviet agent, however, the FBI

took no action.

He also cites: that in 1960 the FBI

collected damaging information about Bernon F. Mitchell

and William H. Martin, National Security Agency (NSA)

employees, and again failed to alert anyone after which

Mitchell and Martin fled to Cuba thence to Russia where

they compromised U.S. secret codes throughout the world.

Fact

The name of Fuchs and his British address came to attention of

RCMP after arrest of Israel Halperin in February, 1946, as a

result of the disclosures of Igor Gouzenko, Soviet Code Clerk

who defected in Canada in 1945.

Halperin, a Canadian, was
