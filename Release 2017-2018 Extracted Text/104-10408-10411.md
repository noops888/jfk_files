assistance to OSWALD in his attempts to obtain a Cuban

Information regarding

DURAN appears in the Warren

Report,

however,

attributed to the Agency.

The Government of Mexico (GOM) did arrest and interrogate

DURAN re her connection with OSWALD, and a copy of the

GOM deposition appears in the Report.

The deposition was

turned over. to the Commission by the GOM via State Department.

Since knowledge of DURAN's contact with OSWALD originally

came to both the GOM's and Agency's attention Gia the

all mention of Agency knowledge or

participation in DURAN's

arrest and subsequent interrogation

has been marked for non-release.

b. Photo of unidentified man taken in front of

the Soviet Embassy in Mexico.

This ploto was taken

by

Station Mexico photo surveillance of the Soviet Embassy

during the month of October 1903.

When news cf the

zarrest of OSWALD as Kennedy's assassin became known,

the Station immediately forwarded copies of the photo

to the FBI in the mistaken assumption that the photo

was

of OSWALD taken while he was in Mexico

It was. later determined that

the photo was not

of OSWALD

and in

fact had been taken after he

had departed Mexico.

the

photo had been taken.

The photo became somewhat of an

issue when the Warren Commission decided it belouged

in the Report as part of the exhibits since it had been

shown to the OSWALDs.

The Agency finally allowed the

picture to appear in

the agreement that no

mention would be made about where it had been

As far as can be determined, the Agency has never

admitted publicly that the photo was taken

Commission later

Gilberto ALVARADO Ugarte.

ALVARADO, a

Nicaraguan citizen, walked in to the U.S. Embassy in

claiming to have knowledge 're Kennedy's assasination.

Mexico learned that ALVARADO was an agent for the Nicaraguan

Intelligence service (als), however his story re the

assassination was separate

from his work for the NIS.'.After

lengthy interrogation, including a polygraph, it was

determined that ALVARADO. had been fabricating a story claiming

he had seen OSWALD receive money from a Cuban official at

the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

The ALVARADO story appears

in the Warren Report but it

does not reveal his identity.
