Samuel Lewis Riddle, Jr, representing the Black

Liberation Front, International (BLFI), a MSU student

He said blacks were victims

of systematic racist repression

The rally was sponsored bythe Detroit. Chapter of the

The rally commenced at approximately 3:45 p.m.

and terminated at 8:30 p.n., February 15, 1910. pproximatels

300 persons were in attendance.

source two stated that person:

who did not have advance tickets were charged $2.50 at the

On pril 29, 1970, source three made available

a speech made by robert Williams which was given on february

15, 1970, at a rally in honor of Huéy I. Newion sponsored

by the NCCr, at the shrine of the Black ladonna church,

7625 Linwood ivenue, Detroit, Michigan.

The speech by Robert Williams in its entirety

is set forth herein:

"Good evening, I'm very happy to meet with you

tonight.

However, I'm sorry we have to meet at a time of

crises,

because this is a time of crises, this we must

recognize as a people, also I consider a great honor to be

here tonight in the spirit of our brother luey i. lewton.

Brother Lewton it is symbolic of the black man's orueal in

• White America. It is symbolic of what is happening to our

race. It is symbolic of what we have known as a people.

We have been a captive people for 400 years in this citadel

of hatred and of racism and brother Newton's plighi is a

part of this.

It is symbolic of this it is symbolic of

what is happening to a lot of us.

The

tragedy is

that some

of us do not yet understand what this is all about and what

is taking place. some of us have been led to believe that

it is a question of crime and of punishment and of bad

people,

but-the only crine that people like brother lewton

is guilty is that of being what the white man likes to call

an uppity Nigger.

I too an considered to be an uppity

Nigger and I'm called a criminal when

I'm not a criminal,

but I plead guilty to the fact that I'm a crouble maker.

yes, I make trouble for racism, i male trouble for oppression,

I make trouble for tyranny, and I make trouble in behalf

"Also in rememberance of what has happened to

orother Huey, we also must remember that this is nothing

the 50's,

I think it was

about 1950 or 1951, and there was an liter leader name

Harry I. Moore and Harry I. Moore has fought for the advance-

• ment of black people. He was a teacher, his wife was a

teacher and all Harry I. lioore did was to ask the white power

structure to give the black teachers equal pay with whites.

And do you know what they did to harry i. koore?

Do you

know what they did to his wife? They placed a bomb under

hid bed and they blew him up, they blew his wife up, they

destroyed his home, they destroyed his life, and they

thought they had destroyed his dignity as a man, but they

they made a mistake; I still remember Harry i.

Moore and

at that time I was a student and we coulân't

forget ana today

there are others like Harry I. •oore.

There were only a few at that time, out they had toiu

that they were going to kill him,

told him thet they

were going to destroy him and his family, but he wouldn't

stop pushing for black rights,

the rights for black paople,

now nobody has ever been punished for the muruer of those

two people, they went scott free.

The officials claimed

that they couldn't find the killers and that's the part of

our history in merica, that is the part of our tracition,

that is a part of our oppression, and this is what people

like fuey i. Newton are trying to correct and this is why

Panthers have been killed all across the land and some of

us have allowed black extremists who must be wiped out,

some of our people tremble when they even hear about our

self defense and they say 'well these people ara only getting

Dia Harry T. loore get what he aske

a long list, ledgar ivers, did he get what he asked for?

What happened to the people ho murdered him?

ind also remember what

and that he destroyed their food so they couldn't exist

then he went into lexico and rode heard over the lexicans

and he stripped them of their land, he raped them, and he

robbed them and here is a man who brought hundreas of

thousands of black people from frica in cages and in chains

had this whole plane to ourselves and nobody but the frew

worked the plane and worked for us and I don't know how

much money Iwi spent on the flight, but I know it cost

more than the ticket that I had paid for. Anyway not only

that, but they sent the Vice President, who was a black man,

to meet me and to fly back with me on the plane and they

didn't tell that in the press either that the Vice resident,

I suppose he was about loth or 17th or 20th Vice President,

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

According to its official newspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can

take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the

black comnunity.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE,

BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEHTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years

on a conviction of manslaughter in connection with the

killing of an Oakland Police Officer.

The official newspapes, "The Black Panther",

which further describes itself as the "Black Community News

Service", states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to ena

oppression of the black people.

Residents of the black

conmunity are liged to arm themselves against the polica who

are consistently referred to in the publication as

• "pigs"

who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,

contains an editorial by BPP Minister Of Education

GEORGE

MASON MURRAY, which ends with the following:

"Black men. Blach people, colored persons of

America, revolt everyvhere!

Arm yourselves. The only cul-

ture worth keeping is a revolutionary culture. Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite!. Black Polier.

Use the gun.

kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "

...we will

not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it."•

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Ise-Tung of the

People's Republic of China and feature MO's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, 1969, that the Republic

of New Africa (RNA). is an all-Negro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.. ROBERT F. WILLIAMS,

Who was then residing in Peking, China, was named"as its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the United States in

1961 following the issuance of a local warrant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping growing out of a racial

incident, WILLIAMS published and broadcast hate-type

material

in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is to establish an independent black nation within

the United States, demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Casolina in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as payment for 400 years of

ancestral slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RNA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom

and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established.

Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order

to avoid detection by the police.

According to this source, Black Legion members

acting as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969, were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policeman and the critical wounding of another.

of the Na

which is as organizing bureau of the Black

muracred by the Detroit pig and fire depart-

ment.

On the night of March 8, 1970 there was

a fire àt 3165 Third Avenue. As the firemen

were putting. out the fire. They "claim that

they here fired upon to stop then iron deal

ing with the fire. It is at this point that.

they were to have traced the fun fire to the

adaress of 3215 Fourth Strect in the Jettcries

projects: in nich at this tire tho pigs out

of 50 who had surrounded the house, came up to

the entrance of the apartment and without any

warning fired into the apartment. After they

fired into the home of these brothers. The

rest that had

surrounded the house began

shooting into it relenticachy. The reapons

used on the brothers were tony guns, roit

puny shotguns and

other weapons of war.

People of the community these brothers did not

is just a lie, ained at justifing what they

have aïtempteà to do, murder these brothers,

Gino Siay, Solomon Walliams, Juan Paschell,

Micheal Farier, were attacked by these mad

rascist dog pigs.

It is rat those inoughts, that they protected

of the gui. lore pigs were rushed into lie

community and were aided by bootlicking niggers.

The Jones family allored these pigs to shoot up

out conmunity, by letzing then shoot fron their

Hindors and

doors.

The pigs then began to

shoot hundreds of rounds of tesr-gas in the

brothers home and in our community. At &:35p-t.

the people's warriors stood between the fascist

pigs and the Black Community with honoräble

dignity of warriors standing as one with the

poople. The pigs then began to brutally beat

all of the brothers up and down the projecie.

They were bealen so badly that they are still

APPENDIX

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (BPP)

According to its officiat newspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can

take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the

black.comnunity. It.was organizod by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE,

BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEVION, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years

on a conviction of manslaughter in connection with the

killing of an Oakland Police Officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther",

which further describes itself as the "Black Community Nevs

Service", states that the BUP advocates the use of guns

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end

oppression of the black people.

Residents of the black

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, 1969, that the Republic

of New Africa (RNA) is an all-Negro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.

ROBERT E. WILLIAMS,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was namedras its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the Unided States in

1961 following the issuance of a local warrant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping growing out of a racial

incident, WILLIAMS published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

•A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is to establish an independent black nation within

the United States, demanding the States of Alabana, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as

payment for 400 years of

ancestral slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that

army of the RNA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established.

Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order

to avoid detection by the police.

According to this source, Black Legion members

acting. as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969; were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policenan and the critical wounding.of another.

STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC SOCTETY

À SOnice has

advised that the Students for a

Democratic Society (SDS), as presently regarded, came into

being at a

Sounding convention hold June, 1962, aù lost

Huron, Michigan.

Exon an initial posture of "participatory

democracy" the

line of the national leadeiship her revealed

a growing Marxist-Ioninist adherence which currently calls

for the building of a revolutionary youth movement.

Concusrently, the program of SDS has evolved from civil

rights struggles to an anti-Vietnam war stance to an advocacy

of a militani anti-imperialist position. China, Vietnam

and Cuba are regarded as the leaders of vorldride struggles

against United

States imperialism whereas the Soviei Union

is held to be revisionist and also imperialisi.

At the june, 1969, SDS National Convention,

• Progressive Labor Party (PiP) forcos in the organization were

expelled.

As a resuli, the National Office (NO) group

moved to Boston.

Each group elocted its own national osficer,

which include three national secrotaries and a National

Interin Committee of eighi.

desired, is not possible under prescht conditions, hencc

emphasizes organizing and raising the political consciousness

of the working class

upon whom they feel successful revolution

depenäs. Although disclaiming control ana comination by rie

Communist Party, USA, leaders in these two factions have in

the past proclaimed themselves to be communists and to

follow the precepts of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy, along

pro-Chinese communist lines.

A second source has advised that the PLP •faction

which is more commonly known as the Worker Stuäent Alliance

is dominatca and controlled by members oi the PLP, who are

required to identify themselves with the pro-Chinese Marxist-

Leninist philosophy of the PLP.

between workers and students is vital to the bringing about

of a revolution in the United States.

SDS regions and university and college chapters,

although operating under the

outlines of the SDS National

Constitution, are autonomous in nature and free. to carry out

independent policy reflective of local conditions. Because

of this autonomy internal struggles reflecting the major

factional interests of SDS have occurred at the chapter level

since the beginning of the 1969-70 school year.

A characterization of the PIP is attached. :

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, 1969, that the Republic

of New Africa (RNA) is an all-veyro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.

ROBERT F. WILLIAMS,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was named as its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the United States in

1961 following the issuance of a local warrant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping growing out of a racial

incident,

WILLIANS published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is to establish an independent black nation within

the United States, demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as payment for 400 years of

ancestral slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RNA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established. Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black legion in

order

to avoid detection by the police.

According to this source, Black Legion members

acting as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969, were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policeman and the critical wounding of another.

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, 1969, that the Repubiis

of New Africa (RNA) is

an all-Negro.organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.

ROBERT F. WILLIAMS,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was named as its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the

United States in

1961 following the issuance of a local warrant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping growing out of a racial

Incident, williams published and proadcast nate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969.

A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is to establish an independent black nation within

the United States,

demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as payment for 400 years of

ancestral slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RNA,

known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom

and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established. Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order to avoid detection by the police.

According to this source, Black Legion members

acting as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969, were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policeman and the critical wounding of another.

also known as

Black Panther Party For S

Defense

According

the official newspaper of the BPP, the BPP

was started during December, 1966, in Oakland, California, to

organize black people so they can

take control of the life,

politics, and the destiny of the black community. It was

organized by BOBBY G. SEALE, BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON,

Minister of Defense,

BPP.

The official newspaper, called "The Black Panther,"

regularly states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end oppression.

of the black people.

Residents of the black community are

urged to arm themselves against the police who are consistently.

referred io as "pigs" who should be killed.

The newspaper, in its issue of September 7, 1968, had an

article by the

then

1 Minister of Education, GEORGE MURRAY.

This article ended with the following:

"Black men.

Black people, colored persons of America,

revolt everywhere!

Arn yourselves. The only culture

worth keeping is revolutionary cuiture.

Change.

Freedom everywhere.

Dynamite! Black power.

Use

the gun. Kill the pigs everywhere."

The BPP newspaper, issue of October 5, 1968, had an

article introduced with the following statement:

"We will

not dissent from American government. We will overthrow it."

DAVID HILLIARD, Chief of Staff, BPP, in a speech at the

San Exancisco Polo Field on November 15, 1969, said "We will

kill Richard Nixon."

DAVID HILLIARD, in the "New York Times,"

issue of

December 13, 1969, was quoted as follows:

"We

advocate the

very direct

overthrow of the government by way of force

and violence."

In the issue of April 25, 1970,. the BPP newspaper had

an article by Minister of Culture ElIORY DOUGLAS as follows:

. "The only way to make this racist US government administer

justice to the people it is oppressing, is...by taking

up arms against this government, killing the officials,

until the reactionary forces...are dead and those that

are left turn their weapons on their superiors, thereby

passing revolutionary judgement against the number one

enemy of all mankind, the racist US government."

The BPP Headquarters is located at 1046 Peralta Street,

Oakland, California. Branches of the BPP, and Committees to

Combat Fascism, under control of the BIE, have been estaolished

in various locations in the USA.:

The Association of Black Students, Oakland

University, Rochester, Michigan, sponsored

a rally in

support of

the Detroit 16 on November 16, 1970, featuring

HUEY P. NEWTON.

BUCY P. NEWTON is the Minister of

Dafense, BEP.

The main theme of the speech given by Huhy P.

NENTON on November 16, 1970, at Oakland University, was that

all poor blacks and poor whites, the working classes, the

opprassed of the world, must üll join forces as a united

body against the "ruling circle" in the United States.

NEWION repeacedly referred to this "ruling circle" through

out his entire speech and apparently interpreted this "ruling

circle" as those leaders of Goverment and industry, the

imperislists or those who are rich in this society.

NEWTON

wanted equality for everyone with no one being superior to

his fellow man.

He indicated the Negro is a class brother

with the poor

whites and they must join in their effort to

overcome the "ruling circle."

NENTON stated,

"The Black Panther Party is the

vanguara of the revolution on a world-wide level because the

world is really one community and we've taken Marxist-Leninist

to a greater level and, therefore, we are the greatest

Marxist-Leninists that ever lived,

and we say this not to

be arrogant because some times I wish that someone else

would carry that banner because the way is narrow and the

burden is heavy."

In conclusion, the speech By NEWTON was

a rambling,

many times incoherent Marxist-Leninist influenced, low-key

revolutionary type speech which attempted to show a connection

between the BPP and the League of Revolutionary Black Workers

(IREN, as well as a unity between the BEP and all oppressed

persons of the world.

A characterization of the IRB is contained

in the appendix pages attached hereto.

His speech called for the release of the Detroit 16,

freedom for ANCELA DAVIS, BOBBY SaALE, and all the oppressed

brothers and for the ultimate overthrow of the pigs.

The speech appeared to be rather poorly organized

cid NEVITON was easily diverted from the main topics which

is sached to be pursuing. The speech had very few references

to any actual radical action or violent confrontation.

The Black Student Union, University of Michigan,

Ann Arbor, Michigan, sponsored a rally in support of the

Detroit 16 on November 17, 1970, featuring HUEY NEWION.

NERTON stated that the working class will be the

ones to carry out the "revolution" and carry the "revolution

banner" and will most likely initiate the creation of the

new order.

Throughout his speech, NEWTON talked about the

new order which will occur when the world is caken over by

Connunism.

Throughout the speech, NEWTON reIers to capitalism

scating that while it has caused many problems, it has also

laid the foundation for Communism. He stated that the

weälthy are the ruling circle

and named ROCKEFELLER and FORD -

as being in this circle. NOVION stated that they offerred

troops to the Vietnamese people, however, did not get a

definite answer on their proposal.

females, who were charged 25 cents. Those persons attending

the speech were advised that they were not allowed to leave,

applaud, or stand during the speech, and that anyone leaving

could not return.

NEWTON arrived at approximately 11:30 a.M..

and spolie on Marnist-leninist theories placing particular

emphasis on the Russian Revolution and its relationship to

the BPP.

The body of the speech was concludca at 1:45 p.m.

At approximately 1:00 pollo, most of the audience had left

because they were unable to understand NEWTON and were

getting fed up with the treatment they were receiving. After

that Flint was overdue in the killing of police officers and

also commented that if you owned a gun, there would never

be an excuse for being arrested for carrying a concealed

The Blacks

Panthers?

T'nc 10 point program of the Black Panthers Party begins "We want our freedon.

"i. ¿ power to daterine the destiny of our blaci: coumunity."

The Black

's: in flerich were brought here iron their native land us slaves, and ever

:i.? Chey have been kept on the lorest level of American society.

They are

a community of people with their on history, cononic life, and cultuic.

Yet

thoris never had political pover over their own conmunity.

The Black Panther

orned to fight for this political pover.

But the founders of the Black Panther Party, led by Huey P. Nerion, Mich

wit they had to have more than their goals.

They had to understand how they

were doing to achiove them.

huey's ansver was "Serve the People" and "Pick up

the gun. "

The Black Fanthers rcalized that the people can be libcrated only

by heir on efforts, and that the Panthers had to reach out to their comunity,

lius out, its needs, and respond to ther.

And they realized that "political porter

vows out of the barrel of a gun," that the people in the black community were

being moved dows by the police and had to defend thenselves, and that positical.

power over their community would never leave the hands of the rich and enter their

min hanas unless they combatted the police--the amy of the rich.

uey first put his understanding of servirg the people and picking up the

gun into practice yes he and bobby Seale went out one night with a harmer

and a shot gun to put up a stop sign that

was badly needed by the community.

Dulhy stood guard with ine shot gun while Huey hammerca in the sign. Later,

the Panther's started many health clinics, breakfast for children prograns, and

other conmunity services.

Because of what the Panthers want for their people, because they are going

-about getting it, and because the comunity is beginning to look towards them for

leadership, their eneu; is scared. So scarea that they have started a nation

wide cempaign to destroy the Panthere.

Freù Hampton was murdered in Chicago

he slept, bobby nution was murdered in Carland, Calif. as he ralled out

"house with his bands up, boüh by police officers that still remain free.

Black Panther and K.C.C.F. offices all across the nation (L.A., New Orlcans,

Poleão, Philadelpaia, bave been attacked and ransacked by police officers.

non Detroit joinsthe list, just as the N.C.C.F. here was beginning to stari a

free commity bealth clinic and to gain the support of the cominity.

But the Panthers continue to grow and sink deeper una deeper roots amoug

the people.

And all of us poor and norking people, black and white, should be

glud, should defend the Panthers and help then grow. For the Pantliers axe

fighting the enemy of all poor and norting people:

oi' Gu) who run this country sud controi not ouly the black coumunity but all. of

of their rights, the arab ration's right, and the

Actually, Increasing the sirectiveness of the

Revolution occurs in two rain fields:

1. In the Palestinian realm, which ircludes

the Falestinian people and the armad

2. In the Arab realn, which includes the

Palestinian people must be accomplishod in Arab Jaro

All this means that the Revolution is affacter

OF THE ARAB PEOPLES

Cairo, January 1969

Friends,

In the name of the people of Palestine, in the name of the

Palestinian Rovolution, in the name of Justice and Peace for

which we fight, sre thank you for your concem and the concern

of your people in Justice and l'eace in our part of the world.

We are very happy to have the opportunity to meet with you,

because you represcht people who fought for peace based on justiee.

We can see among you people who foughi the Nazi invasion

and the fascist terror in Europe.

We also find among you people who fought, and de still

fighting, imperialism and colonialism and racial discrimination

in Africa, Asia and Latin America.

We honestly feel that we stand among friends and commdes

who believe in the right of every peopic to sclf-determination and

its right to enjoy liberiy on its own land, fee of oppression and

discrimination.

**%.

Our people were deprired of their rights to self-determination

and lo the enjoyment of life on their own land without oppression.

This was the result of a serious racist aggression carricd out by

. an imperialist organisation: Zionism.

The aggression of the bih of June is one manifestation of this

basic aggression that had its soots in the loth century, and whos:

culmination was the establishment of the State of Isracl in 1948.

..The major victim of this aggression was the Arab Pale dian people

who were forced to evacuate their homes and land under a reign

of terror and oppression.

No cherofore refuse to consider the 1967 aggression as i

paraie and distinci phenomenon, and we refuse to accept any

slution focussed on the senills of the let aggression without

pasidering the source of the cogracion itself.

The Resolntion of the Secusity Council, November 22nd 1967,

nd all further proposals expizining or modifying it, are inadequate

ad irralevant from our point of view, and therefore are totally

I:d categorically unacceptable to us.

All such proposals skirt the real issue and avoid its core,

arely: the right of the Palestinions to liburate their country, io

njoy

dand homes, and to have the right to decide how they

ion in order to re-establish peace with justice in the Holy Land.

name. Instead of being dcuply ashand of what we did ana of

trying to undo some of the evil we conmitted, by helping these

unfortunate refugees, we justily our terrible acis and even cutempt

to glorify them."

Professor Erich Fromm, the noted Jowish writer and thinter,

had this to add: "It is often said that the Arabs fled, that they left

the country voluntorily, and that they therefore bear the responsi-

bility for losing their property and their land. But, in genera

international law, the principle holds truc that no citizen loses hi

property or his rights of citizership, and the citizenship right is.

de facio right to which the Arabs in

Palestine have much more

legitimacy than the Jews, just because the Arabs lled? " Professor

Fromm asks. "Since when is that punishable by confocudion of

proporiy and by being barred from returning to the land 01 which

a people's forefethers have lived for gunerations? The claim of

the Jows to the land of Isracl cannot be a rcalistic political claim.

If all nations would suddenly claim territories in which their

forefathers have lived two thousand years ago this world would

be a madhouse."

We would like you to consider the magnitude of our problem.

or we are facing a Zionist structure that had its roots in 19th

entury Europe, at the heart of the imperialist moverent. Zionism

p one of the most oppressive aud asgrassive forms of imperialiem,

au that has as its major goal the total uprooting of one people

com a country to roplace them by another.

The roots of the aggrission lie in the Zionist ideology itself,

with its belief in the nced to bring a select, chosen people without

, land, to a land that is to be evacuated by its inferior people.

methods used to accomplish this objective are terror,

and deceit.

Lei me quote one of the original Jewish pioncers in Palestine,

Jathan Choshi, who wrote to the caitor of the Jewish Newsiciter

a Febrary 1959:

"If you roally wanted to know what happened, we old Jewish

otton in Palestine sho witnessed the fight could tell you how

ad in what manner we jews forced the Arabs to leave cities

und villages... Some of them were driven out by force of arms;

there're sade to leave by deceit, lying and false promises.

The Zionists went ahead coldbloodedly with their sinister

scheme to vacate Palestine of its people, by the use of terror,

massacres and frightening rumors.

Arthur Koestlos, the pro-Zionist author, described what

happened at Deir Yassin on April Stli, 1913, as the "blood bath

that was the psychologically decisive factor in the Arabs'

spectacular exodus."

On that day, the Zionist terrorist organization Irgun Zvei

Loumi killed 250

men, women and children. After 19%8 there

were other mass killings in occuped Palustine, c.g. Ikrit (1951), Al

Tira (1953), Abu Ghosh (1953), Kaf: Kassen (1956), etco, as

part of the systomatic Zionist plan for the complete evacuation

of the Palestinians, to be replaced by Jewish settlers from all

over the world.

These were the conditions that forced the Palestinians to leave

their homeland.

The Zionists did not come to a country without people. There

With all their efforts, by 1917 the Zionists had only been

Our people have risen to arms because all other means have

been exhausted. We rofuse to accept raisery and diaspora is our

fate, and we refuse charity and compromise as solutions to our

problem. We shall overcome: through a long-term liberation

the fruits of our sacrifices are bagining to shoir. The Palestine

Liberation Movement has succided in awakening our people,

in rekindling its hope for a beiter future with dignity and respect

in our own land. We are forcing the enemies of peace to admit

their failure to extinguish our ravolution, we are winking battles,

and ive are starting to shape our destiny. We are not swayed by

ornotional appeals, we are not seckers of revenge, we are not

bloodthirsty terrorists. We are freedom fighters with cluar and

mature goals. We are fighting today lu create the nesy Palustine

of tomorrow: A progressive, democratic, secular Palestine in

which Christian, Moslum and Jew will wo:ship, sork, live peacefuly

and erjoy equai rights. This is no utopian dicam or false promise,

for we have always lived in peace, Moders, Christians and Jews

in the Holy Land. The Palestinian Arabs gave a refuge, a warm

shelter and a heiping hand to jews flecing persecution in Christian

Europe and to the Armenians flecing periccution in Mostem

Turkey, as well as to Greeks, Circessians and Maltese among others.

Our Palestinian revolution still stretches its welcoming hand

to all human beings who want to fight for, and live in, a democ-

ratic, tolerant Palestire, irrespective of race, color or religion.

• During the last four years, some 500 of our people have given

their lives on the baulcheld. During the same period many more

than that have died in refugee camps from bitter cold, poor nourish-

ment and disease.

We arc here to assert to you, and to ask you to confirm to

your people, that our people will not lay down their arnes until

Palestine is liberated and our rights restored. We will not accept

any settlement that denies us these rights, be it the Security

Council's resolution, or any other proposal or political settlement

ensuing from it. We will not accopi any substitute to i war

of national liberation and will tenaciously hold to it regardless of

sacrifices and costs. Could anybody have asked you to accept

anything less than total freedom from Nazisra, fascisia or colonia-

lism? We are confident the peopic of the world will back our

struggle and will suppori our revolution, for it is the struggle of

man to achieve the loftiest of man's values: peace and j

Local leaders, upon arrival

at Washington, conferred

with national BPP leaders concerning

security arrangements at the Washington BPP Information Center.

At about 8:00 p.mo, jone of the national leaders, John seale,

announced that

their convention was off. Seale said decision

to call it off was made when they learned that Army troops were

being moved into the area.

Seale also said that Howard Uniersity

at Washington had denied the BPP use of its facilities because

they were a day late in giving a deposit.

Those in the Information Center secured arns and

maintained an alert against a seige during the night.

The next

morning, representatives of the Detroit Chapter made preparations

to return to Detroit.

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, 1970, that the Republic

of New Africa (RNA) is an all-Negro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.

ROBERT F. WILLIAMS,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was named as its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the

United States in

1961 following the

warrant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping growing out of a racial

incident, WILLIAMS published and broadcast hate-type

material

in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969. Shortly after his recurn,

WILLIAMS resigned from RNA.

A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is to establish an independent black nation within

the United States,

demanding the States of Alabama, Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina, in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as payment foi: 400 years of ancestral.

slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the ENA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to

black freedom and committed to the concept of systematic

armed revolution, has been established. Black Legion members

are expected to participate in military training und engage

in firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order to avoid detection by the police.

According to this souice, Black Legion memoers

acting as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969, were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policeman and the critical wounding of another.

'ON THE REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTICNAL CONVENTION *

THE WASHINGTON D.C. ARMORY BOARD HAS FOR THE SECOND TIME DENIED THE

BLACK PANTHER PARTY'S APPLICATION FOR USE OF THE ARMORY FOR THE REVOLUTIO-

NARY PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION. THE FIRST DENIAL WAS ON THE BASIS

THAT THE DATES THAT' WE REQUESTED VERE FILLED. THE SECOND, AND MOST RECENT

DENIAL WAS ON THE BASIS THAT OUR REVOLUTIONARY PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL CON-

VENTICH WOULD HANPER THE OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL GUARD "SECULD THEY BE

CALLED TO DUTY, SHOULD AN EMERGENCY ARISE. "'IT IS VERY CLEAR THAT THE ARMO-

RY BOARD IS CONSISTENTLY LOOKING FOR REASON TO DENY THE PEOPLE THE USE OF

THE ARMORY, WHICH IS A PUBLIC FAILITY PAID FOR BY PUBLIC TAX MONEX.

THIS BLATANT ATTEMPT TO DENY THE USE OF THE ARMORY IS ALSO AN UNDER-

HANDED ATTEMPT TO DENY THE PEOPLE OF ONE OF THEIR BASIC CONSTITUTIONAL

RIGETS: THAT IS THE RIGHT TO FREEDOM OF ASSEMELY.

THE DEMOGIGIC POLITICIANS ARE ATTEMPTING TO MANIPULATE THE KINDS OF

THE PEOPLE INTO BELLIVING OR THINKING THAT ONLY THE BLACK FANTHER PARTY IS

•THE FACT THAT TEN THOUSAND OPPRESSED PEOPLE FROM ALL SOCIAL, ECONOMIC,

RACIAL AND POLITICAL BACKGROUNDS CAME TOCETHER IN PHILADELPHIA TO COLLECI-

IVELY FIND SOLUTIONS TO THEIR COMMON PROBLEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE PEOPLE

HAD & CHANCE, TO PRACTICE SOME TRUE DEMOCRACY AND TO TAKE A HAND IN GRASP-

ING THEIR OWN DESTINY.

HAVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION, ARMORY OR NO ARMORY. THE BLACK PAN

MINISTRY OF INFORMATION

12847 14th STREET

DETROIT, MICH.

TO ALL CONCERNED MERCHANTS AND BUSINESSMEN:

The Detroit N.C.C.F. (organizing bureau of the Black Panther

Party) is presently organizing people from all walks of life to

attend the Revolutionary People's Constitutional Convention to be

held November 27th, 1970 in Washington D.C. The Constitutional

Convention stems from the need for a new consitution because of

the constant exploitation and poverty of the masses of people

In this country.

Before 1776, white people were colonized by the English govern-

ment with certain laws and rules not in their best interest. These

people, a colonized people, had no choice but to protect themselves

from the aggressions inflicted upon them by the government. One

such form of protection was the Declaration Of Independence which

states:

"* whenever any government becomes destructive of these

ends,

it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and

tọ institute a new government, laying its foundations on such prin-

ciples and organizing its powers in such forms as to them shall

seem most likely to effect their

safety and happiness."

We realize that the masses of people who will be attending the

convention are impoverished, and are too, a colonized péople.

As a non-profiting organization, we, a vanguard party, meets

the basic needs of the people by the implementation of Socialistic

Programs into the communities through the support of numerous mer-

chants, businessmen and individuals willing to render their services.

FREE BREAKFAST FOR CHILDREN - In which we feed the chila

ren from the community a well-balanced meal each morning

to supply them with the nutrients they need for the day.

FREE CLOTHING PROGRAM - Programs implemented to meet cloth-

ing needs of the people through the clothing donations ve

receive.

PLOPLE'S FREE MEDICAL CLINIC - Services the same as a

doctors office, initiated because of the great emphasis

placed on money by the majority of Medical Institutions.

Because of the inconsistency of this decadent American Society,

The People's Constitutional Convention has been called which affects

all people living in this society. And in order that the people be

guaranteed the highest form of living in this affluent society, we

all have to combine our energies in order that we have land, food

for our hungary people, decent housing, education, clothes and justice

and

peace.

We are asking for donations of food to feed the many people

who will attend the convention, supplies

opened fire on our office and other houses in the community.

The fork-tongued police have said that they used "great

restraint," but we know that if it wasn't for the swift

actions taken by the black community and other progressive

people, Commissioner Nicholas' henchmen would have committed

mass murder.

The sisters and brothers in the NCCF office,

not taking the word of lying pigs, refused to come out and

didn't do so until they were insured by trusted people from

the community that conditions were favorable.

We see this as part and parcel of the relentless

attempt by the fascist U.S. Government to destroy the Black

Panther Party (BPP) and its organizing bureaus, the NCCE.

For the last six months, since the Nixon, Agnew, Mitchell,

Hoover gang has been oinking its fascistic "law and order"

have attacked BPP and NCCF offices, all across the country.

Our party offices and NCCF offices

in Philadelphia, New Orleans,

Toledo, Ohio and New Bedford, Massachusetts have been under

attack by the forces of the repression.

And now, here in

Detroit, Police Commissioner Nicholas and his bandit forces

have joined in this fascist act.

However, we want the people here in Detroic and

throughout the world to know that the SPE and its organizing

bureaus, the NCCI, will not quiver in the wake the United

States inspired onslaught that is being waged against our

Party, black people, and other oppressed people throughout

the world. And we have said it before and we will say it

again:

THE RACIST DOG POLICEMEN MUST WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY

FROM OUR COMMIUNITIES AND THE CORMUNITIES OF THE WORLD, CEASE

THEIR WANTON MURDER AND BRUTALITY AND TORTURE OF OPPRESSED

PEOPLE, OR FACE THE WRATH OF THE ARMED PEOPLE.

The courts in Detroit are holding our comrades

in preventive detention and will place an astronimical

ransom on our sisters and brothers. Bail money is badly

needed.

Party (BPF) is contained in the appendix

pages attached hereto.

The following statements were made by speakers who

appeäred at the Detroit National Committee to Combat Fascism

(NCCF) picnic at Belle Isle Park, Detroit, Michigan, August

16, 1970 (the Detroit NCCF is a front for the BPP.) :

RAPHEL VIERA, from New

York stated that the pigs

wanted you to believe that you had no power, but he was a

living example that the people

nad power because he was

free, and if the people would learn to stick together they

.could change the whole fascist system and free all the rest

who have been railroaded into prison.

LARRY POWELL, Detroit NCCF, told of the harassment

of NCCF members and supporters by the pigs in downtown Detroit

to keep them from selling the paper, and also to prevent

them From giving the free breakfast to hungary children by

following them around and at the first chance stop them

a traffic violation to search their cars and take food

which has been donated under the pretext that it is stolen.

i . ZAYED!

¡SHAKUR, Deputy Minister of Information for

the New York Bef, spoke and began by stating that he would

not greet them with the faniliar slogan, "power, to the people"

but that the pigs must go.

He stated that they selected

Philadelphia for the convention because the first Constitution

was written there, but the rich slave master, GEORGE WASHINGTON,

did not include the black man in that Constitution. He

further stated that the black man would be in thisme, which

the pigs will probably reject, and the BPP has demonstrated

what action they will take in California when those brave

men show that they would rather die as free men than to

live as slaves.

He requested

a standing ovation for the

fallen comrades, which he received, he then asked for fascist

black pigs to stand, that the people may know who they are

and that they are doing the job they are being paid for. He

stated that if a Black Panther is busted, it was a nigger

who fingered him. It was these people who killed MALCOLM X,

they fed j. E. HOOVER information about KING's extra-marital

relationship and that they had better set their price high

because when we find you, you are going to pay with your life.

I. REVOLUTIONARY PROGRAMS AND POLICIES AS

EXPRESSED BY BPP LEADERS

A characterization of the Black Panther Party

(BPP) is contained in the appendix pages

attached hereto.

LARRY/ PONELL, member of the Detroit National

Committee

to Combat Fascism (NCCF), conducted the political

education classes on July 5, 1970, at which time the topic.

of discussion was the center page of the July 4, 1970, issue

Of "The Black Panther" newspaper. Those in attendance

were instructed as follows:

Whenever you say "death to the pigs" mean it.

Put your words into action.

Use the slogan "all power to

the people" as the pigs think they are the power. Now we-

have to add to our slogan "death to the pigs," so stop.

talking and start putting your words into action.

The pigs

are planning genocide against us.

The reason there are more

pigs in the community this year

than last year is because they

are planning to get rid of

all blacks,

and they want all

blacks to move into the projects so all they would have to do

is put a fence around it and give them just enough money io

get food.

They want to take everything away from us, but

have the power to destroy and there is no way the

•pigs can destroy the BPP. If they kill us off, our struggle

will be taken up by the people in the community as we are

the people's party. If we don't go to the people then we

are not serving the people.

Our struggle is not confined

and exists also in the south in the

We have to fight for national salvation, deal with repression

and will fight for the liberation of all oppressed peoples.

Black Panther Party (BPP), has scheduled a pionic at Belle

begin at approximately 12 noon.

A characterization of the BPP is contained in the

Source one further stated that the NCCF is getting

out leaflets advertising a frae picnic, however, they are

planning to ask for donations for the barbeque.

Source one further stated that the NCCE has contacted

the Youth International Party, Detroit, to obtain sound equip

ment.

Source one advised on August 10, 1970, that a total

of up to 500 persons were at the picnic, however, the NCCF

did not appear to make over $100.00 or $200.00 as

most of the

donations were small.

The NCCI sold buttons bearing the slogans,

Re: Black Fanther party;

Source one advised that a photograph of Ronnie

"The Detroit Iree press" is a morning newspaper

published in Detroit, Michigan, of general circulation,

source two, who has furnished reliable information

in the past, advised

that the NCCF picnic lasted from apfor.

imately 12:30 p.n. to 7:30 p.M., on August 9, 1970.

Source two further advised that there were approx-

imately 150 individuals present most of the time; however,

around 4:00 pon., music was

played over the public address

system at the band shell which attracted crowds up to approx-

imately 400 people.

The majority of these paople did not appear

to be present because they were motivated by BPp doctrine, but

merely curious.

source two advised that to his knowledge, there were

no incidents of violence, and the only damage that

occurred was

when the NCCE broke open

the control house for the electrical

power at the band shell in order to turn on the electricity.

Members of the NCCI closed the house and turned off the power

before leaving.

CONFIDENTIAL

BLACK PANTHER PARTY (EPE)

According to its official neuspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was stärted during December, 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people 5b

they. can

take control of the life, politics,

and the destiny of the

black community.

It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE,

BPP Chaizman, and HUEY P, NENTON, GPP Minister Of Defense.

NEWTON is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years

on a conviction of manslaughter in connection with the

killing of su Oakland Police Offices.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther"

which furthes describes itself as the "Black Community News

Service", states that the BPP

advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end

oppression of the black people.

Residonis of the black

community are urged to arn themselves against the police

who

are consistently referred to in the publication as "pigs"

who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968.

contains an aditorial by BPP Minister of Education GEORGE

MASON MURRAY, which ends with the following:

"Black men, Black people, colored

persons se

America, revolt everywhere?

Arm yourselves.

The only cui-

ture worth keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change:

Freedom everywhere: Dynamite!

Black Power,

Use the gun.

Kill the pigs everywhere,"

Included in the introduction to an

article ascerring

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "...we will not dissent from American Governet.

We will overthrow it."

• Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman ino Ise-Tung of the

•People's. Republic of China and feature MAO's statement that

"political power. grows out of

the

barrel of a gun."

The Free Breakfüst for School Children is about to cover

the country and be initiated in every city where there is a

nourishing breakfast every morning so they can learn.

These brackfasts include every nutrient that they need

for the day. For too long our people hove gone hungry and

without the proper health aids they need.

It is a becutiful

sight to see our chilären aut in the norming for it is a fact

this enables them to trini.

Io begin and continue this progrin it takus donations from

concernea people, business, merchants, and grocors who draw

their profits

we need unlinited cocations of focas which can be stored,

such as cercal, grits, suga, cocon, salt ura pepper, jeily

and cooking oil.

IN THE ELEGTRIC CHAIR

• INTERNATIONAL SECTION B.P.P.

Alger, Algeria

SUBJECT: Press Relese

DATE: March 2, I970

CONCERNING: The preplanned political

murder of Bobby Scale, Chairmas of

the Black Panther Party, in the

electric chair in the stste of Con-

necticut..

The primary lask of the American Revolu

tion, 'at

this point in our history, is to

defeat the Humber One maneover of the power-

istructure, which is to make an example of

Bobby Seale by putting him to death in the

electric chair in the stste of Connecticut.

The fascists have already decided in ad-

vance to murder Chairman Bobby Seale in

their all-out effort to destroy the leader

ship of the Black Panther Party and to in-

tinidate our membership in particular and

all progressive peoples and organizations.

This should be crystal clear even

to a blind

man. The vicious political persecution of

Chairasu Bobby Seale ranges in tine over a

four year period from the very beginning

of the Black Panther Party- and geographic-

Iy it follows a twisted trail of trumped-

up charges from Oakland, Sacramento, Ber-

•keley, San Francisco, Chicago, and now to

amicälcui. The piui against

bubby seale

la particular is so outrageously obvious

that even these shameless pigs should not

havo the gall to pull it off.

grabbed shotguns and positioned themselves behind the windows

and doors of the house ready for a confiontation with the

police. LARRY FOWELI telephonically contacted MISSI HUNITT

(leader of the Central Committee, BPP, California), advising

him of the situation.

HEWITT advised POWELL that if the

police had a warrant

: to let them in.

POWELL then contacted

all the news media and black leaders in the community

relative to the situation.

Immediately reports were being submitted to the

Panthers in the house that the police had surrounded the

building and were on top of the roof and had the whole block

barricaded.

Another call was made to MASSI HEWITT, relative

to the situation to which HEWITT advised LARRy PONELL that

• the Panthers were to relate to Executive Mandate Number

Three, which is "protect the house, let no police in."

arrived and positioned themselves in the house awaiting the

confrontation with the police.

of the fact that the whites were in the majority, they

should be in charge of the demonstration.

REPUBLIC OF NEW AFRICA (RNA)

A source advised in May, -1969, that the Republic

of New Africa (RNA) is an all-Negro organization founded

in Detroit, Michigan, in March, 1968.

ROBERT E. WILLIAMS,

who was then residing in Peking, China, was named

as its

President-In-Exile.

After fleeing the United States in

1961 following the issuance of a local wartant in North

Carolina on a charge of kidnaping groving out of a racial

incident, WILLIAMS published and broadcast hate-type

material in Cuba and China prior to his return to the

United States in September, 1969..

•A second source has advised that the purpose of

the RNA is so establish an independent black nation within

the United States, demanding the States of Alabama,

Georgia,

Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina in addition to

$10,000 per black citizen as payment for 400 years of..

ancestral slave labor.

A third source advised on March 14, 1969, that an

army of the RNA, known as the Black Legion, dedicated to black

freedom and committed to the concept of systematic armed

revolution, has been established.

Black Legion members are

expected to participate in military training and engage in

firearms practice.

The RNA plans to establish an underground

Black Legion in addition to an aboveground Black Legion in

order

to avoid detection by the police.

According to this source, Black Legion members

acting as bodyguards at a session of the Second National

Convention of the RNA in Detroit, Michigan, on March 29,

1969, were involved in a shoot-out with members of the

Detroit Police Department which resulted in the killing of

one policeman and the critical wounding of another.

Know what they did to his wife? They placed a bomb under

hid bed and they blew him up, they blew his wife up, they

destroyed his home, they destroyed his life, and they

thought they had destroyed his dignity as a man, but they

were wrong,

they made a mistake; I still remember Marry I.

Moore and at that time I was a student and we coulôn't

forget ana today

there are others like Harry

I. ioore.

There were only a few at that time, out they had told

him

that they were going to kill him,

they toid him that they

were going to destroy him and his family, but he woulon't

stop pushing for black rights,

the rights for black people,

now nobody has ever been punished for the murier of those

two people, they went scott free. The officials claimed

that they couldn't find the killers and that's the part of

our history in imerica, that is the part of our tradition,

so norto, that

that is a part of our oppression, and this is what people

like liuey i. Newton are trying to corract and this is why

Panthers have been killed all across the land and some of

us have allowed black extremists who must be wiped out,

some of our people tremble when they even hear about our

self defense and they say 'well these people are only getting

what they ask for.'

Did liarry I. lioore get what he asteu

for? What was his crime? and we could go rown the list,

a long list, reagar ivers, dia he get what he ashed for?

What happened to the people who murdered him?

ind remamber

that redgar ivers too was a leader who put his life on the

line. and they killed him.

Not only that, but do you

Was he killed because he was a criminal? No, they said

they killed him because he was a Nigger and this crime, is

I'm not talking about running dogs. I didn't ask you to

I asked you to name an imperialist.

they

look what he's tone to his

The fact is that there is no black

with imperialist mentalities.

There are blacks who would

like to be imperialists, but

they do not have the means

to become imperialists.

See before can become an imperialist

you must have powerful armies, a navy an air force.

must have the means to subdue

people.

we can't subdue

anybody: but ourselves so we can't be imperialists.

you know so that they can blend in with the crowd. When

So I tolä them no I'm not going ani I looked at the man

and I asked him if you haü brought the undertaker and he

said,

'Undertaker, what's an undertaker got to do witlarthis?'

And I said, 'Well, he's the only one whose going to be able

to put me on that plane, it will mean that he will have to

put my body on,

but you can't put me on that plane, you can

put my body on it, but you can't put me on it.'

So I stood

there and looked, at him and they stood there and 100.ced at

me and they had about fourteen men lined up. along the hall

on you.'

the FBI some of the FBI came on the plane and in fact we

had this whole plane to ourselves and nobody but the frew

worked the plane and worked for us and I don't know how

much money Twi spent on the flight, but I know it cost

more than the ticket that I had paid for. Anyway not only

that, but they sent the Vice President, who was a black man,

to meet me and to fly back with me on the plane and they

didn't tell that in the press either that the Vice tresident,

I suppose he was about loth or 17th or 20th Vice President,

couldn't get Haynsworth on the bench so what did he do?

He turned around and got a man even worse than Haynsworth.

and sold land in areas where they didn't allow our people

to buy and sell. Now what was this?

of the United States Constitution, the same document that

they want to put him on the bench to defend. It's like

saying that we will delegate a wolf to defend the rights

of lambs.

We will let the wolf. sit in judgment over the

lambs and we can expect the wolf to do justice to the lambs.

And now people like Huey I: Newton and others are in prison

but they can't release our Huey P. Newton. They can't release

him because we will stick to the

we must uphold law and order.

They don't mean law and order, not the type of

He wouldn't be opposed to law and

Law and order would protect

This is an affront and a slander to every black man in the

world for a man to sit in the governos's mansion and listen

and say that he has been promised that my Constitutional

rights will be protected..

It will be the first time on

this earth that a black man's Constitutional rights have

been protected.

"The Klan is now even rising in Michigan.

In Michigan he looks to North Carolina and

says,

'Oh,

• I have faith in the southern way of life, it shows the

connection.

The connection is because in the last election

North Carolina and South Carolina went Republican. They

voted Republican for the first time since reconstruction and

this is the new conspiracy against the black man and as

political patronage they must accommodate the south and when

accommodate the south, it means that vou are finished

as a human being and this is purely and simple what it is.

But I say to the Klan, to Governor

filiken, to all of the

white racists and. the

fascists, I tell them that they are

moving toward the destruction of imerica if they think that

they can destroy us, that they can deny us our human rights,.

and they can live immune to any retribution.: They are

making the fatal and the final mistake of imerica, and I

can assure you that this is the beginning of the end and

most of all they have started the economic squeeze which

means that beginning this summer you're going to see some

hard days in merica.

to be a leader, he should only heve ambition to do what is

Leadership is not a

special privilege for advantage, leadership means sacrifice,

leadership puts you on the hotseat, it puts one as the bull's

sacrifice; it means that he is a

betraying us, they are betraying our cause.

at this eleventh

hour when the man is about to move against us, look at us

what do we have?

What kind of united front?

How are we

together? We are not, just a lot of faction and he is able

to set these factions

against each other and that we will

call each other names and we will help to create suspicion

and we will help to destroy ourselves when I say that we

have got to get rid.of all of those people in our ranks who

bring about dissention thus we've got to stop thinking that

weive got to have the last word and that we've always got

to be right you see this is a bad thing, this is why we have

so much dissention now because each person feels like he's

got to have the last word if somebody said

something against

me that might not be right or I don't like, well even if it

breaks down the roof and if we've got other business rather

than take care of this business I'm going to have the last

word and that's destructive.

It means that if we really :

care for our people, if we really care about freedom, we

will not resort to this type of tactic and I tell you like

I told the whites, they asked,

well, why did you come back

to America?

Ihy at this time?' and

I wrote a letter to the

going to so and this is why we nust consider an attack on

the Fanthers, an attack on us. We must consider an attack,

a racist atiack, on any black man an attack on us.

We must

also love our people, we must love one another and there is

one thing I like about China, the chinese will not steal

from chinese and the chinese will not fight in their country

now because they're trying to be a selfless society

this is what we have got to be if we are to survive.

The only thing that will help us to survive is that we build

a seliless society means that we first got to change our-

selves.

we have got to change ourselves, nobody can change

us and we have got to start with ourselves and that is that.

We put the good of all of our brothers above our individual

welfare and this is the only way that we can survive. But

I want to say again: that I feel that we are going to make it.

We're going to have to pay for our mistakes, many people

are going to be hurt, be killed, but then we will learn from

that and I'm sure that we will have in us the power to

survive and the pover of greatness.

Because of our suffering

we will have more understanding and we will have a better

attitude to build a better world and I say once again

I'm happy to have this opportunity and I hope that we will

have more meetings in the future

and that we will get our

heads together and we will start working on a united front

and that we will forget about leaders, individuals leaders,

and our indivicuals groups and our denominations and our

clubs and start thinking in terms of survival and I end on

that note with the slogan that is prevalent among the pastors

and as a tribute to brother luey, I say more power to the

people."

"I understand we've been here for quite a while

APPENDIX

1

BLACK PANTIER PARTY (BPP)

According to its official. newspaper, the Black

Panther Party (BPP) was started during December, 1966, in

Oakland, California, to organize black people so they can

take control of the life, politics, and the destiny of the

black community. It was organized by BOBBY GEORGE SEALE,

BPP Chairman, and HUEY P. NEWTON, BPP Minister of Defense.

NEWTON is presently serving a sentence of 2 to 15 years

on a conviction of manslaughter in connection with the

killing of an Oakland Police Officer.

The official newspaper, "The Black Panther",

which further describes itself as the "Black Community News

Service", states that the BPP advocates the use of guns and

guerrilla tactics in its revolutionary program to end

oppression of the black people.

Residents of the black

community are uiged to arm themselves against the police who

are consistently referred to in the publication as

"pigs"

who should be killed.

"The Black Panther" issue of September 7, 1968,

contains an editorial by BPP Minister of Education GEORGE

MASON MURRAY, which ends with the following:

"Black men. Black people, coloica persons of

America, revolt everywhere!

Arm jourselves.

The only cul-

ture worth keeping is a revolutionary culture.

Change.

Freedom everywhere. Dynamite! Black Porer, Use the gun.

Kill the pigs everywhere."

Included in the introduction to an article appearing

in the October 5, 1968, edition of "The Black Panther" is the

statement, "...ve will

not dissent from American Government.

We will overthrow it.".

Issues of "The Black Panther" regularly contain

quotations from the writings of Chairman MAO Ise-lung of the

People's Republic of China and feature MO's statement that

"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."
