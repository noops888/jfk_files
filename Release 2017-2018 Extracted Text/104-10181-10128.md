ME NO ANDUM FOR THE RECORD

The attached cable from Imbassy Moscow 18 solf

It was brought to my attention thie mornlas

by Mr. Robert Crowley of Contact Dirialon/00.

?. Mr. lebater was employed by Fand Corporation last

spring to accompany kir. Hand to Moscow for the opening of

the Sokolalk! Tair and for the pusult of Rand's intereat

as agents for several American exhibitori who vanted to dis

pome of their displays at the ond of the fair.

Webster La

in his early thirties,

Is belleved to have & busineso manage-

ment background, but several attempts to obtain biographie

date about bin from our f1les have drawn a blank.

It appears

that to was assigned as temporary office mannger of the

Moncow office and charged primarily with the responsibility

to sell Rand services to Amerionn exhibitors as agents to

Ilquidate thels displays at the ond of the falr.

033. About 21 Septeaber Ha. Crowley of COCD informed ne

that

word from kr. Horrill, Bast test Contacts State Bopartment,

that inquiry was being mide by Rand Corporation of State

Departmont to deteraine the whereabouts of Mr. Webster who

had departed his office without notice to the parent company.

It seems that Rand Corporation also made direct inquiry

through the Bovlet Embrasy faahington for Information about

Mr. Webater. At thia point I relayod this information to

Major Carels, UBAI/ACSI, who phoned me a day later to say

that the Soviet Eubassy had Informed Rand Corporation that

Mr. Webater was on & tro waks tour arranged by intouriet.

Since lebater wan about to conclude his assigment for land

in Moncow and return home thia information mas considered

quite

satisfactory.

During our conversation on 23 September with

General Dougher and other ATIC representatives, a quantion

na to ki. Hebster's situstion and wereabouts was answered

Information that he had been on a vacation trip and

waa belloved to be enroute to the u. s.

that he ms a temporary employee and uns not intended to be

the Moscow office manager.

Upon learning of Embasay cable number 1082, I

phoned injor Carole to bring 1t to his attention, he sase.

that ho had just learned of 1t hinnell because of a query

Iron ATIC Cleveland which had apparently bees alerted because

of a phone call fron Stato Department vashlagton to land

Corporation about it. ATIC Cleveland wanted to know whether

any pomalbility oxiated that. webater night be carrying out

• cladentine task upon requirements of ClA which had bot

been coordinated "ith tben

afor Carels was assured pon-

tively that such man not the cane, and to the best of ou

Tebter hid not been briefed by and was

unknown to either DDP or 00 officon.

C•. A Check was made with Mr. Thomas Millas to

whether he had personally encountered Mr. lebater during the

course of the Bökolnikt Fair! Mr. Millalhad not ir. "ebster

on a few social occasions and on one or two occasiong when

Mt. Tebater was soliciting Chrysler Corporation commissions

act as Chrysler's agent in liquidating Chrysler

or: M122a)sa1d that Chrynler rejocted Rand'a mer-

Fit 1s dr.

Millotimpression that Ar. Hebuter was ex-

trenoly frustrated in his attenpts to deal with Soviet rep

rosentatives in salon tramactions and was an outspoken critio

of 11 log conditions and relationghips within Moscow.

Wills as most unlikely to dofect to the soviets,

but quallfied this view with the thought that rebater me an

unhappy and maladjustod personality whose lack of suocess

ais assignod mission and whose porsonal problens were evident.

To develop our ploture of Mr. Nebater sore fully, Mr. MillaJ06

will consult with' Mr.

JaRa Mr. Rayles to produce,

perhaps, a pore laforned and composito picture of Mr. Nobeter.

According to Mr. Crowley 00, and Major Carole, each from his

own sources, Mr. Vetster han been laboring under marital and

financial difficulties and le reported to have had a past

rocord of employment instability.
