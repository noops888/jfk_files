MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECI: Relatona with l'anolo RAY and •be MRP

1. For background seo my memorandum of lá May 1961, reporting on

my long session with Landlo RAY, Rogelio CISNEROS (Eugenio) and Ernesto

BETANCOUPI. As will be nosed in that memorandu, Manolo prominad to

come up with a prospecius vithis approvinmoly ten days almo, alter con-

#ulting wich bie leaders lo Cuba.

2, On 1 June 1961 2r. Earnea called me to say that Mr. Goodula had

been violted by Mr. Ernesio BETANCOUNT wio asked for Immediate ilnanclal

suppor! for cartain activilles of the MRP ishich would run around slù, cuu

dollars.

Mr. Barona asked mio 10 contic BETANCOURT for the purpose of

ascertaling what the funda were to do used for, exacily how niuch needed, etc.

1 called BESANCOURI and he loid me lar 1 should get these details drom

CISNEROS (Eugenio), who was saying al room 549 al sha Washtagion Hotal.

I called. Eugenio and mado a daia for nie and Ray DuBolo (Ray Adams is tha

naine he uses with Ray and Cloneros) to call upon blix.

We called on CISNEROS

al soproximately 18i5 houra l Juno, and be intornad us that he had urgent

need for pedoa lor use in suuport of his saborage and underground arrivitive

in Cuba.

Ho said bla people were absolutely without fundo, needed monay for.

living expenses, transportation, purchase of sabotage eguipment, air lares for

couriere, and for assisting peoplo to deb out of prison. He raid that it was

now possible lor peopio to buy ibelr way out of prison by bribing one of the

many 'coinmunist lawyere and judges. He thought that iu, vou or so, voo

would moet timediate needs and that some sort of arrangement anould ba mada

to receive funds - 3i, Coó monthly or thereabouts - on a fired and permanent

basie.

3 We mado no comitment to Eugenio other than lo say thas so would

pass hia plea along to she interened peopie. I ranitadod him that we had asked

him and sianolo to prepare 3 plan for consideration and that we vere still

waiting for that plan.

I said I peraonally doubted that anything could ve done

unill the plan was racalved from RAY, tie sala Manolo was planning to como lo

Vashington on ske afternoon of i June with the plan, bu: that he bimgold was

soney already In Cuba - dollara would be dellvered lo owners of the pesos who

are la liainl). Ilold him! would call hir. in the morning to les him know how

things arood.

I discused our meeting with CISNEROS with Tracy Barnea on the

moralag of i June. It was Iracy'e opinion, in which I heartily concis, that

we should pus out no money whatsoever until we have had a ciance lo examine

Xianolo'o plan and to sudy just what ropercussione or ramilicatione there

would be. polley wiue and otherwise, to a declaion to adelar the MRp

untlaterally; thas la, Outside the Council and presumably without MiRo'a

knowledge or consent. Since RAY has withdrawn his grow from the Council

with a great deal of fanfare, le la moms unllkely that MIRO would look kindly

on any anoistance to RAY, especially since he feals he had a rather firm

promise from the Preildent to deal only through vIRo.

5.: RAY, upon arrival in Washingion, will presunably take hia plan (along

with BETANCOURI) directly to Mr. Goodwin and I would also presure that

Goodwin will jase it down to Iracy and Tracy :o ua. Ray DuBois, who has

beon A'anolo's cane olficer, la standing by in the event he should be needed.

B. l personally deal very atrongly that we should do nolhing to support the

plan, whatever. it is, 'until we have recelved from the White House and the

Dapartment clear-cus, uneyuivocal polley guidance on the overall plan. I also

feel thai now la the lime, 11 we are go ing to support te illi unilaterally to

insert a con-official cut out loto the operation. I would recommend that con-

sideration be given to ualng Mr. Harry Pleper (a #AVE contract employee)

on thia job, larry la tempermentally nutted, bas a good businesa head, la

iluent in Spanish (lived 48 years in Cuba), la cleared, followa directions,

completely bonest and tremendously conscientious. l would be harder lo

lind a better person.

7. Also, I would Ilie to point our the security riake Inherent in any arrange

mente with the RAY-BELANCOURI-CISNEROS trlo. These fellows have had

osay gicess to she White House and to the Department, 'are notorlous for their

planned leaks', will probably presumn all the Depariment oificials they deal

with are privy to the arrangement, and before we know it the whole exile

community will be well awaro that we ara providing financial and material

support to the RAY group. I am not arguing against providing such aupport,

bus am merely polatlag out the real potential for anbarrasiment lo ua lf ide

matter lo nor handled with the greatest of precautions. I feel they have becorne

100 closoly identified with U.S. -officialdom, includin? myself, and that ihe

piausible denial aspecto, to dalo at-least, are almom non-existent.
