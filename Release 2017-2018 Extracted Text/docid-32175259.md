desired to leave the Impression that he was cooperating

but in fact he was not.

His answers were evasive,

indefinite and uninformative.

It was believed that his

attorney had instructed him

to respond in this manner

and it was felt that he may have been urged by ANGEL

BOAN and his attorney to agree to interview without

counsel for the purpose of ascertaining the direction

and depth of the FBI investigation rather than chance

having the FBI dispense with the interview completely

if he insisted on counsel.
