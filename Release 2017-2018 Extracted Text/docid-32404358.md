NOTE FOR: Director, Center for the Study

Deputy Director

Office of Congressional Affairs

FROM:

John Pereira

Chief, Historical Review Group

SUBJECT:

JFK/Possible Letter from

Congressman Burton to EXDIR

Jeremy Gunn, Executive Director of the JFK Board, told

HRG yesterday that Congressman Dan Burton may well write a

letter to the EXDIR expressing concern about whether CIA

will be able to meet the deadline for declassification of

assassination-related records.

Burton chairs the Government

Reform and Oversight Committee which has cognizance over the

JFK Board.

Gunn said that he briefed members of Burton's staff

last week and told them he was concerned that the Agency may

not have enough resources dedicated to JFK to finish the

review of documents by 1 September 1998. Gunn showed the

staffers the recent exchange of letters between the Board

and the EXDIR on the same issue.

According to the staffers,

a strong personal interest in the release of the

assassination records.

The staffers gave Gunn the

impression that Burton's strong interest will prompt him to

write to the Agency.

During our discussion with Gunn, we reviewed with him

the Agency's clear commitment to declassifying all

assassination records.

We also explained that we have

shifted four additional contractors to the JFK project, and

shift more if necessary,

even at the cost of slowing

down

or stopping other declassification efforts.
