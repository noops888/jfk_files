It should bo noted that somo

Intormation reported initially is corroctod in later

Is presented in referoncos and hrought

umoro dotail in the attached memoranda, the operatior

seems to be dirocted by Manuol PINIERO: tho

profossionallen shown

In the preparation df the mossago

and the subsequent concealment of tho mossaga soro

cortainly not warranted

by the circumstancon.

If the

purpose were only to get a messago to ANSTALK-1, a

simplo typed lotter in a sealed onvolop would have dono

the job.

The use of strip film which nocossitates

spocial equipment for reading, also suggosts

the possibility

that the entiro operation is dosigned for

• thó purposo

of

opening a channel

to WOFACT.

PINIERO would probably assume

ASSTALK-l would report the incident to WOFACT and the
