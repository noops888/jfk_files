THE ALLEGATION?

The Central Intelligence Agency conducted

regular surveillance of Cubana flights, filing cable

reports to Headquarters. (1977 CIA Staff Report, Tab B,

P. 11) There was one unilateral CIA surveillance team (LiF 6)

that observed arrivals and departures of Cubana

flights, reporting any unusual incidents and providing

copies of flight manifests.

pertainin to

SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS FINDINGS

The House Select Committee on Assassinations

findings differ from those of the Senate Intelligence

Committee in the following manner:

a) The Cubana flight was on the ground in Mexico

City for a total of four hours and about ten minutes.

It was not delayed five hours as reported in Book V.

b) The Cubana flight departed at 2035 hours

Mexico City time, 55 minutes ahead of the alleged

arrival at 2130 of a private flight with a secret

passenger..

c) The 2035 departure also contrasts further with the

Senate Intelligence Committee Report that the Cubana

flight departed at 2200.

WERE THE RESULTS OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE

AGENCY: FORWARDED TO THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE

COMMITTEE

The Central Intelligence Agency gave the

Senate Intelligence Committee only the informant

allegations. The Senate Intelligence Committee

did not review the LIFIRE Or LIENVOY records.

-Relying

solely on the informant's allegations, the Senate

Intelligence Committee could not have reported the

story any differently.
