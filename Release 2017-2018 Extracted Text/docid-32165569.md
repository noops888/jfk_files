It may be that both wEBstER and SERGIEVSkY are unbalanced

cranks.

But that bothrof them should have called at the British

Embassies in WASHINGTON and MOSCOW respectively within four days

isoremarkable and leads one to wonder whether indeed it was just

a coincidence.

It seems to us just possible that the approaches

of both WEBSTER and SERGIEVSKY to our Embassies were inspired

by the K.G.B. who were hoping thereby to discredit what has

been said on these matters by RAGOs?
