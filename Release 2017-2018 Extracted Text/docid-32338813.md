Dear Sir:

Miss Quiet.

Reference is made to Bureau teletype dated April 15, 1945 C

granting approval for the installation of a microphone surveillance at

the residence of LAWSON, 4542 Coldwater Canyon, North Hollywood, provided

it could be installed with full security.

It was intended by the los Angeles office that this

installation could be made while LAWSON is in attendance at the United

Nations Conference at San Francisco. He left for San Francisco April 24

and will be in San Francisco through April 29, however, there is still

wife hence it is not known when the installation can be made.

Unless the Bureau advises. to the contrary the approval

granted for the installation of instant microphone will be retained b

the los Angeles office and the :

installation will be effected when the

opportunity presents itself.

DECLASSIYI

ON Lt-15-00
