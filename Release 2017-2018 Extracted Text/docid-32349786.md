MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Meeting With WUSLAB/1. on 27 March 1970

1.

Security: This meeting took place in WUSLAB/l's

home.

The door was answered by his daughter, who said

that her father was expecting me.

She helped him come down-

stairs.

We chatted for a time and then went upstairs

where I orally went over about one-half of a PCQ form on

Jose Raul Viera Linares.

WUSLAB/1 gave very good answers

to the questions.

After an hour or so of the questions he

was becoming tired, so I broke it off.

2. Plans: WUSLAB/1 will be examined again by the

doctor at Johns Hopkins on 1 April. At that time it is

expected that a prognosis on his recovery and return to

work. will be made.

I told WUSLAB/1 that I would be on

leave until 8 April, but that I would give him a phone

call after 1 April

to see what the doctor has to say.

3. I. asked him to call Roberto Garcia of the

Brazilian Embassy when he is able to do so in order to

find out what he has been doing.

4.

Administrative: WUSLAB/1 was given his salary

for March 1970. Because of his medical condition he

deferred signing a receipt.
