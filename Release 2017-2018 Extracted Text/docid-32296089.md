1958, he had a telephone call from NATIE MARTIN concerning

two hustlers who got themselves into some trouble and

MARTIN requested PG T-16's help in the matter.

PG T-16 said MARTIN was

calling about ELIZABETH and ANN who

once worked for a madam known as RENEE and a pimp named Bureh

or PHIL. According to MARTIN,

these persons were giving

the girls a hard time and PG T-16 assured MARTIN that he would

call RENts and straighten the

of

the trouble in which the girls were involved.

PG T-16 said that a few days later he was able to reach RENEE

at telephone number Churchill 2-2127 and in conversation RENEE

made the statement that ELIZABETH and ANN are either related

to JOHN FONTANA or working for him.

According to PG T-16,

the girls now live in New Kensington somewhere over a club

and are hustling out of the Jacktown Hotel in the evening.

PG T-16 said that JACKIE, the head walter at the Jacktown

Hotel, is acquainted with the girls and

might be able to 'fully

identify them.

pe m-16 also said that RENEE also commented

that FONTANA had called her regarding the girls sometime ago.

PG T-16 said

it is possible that ELIZABETH and ANN could be

identical with GINA and VICKiE who once worked for RENdE

in the 5700 block of Fifth Avenue, Pittsburgh.

PG T-16 recalled

that at that

time GINA and VICKIE claimed to be sisters,

PG T-17, who has furnished reliable information in the past

money. FG 1-5 asked HANNA why he did not obtain the money

from the MANNARINo organization and HANNA indicated that he

1s in the midst of a

"falling out" with the gang. PG T-5

loaned HANNA $10.

PG I-5 pointed out that HANNAis father, ALEX HANNA, told him

1958, reported that JOHN BORDONARO, Chief of Police,

The press

speculated that BORDONARO was called before the Grand Jury

along with other gamblers in New Kensington in connection

with the gambling losses of JOHN KONOWAL, JR., at the

Triangle Billiards gambling casino.

DANIEL J. ZELOYLE

Former Chief of Police

New Kensington, Pa. (deceased)

PG T-5 on October 14, 1958, stated that approximately

two weeks ago DANIEL ZELOYLE's widow telephoned PG T-21,

of unknown reliability, and requested PG T-21 to come

to the ZELOYLE farm immediately on a matter of importance.

PG T-5 said that when PG T-21 arrived Mrs. ZELOYSE;

her daughter, and son-in-law told him that they had been

looking all over the farm to find ZELOYLE's money but had

absolutely no luck and asked PG T-21 how much he would

estimate that he paid ZELOYLE when the latter was Chief

of Police of New Kensington.

PG T-5 pointed out that during

the period 1944 to 1950 when PG T-2] was operating a house

of prostitution in New Kensington with ZELOYLE's permission

PG T-21 paid ZELOYLE in excess of $250,000.

PG: T-5

said that PG T-21 told him he advised Mrs. ZELOYLE that

he had paid her husband that amount and further that he

would estimate that at the time of his death ZELOYLE should

have had over a haif million dollars considering the huge

amount of money he had received from the MANNARINO brothers

while in office as Chief of Police.

PG T-5 said that Mrs. ZELOYLE told PG T-21 that her husband

never discussed his

business dealings with her when he was

alive but that she was not blind to his corrupt activities and

shared the knowledge that he had buried at least one hair

milion dollars but he would not share the secret of the

hiding place with her.

PG T-S went on to say that Mrs.

ZELOYLE mentioned that even

though her husband left several

income properties in his

estate

on which she could live comfortably the remainder

of her iife that she was very disappointed that she coula not

find the money, especially since her husband's savings account

at the bank contained only $400. According to PG T-5,

Mrs. ZELOYLE also said that ZELOYLE's personal effects

yielded a number of shares of stock purchased some years

ago for $8,000 and now worth $35,000 but that the stock

was not in her husband's name but in the name of another

woman her husband had apparently been living with for a

number of years.

PG T-5 said that Mrs.

ZELOYLE left

the impression with PG T-21 that she and her son assisted

by her daughter

and son-in-law have been digging holes

all over the zeLoyle farm especially around the barn, in

a desparate effort to locate the money that they belleve

1s buried in a milk can.

PG T-21 that the night before her father passed way he

practically had to be tied to his bed in the hospital

because he kept repeating that he had to get up ard go

out to the farm to do something he considered very

important.

It is recalled that during February,

1950, PG 1-4 stated that

SAMUEL MANNARINO in early 1957 purchased

a hunting loage surrounded

by 200 acres of land.

At the time PQ T-4 understood MANNARINO

to say the lodge was

located in Somerset County, Pa.s

extensive investigation was conducted to identify the lodge.

in an effort to locate GABRIEL MANNARINO who might logically

be expected to be hiding there.

PG T-4 on October 28, 1958, learned through JACK KRUPA,

New Kensington, Pa., councilman and long-time hunting companion

of the MANNARINO brothers, that the hunting lodge is not

located in Somerset County,

, Pa., but is actually a twenty

room farm house generally referred to as a hunting lodge

surrounded by approximately 200 acres of densely wooded land

in Pennsylvania near the Pennsylvania Maryland border approximately

a fifteen minute drive by automobile from Hagerstown, Maryland.

PG I-4 was unable to obtain any additional information because

of the likellhood of arousing KRUPA's suspicions.

Examination of

road maps of the area indicate that the hunting

lodge could be located in Franklin County probably in the

general vicinity of Waynesboro and Greencastle, Pa.

PG T-4 on October 20, 1950, recalled that he was in SAM

MANNARINO's office at the Ken Iron and Steel Company during

December, 1957, when the press and radio carried the first

accounts

of GABRIEL MANNARINO's being called before the Federal

Grand Jury in New York. PG T-4 stated that while he was

at the office Deputy Marshals were then attempting to locate

GABRIEL MANNARINO when his brother, SAM, received a phone call

from GABRIEL and hurriedly told him "They are trying to

serve you with a subpoena, take off for the brush,

PC T-4

sald that in view of MANNARINO's prolonged disappearance

it would seem logical to assume that if SAM MANNARINO's

remarks were interpreted literally his advice

"take off for the

brush" could have been his subtle way of telling GABRIEL

to hide out at the hunting lodge.

By way of background information PG T-4 pointed out on

October 28, 1958, that the lodge or farm house near the

Maryland border has several four wheel drive trucks parked

on the property that are used from time to time by local

residents. PG I-4 said that according to KRUPA the area

is thickly populated with whiskey stills and that local game

wardens are reluctant to enter the area apparently because

that MANNARINO and LA ROGCA could be in Youngstown;

Ohio.

PG T-35 went on to say that several years ago MIKE GABLE

was sent to loungstown, ohio, by VALent and hide out for

several months with ANTHONY CORBI.

PC T-35 described

himself as a fomer close associate of CORBI in a venture

in Youngstown and addea

that CORBI has a brother named FRANK

CORBI who

• is a well known racket figure in Baltimore,

Maryland,

• In conclusion PG T-35 stated that if either MANNARINO or

LA ROCCA Is In Youngstown, On1o, or Warren, Ohio, he feels

that he can locate them:

It is noted that

"the information furnished by PG I-35 confirms

information given by PG T-36, who has furnished reliable

information in the past, on August 25, 1950.

PG T-37, with whom contact has been insufficient to determine

degree of rellability, on November 9, 1958, furnished

additional information concerning GABRIEL MANNARINO and

JOHN LA ROCCA's possible presence in Warren, Ohio, with

CHARLES MURGIE:

"I could not find out about that party yet, as

that crew are very secretive, I have an Idea that

they may be in Warren, Ohio again.

I thInk it

would be worth a try

to watch that Charlie Murgle,

from the Sunrise Inn again, or watch his house

at 753 Wildwood N.E. as he

had them hidden down

there, then he took them to Florida, but I think

they must be there again, as I know they like to

stay close to home as John Laroce's Wife is going

to have an operation soon.

It is noted that Mrs. LA ROCCA did undergo surgery recently

1n Pittsburgh, Pa:

PG T-38, another Government agency conducting intelligence

investigations,

on November 12, 1958, stated that a postcard

or letter was

sent to GABRIEL, MANNARINO's home at 540

Charles Avenue, New Kensington, postmarked October 31, 1958,

addressed to PAT CORSO from the
