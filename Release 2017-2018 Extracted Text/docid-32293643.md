well as info re it from a friend who is employed by Cubana

Airlines in Miami, and who formerly worked under FACET

when he was the Miami Manager of Cubana Airlines. FAGET

stated, according to his friend, that this leaflet is being

shipped into the US by ALONSeNHIDAIGOyBARRIOS, former

Cuban Consul General in Miami, who is now the Cuban Flord

Government Supervisor of Cubana Airlines.

11 1 ki?

One copy of this leaflet is being transmitted

to the Bureau.

The 11/10/59, issue of the "Miami Herald' contained

an article entitled, "'Cuban Booklet 'Malicious, Offensive'

to US," bearing a Washington, DC dateline.

This article

reflected that the US on Monday accused Cuba of publishing

an offensive brochure full of inaccurate, malicious, and

leading reports about the alleged bombing of Havana last

month.

The article disclosed that Assistant Secretary of

State ROY R. RUBOTTOM, handed Cuban Ambassador ERNESTO

DIHIGO a bluntly worded note complaining about continued

Cuban charges that US-based planes bombed and strafed Cuban

citizens.

Mr. RUBOTTOM also showed DIHIGO a copy of the

brochure which the State Department charged was "Evidently

designed further to create an atmosphere of hostility in US-

Cuban relations."

This article disclosed that the brochure, printed

in English, had arrived in the mail over the weekend addressed

to Secretary of State CHRISTIAN A. HERTER, and bore the

seal of the Cuban Ministry of State.

The article stated that the new American note

again denied categorically any idea that the US approved

the flight of a B25 which dropped leaflets on Havana on

the night of 10/21/59. The article also stated "The

US note said intensive investigation showed the bomb bay

of the B25 was fitted with a permanent luggage rack which

made it impossible for the plane to drop bombs. It also

said the plane's automatic weapons positions had been

permanently sealed so that no cannon or machine gun could

have been mounted on the plane.

"The note said furthermore that available evidence,

including eye witness reports, indicated that many,

if not all, of the Cubans injured October 21, 1959, received

their wounds from Cuban gunfire."

MM is retaining an Autostat copy of this brochure.

ADDENDUM:

On the late afternoon of 11/10/59, Col. FAGET

advised that between ten thousand to fifteen thousand

copies of this brochure were shipped into Miami via

Cubana Airlines destined to the office of Cubana Airlines

at 100/Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, for dissemination m

the US, presumably by the Cuban Consulate, and Cubana

Airlihes.

He learned from his source that this leaflet

was pritten by ANTONIO DE LAXOSA under the supervision of

RAUL ROA, Minister of State.
