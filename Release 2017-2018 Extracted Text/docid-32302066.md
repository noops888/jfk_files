of groups into Cuba in various

He said that it would be difficult to infiltrate

clandestinely, since the SNFE had very few contacts in Cuba.

Accordingly,

the SNFE had no choice but to wait and follov

developments. C

On June 8, 1964, MM T-6, a Dominican official with

excellent contacts among officials of the Dominican Republic

(DR),

advised that the SNFE had requested assistance from the

Dominican Government in establishing a base of operations in

the DR for use against the CASTRO Government. Dominican

Government authorities reportedly advised representatives of

the SNFE that aid would be given any legitimate anti-CASTRO

organization if approved by the United States Government.
