Subject: Interview with Raymond G. Rocca,

February 14, 1975, 2 р.m.

A. BACNGROUiNU

Rocca is originally from San Francisco, anu

ne still maintains a home there.

he was graduated from

the University of california in 1938 with an Al and in

1939 with an MA in international relations. his thesis

related to the facist problem in the Meditarranean area.

In April, 1942, he joined the Research and

Nevelopment Section of the Foreign Broadcast Intelligence

Service.

With the collapse of Italy in Septenwer, 1943,

Rocca joined the Uss 12 group (which was indepenuent

although cooruinate with the counterintelligence USS unit).

Until carly July, 1944, when he went to Rome,

Angleton assumed colland of the X2 unit in 1944. Rocca

eventually became Angleton's executive aide there.

Angleton left Rome in jovemuer, 1947. Rocca

remained, under student cover.

cover.

Rocca returned to the United States and

stayed a year in lIA heauquarters. ne attended the

wational

War Colleye in 1954-55.

Rocca then joined

Angleton

in the recently created counterintelligence (CI)

Staff of the CIA.

Ithe staft was set up in vecember,

1954 or carly 1055.

Prior to that time, the counter-

intelliyence operation nau been sumerged in foreign

B. OBJECTIVUS UF LOUNILRINIUUHIGLICE

ine overall oojective of the Staff was to

form a octrinal vasis for 'I.

because. CI nad not been

a separate unit theretofore, it was necessary to specify

precisely what its purpose and operational objectives

would be.

these onlectives were:

(1) penetration of

other agencies; that is, identification of other agents

and achievement of placing other ayents therein:

(2)

developing uouble ayents; (3) hanuling uefectors,

principally those coming out of other services;

(4)

development of types of controls; that is, intercepting

and deciphering of communications ('I'he mail intercept

program would have fallen within this objective.); and

(5) accomplishment of research.

this involved builjiny

files, analyzing

relevant information, and creatiny

vescriptive papers.

of the project.

he understood that it was a special

project provucing nih-yrade information on the main

Rocca

saiu that he would classify the project

as a

"strateyic siynificance" because it yielded information

on individuals communicatiny with people working for the

KGb .

le could not recall specific dotails. Particularly

important, in his opinion, was the fact that the adversary

did not know that the project existed.

Rocca was not responsible on a ay-to-day

basis for the project even after he became deputy.

That

responsibility was

given to Freu nubbard, Angleton's

executive virector, whom I believe had been appointed at

approximately the

sale time as Rocca. Monthly reports

from the project would come to Rocca

at which time he

reviewed them briefly and passed trem on to Angleton.

through the regular staff budget. Rocca never saw any

of the substance of the project.

Ober's request.

Ober did not explain what the expenses

Rocca was not aware of any such activity by

I. Present I Activities within the United States

Rocca said that de was aware of only four

areas in which lI presently operates

in the Uniteu States.

1. 'I handles four Soviet or bloc defectors

in the United States.

For example, lI has a man on the

East loase who is a retired annuitant acting as a local

handler of a defector.

2.

C'I has various consultants on projects

doing work in the United States.

These are people

actually working under a contract with CIA.

For example,

a woman is currently working

part time on a book relating

to the use of disinformation.

The contract relating

to

preparation of this book calls only for its publication

abroad, and

a foreign publishing nouse has agreed to the

publication.

worked abroad, now acting under military cover in the

United States analyzing the Soviet press for relevant

intelligence information.

woth in the United States and abroad, these people may

also report on their contacts with people abroad who,

in turn, have contacts with the soviets.

J. Miscellaieous Comments

Rocca

said that he believed that the informant

referred to in the lorsh article of lecember 29, 1974, was

a fraud.

ile thinks that the informant must have been

person

fraudulently posiny

as a former CIA agent because

the information contained in the article is, according

to Rocca, not only incorrect but does not even make sense

in the context of

the CIA. Rocca could not elaborate on

exactly what he meant but strongly suggested that we talk

based on the above discussion, Rocca saiu

that he felt it was important that a Federal law be

enacted which makes it a crime for a CIA employee or

former employee to reveal classified information which

he learns in the course of his activities.

in the article that files might ve uestroyed, he personally

wrote a memoranuum stating that no files should be

destroyed under any circumstances given the existence

of the present investigations. Rocca will proviüe a

MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD

SUBJECT: Leaving CIA - Raymond G. Rocca's Story

1. The immediate background of Mr. Rocca's departure

from CIA was a brief discussion between Mr. Angleton and

Mr. Colby late in the afternoon of 20 December 1974. The

gist of the discussion was related to Mr. Rocca by

Mr. Angleton at around 1800 hours when Mr. Rocca was

summoned to Mr. Angleton's office.

Mr. Angleton said Mr. Colby, after referring

to a forthcoming article by Mr. Hersh, which,

however, had not exercised a determining influence

in his decision, had asked Mr. Angleton to leave

his position as chief and take the advantages of

retirement.

In response to Mr. Angleton's question

about a successor, the DCI said he had not given

any thought to that, but had named three individuals,

presently overseas, as examples off the top of his

head.

Mr. Angleton, as Mr. Rocca understood it from

attachment #/

## Page 10

him, asked the DCI whether the leadership

possibilities were extendable to Mr. Rocca or

MI. Miler and was told, "that was negotiable."

It was stipulated that further discussion should

take place with the DDO, Mr. Nelson, and only

Mr. Rocca would be informed at that

stage.

2. On Saturday, the 21st, Mr. Angleton telephoned

Mr. Rocca and expressed the view--with which Mr. Rocca

agreed--that he should ask Mr. Nelson to enlarge the range

of discussion by including Mr. Miler.

3. Mr. Hersh's piece, falsely accusing CIA of running

a massive domestic surveillance operation, appeared on

22 December.

4. At. 1000, Monday, 23 December, Mr. Miler and

MI. Rocca were asked to accompany MI. Angleton to a meeting

in Mr. Nelson's office. Mr. Nelson's deputy, Mr. Blee,

was present.

The discussion took place under considerable

time pressure because

as the meeting went on, it became

clear that a Special DDO Staff Meeting had been called for

1100, at which, presumably, the results of the discussion

underway would be announced. Among other details there

was an extensive discussion between Mr. Angleton and

2

(

Mr.

Nelson on two points:

a .

By Mr. Angleton.

That it would be a mistake

to retire him at that stage because it would be

universally interpreted as an admission of the New

York Times story. Also Mr. Angleton reviewed the items

of upcoming business that had already been programmed

in sensitive CI matters for January and February:

b. By Mr. Nelson.

The absolute necessity to take

action necessary to assure the integrity of the investi-

gations which were to be foreseen.

MI. Angleton's removal as Chief/ CI,

,was assumed in this

discussion, presumably by derivation from the Friday talk

with the Director. Mr. Angleton reviewed the merits of

having the succession in the staff passed to MI. Rocca and/or

• to Mr. Miler.

5. At a certain point Mr. Nelson asked what did

Mr. Rocca and Mr. Miler want to do. (It will be recognized

that there was, under the circumstances, no chance for

consultations, and, actually, no possibility of considered

thought.)

Mr. Nelson did not offer either of these men the

succession to MI. Angleton, neither did he ask Mr. Rocca

(or Mr. Miler) to leave the Agency. He did request that

they stay on in their positions for a transition period.

6.

Mr. Rocca, in the absence of any indication of

interest by Mr. Nelson in him as successor, stated he was

not desireous of remaining on in any task other than

counterintelligence. He would be willing to stay on for

the transition--under a contract, which Mr. Nelson had

stated would be possible--for whatever time was necessary,

and therefore he too would retire by 31 December, bearing

in mind the advantage of the joint cost-of-living increases

of 31 December and 30 June 1974.

7. To sun up, Mr. Rocca would not have retired on

31 December 1974 had he

been offered the command succession.

(That, as he understood it, would have been Mr. Angleton's

wish.) He was not made the offer. As he saw it, under the

circumstances, there was really no other option to retire-

ment in the interest of the CI function or in his own

interest.

RAYMOND G. ROCCA

(Former Deputy Chief, Counterintelligence Staff)

Background

Staff of

tate dr the ca long

Mr. Rocca joined the Counterintelligence (CI)

the CIA in 1955, having previously served

in Italy as a member of the X2 Unit of the oSS.

The

chief of his unit in the OSS had been Mr. Angleton.

Upon joining the CI Staff, Rocca became a

member of its research and analysis component. He

remained in that capacity until 1969, when he became

Deputy Chief of the CI Staff, under Mr. Angleton.

Mail Intercept Program

Rocca knew nothing of the program at all until

1960 when R and A commenced receiving through COMINT

channals moderats amounts (ro-moss. thar-510-55 tra

pieces

a month) of descriptions or photographs. The

program was highly compartmented.

When Rocca became Angleton's Deputy in 1969,

he learned more concerning the existence of the

project. He understood that it was a special project

producing high-grade information on the main adversary.

The project was handled, insofar as CI was involved,

by the Special Investigations group.

Rocca was not responsible on a day-to-day

basis for the project even after he became Deputy.

That responsibility was given to Fred Hubbard,

Angleton'

s executive Director. Monthly reports

from the project would come to Rocca at which time

he reviewed them briefly and passed them on to

Angleton.

In 1971 or 1972, however,

Rocca had to

"defend" the project to Karamessines, the Deputy

Director for Plans.

This was a part of what con-

stituted, in essence!

an annual review by the Deputy

Director of all significant projects in which CI was

involved.

The task fell to Rocca because Angleton

was then

on vacation.

Hubbard and others involved

directly in the project prepared a pro forma justifi-

cation for Rocca to present to Karamessines

•Rocca has no specific knowledge of the

part of the operation which occurred in the

New York City Post Office.

This was because

• that

aspect of the project was handled by the Office of

Security.

In essence, CI was a "customer" of the

Office of Security.

In addition, CI analyzed the

materials and distributed them to the appropriate

recipients.

Angleton determined who would receive

the materials.

In July, 1973, Rocca was assigned to wind

down the operation,

after the DCI had determined to

torminate it.

Rosce moved the physical location of

the project within headquarters and arranged to have

the three or four people involved in the project re-

assigned.

The work product of the project remains

at headquarters.

C. Dissident Operation

Rocca knew nothing of this operation at

the time it was established, except that he recalls

having seen

the memorandum which specified that

information

relating to foreign contacts of dissi-

dents in this country would be obtained and analyzed.

He also knew that in 1967, Ober, who had been under

Rocca in

Research and Analysis (R and A) was assigned

to Operations, where he became the Referent for the

mahare to brone the

Domestic Operations Division.

At that point, Ober

left the CI area and established his own operation

somewhere else in the headquarters building.

When Rocca became Angleton's Deputy in 1969,

the project had already been established. It was

funded through the regular staff budget.

Rocca's

only connection with the project, even then, was

signing authorizations

for expenses which Ober

requested.

Ober did not explain

what the expenses

• were for.

Ober dealt directly with Karamessines Of

Helms on this project. Ober did not deal through

Rocca nor, so far as Rocca knows, did he deal through

Angleton.

D. Police Liaisons

as far as Rocca knows, CI has not had any

contact with any local police. To the extent that

such contacts or liaisons may have occurred, he

believes it would have been done by the Office of

Security.

E. Surveillance, Breaking and Entering, Taps, Etc.

-Rosea is not amare of any such activity bi

CI in the United States.

F. Present Counterintelligence Activities

within the United States

Rocca is aware of only four areas in which

CI presently operates in the United States:

CI handles Soviet or Bloc defectors in

the United States.

2.

CI has various consultants doing work

in the United States.

CI has former agents (who previously

worked

abroad) in the United States analyzing the

Soviet press for relevant intelligence information.

4.

CI has several people in the nature of

agents

reporting on their contacts with Soviets

both in the United States and abroad.

addition is that my preoccupation in this discussion grows out

of the conviction, hased on operational facts, that hostile

espionage, political action, and counterintelligence - in

other words, uncontested expansion of Soviet intelligence

presence, successful recruitments, penetrations, and disin-

formation by the soviets and the Bloc services of intelligence

and security and other conspiratorial organs - will increase

during the period of detente.

The hard fact that KGB presence under Soviet officiall

cover has continued to increase throughout the world, parti-

cularly in areas of direct concern to us like Western Europe,

Latin America, and Africa, makes it a matter of urgency for

CIA to devote a larger part of its energy to the CI problem.

The same thing has happened in the U.S.; the remedy, through

the appropriate Federal agency or agencies, will have to be

the same.

The fact that the KGB/Bloc services, including Cubans,

have continued in the past two years to undertake developmental

relations and have made pitches to and significant contacts

with American officials overseas at an undiminished rate, that

work out to one or more per week, is the complementary opera-

tional element that underlines the urgency for an effective

counterintelligence response abroad and domestically.

Overhead photography and sophisticated but remotely

operating equipment will not, and never will, tell us who the

Soviet, Bloc, and Cuban spies are. This inimical activity

originates abroad and is no respector of our organizational,

jurisdictional, or territorial distinctions. As we are pre-

sently organized in the United States, no one Federal agency

can hope to deal successfully with the growing threat alond.

This integrated, determined adversary can only he dealt with

together the operational

capabilities of all Federal agencies

invested with the problem.

I have been a

member now for 30 or more years of

one of the components invested with this job and my career has

ended by retirement. I contemplate the future in the statement

as well as the past and I want to say that as far as I know, the

component I have heen a member of CI staff, has engaged or

participated in no way in the domestic activities specified by

Hirsh in the New York Times, that is, in the Breakins,

physical audio surveillances and the other massive elements of

surveillance that he has charged.

With respect to the mail intercept program, I have

talked in detail with Mr. Weidner and I am prepared to discuss

that as well as anything else you have in mind.

MR. WEIDNER: Perhaps we should back up just a hit to

the time that you returned to the United States and joined

the CIA staff here. You have given us a biography that brings

us up to that point.

What position did you take in 1955 when you returned?'

MR. ROCCA: I became Chief of the Research and

Analysis Division, it eas called at that moment. It became a

group later on. It numbered at no time more than 35 or 36

"people and it was concerned in the main with the topics that

I have outlined in my biography. It represented an attempt to

bring to bear brain power on the problem, research, hard

research brain power on the problem of the identification,

neutralization and manipulation of Soviet agents and their

principals.

MR. WEIDNER: At that time was the counterintelli-

gence funcwion of the CIA just being established in a formal

sense?

MR. ROCCA: The question turns in a formal sense

there had been counterintelligence in OS$, it had been indepen-

dent under General Donovan, it had been headed by Jimmy Murphy,

it had its own cadre, it had its own ciphers, it was an

autonomous part of USS function, it was submerged as a function

to foreign intelligence during the SSU and following periods.

In other words, it became a subordinate part of what we call

foreign intelligence activities until late '54, early '55,

when it was finally broken out as a coordinate activity at the

staff level.

MR. WEIDNER: Was one of your early functions to

determine precisely what counterintelligence activities had

been going on up to that point that were not particularly

coordinated?

MR. ROCCA: Yes sir. One of our first jobs was to

study first of all how many people were doing counterintelligen

full time within our organization. We found the number to be

extremely small. As a matter of fact, they are still extremely

small and growing smaller.

MR. WHIDNER: Did Research and Analysis have any

operational activities at all?

MR. ROCCA: At that time it undertook no operational

activities except in direct dealings on an ad hoc basis with

people like defectors who had something to contribute directly

to the research impact.

MR. WEIDNER: What sort of dealings did you have with

them?

MR. ROCCA: As you know, by law we have the responsi

bility for resettlement of defectors and any number of Soviet

defectors, any number of incidents these people remained in

contact with us continuously and are handled as continuing

sources of information, in some instances compensated, in other

instances not.

MR. WEIDNER: Would the FBI have played a part in

this?

MR. ROCCA: FBI might or might not have played a

part. They have always participated in the continuing debrief-

ing of defectors.

For example, we have a number, the staff still

operates a number of these, I would say half a dozen of those.

The FBI sees on a continuing basis at least two of them. They

incoming Soviets, to try to pick up in these human sources who

have memories about that service people that they are still in

the Service and are coming into the country. So we are in

touch with the FBI.

MR. WEIDNER: This is activity within the United

States?

MR. ROCCA: This is activity within the United States

with respect to defectors.

MR. WEIDNER: We will return to other activities in

a more general sense. But you mentioned the mail intercept

of April 19G0.

MR. WEIDNER: How is that?

MR. ROCCA: This fact is registered and I was able

to confirm by simply looking. At that point I was cleared

for the reception of material..

this program was initiated back in '49, I think. Was it '52?

MR. ROCCA: He may have had a lapse.

MR. ROCCA: It was a very small flow of material and

none of it sticks in my mind at this time as outstanding in

importance to what we were doing in R&A. I have better

recollection for later pieces of information that concerned,

that is, for information in the '60's when we became very much

interested in the problem of disinformation - dez informatzia,

that is what the Soviets call strategic deception. This

information went, some of the coverage concerned one of our

specific targets who was an individual named Victor Louie and

on him we had as I recall from this material very good

MR. WEIDNER: You became Mr. Angleton's Deputy in

1969, is that correct?

MR. ROCCA: Yes. First of July I judge was the date.

MR. WEIDNER: Did you gain any further information

concerning the mail intercept program at that point?

MR. ROCCA: Not at that point. At that point in the

staff's development I became, Deputy, leaving the position as

Chief of Research and Analysis, where my Deputy succeeded in

my place. I took with me a good number of jobs that I had

already begun on the research side and there was created an

executive officer and it was through him that the direct

oversight was continued in the project. Now, what had happened

is, more than what I had stated to you the other day, in

becoming Deputy, I did not succeed to the job which the

previous deputies had, and there had been two, Mr. Horton, and

Mr. Hunt, had had which was simultaneously acting as Deputy

to Mr. Angleton's staff and Chief of Operations. I did not

succeed as Chief of Operations. Mr. Miler became Chief of

Operations. So an executive officer was added, Mr. Hubbard

at this time, and he took over the chore of direct oversight

of the project though I remained on the distrihution for

materials as they came in on a routine monthly basis indicating!

what had been covered in cryptic language, and I was in general'

aware of the project on that level until it was terminated, and

that was in '73, I judge.

MR. WEIDNER: Did there come a time when you had a

discussion with Mr. Karamessinas, who was the Deputy Director

of Plans, concerning the project?

MR. ROCCA: I did. At one time during this period

MR. WEIDNER: What period is that?

MR. ROCCA: 1971 is my best recollection. During Mr.

Angleton's absence, inasmuch as it was my function as Deputy

to act in his absence, there was some kind of a question that

had arisen that required the poesentation of an indication of

the results as they had accumulated in the recent past, for

him, and to the best of my recollection Mr. Hubbard and I went

together to present these elements of proudction and security

review. They were interested in how secure was the project

and so forth. And I presented these materials to Mr.

Karamessinas in written form, as I recall.

MR. WEIDNER: Was it Mr. Karamessinas' general mode

of operation to have annual or periodic reviews of projects

within his directorate?

at any other time that you can recall was there any question

raised as to the propriety, the legal propriety of the project?

dissemination point in 1955 or whenever. That was our relation

ship to it. The actual work was done by another component

outside of the seat of Government.

mechanics of the handling of the material.

MR. WEIDNER: But the processing of it, that is the

analysis, was done in headquarters in Washington?

MR. ROCCA: That is correct, sir.

MR. WEIDNER: And that was done by counterintelli-

gence?

MR. ROCCA: That was done by a very highly compart-

mented small unit of Russian language specialists who were set

up in a comintarea, a vaulted area, under every possible safe-

guard, and they treated this material in accordance with their

skills, that is they translated or summarized or otherwise

prepared it.

MR. WEIDNER: Was that vaulted area in the part of

the building where CI is located or was it in a separate area?

MR. ROCCA: It was in a separate area for most of the

time that the project existed, as far as I know. They may

have started in 1955-56 in that area, in that timeframe, on

the same floor, but very quickly thereafter moved to the 7th

floor into comint area where a vaulter area had been prepared.

MR. WEIDNER: Was there any particular reason for that

move, that you can recall?

MR. ROCCA: I could only justify it on the basis of

the security and the handling of the material. It was handled

as comint also.

MR. WEIDNER: Did he tell you why?

MR. ROCCA: The indication that he gave me was that

Mr. Schlesinger had agreed to go to the President to get a

top executive decision with respect to the contuance or

discontinuance of the program, that this issue had been raised

in a discussion between him, DI. Schlesinger and Mr. Colby,

before that; that DI. Schlesinger had agreed to take that

action, Mr. Colby, or someone was to talk with Cotter, or

someone, whoever it was.

MR. WEIDNER: Who was Cotter?

MR. ROCCA: As I understand it, he is the individual

on the Post Office side who was actually handling it, the

Post Office interest, and he refused to permit the time

necessary for Dr. Schlesinger to go to the President. The

thing therefore ended sumarily at his choice.

complete good faith. It may not be correct, he may well have

MR. WEIDNER: Were you told whether the impetus to

terminate the project had come from within the CIA or from

without?

MR. ROCCA:

No; I was not. I jusged that there had

been some difference with respect to the project inside as well

as out but I only know that by hearsay.

MR. WEIDNER: What difference?

MR. ROCCA: That the decision as to whether or not it

should be continued or terminated.

MR. WEIDNER: Did you play any part in the termina-

tion of the project, that is, once the decision was made to

terminate it?

MR. ROCCA: Yes, these decisions coincided with the

decisions made by DI. Schlesinger to compress personnel in the

Agency and as a consequence the first large hemorrage of per-

sonnel took place on the retirements that took place on 30

June 1973, and among them was the Executive Office.

MR. WEIDNER: And the Executive Officer is Mr.

pressure of the need of our comint people for additional space

on the top floor, and they wanted, in other words, to usefully

employ the space we occupied, we secured new vault space of

similar level of security, securely transferred all of the

material to the new vault space where it remains together with

its indices and appurtenances.

MR. ROCCA: The new vault space is within the CI

counterintelligence area?

MR. ROCCA: The new vault space is on the same £100r

but physically dislocated from CI. It is, however, an approved

security office vault which meets, inother words, all of the

minimum standards. We created it, it had to be built.

MR. WEIDNER: The personnel were reassigned, then?

MR. ROCCA: The personnel were reassigned to other

tasks.

MR. WEIDNER: If the Commission wanted to look at

the records of this project to determine the substance of it,

are those records still in existence and intact?

MR. ROCCA: They are totally intact.

MR. WEIDNER: In this vault, newly created vault?

would be welcome to examine them, both the vault and the

material, in its present status.

Angleton recently in interviews with members of the staff; is

that correct?

MR. ROCCA: Well, I read the attachment.

presented?

MR. ROCCA: Yes sir.

MR. BELIN: Is there anything in the attachment with

which you disagree?

MR. ROCCA: No sir. It seems to me like a perfectly

complete narrative, descriptive account, as far as I know.

COMMISSIONER REAGAN: This chart that you gave us

here, we have some difficulty identifying them. How do we

estimate the increase in the number of agents, foreign agents

they have?

MR. ROCCA: These are official personnel assigned

here, sir, you see, and within the official personnel that they

assigned here on l6th Street. There is an institution known

as the Resident Toura which comprises those that work for

State Department and for GRU, Soviet military intelligence,

so these charts reflect the growth of Soviet official presence

throughout the world and in the United States, delineates in

another line, a solid bar, what we know among them to be

security and military intelligence operatives, and then it

draws another line, which is an estimate, and it is a minimal

estimate, the 40 percent line, which we have come upon as the

result of the research that I have been doing for years, as

the minimal. And as you see we are falling behind in our

identifications both here and abroad, and very seriously

abroad.

MR. CONNOR: May I ask a question on this subject.

Based on your experience, was the substance of the

material that was obtained from these written communications

back and forth of value to the counterintelligence group?

MR. ROCCA: I consider it sir, mind you, I am talking

now completely as an individual who was not privy to the begin-

ning of it and did not get into it until 1960, and therefore,

to a large extent impressionable. It seems to me that for the

'50's and '60's this what may be called a source of strategic

importance for counterintelligence. AS to the extent that the

Soviets did not know it we had it. It was capable of bearing

indications that would have given us identifications not only of

legals but of illegals and of other interests that the Soviets

had that we could get in no other way and that I could only

compare it to the overhead photography which functioned at the

This taken together with the six or seven defectors

that ame out in the '50's, who gave us living examples and

identifications, and the three penetrations that we had going

in the '50's of the Soviets, they were Popov, and Penkovsky, and

Goyenevesk;, three people working inside those surfaces over a

period of time fron '53 to '61. We had the foundation of a

strategy response to the Soviet threat and all you have

to do is to read the '60's and you read the results because

at no time in the history of Soviet intelligence and counter-

intelligence have they been hit so hard as in the decade of

the '60's. We got Blake in '61. We got Philby in '63. We

got Pak, these are two UK fellows, Vassil, another UK one, in

'64. Pak in France in '64. Felfe, the Chief of German

Counterintelligence, West German, about the same time. There

are a number of NATO cases that grew out, all of them, of this

combination of what I call strategic CI weaponry. Defectors,

penetrations and unfortunately all of these penetrations were

compromised. Penkovsky was tried and shot, Popov was tried

and shot. Only one got away, and that is Goyenevsky.

So I would say that this was an extraordinary resourde

particularly in view of the way it was handled for counter-

intelligence. I can't go beyond that because, as I say, I

don't know where every distribution went to the Bureau, how

many went, how many reports went with the Bureau, you have that

data and can gauge it for yourself. To me it was part and

parcel of an advantage which was extraordinary and it hurts

me to talk about it now.

MR. GRISWOLD: What was the relation of this to the

defectors. I haven't found that connection.

MR. ROCCA: Well, a defector will talk about collec-

tion by true name and in some instances in this project, in

this material, we found that individual writing to people here,

and so by that kind of correlation of identification of names,

the project makes its contribution to an ongoing lead which

began with a defector. So that the idea of backing up

operations with research

involves using all of these tools

against the target.

That is a specific example that I can recall offhand.

COMMISSIONER CORBIN: You have given an example of

mail coming from USSR. What about mail originating in the

United States?

MR. ROCCA: As I say, the stuff I saw came fron the

USSR. I can't make anything out of the other at all because

I was not that close to it.

COMMISSIONER BELIN: Basically the defectors were

of prime importance?

MR. ROCCA: Absolutely gilt edge..

MR. ROCCA: This is another thing.

COMMISSIONER BELIN: And both of those were far more

substantial than the mail intercept program; isn't that true?

MR. ROCCA: I can't argue the merit really in that,

with that fineness of degree of detail because they were laid

to different -

COMMISSIONER BELIN: To follow through the question

Mr. Corbin asked, was there anything that you can specifically

remember that was gleaned from intercepting the mail of an

American citizen going to the Soviet Union?

MR. ROCCA: I have not that capability, not because

it doesn't exist, in fact I think there are some specific

examples cited in the report.

COMMISSIONER BELIN: In Mr. Angleton's report?

MR. ROCCA: Yes. But maybe other witnesses could

clarify that.

COMMISSIONER LEMINITZER: You don't know whether

it went to the FBI?

MR. ROCCA: I am sure the reports were shared with

the FBI. I am sure they were. Sir, what I don't know is in

response to Mr. Belin's question, how important it was, whether

they made any cases, that kind of thing.

I believe the project was established sometime in

1967. The record will show that. •

At that point you were sitll in RA; is that correct?

MR. ROCCA: That is right.

MR. WEIDNER: Were you aware that this particular

project was being established?

MR. ROCCA: I was aware of it when it was announced

in the regulation. It was not discussed with me before it was

announced, before the action was taken. I was not privy to

that kind of thing as Chief of Research and Analysis though

the very man chosen had spent sometime in Research and Analysis

working specifically on machine records and techniques which

was a matter of grave concern to him, and interest. He was

specifically interested in developing and perfecting the

techniques of ADP control over data. I recall him, Mr. Ober,

a fine officer, who spent sometime in RGA before he went down

to OPS, from whence he went into this unit.

COMMISSIONER GRISWOLD: Excuse me. What do you mean

when it was announced?

MR. ROCCA: I would say there was an actual announce-

ment by Karanessinas which said as of such and such a date a

unit has been created under the headship --

COMMISSIONER GRISWOLD. This was an internal announce-

No.

COMMISSIONER GRISWOLD: You mean '67?

MR. ROCCA: '67. I am sorry.

COMMISSIONER GRISWOLD: Thank you.

MR. WEIDNER: Mr. Ober was transferred out of RSA

at about that time, or was it before then?

MR. ROCCA:

Before then. Because he did a' :..::

transitional tour. I had nothing permanent for him to do in

R&A besides this work that he was doing. We have our own

machine, I had my own machine records, so he went to OpS as

referent, as we call it, as the OPS Supervisor for the Domestio

Operations Division.

MR. WEINNER: Was this program a part of the

Domestic Operations Division, do you know?

MR. ROCCA: No, I don't think so.

MR. ROCCA: I gained no greater knowledge because

it was absolutely compartmented and sat in another part of the

building. What I gained was the opportunity of administra-

tively seeing budget and travel accounts pertaining to Mr.

Ober's activity and his people's activity within the United

States.

MR. WEIDNER: Did he specify to any degree what those

activities were?

MR. ROCCA: I was never told what those activities

were. In fact, I am sure I would not have been even had I

asked because these were known as compartmented activities.

MR. ROCCA: He dealt with Mr. Karamessinas and Mr.

Helms on these matters. I would say that he was with us for

rations and quarters. This would be something that General

Leminitzer recognizes.

MR. WEIDNER: There seems to be a certain parallel

between the mail program and what I will call the dissident

program, that is, both seemed to have a chain of command, if

you want to call it that, somewhat out of the ordinary. Is

that a fair statement?

MR. ROCCA: Yes, I think that is probably a fair

statement and in both instances I think the differences pertain

to the sensitivity of the activity.

MR. WEIDNER: You never had any discussion with any-

one concerning the propriety of the dissident program?.

MR. ROCCA: No, I would never have thought of it as

being improper. The National Security Act in its provisions

with respect to limitations on our powers does not proscribe

that we live in another country in doing our operations and

my assumption had always been, and I have not seen any evidence

to the contrary, that Mr. Ober's activity, the activity of

this unit, at all times looked to fruits abroad, which is

precisely where we were supposed to operate.

MR. WEIDNER: You say that is your assumption. Do

you have any specific facts on which you would base that?

MR. ROCCA: I don't know Mr. Ober's operations.

He

had them because, as I say, I know the budgetary line-up of

the period and, therefore, I am sure you can get them from him

They were never explained to me under this need to know

principle.

One operation that I know is his, and maybe you

already know about it, is the penetration of Agee in Paris.

MR. WEIDNER: Perhaps you can tell us about that.

MR. ROCCA: Agee is a defector, an American intelli-

gence defector, as far as I am concerned, the only one we have

had, and he has just written a book that is going to be a

massive blow to the security and identity of our operations

in Latin America. It comes out in England. He was an

individual recruited in the late '50's, he operated in Latin

America in the '60's, and left us under what he himself called

very friendly circumstances in 1968 in Mexico City after his

personal affairs had become completely mucked up as a conse-

quence of the collapse of his marriage.

One of the final things he did was to write the

Director - this is again hearsay, I have not seen the letter,

but I believe my sources are good on it - a letter in which

he said no hard feelings, I will always he your principal

backer, and so forth. This is 1968. By 1971 we knew that he

had made two trips to Cuba. The origins of his ideological

conversion, whatever they might be, in Mexico City, after he

left us, presumably, he went to the University of Mexico, he

had, as I say, marital problems, another woman, whom he has

since left. I can't judge. But when he became by his action

a threat we only had to point out what the nature of that

threat was and to assess it. It is, I am told, that the

individual who succeeded in placing an agent within the zone of

confidence in Paris was Mr. Ober and this was one of his

operations, perfectly legitimate operations, as far as I am

concerned, because while it involved an American, I think,

maybe not maybe, it was in Latin American, but whatever, it

took place outside of this country and it presented us with

extremely useful information on the basis of which we could

assess the potential damage and intention of Agee, all of which

has come to pass.

MR. WEIDNER: You say this was a part of Ober's

special operations?

MR. ROCCA: As far as I know this is one of Agee's

operations and it should figure as one of the big cases.

MR. WEIDNER: I think you mean one of Ober's

operations?

MR. ROCCA:

Who did I say?

MR. WEIDNER: Agee's.

perhaps if anyone else has any questions on this one before I

do?

COMMISSIONER BELIN: I think we had better move

forward because we have one more witness.

MR. WEIDNER: Let me touch briefly on two other

subject matters which have come to light, at least in publicity,

and that is the liaison with local police forces and/or this

use of surveillance, breaking and entering, and the like,

within the United States.

Are you aware of any such activities by counter-

intelligence?

MR. ROCCA: No. And as far as police are concerned,

we have no relations with, we have never had any relations

with local police.

MR. WEIDNER: What about surveillance and the like?

MR. ROCCA: As far as I know the staff has never

done any surveillance of any kind. It has no capability to do

it or experts to do it, and we have a TO officer that was as

high as 202 and it is now down to 78, and each I think can be

if necessary summoned and questioned on the point. No breakins,

no surveillances, involving audio or physical activity, no

capabilities of wiretapping us. As I told you, we had a

specialized component that studied Soviet capabilities of

tapping our communications and we reported to the

community regularly on this.

MR. WEIDNER: ARe you presently aware of any CI

counterintelligence activities within the United States?

States outside of our headquarters building involves contacts

with the Washington area and in one major city, Eastern

Seaboard city, with defectors, Soviet defectors, and we have

contacts in this area with about

I am in personal

contact with some of these people at least on a weekly basis.

I have an officer in touch with them nearly on a daily basis.

The exception outside of the Seat of Government in this major

city is handled by anothr officer, former staffer, who is now

a hired annuitant. So these are defector contacts that we

have. These are highly specialized relations dealing with the

we are in direct touch with and to whom we move and from whom

Second, we have three consultants.

These are

private individuals who are experts in international communism,

or on disinformation, and there again the contact is direct.

We don't buy all of their time, we buy some of it, and those

are, in other words, consultants.

MR. WEIDNER: What sort of work. Can you give me an

example?

MR. ROCCA:

One of the topics, one of the consultants

is on tap for disinformation. I think we have contact with

the person who is probably the world's best authority on this

topic and we simply pay for a part of his time.

MR. GRAY: Would these be university professors and

similar people?

MR. ROCCA: They could have been formerly. This

person is not.

intentionally misleading misinformation released by the

Soviets?

that and the other, that is disinformation. No question it

would have been good to have recognized it then instead of now.

MR. WEIDNER: These consultants are U.S. citizens

under contract with the CIA; is that correct?

MR. ROCCA: Yes.

MR. WEIDNER: Do you have any other activities within

the United States in which counterintelligence is involved?

MR. ROCCA: We have a group of former agents.

These are people who work for us abroad that we keep under

appropriate cover here in Washington, official cover, working

on overt Soviet publication, that is things in the Russian

language, that they read and from which they extract information

dealing with Soviet intelligence and security matters. These

people have cover status in official buildings, they don't

figure as CIA. We pay them salaries and we interact with them-

I think that is the entire extent of it.

MR. WEIDNER: Do you have any people through whom

you maintain contact with other Soviets here in the United

States or abroad?

MR. ROCCA: Thes might be uncompensated contacts

who would really figure in the area of agents or double agents.

perfectly legitimate developmental activity.

what the Russians are doing in this country? Summarize what

they might be doing insofar as wiretapping or eavesdropping

on phone conversations?

MR. ROCCA: The Russians' sophistication in this area,

Mr. Belin, if you are interested in it, to the extent that you

seem to be, should be gained from someone who has expert

knowledge, and I think you ought to lay the question on for

NSA or someone, but it is phenominal. Their ability to cover

communications, including microwave, is astounding, ad I am a

layman in this, therefore, I am giving you what I have been told

in the course of briefings designed to keep me from using even

our own phone, a 351 number, even the 351 number. They have

the degree of sophistication of coming in and discriminating,

if you use a microwave; on that kind of a code. So this is an

extraordinary thing. It is going on right here in your back

yard.

MR. WEIDNER: If they want to they could get every

conversation coming out of Capitol Hil, or most conversations?

MR. ROCCA: That is too much. I haven't the

expertise to say that but I think if you are interested in it

get the experts.

And that is, what in your opinion caused the downward curve

MR. ROCCA: This is on the domestic chart?

CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER: Domestic. Then it has picked

up again but you show a lag there.

MR. ROCCA: That is right. This is the Bureau

record. It is directly related, sir, I believe to, there are

a number of explanations or points bearing on an explanstion.

One of them is it is directly related, I believe, to a 12

percent decline in Bureau manpower expenditure, which I am not

showing and which I am just giving you.

CHAIRMAN ROCKEFELLER: Is that true on a worldwide

basis, too?

MR. ROCCA: On a worldwide scale we have simply gone

off line in our counterintelligence work. I think MI.

Angleton said so in his statement that we are looking for

other things, we are not analyzing resident tourists, and our

gap is getting resident toura. That word means resident toura.

That is the word that means the organized intelligence and

security component within each Soviet Embassy or Consulate.

It has its own capabilities, its won ciphers and its own

operations.

We used to study those and we knew them everywhere

in the world back in the good old days, but along with manpower,

and we have been cut well into the bone, not just to the bone.

Aide-memoire for the Commission on

CIA Activities Within the United States

My preoccupation in this discussion grows out of the

conviction, based on operational facts, that hostile

espionage, political action, and counterintelligence--in

other words, uncontested expansion of Soviet intelligence

presence, successful recruitments, penetrations, and

disinformation by the Soviets and the Bloc services of

intelligence and security and other conspiratorial organs

will increase during the period

of detente.

The hard fact that KGB presence under Soviet official

cover has continued to increase throughout the world,

particularly in areas of direct concern to us like Western

Europe, Latin America, and Africa, makes it a matter of

urgency for CIA to devote a larger part of its energy to

that CI problem.

The same thing has happened in the U.s.;

the remedy, through the appropriate Federal agency or

agencies, will have to be the same.

The fact that the KGB/Bloc services, including Cubans,

have continued in the past two years to undertake develop-

mental relations and have made pitches to and significant

contacts with American officials overseas at an undiminished

rate, that work out to one or more per week, is the

complementary operational element that underlines the

urgency for an effective counterintelligence response:

abroad and domestically.

Overhead photography and sophisticated but remotely

operating equipment will NOT, and never will, tell us who the

Soviet, Bloc, and Cuban spies are. This inimical activity

originates abroad and is no respector of our organizational,

jurisdictional, or territorial distinctions. As we are

presently organized in the United States, no one Federal

agency can hope to deal successfully with the growing threat

alone. This integrated, determined adversary can only be

dealt with by coordinated, innovative, and aggressive defense

through counterintelligence and counterespionage operations

which bring together the operational capabilities of all

Federal agencies invested with the problem.
