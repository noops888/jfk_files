Attention: Mr. Robert I. Keuch

Deputy Assistant Attorney General

Criminal Division, Room 2113

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

It has come to my attention that SA Howell Lowe, after

his interview with members of my staff, indicated that he felt

certain questions posed to him concerning FBI sources and

informants and organized crime were improper.

While it is not generally our policy to do so, the interview

with SA Lowe was tape recorded.

You or your designated repre-

sentative may listen to that recording.

After reviewing the pertinent portions of the tape, I found

the questions regarding informants to be general in nature and

those regarding organized crime to be general and not involving

current cases.

Therefore, I have concluded that the questions

were consistent with the memorandum of understanding between your

office and the Committee.

If your records reflect a different line of questioning,

please bring that to my attention so that we might discuss your

interpretation.

very truly yours,

Re HSCA request dated March 27, 1978.

The following is a partial transcript of the HSCA

Interview of SA Howell S. Lowe, Memphis Office, on April 19,

1978, which was taped by the Committee.

The portion of the

interview below occurs approximately between the twenty-first

and twenty-fourth minutes of the interview, and includes an

obvious interruption in the recording of that interview.

HSCA "During the period 1967 through the assassination

do you recall having any sources within...'

SA LOWE

"I don't discuss sources."

HSCA

• "Oh, well, I understand that the instructions you

receive from the Legal Unit of the FBI...

SA LOWe

"I haven't talked to them."

HSCA says not to discuss specific names but the fact

that you had or did not have, I understand, if I

understand the ground rules, a fair game."

SA LOWE

"Well I ah, I unfortunately

with the late airplane this

morning have not talked to the Legal People, but I ah,

and I'm not interested particularly in talking to

them, they were supposed to call me two days ago, that

is their problem not mine. Ah, but I would not discuss

ny sources, or our sources,

WASHINGTON, D.C. 20515

July 5, 1978

:

The Honorable Griffin B. Bell

Attorney General of the United States

Department of Justice

Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. Attorney General:

In connection with the Committee's investigation into

the circumstances surrounding the death of Di. Martin Luther

King, JI., I write

to request that you make certain fiela

office informant files available to the Committee so that

serious allegations involving the Federal Bureau of Inves-

tigation and the death of Dr. King may be resolved. The

Committee has already had access to the relevant Bureau

personnel, and it has conducted extensive interviews among li

those who

may also be subjects of this aspect of the Com-(il

mittee's investigation.

The focus of the Committee's

effort now is to determine if the written record supports

or refutes

the oral testimony on the relevant questions.

These

files have been denied to the Committee by the Director

of the Bureau by letter dated June 11, 1978, with the con-

currence of the Criminal Division.

I write this letter to

ask that you give your personal attention to resolving this

serious

matter.

On October 7, 1977, you and I signed the Memorandum

of Understanding between the

mittee. As you will recall, ilgent and the Select com-

intended that the

Memorandum should cover what materials the Department of

(I.A.C.).

Justice would release to the formittees 17290 -19941

in 1968. The files were to be examined in a form in which

only the identity of the informants had been exercised from

them.

The letter also expressly noted the "Committee…..

reserves the right to request...the identity of all Invader

informants during 1968 should the sanitized files and agent

interviews be inconclusive on the issues to be resolved by

the Committee."

(See I.B. (1))

During the week of May 14, 1978, the Bureau, in partial

response to the April 12th request, permitted only Professor

Blakey to review the duly excised FBI Headquarters informant

files.

The staff of the Committee was denied access to the

files. Professor Blakey agreed to this form of limited access,

reserving the right to insist that the terms of the Memorandum.

of Understanding be complied with.

Letter dated May 23, 1978, the Committee then

requested "that the Memphis Field Office files for these

same informants be prepared for access by the staff."

Headquarters files contained basically administrative data;

it was felt that the Field Office file might be more en-

lightening.

The letter also observed, "While the Committee

feels that the procedure by which... (Professor Blakey) was

permitted access to the first set

of files was unacceptable

and contrary to the Memorandum of Understanding, pending

further discussions to arrange to broaden access, this pro-

cedure may again be utilized."

It should be clearly understood that the Committee's

request for these files, as well

as the other informant

files, is predicated on the precise language of the Memo-

randum of Understanding.

Section I.B. (2) of the Memorandum sets out the

"Specific Rules"

by which access to materials may be ob-

tained.

by hich

Section I.B. (2), in pertinent part, provides:

Where. requested materials reveal the

identity of FBI sources who are or were

informants...The D(epartment) of J(ustice)

will appropriately sanitize, including ex-

cising, if necessary, information identifying

such operations, sources or informants. (Emphasis

added. )

The Honorabl

Under I.B. (2), the only matter at issue is the terms

of access.

Denial of access is not contemplated. B(2)

clearly allows

access to the files at issue, subject only

to proper sanitization. Nothing else is asked for here.

The Committee is fully cognizant of the issues raised

by the Bureau in its letter of June 13, 1978, in response

to our request. It is, of course, recognized that a measure

of confidence in the Bureau's informant program would, in

fact, be eroded should it become general knowledge that

the FBI identified its informants in anything but extra-

ordinary circumstances, where, under the prevailing view,

they must be identified.

See Roviaro v. United States,

353 U.S. 53 (1957). Nevertheless, all this is premature;

the Committee has not requested, as yet, that the identity

of these informants be revealed.

All that is requested is

access to the files, in order that serious allegations

involving the informants and the Bureau be resolved.

The Director's letter of June 13, 1978, offers instead

of access to the relevant files, sworn affadavits denying

the Bureau's informants

acted as "agents provacateurs".

Committee feels that this procedure for resolving this

would be unacceptable.

As you know, with respect to the King

investigation the Committee is, in effect, performing for

death of Dr. King the same function that the Warren Commission

performed for the death of President Kennedy.

One of the most

frequent criticisms of the Warren Commission is that in at-

tempting to resolve the issue of whether or not Lee Harvey

Oswald was an FBI informant, the Commission accepted sworn

affadavits from the Bureau.

The Committee feels, therefore,

that it is unacceptable in this instance merely to rely on

sworn denials without an opportunity to examine and cross

documents.

the American people if it is to achieve its goals. Conse-

vector and command the cont conce of

as the Director suggests, that this issue be resolved by the

taking of affadavits from the Bureau.

After noting that the allegation that the Bureau or

persons employed by it instigated violence is not new, the

access to the files, referring to

In support of that assertion,

the Committee is told that "The Memphis Office advised that

these informants did not advocate nor take part in the

planning of any riot."

Next, our attention is drawn to the

Department of Justice Task Force's conclusion, stated in two

sentences of their report.

Н 55003. DocId: 32989736

The Honorable

Griffin B. Bell

"There is no evidence that the activities

of these informants related directly to

DI. King.

Moreover, there is no evidence

that would suggest that these informants

were connected in any way to the assassina-

tion of Dr. King.

(HQ 134-11867; 170-1841;

170-1922; 170-2530, and 157-4885). "

From the Committee's perspective, this "evidence" is

hardly overwhelming.

But that is largely beside the point.

Without access to this evidence, it cannot be evaluated.

Mere denials and conclusions cannot be accepted in lieu of

records and sworn testimony. The Committee has completed

the compilation of an oral record of the events that tran-

spired in Memphis during March and April, 1968.

This record

consists of interview notes, testimony under oath before the

Committee, and witness depositions.

It is now imperative

that these witnesses'

current recollections be compared with

the contemporaneous written record, particularly that con-

tained in the relevant informant files.

Throughout the effort to resolve this issue, the Com-

mittee has attempted to move with restraint. It was not until

our field interviews with former members of the Invaders and

people present in Memphis at the time of the March 28, 1968

march revealed: 1) that the Invaders were in fact a proximate

that the Invader followers who caused the violence were paid

FBI operatives that we requested access to any informant files.

By that time, the Committee had reviewed the Sanitation

Strike, Invaders,

King and Southern Charter Leadership Con-

ference files.

It had also reviewed the Memphis Police

Department files, and it had interviewed their undercover

operative within

the Invader organization.

The Committee had initially hoped that the answers it

sought would be contained in the Headquarters files.

They

are, as noted above, largely administrative, containing only

general information on informant reliability, payment of fees,

and justification for continuing the informant's status. They

do not contain agent instructions; they do not reflect in

detail the working

relationship between agents and informants.

From the Committee's perspective, therefore, the information

contained in the Headquarter files proved inadequate. Sub-

sequent interviews with current and former agents have also

Toyeeled thand the Memphie

the Memphis Field Office had prior know-

Ledge of impending violence (a fact memorialized in FBI

documents) and 2)

members of the Invaders were observed by

agents of the FBI exhorting the crowd and readying weapons

from signposts (a fact later testified to under oath by

these agents.) Professor Blakey's review of the files

revealed that at least one informant subseguently joined

a more violence-prone organization. You can see, therefore,

the reasons why access to the files, duly excised, is es-

sential.

I feel that this is a matter that can best be resolved

by our discussing the issues involved. Since the Select

Committee's investigation is in its last stage - our public

hearings will begin in August - I suggest that you give me

a call this week

and we can meet as soon as possible to dis-

cuss this matter.

although the Section handled the supervision of the

bulk of security investigations of individuals other

Sections did supervise the investigations of a number

of top leaders of domestic organizations and individuals

in the Espionage and/or Foreign Intelligence field.

They asked about the routing of memoranda and handling

of tickler copies within the DID.

In this connection they

then asked concerning

the investigation of Dr. Martin Luther King and the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). In

this connection they had a number of copies of memoranda

from F. J. Baumgardner to W. C. Sullivan with tickler

copies designated to a number of people including J. F.

Bland (JFB). They wanted to know if the SCS supervised

the above investigations and what was the significance

of the tickler copy designated to JFB. They were advised

to the best of my memory the 2 investigations were

never supervised by the Scs while I was Section Chief.

That organizations were supervised by the Internal

Security Section and usually the top function areas

of the organizations were supervised with the organizations.

They were advised that the tickler designation of

the FJB memos' was for information purposes. That

assignments of cases in the SCS were by office covering

a person's residence and that the tickler would normally

be routed to the Agent handling the office covering

Dr. King's residence.

They desired to know if the

memos would be routed through for approval by those

shown as getting ticklers such as JFB and they were

advised that would not normally be the practice - That

It could happen but there would need to be more of

a reason for the routing than just for information.

Mr. McHargh then asked regarding my transfer to

Crime Records Division (CRD). He asked concerning

who was Ass't Director then - if Tom Bishop was - when

was Mr. Wick - Mr. De Loach in the Division - The

organization of the Division -

What was handled particularly was Congressional Liaison

and contact with the press handled by the CRD.

He

asked if I had passed

any infor-mation to the

press

to discredit Dr. King.

I advised him that I had no

recollection of

passing any information to discredit

Dr. King to the press.

He asked if I had knowledge

of a 35 page document

prepared under the counter-intelligence

program attacking Dr. King and prepared in such a fashion

as to be given out to the press.

I told him I had

no recollection of seeing such a document or giving

such a document to the press. He asked if I know whether

" HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ASSASSINATIONS

'INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA JAMES F. BLAND

Tom Bishop gave such a document to the press.

I told

him I could not answer for Bishop but that I had no

such knowledge.

Mr. McHargh made the statement that

it was well documented that the FBI and Mr. Hoover

had an active roll in trying to discredit Dr. King.

Mr. McHargh had a copy of a memo from Bishop to

De Loach with my initials (JFB). The memo was written

rior to Dr. Kings' death in April, 1960, and reierrec

to a memo from W. C. Sullivan to Mr. De Loach recommending

DID prepare material showing the communist connections

of Dr. King for dissemination to the press. The memo

then set forth the receipt of a clipping from a Birmingham

paper of an article by a James Free and stated that

it set forth very well the communist connections of

Dr. King.

Action of the memo was for information.

The memo did not say - but apparently the clipping

was sent in by the Birmingham Office. He asked if

I recalled this memo.

I advised him

• I had no recollection

of the memo - however, since my initials were on the

memo it was obviously written by me.

The memo said

nothing about the DID material having been disseminated

to the press but it did show an interest in exposing

Dr. King's communist connections and that James Free

had written such an article.

They asked about the Special Correspondence List

maintained by the FBI. Was it for people only friendly

with the FBI and who were given information not available

to others - was it a list used by Mr. Hoover to reward

friends.

He was advised that to my recollection it

was not a secret list for outsiders to receive unauthorized

information. - That people were on the list who had

indicated an interest in receiving FBI releases and

publications of all types, on a continuing basis, including

annual reports, press releases, law enforcement bulletins,

He asked if people such as Mr. Tolson, Mr. Belmont,

and Mr. De Loach kept separate files. He was advised

that to my knowledge they might receive tickler copies

of memoranda addressed to them in the regular course

of business, but that I have no recollection of their

keeping separate files.

* INTERVIEW OF FORMER SA JAMES F. BLAND

He asked if I knew of the Society of Former Special

Agents.

I said I did that I was a member. Also asked

if I knew if Iir. Hoover asked former Agents to work

on cases for the FBI. I told him

1 that I didn't quite

understand what he meant but that I had no personal

knowledge of such. That the Society is a social group

but does fully support the FBI and if called upon would

do its best to assist the FBI. - that the society is

now collecting funds to support the legal defense of

former Agents.

Mr. McHargh said he had a copy of a memo showing

there was an effort by the FBI and Mr. Hoover to prevent

Dr. King's birthday from becoming a national holiday -

That the memo showed Mr. Hoover's approval to contact

Congressmen in this regard. He asked if I had knowledge

of this.

I told him I probably had such knowledge

but didn't know when I acquired it.

Mr. McHargh asked me if while I was in the Crime

Records

• Division did I disseminate to the press confiden

tial information on Subversive matters normally not

disseminated outside the Bureau.

He was advised that

I had no such recollection of engaging in such activity.

He said they were interviewing a number of people

and he did not think it would be necessary to call

me again for clarification but he took my address and

phone number.

MI. HOWARD C. KENNEDY resides at 55 Harneywold Drive,

Ferguson, Missouri 63136, residence telephone number (314)

521-8221.

MI. KENNEDY is presently self-employed as a private

investigator and polygraph examiner.

He retired fron FBI service

on 2/28/77.

Prior to his retirement he was assigned to the

St. Iouis Division of the FBI from 1954 to the date of his

retirement.

During 1974 he was assigned to general criminal

"atters and worked as a Special Agent under the supervision of

Field supervisor ROBERT I. BENDER.

MI. KENNEDY was interviewed at the St. Louis FBI Office,

at which place he voluntarily appeared.

MI. KENNEDY was exhibited sufficient portions of a closed

St. Louis file 137-16185 to enable him to identify it as a matter

which was at one time assigned to him while he was an FBI Agent.

The file in this instance pertains to one RICHARD I. O'HARA,

a fornor informant of the St. Louis Division of the FBI.

The

attention of Mi. KENNEDY was directed to a memorandum in this .

file dated 3/19/74 from him to the SAC, St. Louis.

This menorandum

is identified as serial 5 of the file.

He was permitted to read

this memorandum in order to refresh his memory concerning its

contents. KENNEDY related that from his review of this memorandum

it reflects the results of a contact by him with @'HARA at which

time O'TARA furnished him several pieces of information.

KIty's attention was further directed to paragraph 2, page 3

oi the memorandum, which paragraph begins "During the

• fall of

1973 ...," and ending with "... $20,000 to kill KING."

MT, KENNEDY stated that upon having his nemory refreshed

by reading the above memorandum, he vaguely recalls receiving

the information.

He has no recollection, however, of having

disseminated the information contained in the above-cited

paragraph or that the information was otherise actea upon.

He can cite no reason for such failure other than inadvertence.

To the best of his recollection, no action was, in fact, taken

cunuerning the information about MARTIN IUTHER RING, as contained

in the memorandum, and he shared this information with no

other personnel in the office.

MI. KENNEDY was unable to provide an evaluation of the

information and he is sure that no other information concerning

KING was furnished to him by O'HARA.

He can make no comment

with

regard to the credibility of the information at this late

date.

He does not believe, however, that credibility of either

O'FARA OI BYERS entered into any decision or lack of decision

with regard to dissemination of the information conceming RIG.

KENNEDY recalls, however, from his many years of service

in the FBI at St. Louis that

RUSSELL BYERS was a well-known

fence.

KENNEDY reiterated that he has no idea or reason for the

failure to disseminate the information contained in paragraph

2 of page 3 of the cited memorandum as it relates to MARTIN

LUTHER KING.

He noted that there is nothing written on the

memorandum to indicate such dissemination was made or action

taken otherwise.

MI. KENNEDY's attention was further directed to a hand-

written notation on the first page of the memorandum which

states, "Notify locals of info re killing." He identifies

this notation as being in the handwriting of his former Supervisor,

ROBERT I. BENDER. Upon reading the memorandum in detail, it

was KENNEDY's conclusion that this handwritten notation did

not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied

to an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities

appearing on page 2 of the memorandum.

At the conclusion of interview, Mr. KENNEDY stated that

in retrospect, the information concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING

in the memorandum of 3/19/74 should have been acted upon.

He did note that there is a handwritten notation in his hand-

writing on page l of the memorandum which states,

"Notify locals

of info re killing." Upon reading the memorandum in detail,

it was BENDER's conclusion that this handwritten notation did

not apply to the above-cited paragraph but, instead, applied to

an unrelated matter of interest to local authorities appearing

on page 2 of the memorandum.

MI. BENDER stated that he has absolutely no recollection

or acted upon. He can only assume that such failure was through

inadvertence.

not acting on it.

BENDER related, however, that because of

his long association with the FBI in St. Louis, he does recall

an individual by the name of RUSSELL BYERS as a

• well-known

thief and fence.

At the conclusion of interview, MI. BENDER stated that in

retrospect and in light of today's climate, the information

concerning MARTIN LUTHER KING in the memorandum of 3/19/74

should have been acted upon.

"There is little question but what the administration

will ask Congress for

legislation to enforce the

outlawing of 'discrimination'

so-called.

But,

even such an attempt to clothe this proposed

¡lagrant invasion of the rights of private property

does

not detract from

its obvious unconstitutional

aspect.

"I must point out that I see a senseless contradic-

tion in fighting to preserve liberty in Viet Nam

while we are in danger of having that very liberty

undermined by such proposals at home.

"Do the American people sanction such attempts to

jeopardize our sight of private property as is

proposed in this instance?

The voters of California:

of Detroit and Akron answered overwhelmingly in the

negative when they had

an opportunity to express

themselves recently...I do so now!

"As my elected representative in Congress I urge

you to fight the introduction of such

a proposal

when it appears, to oppose it in committee, to

speak against it on the floor and finally to vote

against it when the roll is called.

In so doing

your name shall be blessed by untold generations of

liberty loving American citizens.

The following investigation was conducted by

SA ROWEN B. AYERS:

At Columbia, Missouri:

On January

*, 1966,

Mr. ERIC ENGBERG, News

Director, Radio Station KFRU,

Columbia, Missouri,

associated

with the Columbia Tribune, a daily newspaper, advised he

was the source of an article appearing in the Tribune on

November 12, 1965, referring to the White Citizens Council.

He said he picked

up some information in the St. Louis Press

about November il, 1965, indicating an attempt to establish

a White Citizens Council in various

Missouri cities.

said

he telephonically. contacted Rev.W. C.. BARLOW, St. LOUIS,

Missouri. Mr. BARLOW told him his organization had only

one contact in Columbia, Missouri, and that was a

student by

the name of TOM LACHS.

Mr. ENGBERG said he directed JAMES PIRNER, Of his

staff, to interview lACHS, and he did.

He said the interview

resulted in the article appearing in the iribune on

November 12, 1965.

He said he has been in continuous

contact

with LACHS since then, and LACHS has contacted him on

frequent occasions.

He said so

far LACHS has one other person

who might be interested in establishing a chapter at Columbia,

Missouri, but nothing has been done since November 11, 1965.

Mr. ENGBERG said he plans on contacting LACHS

further to determine what progress is being made in

connection with this organization.

Mr. ENGBERG said,

judging from his conversations with LACHS, he would

say

that LAcHs is seeking publicity. He said

he can discover

no progress being made to form a

White Citizens Council in

Columbia, Missouri.

He said he is sure LACHS will keep

him

informed of any establishment of a chapter or activity

on the part of the group if such can be formed.

He said

he would, in turn,

keep the FBI posted.

On February 8, 1966, Mr. ENGBERG further advised

that LACHS has dropped out of

school, and on a recent contact

with ENGBERG, claimed he had about 20 members interested in

the formulation of a White Citizens Council at Columbias

Missouri. However, Ms. ENGBERG said he did not believe

is true and he has attempted to determine the identities of

some of these persons

without success.

On February 28, 1966, Mr.

& ENGBERG

said he has

been unable to develop any further information regarding

the formation of a White Citizens Council In Columbia,

Missouri. He noted that on February 13, 1966, there

waS

a meeting of various political factions, including extremists

of both the "right" and "left", sponsored by St. Luke's

Methodist Church, and the White Citizens Council was

represented. He

believed the representative was from

St. Louis.

An article

in the Columbia Missourian,

a daily

Columbia,

newspapers

on February 14, 1966, reflected

a Miss GERYL DEAN,

no other identifications

attended the

meeting mentioned above as representative of the White

Citizens Council.

She was reported to have commented at

the meeting that the Council was

"not anti-Negro,. but anti-

integration. "

She said integration produces intermarriage

and a

"consequent weakening of both races."

"Someone said they had counted 200 (two hundred)

marchers in the line I was in.

Later more joined

the line, but i did not hear the count of these.

There were more marchers on the other side of the

church, walking down Gibson, but I did not hear how

many of these there were.

From the one who gave out

the count of the 200, said there were about eighty

young people from the Washington University and the

ACTION group had their members there.

Someone said

members from the CORE group were there and the NAACP

had members there.

At first we had been told when

we joined the march, it would go on till 8 p.m. I

had

called Walker to ask if he was going down, and did

he have a place for me in the car. He said he did

and would be after me.

He got to my home at 6 p.m.

and

picked me up and picked up Lutz and Ballard. He

had

two young girls with him and took these out to

the march and later to the party. I do not know who

these young girls were. Both looked to be no older

than fifteen years old

and colored. They were not

sisters, but knew each other well.

"When we arrived, the march was going on by the uni-

versity students. Several had bands around their

arms, and acted as lieutenants and

lookout or spotters

for trouble, and kept the line moving.

They made room

for us in the line and we began to march.

When the time

came to stop, word came down through the line that they

wanted us to continue till eight thirty, they said. Some

one asked why.

They said they had reason for this

and

said they had

heard some people wanted to go into the

meeting,

but they were preventing this. Word also came

down that two of the marchers were arrested, but no one

knew who these were till later on in the evening.

I

do not know who this Perry is. I have never met him,

that I know of. Scales, when

he arrived, came up to

"where I had

stepped out of the line to take a breather,

and asked it Landberg was there, and I told him i had

seen him not long ago, standing

talking to one of the

spotters.

He asked if I had seen Perry.

I told Scales

I did not know who Perry was

and asked him if this

fellow was to have been here. He said yes. I told

hin to talk to Percy Green; that he may know. After

the march broke up:

the ones I was with went out and

picked up the Waxman girl and went to the party. "
