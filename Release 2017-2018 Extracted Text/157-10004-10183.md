ODENY

SAYS THEIR FOLLOW-UP INVESTIGATION OF OSWALD'S

ACTIVITIES HAS PRODUCED "REALIABLE INDICATIONS" THAT HE WASH IN

NEW ORLEANS ON 19 SEPTEMBER 1963 REPEAT 19 SEPTIMEER 1953• THIS;

COUPLED WITH EARLIER EVIDENCE THAT HE WAS IN NEW ORLEANS APPLYING

FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE ON 17 SEPTEMBER 1963, MEANS OSWALD

WOULD HAVE HAD TO FLY TO MEXICO AND BACK TETWEEN 17 AND 19 SEPTEMBER

IN ORDER TO BE AT THE CUBAN EMEASSY GETTING HIS PAY OFF, AS ALVARADO

CLAIMS, ON 18 SEPT.

2= WITH THIS ADDED INFO, BELIEVE MEXI CAN CONFIDENTLY REGARD

ALVARADO AS FABRICATOR AND TAILOR INTERROGATION ACCORDINGLY.

PERHAPS HE MIGHT RESPOND TO THE SUGGESTION THAT HE HAS BEEN

HAVING DELUSIONS AND NEEDS PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT•
