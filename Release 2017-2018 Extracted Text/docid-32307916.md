DESIMONE, brother of deceased La Cosa Nostra

It was agreed fooled note BOSS FeN

DESIMONE, and relate to him the details of source's previous

contacts with JOSEPH CIVELLO Of Dallas concerning the

Teamsters Pension Fund Loan for the purpose of purchasing

the Riviera Hotel, Las Vegas and the involvement of NICK

CIVELLA of Kansas City. Source would attempt to induce

DESIMONE to go to Dallas to determine from JOE CIVELLO why

CIVELLO was no longer interested.

Source did contact Dr. DESIMONE on the same day

and requested DESIMONE to come to source's office, which he

did. Source explained the situation and DESIMONE

said that

... JOE

CIVELLO's cousin is in Los Angeles and he talks to him

all the time.

Dr. DESIMONE said he will immediately go to

Dallas to contact JOE CIVELLO to find out why CIVELLO has

taken this non-interested position in helping source obtain

the loan.

Because source had previously told Dr. DESIMONE

that he would receive his brother FRANK's share, DESIMONE

is acting in his own interest to assure that there is a

share to receive.

Source will advise the results of DESIMONE'S

meeting with CIVELLO.
