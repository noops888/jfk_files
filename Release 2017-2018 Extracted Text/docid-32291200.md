¡AL

Referenced Bureau letter furnished copy of

Department letter dated 11/16/65 requesting investigation

of matter originally set out in referenced Miami LHM of

9/22/65. Based on information developed to date it appears

likely that the information furnished by MM 974-S which

was set out in that LHM, prepared under the MRR caption

in view of the previous

association of SANTIAGO ALVAREZ

with the MRR, is related to the attack which took place

on 11/14/65.

There is no indication to date of

involvement by the MRR in this attack. Both DIAZ and IZA

declined to implicate ALVAREZ claiming that he is "semi-

retired" from revolutionary activity. Efforts are being

nade to arrange interviews with both ALVAReL and his sol

and results will be submitted promptly thereafter (Ofa

MM T-1 is MM 974-S.

The informant is attempting

co ascertain additional details which will assist in fully

identifying the unknown participants.(Kim

Information set forth in the enclosed LHM from

DIAZ and IZA has been included in FD-302s being maintained

in Miami file 105-8280. Mms
