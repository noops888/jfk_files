any material considered

assassination records must be made available to the National

Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in their original

form.

The JFKARCA defines how the FBI may postpone certain

information, but the originals are still sent to the NARA, to be

maintained

until the year 2017 when they are to be opened in

full.

Therefore, the files will not be returned to your Field

Office. Since the originals will be sent to the NARA, copies of

the files should be made for record purposes prior to their

shipment to FBIHQ. All files should be received at FBIHQ no

later than C.O.B.

07/11/97.

If you have any questions, you may call Brian J. Fields

(202) 324-9535.
