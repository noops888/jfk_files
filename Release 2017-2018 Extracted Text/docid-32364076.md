PIMORANDIM FOR: Assistant Deputy Director, Plans

FROM:

Acting Chief, SR DivIsionS

SUBJECT:

Contact of lee OSVALD with a member of Soviet KGB

Assassination Department

According to an intercepted phone call in Mexico City, Lee OSWALD

was at the Soviet imbassy there on 28 September 1963 and spoke with the

Consul, Valeriy Vladimirovich KOSTIKOV.

\This was learned wien OSWALD called

the soviet Embassy on l October, Identifying himself by name and speaking

brosen russian, stating the above and asking the guard who answered the phone

wether there weddin thin aid ste the the telesten to er test, not

received. (MEXI 6453, 9 October 1953) The FBI laison

officer, Mr. Pappich, told me on 23 November that the Bureau has reason to

believe that OSHAID's visit was to get Soviet support for a U.s. passport or

visa matter (perhaps the new passport mentioned in the press articles

2.

KOSTIKOV is an Identified kaR aflicer.

He was a case officer in an

operation waich is evidently sponsored by the KGB'E 1301 Department Gasponsible

for sabotage ant assasstation): Wais operation, which is controlled by the

FBI under the cryptonym TUMBLEWEED, involved a German-national resident of

Delahona who was recruited in Emage, and mat this year sich KOSTKOu in Mexico

City and shortly thereafter with a known 13th Department officer. Ole& BRYKIN,

in New York. The instructions given TUMBLEWED by the two officers, (pinpointing

objectives for sabotagel and the circumstances of their involvement in the case,

left no doust that both of then were working for the same KGB component, the

13th.

3. Of course it is not usual for a KGB agent on a sensitive mission to

have such overt contact with & Soviet Embassy. However, Je have top secret

Soviet Intelligence documents, describing Military Intelligence doctrine, which

show that very impartant agents can be met in official installations using as

cover for their presence there some sort of open business:

L. BEKRINEV, In a top secret lecture to a Soviet Military Intelligence course

at Military-Diplomatic Academy, 1960, said,

"Case officers no use as cover, let us say, the Soviet Trade

Representation, TASS or Soviniorburo, can use their cover

assignuents as backstopping for non-clandestine meetings with

certain agents raose particular activities officially associate

them with the previously mentioned Soviet Institutions However,

such non-clandestine meetings within a legal residency should be

restatetedito a minimum both as to place and times. Meetings o

his type should be carried out only in exceptional cases with

tester and reliable agents in order ta avaid pratocation by che

10091

counterintelligence service against the soviem installation

being used as cover. such meetings are held as a rule ti the work

offices of the case officer or of the agent during working hours.

It Is necessary that such meetings be conducted naturally, that

they do not attract the attention of outsiders, and that the receipt

and transmittal of intelligence matters, properly camouflaged, be

carried out discreetly. In setting up such meetings, measures against

tapping must be taken.

One must bear in mind that a meeting with

persons

outside official premises and during non-working hours usually

signifies & relationship

between the two parties that is above and.

"

beyond official matters.

ALSO,

such contact in official installations.maj.becaused.by.the agents own

carelessness.

Again Admiral BEKRENEV speaks:

"Some agents, because of inexperience or because of deliberate

violatoro the rakey of security through pecullar personal

rashnass,.. approached our case officers at places not stipulated

as operational meeting sites, others terephoned the case officer

his soviet instarration and discussed personal contact arrangements,

white others still showed up personally at the sortet Instartation in

order to contact the

case officer

I called the above

connectioes to the attention of Mr. Pappich by

phone to his FBI office at 1030 hours on 23 November.
