possibility of FRANK JOHN VELOTTA, FBI No. 313 999 C,

presently residing in the Los Angeles Division, having

access to YOUNGNAP money, as set out in Los Angeles

teletype to Bureau 7/3/67.

Informant stated VELOTTA last visited him 6/27/67,

accompanied by RAYMOND FERRITTO. Identified FERRITTO as a

burglar from Erle, Pennsylvania and an associate of VELOTTA.

Stated that VELOPIA and FERRITTO drove from Los Angeles area

to San Diego in FERRITTO's 1966, gray Mercury station wagon

(California license SJC 005), because VELOTTA's 1965, black

Cadillac recently caught fire and burned. VELOTTA collected

$1,500 insurance money rather than have car repaired.

Intormant was of the impression VELOTTA in need of money at

this time and specializes in burglaries only. Stated

VELOTTA owns a ten-unit apartment house in the greater

believes he purchased the apartment house and possibly some

private homes as an investment with other associates.

Intormant belleved two of these assoclates were RAY FERRITTO

and JULIUS PETRO.

Informant stated VELOTTA 1s an expert burglar

operacing wich artierent noodlums out or che clevelane area.

Informant believed RAY FERRITTO and ALBERT "Tubby" FIGER

were two of the persons with whom he operates. Informant was

very doubtful that VELOTTA would ever become involved in a

crime or violence such as kidnaping or the bomb murder or

GERALD JOSEPH COVELLI at Encino, California on 0/10/07•

Informant emphasized that VELOTTA has been contacting

him in San Diego occasionally for the past few months to

discuss with him his efforts to keep from being extradited

would have contacts through SANTO TRAFFICANTE, LCN boss in

Florida, to pay off some public officials in order to kill

excradition process.

Informant also speculated that

VELOTTA and JULIUS PETRO have been contacting him to

develop friendship, with a hope of sometime being invited

to join LON.

Informant advised that at his last meeting

VELOTTA claimed he had received information through his

contacts in Cleveland that AL POLIZZI could help him.

Informant identified AL POLIZZI aS ALFRED POLIZZI OL

Coral Gables, Florida, former LCN boss in Cleveland, now

living in Coral Gables, Florida and a retired millionaire.

VELOTTA Claimed to the

informant that POLIZZI had sent

word back to Cleveland that 1f VELOTTA was willing to

return voluntarily to Florida and enter a guilty plea to

the local burglary charge outstanding against VELOTTA, he

would not serve more than six months in jail.

In accordance with Los Angeles celetype setting

forth VELOTTA as a possible suspect in YOUNGNAP, the informant

was questioned further regarding any conversations he had

Informant could not recall VELOTTA ever

mentioning RONALDDAVID CARABBIA or his brothers, ORLANDO

and CHARLES CARABBIA, Cleveland hoodlums. He could not

recall VELOTTA mentioning Cleveland fence TONY BUFFA.

Informant had no information connecting VELOLLA wich

burglary of drugs valued at $429,575 at Franklin Park,

Illinois on 5/22/67 from E. R. Squibb & Son.

Informant further advised he had no information

of VELOTTA recently visiting Cleveland, and from comments

of VELOTTA, he doubted that VELOTTA had been back in

Cleveland recently.

Informant stressed his opinion that VELOTIA is

an expert burglar, specializing in getting around burglar

alarm systems, and would not be involved in a crime of

violence if he could possibly avoid it.

Informant was not aware of any other contacts of

VELOTTA in the San Diego area and stated that VELOTTA spends

most of his time these days in the Los Angeles area and

identified some of his companions as RAY FERRITTO, JULIUS and

MIKE PETRO, NICK VALENTI, and NICK TIRABASSI in the Los Angeles

area. Informant stated that these are all acquaintances

of JIMMY "The Weasel" FRATIANNO from the days when he

resided in the Cleveland area and are not friends of the

informant.

Informant stated that his association with

VELOTTA is not close enough to have detailed information

regarding burglaries being pulled by VELOTTA and his gang.

Informant advised that when VELOTTA contacts him again, he

win attempt to bring up the subject of YOUNGNAP money to determine

1f VELOTTA has any information of value.

Re: JOHN ROSELLI

Informant indicated he has been in recent conver-

sation with ROSELLI, and that ROSELLI is no longer making

plans to go to Chicago, and therefore informant assumes

SAM GIANCANA, aka Mooney, might not be returning to Chicago.

Note that in last contact with informant, he

indicated the possibility that GIANCANA would be returning

to Chicago in about a month.)

Informant speculated that GIANCANA might have

decided against returning to Chicago after receiving reports

regarding subpoenas being issued for FRANK LA PORIE and

other Chicago Heights hoodlums being subpoenaed before the

Federal Grand Jury at San Diego.

gambling operations of NICK SIMPONIS in the Palm Springs,

California area.

DESIMONE sent word to the informant through

ADAMO that when SINPONIS opened his new card room in Cabazon,

California, he had an understanding with DESIMONE that the

Los Angeles family would leave him alone and paid oft

$40,000 to the LCN leadership to leave him alone. DESIMONE

claims he is now going to honor this agreement and refuses

to give the informant permission to muscle in on SIMPONIS's

operation.

Informant advised that he has been in recent

telephone contact with FRATIANNO and learned that Los Angeles

criminal attorney JAMES CANTILLON has notified FRATIANNO and

his wife that he is no longer going to represent them at

the result of representing them against state charges in

El Centro, California.

Re: CARL LEE CASPERSON

Informant stated that in conversations with

FRATIANNO, FRATIANNO has made no statement to indicate

that he is aware of CASPERSON's present location.

testimony against JIMMY "Monk" ALLEGRETTI - LCN member of

the Chicago family. It is noted at the time COVELLI was

murdered at Encino, California on 6/18/67, FRANK LA PORTE of

Chicago was with the informant at San Diego waiting to testify

before the Federal Grand Jury.

Informant stated that LA PORTE's reaction to the

killing was one of surprise, and that he did not think

LA PORTE knew anything about it. Informant had no infor-

mation indicating that COVELLI's murder was an LCN contract

killing.

He speculated, however, that it could have been,

as the result of the testimony he gave against ALLEGRELLI,

and that LA PORTE would not necessarily know about it unless

he was involved in it himself.

In accordance with New Orleans request by letter

dated 6/5/67, the informant was questioned regarding

FRANCESCO PAOLO COPPOLA, aka

"Three-Finger Frank."

Informan t

substance stated the following:

Informant has known COPPOLA for many years and

was on a very friendly basis with him.

COPPOLA is now living in Italy and claimed that COPPOLA is

very wealthy. Stated that in the past COPPOLA has invited

him to visit him in Italy, but he has never done so. Stated

that many years ago COPPOLA lived for a while in Los Angeles

when JACK I. DRAGNA was LN boss in southern California.

(It is noted in New Orleans reports on COPPOLA that he was

booked at Los Angeles County Jail on 7/7/31 and 10/27/31

for operating a still.

Informant confirmed that COPPOLA was very active

in the international narcotics traffic between Italy and

Detroit. He talked about COPPOLA having moved to Louisiana

and becoming involved in gambling at New Orleans and Baton

Rouge, Louisiana with SILVESTRO CARROLLO.

He talked about COPPOLA eventually becoming

involved in his Louisiana gambling operations with FRANK

COSTELLO, the former Commission member residing in New York

City. Informant related a story that during that time he

accompanied JACK I. DRAGNA from Los Angeles to New York City

for a meeting with the Commission. At that time FRANK

COSTELLO was attempting to get Commission approval for a

contract killing on COPPOLA. Informant stated that he

himself got into a nasty verbal exchange with COSTELLO

because COSTELLO objected to Informant calling him by his

first name.

His remarks to COSTELLO were so inflamnatory

that his boss, JACK I. DRAGNA, and the Detroit boss, JOb

siriull, who was present, cooled it off and sent the informant

home to San Diego. Informant was very critical of COSTELLO,

referring to him as a

"phony" whose only crime of personal

violence was probably the one that obtained LCN membership

for him.

He advised that the outcome of the meeting was in

COPPOLA's favor.
