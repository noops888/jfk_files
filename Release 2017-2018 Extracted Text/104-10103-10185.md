MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD:

SUBJECT: The CUBELA Trial

Briefly, Rolando Cubela Secades has been in personal contact with

staffers of this agency in 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964 and, for the last

time, in February 1965 shortly prior to his return to Cuba.

The Record of Cubela's long conversation with Manuel Artime Buesa

on 30 December 1964 (reported by Artime via Nestor Sanchez in the

attached Memo dated 3 January 1956) clearly indicates the extent

of Cubela's probings and high-level military contacts and his

attempts to form an internal group which would work together to

a non-Communist government in Cuba in the event of Fidel Castro's

demise.

During the reported conversation of the trial, there is no indication

whatsoever that Cubela revealed anything more

than his "weakness,

playboy attitude'et cetera in plotting with a man like Artime to

assassinate Castro.

Under private interrogation to date there is no

known possibility that Cubela has revealed the names of the real

military leaders with whom he really was in contact and with whom

he discussed the overthrow of Castro, because none of these major

individuals, whose names are known to us, have been arrested or

detained. Ameijeiras, of course, does fall in this category. However

he, like Juan Nuiry Sanchez and Victor Bordon Machado who are

reportedly arrested, falls in the category of known personal friends

of Cubela. The other military leaders whom Cubela contacted who

have not been arrested are apparently not known to be personal or

close friends or acquaintances of Cubela. Among the latter are

nolartino Case 4:

Minister of the Armed Forces and Chief of the General Staff Cmdte.

at the sater br

Vice

Belarmino Castilla Mas and the former chief, Cmdte. Dr. Sergio del

Valle jimenez, who is stili a Vice Minister oi the EAR

and a member

of the Political Bureau of the CCCP; a third member of this group

- was. Cmdte. Guillermo Garcia Frias,

former Chief of the Army of the

West but currently a member of the Political Bureau of the CCCP.

Garcia Frias has been almost constantly with Fidel Castro, even on

â€” traveis

inrouguout the island, and for this reason was replaced as

Commanding Officer of the Army of the West

* in the past few months.

Several careful readings of the entire proceedings of the trial

appear

to indicate that as soon as Cubela learned the extent of the

regime's knowledge of the plot to assassinate the Premier he adopted

an an immediate line of defense his own "weakness, emotional in-

stability, deterioration, liking for

gay parties,

the 'dolce vita'

life" et cetera, as the common denominator to make himself and the

few friends known to be involved through the betrayal by AMHAM-1

as the sole "responsibles" for the plot. When asked had he been.

in communication with his arrested friends since 28 February 1966,

he said "No, but I amagine that they must be profoundedly analyzing

everything I am saying here because it is the result of my deep

meditation during my deserved imprisonment where the only thing one

does is think and think - seeking the reason for one's behavior which

has led one to that condition"

That QUHOPS-1

a osage was very evident - for while

they revealed minor facts about the Madrid meetings with Artime which

could only have been of their own knowledge, both managed to mention

that although Cubela at times talked of the assassination they were

"sure Rolando couldnever really do something like that". And "that

he appeared at other times determined and at others very indecisive

about the plan".

Cubela has been reported by several sources to have been drugged.

The clear, precise, careful, educated statements he made throughout

the trial do not bear this comment out to any degree. A handwriting

analysis done by Mrs. Hall of TSD in April 1965 bears out many of the

underlying subtleties he showed in the trial. To quote a few:. "He

is a cool and calculating observer who relates the smallest details

to their larger aspects".... Most people in his environment may not.

even be aware of his astuteness and vigilance, as he may intentionally

convey the impression of being preoccupied with his own thoughts."

.. . .

Basically rather impressionable, he makes strong efforts at concentrating

on what he is doing, shutting out all possible distractions and

diversions"....."He possesses great facility in expressing himself

in word and script. He has some skill in adjusting his style to that

of the people he is talking to.. While he can be rather eloquent, he

is not likely to divulge anything which should be kept secret'.... "He

has his feelings and impulses under the strictest control.

He is a

role player who may appear more natural and spontaneous than he actually

is"..... "He can exercise various deceptive mechanisms in the most

adroit fashion, and while demonstrating a smooth behavior".
