Excerpts From Justice Department Report on

WASZINGTON, Feb. 18-The follow-

ing are excerpts from the report of the

Justice Department Task Force that re-

viewed the assassination of the Rev. Dr.

Martin Luther King Jr.

Critical Evaluation of the

Assassination Investigation

First, the task force has concluded

that the investigation by the F.B.I. to

ascertain and capture the murderer of

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., was thor-

oughly, honestly.

and successful con-

ducted. We submit that the minute de-

tails compacted in this report amply

support this conclusion.

At the very outset of the investiga-

tion, telegrams went to all field offices

of the Bureau instructing the Special

Agents

in Charge to take personal

supervision of

the

investigation,

check out all leads in 24 hours, and

noting that they would be held person-

ally responsible. (HQ-44-38861-153).

The files we reviewed show that this

directive was conscientiously followed.

The Bureau sought first to identify and

locate the murderer using the obvious

leads.

They

checked

out

aliases,

tracked the traces left under the Galt

alias and used the known fingerprints

from the murder weapon and the con-

tents of the blue zipper bag left on

eliminate suspects.

This backtracking ended in Atlanta.

At this point the

It was possible for the task force

to create a well documented history of

James Earl Ray from the moment

his escape to his capture in England,

using the investigation reports in the

F.B.I. files and to corroborate and fill

in essential

details

with Ray's own

statements (admissions)

to author William Bradford Huie.

From this chronology, from the labo

Ray's judicial

admissions it was concluded that he

We saw

probative of the possibility that Ray

and any co-conspirator were together

assertions that someone else pulled the

trigger are so patently self-serving and

so varied as to be wholly unbelievable.

They become, in fact, a

Third, we found that conspiracy leads
