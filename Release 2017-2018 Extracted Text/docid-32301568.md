Previous information has indicated that the

captioned anti-Castro organization is planning to carry out

a bombing raid over Cuba from Bimini in the Bahama Islands.

The alxplane scheduled to be used in the raid reportedly 1s

located at the Broward International Airport, Fort Lauderdale,

Florida.

On December 13, 1963, our source in this matter

who has furnished reliable information in the past. learned

that a pilot and a copilot of the airplane were to proceed

to the Browerd International Airport on December 14, 1963,

for a practice flight.

On December 15, 1963, the above-nentioned pilot:

and copilot were scheduled to make another practice flight

from the same airport. On this flight the airplane was to

be flown over Bimini for the purpose of observing the landing

fleld there and was scheduled to return to the Broward

International Airport on the same day. No landings on

foreigny soil were to be made.

The source believed that an Aero Commander airplane

would be used.

British authorities were advised of the above
