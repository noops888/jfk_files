MEMORANDUM FOR RECORD

SUBJECT: Minutes of Meeting of the Special Group (Augmented) on

Operation MONGOOSE, 6 September 1962

PRESENT: Mr. McGeorge Bundy; the Attorney General; Mr. Martin;

Mr. William Bundy, General Decker, General Lansdale and

General Harris; General Carter; Mr. MurIOW

1.

Sabotage Operation

General Carter reported that information should be available by

Sunday as to the success of this previously-approved operation. Mr.

Bundy requested that the White House be informed as soon as the

information

is obtained.

2.

General Lansdale commented in general on his paper of August 31st.

He noted that some of the operational representatives had questioned

whether this was responsive to the changed situation engendored by the

issuance of NSAM 181, but said that this plan had been prepared within

the framework of the previously-approved guidelines (those of August 16).

Mr. Bundy noted that most of the paperwork in response to NSAM 181 has

been done and the President's statement of Tuesday night had clarified

the situation to a considerable degree. He thus felt that the approach

taken in the August 3lst paper was satisfactory.

3. The following specific couments were then made on Activities

listed in the paper: (It should be noted that final approval was not

given to the paper at this meeting.)

a. Mr. Martin said that number 20 (balloons) was tricky and that

he thought a very careful look should be taken when a specific proposal

C.

In answer to the Chairman's question, Mr. Murrow, supported

by State, said chat Radio Swan (number 23) should be continued even

though it is not entirely effective. This led into a discussion of

the possibilities of intrusion into radio and TV channels in Cuba. Mr.

Murrow explained the far-reaching reactions that the Cubans could mount

against U,S, radio stations, and said that he felt on balance it would

not be profitable to provoke this kind of electronic warfare. The Group

asked, however, that a detailed paper on the pros and cons of such

intrusions, to include the legal aspects involved, be prepared.

d. At General Carter's suggestion, number 21 (propaganda directe

e.: On number 28 (sabotage of assets outside of Cuba), the purpose

was changed from crippling to harrassing Cuban commerce.

f. General Carter pointed out that reference to support of all

Cuban exile groups (number 48) is impractical. The word was changed

to selected.

8. Mr. Martin cautioned that results of number 50 (actions to

be undertaken by other Hemisphere governments) would not be expected

overnight.

h. General Carter urged that, in connection with number 22

, General Lansdale should be given more latitude

in working up other deception possibilities. Mr. Bundy felt, on the

other hand, that particularly because of the possible Cuban counter-

measures which had been outlined by Mr. Murrow, the Group should look

at other possibilities in some detail.

1.

General Carter felt that a determination should be made as

to how far the U.S. is prepared to go in economic harrassing actions.

He emphasized that

sabotage operations such as those under number 27

will not in themselves be especially effective in wrecking the Cuban

5. A suggestion was made that small explosives or incendiaries which

could be distributed to Cubans should be infiltrated. General Carter

explained that the problem is not one of such supplies, since they can

be easily improvised, but rather that the people have shown no inclination

to use such materials despite many exile claims to the contrary.

9. General Carter urged again that a decision be reached as to how

much latitude would be allowed the operating elements of the government,

within broad policy lines. The Chairman indicated that it would not be

a simple matter to delegate responsibilities of this kind to any great

degree.

10. Mr. Bundy then raised the basic question of the entire spectrum

of other contingencies beyond those envisaged in the MONGOOSE prograu.

He mentioned as examples what the U.S. response should be in the event

of a revolt and whether or not a naval blockade should be mounted.

The Group agreed that such planning, in addition to the military contingency

plans already prepared, must be pursued.

Although recognizing that this type of activity is not within the

Sie the?

MONGOOSE framework, MI. Bundy fest that General Lansdale's group,

particularly the State representative, coutd do the initial exploration

of possibilities for later consideration by the Special Group, the

Secretary of State and higher authority. On the other hand, General

Carter felt strongly that if General Lansdale and his associates

were given the responsibility for developing the spectrum of possible

decisionsof this kind, it would inevitably detract from the time

available for MONGOOSE operations. This matter was left open for further

consideration at a meeting next week.
