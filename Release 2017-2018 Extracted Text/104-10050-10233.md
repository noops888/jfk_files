Q:

A:

Q:

Q:

A:

at was the line of reporting in Cla during the period I serv

i working level point-of-contact with the Warren Commission Staf

It was a multiple leveled things

"(a) from the Commission and AWD

personally via McCone-to Dick Helmsy (b) from Helms to the two or

three components primarily concerned (SE, then SB, Dave Murphy;

LA, then WH; and ab:

"In practice, the substantive SB input worked

research components headed by Lee wigren-Minsk

photo for example, et alo-passed via CI. CI had own defector input.

In addition, on sensitive natters of concesn ta the investigation,

Dick Helms and Murphy also dealt directly with the Conmission.

Did you hear:

? ? [two crypts,

one sounded by "Jackenet" ?]

I had not. Belin recalled that Castro had made a speech in which

he had charged

assassination intent by emigres and had promised

retribution in kind if there was official support.

Had any thought been given to the assumption that an anti-Castro

assassination plot might have been underway, and fact it was known

to Helms and to Castro? LMr. Belin said he now knew that Helms

was, in fact, aware of something underwas regarding Castro.

had no evidence to show that I RGRY had been informed about it.J

Would that change any of the thinking re Oswald's Mexican trip and

contacts?

Yes, I said, though I intended to

give more potential importance

to Oswald's KGB

contacts, and related that

band others--though

recognizing the wisdom of the Warken Commission's handling--had

felt there had been poke to the sowet aspect that should have

been pursued:

a.

Fact that his two Sovtet consular contacts in Mexico City

had been identified as KGb and at least one (both 2 had been

traced orgarizattoratly to the T3th Department (assassinations).

Q:

b. Our defector information strongly insists that all

Western militar defectors-

Alike Oswald--were screened by the

13th Department.

c. Thinness of file turned over by Soviets in view of b.

I acknowledged in retrospect that cuban hypothesis was worth recon-

sidering, though it would appear that period of solid inter-service

(KGB-UGT) relations began Tater, (i.e. after 1967-68, Venceremos, etc.).

Why did Oswald's lies include a denial to Dallas police that he had

made the Mexican trip unless there was something important to hide

about it?

All his other lies concerned key factual elements of his

cover story.

Why also did Marina deny she knew anything about the

Mexican trip in her first story to the FBI which she later rectified

before the Warren Commission? Mr. Belin noted that he had left the

hypothesis of Castro/Cuban involvement oper in his book.

He added

that it would have been important to have known the facts about the

inti-Castro plot at the wmejef the warren Commission investigation

le felt the least he would have domeswould have been to have insiste

on the polygraphing of Marina Oswald regarding her knowledge of

Oswald's Mexican trip.

1. This memorandum is for information and for action.

The proposed lines of action are Indicated) in paragraph 4.

2. AMMUG/1p the Cüban Intelligence Service defector,

has produced information ofrinterest to the President's

Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, CI

Staff learned of AMMUGA

Da 30 April. A questionnaire was

submitted by the Staff on I May (Attachment A). Mr. Swenson,

who is handling the AMMUG/1 debriefing, provided a reply on

5 May (Attachment B). It was clear from Mr. Swenson's

summary that AMMUG/1 had information bearing on the

OSWALD relationship with the Cuban Embassy and Cuban

intelligence personnel in Mexico City, albiet his knowledge

was not that of a direct participant in matters affecting

OSWALD. A follow up questionnaire was submitted to

AMMUG/1 on 6 May (Attachment C). Mr. Swenson's reply

was dated 8 May (Attachment D). Attention is directed

particularly to the content of paragraph two of Attachment D.

3. We have the problem of reconciling the operational

exploitation of AMMUG/ 1 and satisfying the responsibilities

we have undertaken with Mr. Rankin.: AMMUG/1 is such an

operational gold mine that Mi. Swenson wants, at a maximum,

two months to work fully. It'is palpable, however, that we

must furnish to the Commission the substance of AMMUG/1's

information on OSWALD before that

On the previous record of

our association with the Commission, particularly with Mr. Rankin,

it seems possible for the Agency to workout an arrangement with

Mr. Rankin personally that would take care of their needs and ours

after a frank discussion

at the equitjes.

4. It is recommended that the DDP in person or via a

designee, preferably the former, discuss the AMMUG/1

situation on a very restricted basis with Mr. Rankin at his

earliest convenience either at the Agency or at the Commission

headquarters. Until this takes place, it is not desirable to put

anything in writing.

SUBJECT General

Debrieting of AMMUG-1

The Oswald Case

REFERENCE

Blind Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 v

1. Reference is made to a telephone conversation yesterday

with Chief, CI Statt concerning this matter.

2. Because I am not aware of the information already

avallable to the Commission investigating the Oswald Case or

furnished by the Agency, my debriefing of the Source has been

based on the questions prepared by the CI Staif and on what the

Source answers have suggested. I shall be glad to pursue any

other topics suggested by Ct Staff.

3. The Following Information in addition to that in the

reference might be

rof interest:

a Luisa CALDERON, since she returned to Cuba,

has been paid a regular salary by the DGI even though she has

not performed any services. Her home is in the Vedado section

where the rents are high.

b. Source has known CALDERON for several years.

: Before going to Mexico, she worked in the Ministry of Exterior

Commerce in the department which was known as the #Empresa

Transimport'. Her title was Secretary General of the Communist

Youth in the department named in the previous sentence.

c. Luisa CALDERON was transferred directly from her

position in the Ministry of Extertor Commerce to a post in Mexico,

a matter of surprize to the Source.

d.

• Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez (DGI pseudo MORCOS),

shortly before he left Cuba for Mexico on or about 16 April 1964,

saw CALDERON.

REFERENCE

A.

Blind Memorandum dated 05 May 1964 v

B.

Blind Memorandum dated 07 May 1964

C. Conversations between CI Staff and

C/WH/SA/CI

1. When the Oswald Case first was discussed with the Source the

specific questions prepared by Cl. Staff were posed. The answers

given by the Source were reported in Reference A. That memorandum

which I dictated to a Cl Staff stenographer appears accurate except for

sentence #9 which should have said that the only possible "fabrication"

known by Source was the specific denial by Fidel CASTRO, on a

television program; of any Cuban knowledge of Oswald.

2. On 07 and 08 May 1964 I further discussed the Oswald Case

with the Source in order to elarify exactly what he knew and what

he had heard. In the light of the explanation given by him, I believe

that a clearer understanding of what he knows can be reached if I

record his knowledge without using the question and answer format.

Accordingly, in the following paragraphs I shall report all the

information given by the Source paraphrasing his explanations and

comments.

" I have no personal knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD or his

activities and I do not know that OSWALD was an agent of the

Direccion General de Inteligencia (DGI) or any other directorate

or department of the Cuban, Government.

I first heard of OSWALD aiter the assassination of President

Kennedy when news media carried the name of OSWALD.

Personnel in the DOl first commented about the case, so far as

I can recall, one day after lunch when a group of officers, of

whom I was one, were chatting. The officers present were about

ten including Roberto SANTIESTEBAN, Norberto HERNANDEZ

de Curbelo, Andres ARMONA, Pedro FARINAS Diaz and

Manuel VEGA Perez.

Mantel VEGA Perez previously had

been assigned to Mexico in thé Cuban Consulate where he

was the principal intelligence officer of the DGI. VEGA

mentioned that OSWALD had gone to the Cuban Consulate

two or three times in connection with a visa application

during the time that VEGA;w as in Mexico. I gathered,

although I do not know that VEGA made any speciic

statement to this effect, that VEGA personally had seen

OSWALD. I well could have reached this conclusion

because normally VEGA and his assistant in Mexico for

the DGI, Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez, would see persons

applying for a visa to go to Cuba.

This is because DGI

officers are charged with expediting the granting of visas

of agents of the DCI. Such agents on appearing at the

Consulate use a special phrase to indicate their relationship

with the DGI. (I do not know the particular phrase used

in every case. I do know that agenta from El Salvador in

requesting visas alway ( made mention of the name "Mauricio" )

The DGi officers at a Consulate Interview visa applicants to

find out if they are agents. If the visa applicant does not use

one of the indicated phrases, the Doi officers, instead o

granting the visa Immeciately, tell the applicant to return in

a few days. The officer then notifies Habana and requests

authority for the visa.

I cannot recall if VEGA even made the

statement that he had requested permission to issue a visa to

OSWALD, but I feel sure that he would have done so because

VEGA had said that OSWALD had returned several times and

this would be the usual procedure.

I believe that Rogelio RODRIGUEZ Lopez also would have

seen OSWALD because he worked

with VEGA and also would

have screened visa applicants.

I thought that Luisa CARDBRON wight have had contact with

OSWALD because I learned about. I7 March 1964, shortly before

I made a trip to Mexico, that she had been involved with an

American in Mexico. The information to which I refer was told

to me by a DGI cast

dricer named Norberto HHNANDEZ de

Curbelo. (I remer

because he gave me $40. 00 to, buy some shoes and

other items during my trip to viexico.) I had

commented to HERNANDEZ that it seemed strange

that Luisa CALDERON was receiving a salary from

the DGI although she apparently did not do any work

for the Service CEARNANDEZ told me that bers was

a peculiar case and that he himself believed that she

had been recruited in Mexico by the Central Intelligence

Agency although Manuel PINEIRO, the Head of the DGI,

did not agree. As Krecall HERNANDEZ had investigated

Luisa CALDERON. This was because, during the time

she was in Mexico, the DGI had intercepted a letter to

her by an American who signed his name as OWER (phonetic)

or something similar. As you know, the pronunciation

of Anglo-Saxon names is difticult in Spanish so I am not

sure of how the name mentioned by HERNANDEZ should be

spelled. It could have been "Howard" or something different.

As I understood the matter, the letter from the American

was a love letter but indicated that there was a clandestine-

professional relationship between the writer and Luisa

CALDERON. asgunderstood from HERNANDEZ that

after the interception of the letter she had been followed

and seen in the company of an American. I do not know if

this could have been OSWALD. I, myself, considered the

case of Luisa CALDERON unusual because I had known her

before she went to Mexico when she worked in the Ministry

of Esterior Commerce in the Empresa Transimport Department

where she was Secretary General of Communist Youth.

She

was transferred directly from that position to a post in Mexico

which seemed strange.

The only other person about whom you asked me in connection

with this, whom I recall, is Sylvia RAN and I know very

little about her. What happened was that I was in the Cuban

Embassy in Mexico on 29 March 1964 about 1230 in the afternoon

preparing to return to Habana the same)day. I was talking to

some other Cubans including Rogello RODRIGUEZ Lopez and

fnu BUENAVENTURA af the Cuban Embassy; a courier named

"Enio", a courier named, "Tatoy and one other Cuban whom I

cannot recall.

We saw a pretty girl standing at the end oi

the reception rooms and someone asked who she was, and one

I recall that, after the news of the assassination of

President Kennedy reached the DGK. orders were issued

To at and a so at carents ording to not holi,

they were "muy geereto" (very secret),

"gecreto" (secret),

or "importante" (important). The material, once packaged

was to be held pending further instructions. All travel by

DGI officers and all DGI pouches were suspended temporarily.

In addition,

I recall that DCI Headquarters personnel were

instructed elther to remain in the DGI Headquarters offices

or to keep the DGI aware of their whereabouts so that they

could be reached immediately. I do not know the reason for

these measures but I believe it logical that they were issued

because of the possibility that the United State might take

some type of action against Cuba and the DGI offices.

As

nearly as I can recall, we were able to unpackage DGI files

and use them normally about the 3rd of December 1963."*

3.

In brief, the Source does not claim to have any significant

information concerning the assassination of President Kennedy or

about the activities of OSWALD. If the paraphrased comments of

the Source are considered to fee further chrification, I suggest that

Mr. Rocca, who is most familiar with the details of the OSWALD

Case, talk to the Source.& This can barranged at any time. Mean-

while, I shall have a question asked in a forthcoming LCFLUTTER to

determine whether or not the Source seems to have concealed any

information on this matter.

Subject - General: Debriefing of Cuban Source

Specific:

oswa ta. Ease

The source does not have afreg& knowledge of Lee Harvey OSWALD

or his activities but was able to provide items of interest based on

Cuban intelligence officers assigned to the Direccion General De

Inteligencia. The information appearing below was furnished by

the source and is keyed to questions submitted.

Lerior on tober 1963 OSA visited the Cuban End arer

in Mexico City on two or three occasions. Before, during and after

these visits, OSWALD was in contact with the Direccion General De

Inteligencia (DGI), specifically with Luisa CALDERON, Manuel

VEGA Perez and Rogchia RODRIGUE? Dopez.

VEGA whorg Cuban Intelligence pseudonym is MARCOS

is the current CubanIS cmetro Mexico. He recently has had a

tour of duty in Habana, prior to which he held the same post as

now as Cuban IS chief in Mexico.

RODRIGUEZ is a Cuban IS staff officer in Mexico. He has

three Cuban intelligence pseudonyms, Eduardo, Casimiro and Jose

Antonio.

The precise relationship of Luisa CALDERON to the DGI is

not clear. She spent about six months in Mexico from which she

returned to Cuba early in 1964.

The source does not know whether or not the Cuban Services

used OSWALD in any agent capacity or other manner.

A.

When news of the assassination of President Kennedy

reached the DGI, it caused much comment concerning the fact

OSWALD had been in the Cuban Embassy in Mexico. In addition,

orders were issued for all headquarters and field officers of the

held pending further instructions. In addition, all travel by DGI

officers and all DGI pouchesurere suspended temporarily.

B. When the news that OSWALD was the assassin reached

the DGI, there was no immediate comment but, when Fidel CASTRO

spoke on television to deny Cuban involvement, there was considerable

comment concerning OSWALD's visit to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico.

At this time VEGA, who has been mentioned previously, was in Cuba

and commented to a group of DGI staff officers that OSWALD had come

to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico to request a visa but had been refused.

VEGA did not give any details and the subject was not pursued.

4. It is not known whether information on OSWALD's visit to

the Cuban Consulate in Mexico in September 1963 was relayed to any

Cuban service.

It is not known

if the Cuban intelligence services had contact

with the New Orleans' Fair Play for Cuba Committee.

6. The only Molina who-is recalled ig "The Hook", the Cuban who

was convicted in New York City for the murder of a young girl during

a clash between two Cuban groups. The DGI staff officer who had been

in the United Nations in New York, SANTIEST ABAN traveled to Cuba

with "The Hook" and with another Cuban named ORIHUELA and upon

arrival in Cuba tried to obtain employment for both individuals. The

names Pedro Charles and Peter have no known significance.

7. The reaction of Soviet officials in contact with the Cuban intelli

MEMORANDUM FOR: Mr Rocca

"Internal Mame Rogending Agaucy's Position in Dunling.

with

The DDP called me this afternoon, 12 May, to state

that the Directos has received a telephone call from RANKIN

regarding the Commission's desire to interview him at 1030 AM,

Thursday.

Mr. HOOVER is scheduled to appear at 9:00 on that

morning.

2.

The DDP wishes to have from you a short but

comprehensive memorandum which highlights the basic issues or

positions entered into by the Agency in its dealings with the

Commission.

For example, RANKIN indicated that the Commission

would wish to hear the Dire ctor's views as to how improvements

might be made in protecting the President's life. Further, they

will probably ask questions regarding the possibilities that a con-

spiracy existed. Such general questioning certainly necessitates

that the DCI be made aware of the positions taken during previous

interviews.

I raised with Mr. HELMS the nature of the recent

information which you are processing which originated with the

sensitive WH source.

I informed him that in your view this would

raise a number of new factors with the Commission, that it should

not go to the Commission prior to the Director's appearance unless

we have first had some preliminary reaction or made sure that the

Director is fully aware of its implications since it could well serve

as the basis for detailed questioning.

The DDP stated that he would

review this carefully and made a decision as to the question of timing.

3. Given the schedule, you will appreciate that the DDP

will need a paper covering the above points as soon as possible.

Summary Outline

22202

This brief is concerned yith five topics which, it is

anticipated, will arise in the course of the Director's appear-

ance before the Pr

Eeident's Commission.

These are:

a. Formal and

unqualified negation by the DCI

of any contact or association, direct or indirect,

between the Central Intelligence Agency and Lee

Harvey Oswald. This should be accompanied by

the tabling of an affidavit signed by the Director

and notarized. (TAB A)

b. A formal assurance by the Director that all

information in the possession of the Agency regarding

Oswald's activities and associations outside of the

United States has been made available to the

Commission through its staff, with which there has

been close and frequent contacts since the inception

of the Commission's activities. (TAB B)

c. An interim pronouncement by the DCI on the

problem of

information bearing qu this problem has been furnished

to the Commission for evaluation and consideration in the

framework of its total knowledge of the facts.

The Agency,

at the present time, is lacking any knowledge of recent

information or documentation furnished by the Soviet

Government to the Commission with respect to Oswald's

activity in the Soviet Union. (TAB C)

d. The DCI's suggestions for improving policy and

organization With respect to the personal security of

the Fresident. Certain steps relating strictly to the

Agency's jurisdiction have already been suggested by

memorandum. It is proposed that the Director now

make specific suggestions involving legislation which

would treat information bearing on the personal security

of the President and, advisedly, other Federal officials

directly related to national security affairs in a manner

similar to what currently exists by statute for special

relationship to the Cuban Intelligence Service.

Substantive information of grave concern, to the

security of sources and methods have been developed

on both of these topics. The information and, in certain

instances, knowledge with respect to acquisition has

been made available on a highly restricted basis to

MI. Rankin and to certain elements of his staff. It is

recommended that the DCI not respond on the record

to queries on these topics. He should suggest that all

such "technical questions" be worked out in detail through the

channels and procedures that have functioned very well

- we believe - between the Commission and particular

CIA components. (TAB E)

Formal Disclaimer of any Relationship with Dee Harvey Oswald

There have been rumore and) allegations which began

immediately after the assassination which branded Oswald as a

U.S. Government agent, In many instances, CIA has been

named as his sponsor. The authorship, geographical dispersion

throughout the world, the idefititycof themes and the timing lend

strong support to the conclusion that these charges are elements

of a world-wide, Sowet-sponsored propaganda and misinformation

program.

As DCI, MI. McCare welcomes this appearance before

the Commission to make a categorical and unqualified denial of

these unprincipled distortions

of the historical and personal

responsibilities for what was a dastardly and heinous act. In

witness of this, the DCI submits to the Commission an affidavit

which formalizes this statement. The affidavit is attached.

It is recommended that the DCI state concurrently with this

action that he desires to draw the Commission's attention to the

fact that the irresponsible charges that have been made, sponsored

methods and the pusposes of the broader campaign against

American intelligence and security components which has built

up momentum over the past six years. We have traced the

sponsorship of that campaign directly to individuals and com

ponents within the Soviet police state apparatus. Their un-

scrupulous treatment of the Oswald case was neither new as a

method nor a surprise as an occurrence.

If the DCI is challenged by anyone on the Commission

about the substance or implication of his affidavit, it is recom-

mended that response be along the following lines:

and painstaking examination.

The DCI should note that from

Oswald's possible relationships with foreign sponsors be

state which are

referred to as "executive action'' , but is, in fact, charged

with assassination and sabotage.

the Commission has taken up these points item-by-item with

the technical levels of the Agency and that the ultimate findings

Suggestions for Improving Policy and Organization Regarding

Presidential Security

Mr. Rankin raised thin question dire ctly by letter. In

its response, the Agency confined itself to elements relating

to its statutory mission. Specifically, it was suggested that:

a. The Secret Service, or Treasury, record

with the Office a Central Roference a formal require-

ment for information relating to Presidential security.

b.

It was suggested that, if the-Secret Service

intended to expand its

tetrigence coverage of possible

threats to the President's security, our experience

showed that it would need a specialized organizational

component to handle that task within the Secret Service

itself.

c. The CIA reply also noted that the Agency was

in direct touch with the Secret Service regarding the

possible utilization by that agency of our experience in

machine data processing.

On the public record, it is

suggested that the DCI not repeat this detail.

In his presentation to the Commission after referring

to these earlier suggestions th

the DCI should state that he desires

to take the opportunity

to offer

uggestion which he has not

tabled heretofore.

The Commission's major problem has been the assessment

of personal motive and the relationship of an individual act to

possible conspiratorial guidance. Because conspiracy is the

core of the problem, the DCI should point out the possibility of

legislative action which might be an assistance in preventing

recurrence of the national calamity it is investigating. There

is an analogy at close hand between the problem of developing in

advance information relating to Presidential security and the

problem faced by the country a few years ago regarding the

clandestine introduction or manufacture in the U.S. of special

nuclear material or atomic weapons. The remedy devised at that

time was embodied in the Atomic Weapons Reward Act of 15 July 1955

(29 Stat 365, PL. 165, 84th Congress). In essence, the Act estab-

lished a substantial reward ($500, 000) for information bearing on

the Act provided by any person, and in certain instances privileged

treatment for such persons -- for example, asylum if they were

foreigners, was assured.? Finally, a Reward Board was

created to adminter the purposes of the Act.

1) The Del should susatthat the Cormiasion consider a

• recommendation for original legislative action designed to

induce individuals to furnish information bearing on Presidential

security by offering a substantial reward and preferential treatment.

The DCI should assure the Commission that he is convinced that

the substantial award, the special treatment, and the publicity

which would attend the implementing legislation in this matter

could represent a significant inducement even to staff officers

and personnel of secretassociations and state security organs

abroad whose functions include assassination and sabotage. It

is these individuals who would be privy to plans of executive action.

The reward would constitute additional inducement for such

individuals to take the risk of making important disclosures.

calone

The suggestion does not rest on the naterial elements of

reward and special treatment. The DCI can assure the Com

mission that we are aware that personnel in police state apparatuses

charged with the assassination and sabotage functions have repeatedly

expressed and, in many cases, acted upon their repugnance for

such work and for the system which calls upon them to do it.

There are specifio cases in the past tengears which document

this assertion, Trusted personnel charged with assassination

• missions have abandoned the mission even without the assurance

or the inducement which the DCI is here proposing.

In making this suggestion, the DCI may go one step furtiner

in advising the Commission to suggest that the Commission

examine the advisability of legislation making it a Federal offense

to conspire and to kill the Chief Executive. 3) The DCI could also

indicate that the Commission might desire to suggest that any

legislation along these lines should be enlarged to include con-

spiracy to kill any Federal official in the President's personal

circle of official associates directly concerned with national

security affairs. (The Agency's Legal Counsel states that

draft bills have been considered on the Hill.),

Mexican and Cuban Phases of Oswald's A

Extensive information hasibeen made available to the

Commission by CIA on tag working level regarding Oswald's

activity in Mexico City in September and October 1963. The

Commission Staff has been in detailed communication and

conversation with the Agency working levels both in head

quarters and in Mexico City. Within the past week,

significant information has been developed by CIA regarding

the relationship with Oswald of certain Cuban intelligence

personnel in Mexico City and the reaction in Havana within

the Cuban Intelligence Service to the news of the assassination

of President Kennedy. The Commission Staff is in the course

of being briefed on the Cuban aspect.

It is suggested that the DCI handle any question on the

Mexican and Cuban phases of Oswald's actinity as "technical

questions" which members of the Commission can develop

from or through their own staff with the appropriate component

of the Agency. This would be entirely consistent with the DCI's

overall assurance that he had ingericted his personnel to place

their information completely at the Commission's disposition.

the express request of ir. David W. Belin as a follow-

up to Question 3 of his letter to the Agency of

SUBJECT : Review of Selected Items in the

Ice Harvey OSWALD File -Regarding Allega-

tions of CASTRO Cuban Inyolvement in the

John. F. KENNEDY: Assassination

REFERENCE: •Letter by David i Belin to

Mr. E. Henry Knoche,

15 April 1975,

paragraph 3 (Regarding Public

by CASTRO,

etely, attached

BACKGROUND

1.

On Saturday evening, 7 September 1963,

Fidel CASTRO appeared at a Brazilian Embassy reception in

Havana; even more unusual, CASTRO submitted to an informal

interview by the Associated Press correspondent,

Daniel HARKER.

2. HARKER's interview reached New York on Sunday,

8 September, and was in print throughout the country on

Monday, 9 September.

There can be no question from the

facts surrounding the CASTRO appearance, which had not been

expected,

and his agreement to the interview, that this

event represented a more-than-ordinary attempt to get a

message on the record in the United States.

3. CASTRO's statements/ to HARKER covered a range of

topics but dealt principally with American political

leadership, in particular President KENNEDY, whom he ex-

coriated in extraordina

Provocative fashion

(" ... KENNEDY is a cretin" ... the BATISTA of his

times ... the most opportunistic American President of

all time ...").

4. The interview also contained an uncomplimentary

reference to Senator GOLDWATER and Cuban delay in signing

the limited nuclear test ban. There were differences in

the replay by United States newspapers like the

New York Times and Washington papers, with a result that

CASTRO's "message" was significantly modulated.

5. In New Orleans, where Lee Harvey OSWALD resided

until the midale of September 1963, the HARKER story

appeared in the principal morning paper. the Times-Picayune,

on Monday: 9 September, page f, under a three-column head-

line:

"CASTRO Blasts Raids on Cuba. Says U.S. Leaders

Imperiled by Aid to Rebels." The story followed under the

HARKER by-line:

"Havana (AP) - Prime Minister

Fidel Castro said Saturday night: 'U.s.

leaders would be in danger if they helped

in any attempt to do away with leaders of

Cuba.'

"Bitterly denouncing what he called

recent U.S. prompted raids on Cuban terri-

tory, Castro said:

weare prepared to

fight them and answer

in kind. U.S. leaders

should think

Ibat it they are aiding terror-

ist plans

themselves will not be safe.'

• World affairs ... seemed to be

entering a more peaceful climate a few days

ago, but now this trend has changed with

attacks.

*"The U.S. is always ready to negotiate

and make promises which later it will not honor.

This has happened to promises made during the

October crisis. They have been broken as can

be seen with new attacks.

" 'But I warn this is leading to a very

dangerous situation that could lead to a worse

crisis than October's ...'"

6. The New York Times, in its coverage on 9 September,

used a UPI wire service report which omitted any reference

to the warning and threat which gave the interview its real

significance.

The Washington Post did an abbreviated re-

write (9 September, page A-7) which, similarly,. omitted

any reference to the main thrust of CASTRO's remarks.

The Evening Star of Washington, D. C., printed_ the HARKER

story nearly in its entirety in the second section of the

paper 19 September 19ol, page 8-4) and reworded the content

of the HARKER interview, placing the emphasis on the po-

litical aspect

in particular, highlighting the GOLDWATER

elements and burying CASTRO's warning to the United States

leadership in the middle of the piece.

7. There is no evidence in the files on the KENNEDy'

assassination).that this CASTRO interview was considered in

following up leads or in dealings with the Warren Commission

and its staff although Mexico Station specifically directed

Headguarters attention to the AP story very shortly after

the Dallas killing.. More important, the interview appears

to have been forgotten in the contemporary political consid

eration of relations with CASTRO's Cuba.

There is no evidence

in the Agency records, either, that the Warren Commission

staff itself pursued the implication of the CASTRO interview

in dealing with the conspiracy hypothesis. There is no

evidence in the files that anything along these lines was

stated by any other Cuban leader before the assassination.

8. The purpose of this review, undertaken at Mr. Belin's

request, is to reconsider Lee Harvey OSWALD's activity on the

assumption that as an avid newspaper reader - which we know

from

testimony of Marina OSWALD and others - he read the

CASTRO warning and threat

as reported above. The results

of the review, admittedly heavily using the 20 - 20 quality

of hindsight, may be stipulated in sunmary:

a.

There is no increment of credible

?

evidence, applying this phrase strictly, of

Soviet andfor Cuban political, intelligence

or security service involvement in the as-

sassination to what was developed and con-

sidered by the Warren Commission and its

staff. The Commission's finding that

Lee Harvey OSWALD was the killer of

President KENNEDY and Officer TIPPIT and did

them in alone and of his own determination

stands.

b. "Credible evidence" that would

upset or significantly modify this judgement

did (and does) not exist in Washington. But

such evidence could exist in Moscow and or

Havana, whose voluntary inputs to the Warren

Commission were minimal in quantity and

quality, designed to cover up any admissions

of knowledge of, or connection with, OSWALD

which might be related directly or indirectly

with the assassination.

Therefore, the belief

that there was Soviet and or cuban (KeBand. 05

DI) connection with OSWALD will persist and

grow until there has been a full disclosure -

by these governments of all elements of

OSWALD's handling and stay in the Soviet union

and his contacts in Mexico City. The

Warran Consission report should have left a

wider "window" for this contingency. That,

indeed, was the opinion at the working level,

particularly in the counterintelligence com-

ponent in the CIA in 1964. As was indicated

by Mr. Helms in his testimony before the

Warren Commission, CIA would continue to

regard this aspect of the OSWALD case as

still open.

c. In the absence of additionad of new

elements of "credible" evidence,

are

"nuances" in the record that emerge

as note

worthy, in the light of other conclusions.

These are reviewed and summarized below, item-

by-item.

13.

DELGADO'S testimony has the cast of credibility.

Granting that, it is of basic importance to focus attention

on the male visitor who contacted OSWALD at El Toro Camp

and talked with him for between one and a half to two hours.

The event was unique in DELGADO's recollections, and actually

there is nothing like it - on the record - in everything else

we know about OSWALD's activity in the United States before

or after his return to the United States. The record reflects

no identification of the El Toro contact. DELGADO's presump-

tion is that he was from the Cuban Consulate in Los Angeles.

Assuming that, the questions are: Who was it, and was

there reporting ftom. Los

INTERCEPTED, CONVERSATIONOF CUBAN EMBASSY

EMPLOYEE,

LUISA CALDERON, AFTERNOON OF 22 NOVEMBER 1963

18.

Mexico City time, about five hours after the

KENNEDY assassination, a Cuban Embassy employee named

"Luisa" received a telephone call in Spanish from an uniden

tified male outside.

19. The caller asked her if she had heard the latest

news. "Luisa" jokingly replied: "Yes, of

course, "I knew

it almost before KENNEDY ... Imagine, one, two, three and

now; that makes three [she laughs], what barbarians! ..."

20. Both speakers agreed on the seriousness of the

assassination. "Iuisa" also stated that the party at

Silvia DURAN's had-been called off so it would not appear

that they were celebrating the death of KENNEDY, nor would

they have the party coindide with the burial. Finally she

said she planned tg move that night into the house of

doctor la womany friend.

21. Latin hyperbole? Boastful ex post facto suggestion

of foreknowledge?

This is the only item in the intercept

coverage of the Cubans and Soviets after the assassination

that contains the suggestion of foreknowledge or expectation.

22. The tenuous, enigmatic character of the conversation

is sharply highlighted by the following facts:

"Luisa" was probably identical with

Luisa CALDERON, a cadre worker of the Cuban

Directorate, Genéral of Intelligence (DGI).

She returned to Cuba in 1964 and was reported

to be working in DGI Headguarters.

b. The DGI element in Mexico City in the

fall of 1963 was headed by Alfredo MIRABEL Diaz

who had arrived on 2 September 1963, formally

•as the replacement of the Consul Eusebio AZCUE

(departed 19 November 1963). The deputy DGI

chief (and as of June 1964, MIRABEL'S successOr)

was Manuel Engenio VEGA Perez.

c. The "Silvia DURAN" named in Luisa's

conversation was the receptionist, a Mexican

national, who dealt with OSWALD during his known

visits on 27 and 28 September to the Cuban

installations in connection with a Cuban visa

application for stay and/or transit.

Silvia DURAN is the sole live witness on the

record regarding OSWALD's activity in

Mexico City-

Rogelis RODRIGUEZ Lopez, were positively

identified in February 1964 by two independent

sources as engaged in the active development

agents for the purpose of assassinating

General Annstasio SOMOZA. VEGA, it is estab-

OSWALD's stay there 27 September - 2 October

1963. He left Mexico City on 3 November 1963

for Havana. It was reliably reported about

VEGA that all individuals going to Cuba, legally

or illegally, had to pass through him first. He

took the biographical data and sent it to Cuba

for name checking, a procedure which normally

took fifteen days. 5

For example, VEGA would have handled the details of the

23. There-is

no

evidence in the OSWALD case file that

Silvia DURAN was subjected to a systematic elicitative

interrogation that would have related her dealings with

OSWALD, KRoNg

for confirmed by intercept, with the data held

on the Cuban DGI, its personalities and methods, in

Mexico City. Was it normal for a case like OSWALD's,

considering the fuss

he allegedly made with AZCUE, for the

applications to be handled

solely by a local employee and

a lame duck like AZCUE whose slot had been taken by the •

DGI chief? Whatever the answer to these questions, they

were not asked at the time. And there remains the more

fundamental question: accepting the DURAN story on its

face, could it have happened without the knowledge and

participation of the DGI personnel above cited? This

seems unlikely especially because VICA is later fited by

a Cuban DGI defector as having stated he was aware OSWALD

made several visits to the Cuban Consulate. It is clear

CASTRO's overseas intelligence and security service could

have more in its files than was surfacéd in the DURAN

was taken by Vincent Theodore LEE, the organizer of the

Fair Play

Committee for Cuba, with which OSWALD established

relations from Dallas during the period 19 April -

2 November 1963.

There is an overlap between LEE's and

VEGA's travels to Havana during that period:

departed Mexico City on 6 January for Havana and returned

on 13 February 1963.

24. The defects viewed in hindsight of the Silvia. DURAN

testimony already have been suggested above.

(In that

context of criticism it would also be relevant to reconsider

the implications of the two intercepted telephone conversations

on 26 November 1963 between the Cuban President, DORTICOS,

and his Ambassador to Mexico, Joaquim Hernandez ARMAS,

tion whether Silvia DURAN had been asked about lor been

25. As of September 1964 Silvia DURAN gave up her

Cuban Embassy job. In the spring of 1967 Silvia DURAN

was reported by a reliable and sensitive source to have

cut all relations with Cubans. Her account, in 1967/ Of

Mexico city. ALVARADO's story was ultimately broken by the

use of the polygraph, on which ALVARADO showed evidences of

deception, and by bringing ALVARADO's former Nicaraguan

security service contral into the case.

28.

The ALVARADa story is a particularly acute reper

sentation of the aliticulties that beset the evaluation of

observed evidence: certain elements of the story persist

despite the impeachment of its major premises. ALVARADO,

whose account did not becone public until the release of

the Warren Report in October 1964, talked consistently of

the presence in the Cuban Consulate transaction of a Negro

with red-dyed hair.

29. Elena GARRO de Paz is a mecurial.

articulate and

socially prominent Mexican writer, married, but separated

from a high-ranking Mexican foreign service official. She

is also the cousin of Horacio DURAN, the husband of

Silvia DURAN, cited above. There is a strong personal

antipathy between the two women descending from

Elena GARRO's trenchant anti-Conmunism.

30. From October 1964 until his retirement in the fall

of 1969, a U.S. Embassy officer, Charles THOMAS, persistently

kept up a stream of reports and memoranda reflecting GARRO's

account of what had actually gone on between OSWALD, the

Cubans and in particular Silvia DURAN in September 1963,

including a repeated reference to a Negro with red-dyed hair.

31. The, first reference to the GARRO story was noted in

a Mexico Station Memorandum of Record dated 12 October 1964:

"Elena GARRO [said) that she and her

daughter were invited to a party at the Cuban

Embassy during the period she now finds out

that OswAin was here in Mexico prior to the

assassination. She was invited by a Mexican

secretary in the Cuban Embassy whose husband

is a cousin of the GARRO family [Horacio DURAN].

At the party she saw three Gringos, not

drinking, not mixing and more or less just

standing around together like three bumps on a

1og. They were so obviously out of place that

she asked someone in the Cuban Embassy about

them and was told that 'they were just passing

through.'

She claims that on the way these

three Gringos stood out she took a good look

at them as did her daughter. When the

assassination occurred and OSWALD's picture was

spread into the newspapers, both Elena and

her daughter immediately said that he was one

of the three Gringos "without a doubt' at the

party."

32. GARRO repeated her story to Mr. Charles William

THOMAS, an Embassy political officer on 10 December 1965:

in certain particulars significantly modified her cartier

account. She also acknowledged that she and her daughter

had been interviewed by Embassy officers to whom she claimed

they did not give a very complete story because the

Embagsy officers did not appear to give much credence

to

anything they said.

34. It developed that GARRO and daughter had been.

interviewed by the Legal Attache a 12 and_24, November IIGA.

Her information had been similar to what she claimed in her

account to THOMAS but had not been substatiated bylinquiries.

The FBI representative therefore considered the matter closed

and reaffirmed his disengagement from the matter to the CIA

Chief of Station on 27 December 1964 and to the Ambassador

on 25 February 1965.

35. The Embassy Illitical Officer, however, persisted in

his interviews and reporting. In a memorandum of conversation,

13 July 1966, CARRO identified the place to which she had been

taken by CALVILLO as the Hotel Vermont. (This detail checked

out affirmatively. - GARRO was at the Hotel 23 - 24, 25 - 27

and 28 - 30 November 1963.) In another, on 7 February 1967,

CARRO's continuing

vicissitudes with the Cubans are set out.

And finally

upon

THOMAS's retirement from U.S. Government

service, the Department of State, at his request,

28 August 1969, disseminated to CIA and FBI a

compilation of

his reporting of the Elena GARRO interviews.

There the matter rests. GARRO's chronology of the

events she described, as having occurred in the Mexican capital

in September 1963 never coincided with the confirmed data

oscar CONTRERAS Lartigue, who claimed to have encountered

OSWALD with other pro-CASTRO students at the

University of Mexico campus in September 1963.

38. In June 1969 CONTRERAS was interviewed by a CIA

officer:

He studied law at the University of Mexico

approximately 1960 - 1964. He

belonged to a clandestine pro-CASTRO revolutionary

OSWALD met CONTRERAS and four other persons

held in the faculty of Philosophy. OSWALD

told the group it was urgent that he visit

CONTRERAS and others mistrusted OSWALD because

they felt he was a CIA provocation. The group

allowed OSWALD to accompany them the rest of the

However, the group ceased

Oscar CONTRERAS was never one of its leaders. No further

Apart from the unsustained claims made by CONTRERAS about

his own presence at the University, there is an additional

element that undermines the credibility of his account:

OSWALD's Spanish, which was barely adequate to get him meals

be phrased in generali-

of the natter than would a more pointed letter based on

concrete findings.

Hr. Dulles asked CIA only lor the questions

and not for a drait letter.

Ar. Kurphy suggested that wo ask

only for certain records rather than put specilic questions

to the Soviets.

Hr. Murphy suggested that these might include

Soviet hospital records connected with Lee Oswald's attempted

suicide,

city visa and registration records for loscoy and

Mins's, factory personnel records Iron Oswald's place of employ

rent, etc. - Also Oswald's diary noted that bis case had passed

through two cormissions in the ussi; we might as: for tha

records of these commissions as well.

felt necessary to explain to l. Dulles the direction of our

thinking about thesa proposals.

(Note:

I Instructed ir. Migren to prepare a

drait of

suggested queries, using the

assistance o2 DERYABIN and

to have this

ready, 1f possible, by the closa of

business today.)

Rankin stated that the Cornission wants to account

1n dotail, minute by minute and hour by hour, for Oswald's

time outside the United States.

Mr. Bagley suggested that

thè narrative chronology of Oswald's stay in the Soviat Union

be convarted to a chronology tabulation which would pernit us

more simply to insert added details and dates as we learned

of themjia other docunentation which we can expect to receive

, Shortly.

This was agreed.

(Note: I Instructed li. Wigren to begin re-

casting the narrative immediately into

this {OrM.)

Dir. Rankin said that the Comnission has a waist high

of documents and reports received from the FBI and Secret

Service which CIA has not yet received.

These include Secret

Service Interviews with Narina, Oswald, letters from Lee Oswald

In the USSR and other naterial. He promised to send this

materlal to Hr. Fielms shortly.:

(Noto: No will pass appropriate parts of this

material to DERYABIN for further analy

sis along the lines of his earlier works

on documents already in our possession. )

Messrs. Angleton. Murphy and Bocca considered REgIA

BIN'S initial analysts of Marina Oswald's documents, and the

questions to which it gave rise, to be a worthwhite and

impostant contrabution.

CIA would be unable to nate any seri-

analysister even hypothesis until some of DoRYABIN's

questions had been answered.

Mr. Rocca suggested that DERYA-

SIN's paper be recast into nore of a questionnaire form and'

ir. Bagley agreed, pointing out that DERYABIN's comment and

speculation could be put off to the side as explanatory com

ment on each question, as appropriate.

Mr. Angleton and Mr.

Murply thought that it would be desirable to send this paper

to the Warren Commission in advance of other CIA reports with

a menorandum informing the Connission that we would need

answers to this interim questionnaire in order to reconstruct

a detailed chronology of Oswald's time in the USSR and to

corment on his activity there.

The Commission would be asked

to procure the information from Marina through any Agency 1t

might choose.

G.

Hr. Angleton reported that he had asked the Commis

sion representatives certain questions pertaining to our use

of defectors_In analysing the Oswald papers:

Has the Commission formally requesting

Us

to

have

defectors analyse the material?

Wellins thought that the answer

Uto this question is yes.

However,

Mr. Angleton asked for a formal

request from the Comission to this

effect.

The FBI. has stated that 1t8

reports are not to be passed to

ATLADLE, which may cause some compl

cations.

Would the Connission be prepared to assune the

burden of responsibility

It such a delector should disa

gree with the commission's opinions of cone up vito i

radically different hypothesis of interpretation?

The persons present said that the

Commission would.

If a defector who had contributed to the analy

is of the documents should be unwilling to appear person

Ily and formally before the Commission, would th

Cornission exercise its subpoena powers agalnst hin?

Ar. Rankin thought that if there was

a risk involved for the detector, the

Commission would not do so.

However,

Rankin pronised to get a fornal anster

from the Conission on this point.

Will the classification we put on our corres

pondence to the Commission be honored?

The answer was that In principle our

cIassiftcation would be honored. How

ever, r

Bankis yarned those present

that ChA' should not hope to evade crit1-

ficution of its material.

Similarly CIA has not

The Commission representatives at the 14 January 1964

meeting estimated that the

Mr. Bagley raised the question of the desirability

of having DARYABIN participate personally, representing the

FBI as an interpreter perhaps, in a debriefing of Marina.
