SQUIB/Request For Release of Warren Commission Docunent

ACTION REQUIRED - REFERENCES

FOFIR! has been requested by an

newspaper

editor (Attachneat A) to release the Warren Commission Document

971 (CD 371 1s- Attachment B) which relates to

telephone,

calls to the

Embassy, at the tine of the assassination of

President Kennedy. His request was turned down.

As you probably

know, there has been mounting public pressure to release classified

documents of the Warren Connission.

While no decision has been

made to declassify CD 973, it is highly possible we will be asked

to do so in the near future by National Archives, which has

official custody of the documents, or by some higher authority.

2.

Station is requested to discuss. Paragraph

One above with SQUIB/Palterhis return tor

The (SQUIB:

service is mentioned in Paragraph 4 of CD 971 and release of the

document is certain to provoke questions in

CD 974 1s a U. S. Government document we need not (and should

not)

request ‹SQUID concurrence for release of the document.

He should

be informed, however, that release of co 97y to the puslic

domain

as presently under consideration; that the United

States Navy

has no objections; and that we are giving him advance notice

as

va matter of courtesy.

Any views volunteered by SQUIB/l regarding

this release should be reported proaptly to Headguarters.
