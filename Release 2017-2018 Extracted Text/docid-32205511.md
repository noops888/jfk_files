TOR. SECRET

MILITARY CONTINGENCY PLANNING

Plans Approved by the Joint Chiefs of Staff

1. CINCLANT OPLAN 308-62 - Provides for the air quarantine

of Cuba. This plan can be fully implemented in 72 hours. A range of

actions is contemplated ranging from diversion to attack and destruction

of specified aircraft.

2. CINCLANT OPLAN 312-63 - This plan provides for the rapid

application of air power against Cuba. A series of optional attack plans

are included for added flexibility of response. These options provide for:

a. The attack of a single SAM site ("'FIRE HOSE").

b. The attack of all SAM sites (''FULL HOUSE").

c. The attack of a specified target system (e. g., commun-

ications system) ("'SHOE BLACK"').

-

d. The attack of all Cuban/Soviet air detenses and anti-

shipping missile capabilities ("ROYAL FLUSH").

. e. Execution of OPLAN 312 (which includes a through a

above, plus those targets developed as a result of post strike

reconnaissance) ('RED BLUFF").

Planned reaction time varies from 12 to 72 hours; depending on the

option selected. Before offensive action is taken by the United States under

this plan, it is essential that evacuation of non-combatants from Guantanamo

and reinforcement of the base be initiated.

•3. CINCLANT OPLAN 316-63 - Provides for simultaneous coordin-

ated amphibious airborne assault of Cuba, designed to eliminate the Castro/

Communist regime. Planned reaction time from no-warning status is 18

days. This plan includes provisions for a surface blockade/quarantine.
