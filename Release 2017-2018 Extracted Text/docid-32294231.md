KNOWS ALDERISIO and KAY, but is vague about

any meetings

between ALDERISIO and EGAN and denies overhearing any threats

A review of Chicago file 166-86; Bureau file

166-450; New York file 166-102, captioned "FELIX ANTHONY

ALDERISIO, aka; ET AL; ALAN IRVING SEGAL; SEYMOUR DANIEL

SEGAL - VICTIMS; ITAR - EXTORTION" reflects that the

New York Division is office of origin in this case and

as such is in possession of the full complete facts.

Accordingly the Chicago Division is not submitting a

summary of this case and the same is being left to the

New York Office, due to the fact that this

would only

entail a duplication of effort.

PCI

and CG 6656-PC-TE both advised

that they are familiar with ALDERISIO's current activities.

Both of these individuals stated that it is impossible

to determine as to whether ALDERISIO was in Miami, Florida

in March or April, 1962,

because in dealing with ALDERISIO

no one asks him any questions or delves into his business.

The Chicago Division is not reviewing the records

of CCC pertaining to a flight ôf BRAY's from Miami to

Chicago and return inasmuch as this information was

previously obtained including the flight coupon actually

utilized by BRAY, which was forwarded to Miami by: Chicago

airtel to Miami

dated 5/6/63 (IO). For the information

of the Bureau, this information pertaining to the expense

accounts of CHARLES W. BRAY is set forth on page 4 of

report of SA JOHN P. LENIHAN at Miami dated 6/7/63.

Investigation continuing Chicago.
