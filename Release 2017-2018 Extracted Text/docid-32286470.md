the chicago Oftice has

advised that there

appears to be a possibility tharithe person using the

name NICKY MANCUSO might possibly be identical with

SAM GIANCANA, former Chicago La Cosa Nostra (LCN) leader,

who has been

self-exiled from Chicago. Chicago advised

that GIANCANA in 1958 traveled to Los Angeles with

ANTHONY J. ACCARDO, and on this occasion, information

was developed which indicated that GIANCANA used the

alias MIKE MANÇUSO.

On 4/25/68, a letter was submitted to Commissioner

MOIR kenclosing a photograph of SAM GIANCANA, and descriptive

data

on the Chicago LCh leader.

A request has been made

that 'Commissioner MOIR exhibit

this photograph and make

inquiries to determine whether or not the NICKY MANCUSO

identified at Freeport is in fact SAM GIANCANAdE(U)

The Bureau and Chicago Offiœwill be immediately
