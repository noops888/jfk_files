it was going to be between the Irish and the Italians.

that sael the

Source

left town on the l8th. FRANKLIN flew south to Florida and the

Islands.

On December 10, 1975, CV 32846-TE advise

ASH RICHAD

C. ANTIN that MORT FLANKLIN and EUGEND GIASULEn go back maybe

5 to 7 years. FANKLIN has placed numerous sports bets with

CIASULLO in years past and has even purchased a

new station

wagon from CIASULLO that was stolen and ietitled by CIASULLO.

CIASULLO maintains control of FANKLIN mainly through intimidation.

Concerning the recent bust of FRANKLIN by the Drug Enforcement

Agency (DEA), the source advised that originally CIASULLn

had been offered the deal by JOHN NANDI, but he, CIASULIO,

turned the deal down and FRANKLIN picked up the option.

On January 29, 1976, source advised SAS MICHAID C.

ARTIN and PATRICK J. FOMAN as follows:

During the initial contact that the source had with

FRANKLIN in late December, another job was mentioned by FLANNIN.

This job involved the destruction of the building that held

the records and evidence for the narcotics case against NA.DI

and FRANKLIN which caused their recent indictment and arrest.

According to the source, although FRANKLIN did not mention

NANDI's name as being behind this destruction of evideuce, souice

from his experience with FNANKLIN and his knowing FrANKLIN's

spinelessness, source believes NANDI to be the prime movei in

the destruction.

FRANKLIN instructed the source to find some-

one to handle this job, which would pay $25,000. Source was

recently told by FRANKLIN that the bombing would not occur

until the hearing which was to take place in Miami duzing the

week of January 19, 1976, and it was determined exactly how

gond a case the Government had concerning thei. narcotics

violations.

Source then mentioned that if "they," meaning the

source and his contacts, GICCO, et al, were to handle some

of the aisons for CUNNINGHAM through FRANKLIN and NADI, they

(source and others) would be in a position to learn the

details concerning the destruction of the building in Miami.

Source then mentioned there would be no harm in this, in that

no one would be killed. The source was specifically instructed

by SAs ARTIN and FOKAN that he was in no way to facilitate

or have anything whatsoever to do with any arson case involving

anyone at anytime.

The source stated that if that is how

the FBI felt, he understood and would not participate in any way..

Source stated that through personal conversation with

FRANKLIN, he learned that FhANKLIN and NANDI and CUNNINGHAM

have telephone numbers. of pay phones where they can reach one

another on a daily basis.

There are separate telephone contact

points by the specific day of the week.

Snurce advised that FRANKLIN is leaving for Florida

on January 21, 1976 and will be back in Cleveland by January 25,

1976.

The purpose of this trip is to appear in court iegarding

the narcotics violation.

The source further noted that the

reason for FRANKLIN's involvement in the arsons contemplated

by CUNNINGHAM was that FRANKLIN owes NANDI money from his bond

that was put up foi him by NAKDI. Source furthe anted that

NADI put up the bond for FrANKLIN in that he, NANDI, feels

that FIANKLIN is a weak siste: and that he, NANDI, has to

protect himself.
