Dallas T-l advised the pIlmary purpose of the

The group secondarily

attempting a full-scale raorganization.

The group recruits

basically from those who do not have criminal records and is

organized in such a manner that no one is supposed to know

the names of other members in the organization. This is to

prevent effoctive infiltration by the foverzient. Ballza 2-1

advised that the group has so irisdiate plans for action,

but that several tines locally this group has determined

of orders relayed fron higher authority in the orgarization.

These higher authorities are unbnown to Dallas I-1,.

Cult of Islan, 2150 known as

Muhamnad's Tenples of Islan

In Jantary, 1957, a source advised Elijah Muhammad

hes described his organization on a nationwide basis as the

"Nat10n 01 Isian," (NOI) and "Muhammad's Temples of Islam.".

Muhamrad is the national leader of the NOI; Muhammad's Temple

of Islam No. 2, 5335 South Greenwood Avenue, Chicago, Illinois,

1s the national headquarters of the NOI; and in mid-1960,

Muhammad and other NOI cilicials, when referring to Muhammad's

organization on a nationwide basis, commenced using either

"Mosque" or "Temple" when mentioning one of "Mubammad's Temples

of Islam."

The NOI 15 an all-Negro organization which was

originally ciganized in 1930 1n Detrot, Michigan.

Muhammad

claims to have been selected by Allah,

the Supreme Being, to

lead the so-called Negro race out of slavery in the wilderness

of North America by establishing an independent black nation

In the United States.

and his interpretation of the "Koran" believe there is no such

and that the white race, because of 1ts explitation of the

the united serenad the sonate devil eate testates

so-called Neg=oes, must

w111 be destroged in the approach-

1ng

"Har of Armageddon."

In the past, officials and members of the Noi,

Including Muhammad, hate refused to register under the provisio:

of the Selective Service Acts and have declared that members

one no allegiance to the United States.

On May 5, 1958, the first source advised Wuhammad

had, upon adrice of legal counsel, tempered his personal

statemen's and instructions to his ministers concerning the

principles of his organization 1i order to avoid possible

prosecution.by the United Sistes Government; however, he did

not indicate a2y., fundamental changes in the

teachings of his

organizat1on.

On May 7, 1964, a third source advised Muhammad

had, early in July, 1958, decided to de-emphasize the religious

aspects of the teachings of Islam and to stress the economic

benefits to be derived by those legroes who joined the NoI..

This policy change, according to Muhammad, would belp hin

acquire additional followers and create more interest in his

programs.

that George Lincoln

Rockwell had, on the previous day,

again applied for the American Nazi Party to be chartered

1n the State of Virginia, but this request was turned down

by the Virginia State Corporation Commission. This action

was taken pursuant to as act of the 1962 Virginia Assembly

which prohibits use al "Nazi" or "National Socialism" in

a Virginia chaster. This article further pointed out

that Rockwell's party is presently chartered in the State

of Virginia as the George Lincoln Rockwell Party.

On August 14, 1964, a source advised that the

ANP - WIFENS was Organized by George Lincoln Rockwell at

his residence in Arlington, Virginia, on Februarg 26, 1959,

as an international "National Socialist" movement based

on the German Nazi Party headed by Adolf Bitier.

that Rockwell is the dominant force and personality in

this party; that he is espousing? "line" of hatred against

the Jews and Negroes; and that he is seeking, through

speeches, distributich o1 literature and picketing, to

establish

a conesive and dominant political party in the

United States and 1n foreiga countries.

According to the "Storntrooper's Manual," ar

for power are fourfold, nameiy,
