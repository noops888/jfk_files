Mr: Colby::: I might just precede the questioning by

a general statement which I can make off the top of my

head because I was very closely involved in those days with

Vietnam.

I served in Vietnam as the Deputy first and then the

Chief of Station from February 1959 to June 1962. When I

returned from Vietnam I became Chief of the Far Eastern.

in. Vietnam and the consequently degree of attention that it

got from our press.

This focussed particularly on the weak-

nesses of the diem regime and some of the misdeeds Involved

in it.

There was a high degree of criticism and our yovernment

was faced with the problem of supporting a regime against

Communist insurgency that had defects and this gave our

government a problem as to its position with respect to such

a government and such defects.

There was concern in the executive branch and in the

Congress and in the public about this whäch dominated the

discussion of our policy toward Vietnam.

My role in this was to provide Intelligence from Vietnan

when I was there and to continue to assure that intelligence

was provided from here.

A good deal of: the intelligence critical of the regime

stemmed from our reporting from

clandestine. sources.within

the government and the business socicty of South Vietnam,

but I confess that my assessment as distinct from the indi-

vidual reports sent in was that the Diem regime was about

was acting as his special adviser and with particular concern

for political matters and general advice on the development

of the war. And in my extensive conversations with Mr:

Nhu over the years we together discussed the counter-insurgency

problem and how it should be organized ai

much agreed that the key

to it was to build strength at the local village and hamlet

as. I remember, something on the order of some tens of thou

sands of armed villagers up in the high lands, down in the

Delta, and various other places, and these became experimental

models for the development of Mr. Nhu's concept of this

strategic hamlet...

He then documented the strategic hamlet

as a concept and imposed it upon the Administration of

of 1961, and about a year or year and a half later it began

to show some results and begun to pick up some momentum.

•At this time the government had troubles with the

Buddhists which broke out in a riot up in northern Vietnam,

In Hue, a riot in which a grenade was dropped and there were

various allegations asito who dropped: the grenade.

The Buddhists went into essential opposition to the

government during this period.:: You will recall 'it was

particularly marked by the self-immolation of one of the

Banzis in a fire that he poured gasoline on himself.. This,

of course, was a dramatic presentation. of the fact that there

were a lot of people opposed to President Diem "In Vietnam:

Certain people chand I willidentity

which departments and agencies later i but certain believed

that the Diem regime was both reprehensible and would arouse

such opposition from, its own people that it would be impossible

for it to

rally the necessary support to win the conflict against

the Communists.

They held this position in good faith.

The other people belfeved that there was enough going on

In the countryside where the roar world was being rought,

that these political issues were essentially educated city-

urban problems and that the basic. conflict in the countryside

was gradually being: built through the strategic hamlet

program and other programs to other counter-insurgency pro-

grams and that the key to the problem was our interest in

supporting Vietnam against a Communist insurgency and a

Communist takeover,

and that that part

of the war seemed to

be moving along with problems but; nonetheless, seemed to be

moving along, and that we were not apt to get a better govern-

ment if we went into any change of government or opposed the

government.

There was very little doubt following the general con-

sensus of policy at that time that it was in the United

States' interests to help preserve a free South Vietnam

against a Communist takeover in South Vietnam.

Whu, there had been a suggestion some wecks before, which was

received from an officer of the Vietnamese, that there were

various things that could be done about the government problem

there, and one of the alternatives was the assassination of the

station Chief had taken with the Ambassador and did not neces-

All right, proceed.

Mr. Colby. Mr. Chairman, when Mr. Conein went over to

the headquarters and participated in the command center during

the running of the coup, he kept the station continually

advised.

There were discussions as to the state of the war and

how it was going. There were meetings. here in Washington where

the information was provided to the government, as a whole,

Ther e were a series of meetings and a series of

directives given and the news that President Diem and his

brother Nhu had been assassinated, were dead, first came to

us in a message which started with Mr. Conein, who was told

by one of the generals; General Minh, thät they had committed

suicide, and this was publicly announced by the government

at that time. It was on its race Incredible to Mr: conein when

he heard it from the General because both were very strong

Catholics and he just doubted that they would have done

such a thing.

There was a withdrawal in essence in the conversation

from that story.

He was offered a chance to look at the

bodies but turned it down.

What was actually done, apparently, and we have tried

to reconstruct this, is that there was a telephone conversa-

tion between President Diem and the generals.. There were

several of them. And President Diem was very strongly

rejecting them, calling them to discipline, and so forth,

in the earlier stages.

At a later stage, in the early morning of November lst,

he called and indicated that he would surrender if he would

be properly handled.. The generals then sent somebody down to

receive that surrender and found that President Diem was not

Apparently, the decision was taken by several of the

when they got him.

They sent an officer, a small armored

unit out to pick him up after they found out where he was

down in the other part of town.

He and his brother were putin an armored personnel

carrier with an officer, a young Vietnamese officer who was

an aide to General Minh, head of the coup group, and they

went into the armored personnel carrier and when the carrier

arrived back at headquarters

the two were dead and had been

shot several times:

That officer incidentally in a rather bizarre aspect

of this was himself apparently executed when this junta of

generals was. overthrown about two months later. Somebody

took that occasion to shoot him.:

In retrospect.one.must-realize.that, thore was..how-

course, I think it is fair to say that in launching a violent

overthrow of a regime involved such as this, people are going

to get hurt, and in this case the leaders were killed in the

process:

Now, there is one postectipt to this I would like to

cover. Mr. Chairman, because it is worth mentioning.

When Mr. Conein went to the headquarters on the 30th of

october, I think it was, the night before the coup, he

carried with him five million plasters. That five million

piasters had been put in his safe at his home, a day or so

before by our Chief of station.

That is about $65,000,

as I remember the figure in the way it adds up. He was

specifically asked by the officer who called him telling

him to come to bring some money with him. He did. And when

he got there he

gave some of the money, three million of it,

to the officers and it was apparently used to support, to

give to certain troop units that joined the coup. The

leaders of certain units that came with the coup..: I can't

name which ones but the generals, in other words, used it

to help attract the support of certain additional units:

The remainder he gave another sum, a couple of days

later, which was given under his belief, and the reguest

was that he give that to compensate the families of

Individuals killed during the coup, the soldiers and so

Iorth. This 1s a frequent custom in'the Vietnamese, some

kind of an award is given to the families astde from the

particular activity.

Now, that money stemmed from a station decision to put

the money available there.

The action of giving the money

over was taken at the station level. It certainly was con-.

sistent in the station's view with an exchange of several

cables over the past several weeks which had indicated

that the Ambassador said that it may prove necessary to

give some money in the course of this activity.

There was one message from Washington which referred

to whether money would, be necessary às a part of this

overall effort, and a key quotation which I do not find in

this summary but I think is very important, which is a

message which was sent, I think, a day before, part of

which is quoted in this document -- but the additional

part of which is quoted, a message from Mr. Bundy to

Ambssador Lodge. The number of the message is 79407. And

it discussed that our policy with respect to abstaining

to u.s. forces becoming

Senator Tower. What you are saying is the passage of

Mr. Colby. Totally consistent with the policy at

that time. There is a question as to the degree Ambassador

Lodge was aware of all of this. He was aware of "Mi. Conein's

dealings over

the months in great detail and he has stated

that many times.

There is absolutely no reservation. He was not aware

apparently of this money, of the fact of the money being

taken at the time. He had, of course, himself in his own

so, the action by the station was consistent With

what he had obviously indicated was part of the thing that

had to be done, but frankly in dealing with Ambassador Lodge

out there on the details of some of these things it became

a habit of the station and they felt his

reeling of the

degree of detail' in depth he wanted to get Into things

and some things they brought to his attention and some

things he really just delegated off, and this one was not

brought to his attention.

Senator Tower. Mr. Colby, I think I understand the

Oriental mentality better than most Americans.and I am

certain you understand it far better

than I, so you would

expect really in a military coup that the targets of the

coup would be assassinated; wouldn't you, that is their

sort of way of doing business over there?

MI. Colby. Not necessarily.

Senator Tower.

They are not so naive to think they

would have bought them a nice villa in Paris?

Mr. Colby. Not necessarily.

Actually Mr. Conein during that night while the

thing was being launched was discussing with them before

they made the decision to assassinate, bringing an American

aircraft in and bringing it in and putting the brothers on

the aircraft and then taking them out of the country and

taking them to exile, and they specifically asked him if he

We then got into a very complicated problem, that apparently

It was decided that we didn't want the aircraft to come from

either Taipel or the Philippines and it would have to be

brought from Guam, which would take

24 hours to arrange, which

sounds a little unreal, but that was the answer given.

Senator Huddleston: In retrospect.. do you think that

if the President had been at the appointed place at the

appointed time, rather than slipping.out to the other section

of town, that he might not have been assassinated?

MI. Colby. I think he might not have been. I don't

know for sure.

I think that they were excited and they were tense and

I think they got excited and considered this trickery and --

Senator Huddleston.

MI. Colby. No; I think it was more a feeling that they

that really is the motive at the bottom of it.

the effect that the highest ter

authority in Washington wanted

to know where Diem was.:

Conein then returned to the headquarters and by that

time they had all of the ministers of the government there,

to Diem and General Minh told him that he had committed suicido

disbelief of it and General Minh replied the bodies were

You are undoubtedly in the civil. law category of a co-conspira-

tor:. But I think when" you are dealing with a sovereign

foreign group or power that at some point. the decision as

to what is actually to be done withinga general policy

frame is taken by someone else rather than yourself.

I am trying to draw a distinction here which a lawyer would

not admit because of the conspiracy.

Senator Morgan. . :

I want: to say, Mr. Chairman, no one

on this committee recognizes any more than I do the need.for

a strong Central Intelligence Agency, and the one question,

the central question that I have been trying to follow ever

since we have been in these hearings is is the CIA an

arm of government that acts somewhat irresponsibly on its own,

or has it been a responsible and controlled agency of

government that was carrying out policy of higher authority?

I am not interested in placing blame, because as far as

I am concerned the recommendations that this committee ought

to make are going to hinge to

a large degree on where the

action originated from.

Now, the thing I think in this situation, your

conspiracy situation, we might have tried to back away

but we didn't complete the back away. Mr. Conein, is that

back away, the telegram or cable we talked about earlier, that

Conein then, it seems to me what makes me think it was a

CYA proposition, he delivers a message but he goes out on

the balcony.:

This frankly concerns me more than anything

we have heard.

MI. Colby. Remember, this was a couple weeks before,

that the thought of assassination was not aimed at President

Diem, It was aimed at the two brothers who were considered

the evil influence in the government, and the thought

process was that of those advocating it,. the foreigners who

were advocating.

If you eliminate these two evil fluences then President

Diem can remain as President and we. can patch together a

good operation.

Senator Huddleston. Farlier in.your testimony you

mentioned receiving a telegram from the State Department re-

lating to at least investigating the possibilities of a coup.

Is it common for a station director: to receive direct instruc-

tions from the State Department or from the Forty Committee

or from the white House or from just where?

Mr. Colby. That telegram was a telegram from the State

Department to the Ambassador.

Senator. Huddleston. Is it the usual chain of command?

Mr. Colby. That is the usual:

Senator Huddleston. For the CIA to receive its in-

structions?

Mr. Colby. Well, the CIA got 'a copy of the telegram.

Senator Tower:

Mr. Colby. And CIA was. in receipt of a telephone call

before it was sent..

Senator Huddleston. What I really want to know, you

as station agent in Saigon, what is the one source that is your

ultimate instruction to do something.

Mr. Colby. Obviously a station chief has several chiefs.

Mr. Colby. He was under instruction to follow the

Ambassador's directives.,

Senator Huddleston. Is that the usual chain of commana,

that once the National Security Council or whoever makes the

determination as to what we are going to do, do they then

have the State Department convey that message to the CIA through

the Ambassador to that particular country, or is that set up

seprately everywhere?

Mr. Colby. I think policy is normally transferred from

the National Security Council to the Ambassador.

The

Ambassador is the President's representative and has overall

authority of all agencies. in that country and, therefore, an

important question like this would be passed to the Ambassa-

dor to handle.

Now; the other agencies in town would be informed of

the policy directive that we might have additional communica-

tion as the details as to how to implement them, which in

this case were done through directive to our station chief

to make sure that he operated very directly and immediately

under the

control of the Ambassador.

Senator Huddleston. Where does the director of the

The state Department wouldn't lasue

an order directly: to a station without going through the Director

of the CIA?

Mr. Colby. Well, in this situation we were having

almost daily meetings with senior officials. in the CIA,

State Department, Defense Department and so forth, in:

the basement of the white llouse, and there is no question

that this was national policy and hammered

out.

Mr. Colby. Frequently. At these meetings, these were

that we should not move against the . Diem government, we

should continue to work with it.

Mr. Colby®

The clear. development of u.s.policy

against the regime. The most eritical ching. think, to

the Vietnamese, and I don't think it was perceived as this

important to the Americans, was the suspension of our commercial

import program, because this said to the Vietnamese that

American assistance is being suspended from the Diem regime.

Senator Huddleston..

Who in our government: was: 50

unhappy with Diem?

Mr. Colby. Most of the people in the State Department

and National Security Council staff. " This became an indi-

vidual matter, quite frankly.

There is an article here in the washington Post in

September which sort of, I think, pretty clearly states it.

U.S. Policy toward South Vietname has come to a standstill

while the Pentagon and CIA on one side of the pot arguo it out,

with the State Department on the other.

Senator Huddleston. Is this '62?

MI. Colby. '63.

You can have it.

Senator Tower... Let me just say one thing. I think

this underscores the difficulty we are going to be confronted

with several times on the committee, that is, making a dis-

tinction between the CIA acting on its own and acting as an

instrument of national policy made. by somebody else. We are

going to be in the position, I suppose, by hindsight question-

Is there any doubt in your mind had it not been for the

United States insistence that the generals would not have

ever initiated the coup?

Mr. Colby. There is no doubt in my mind. I believe that,

frankly, I belleve that the five years which intervened be-

tween 1963 and '68 were years of chaos leading to the commitment

if the war was not to be lost, five hundred thousand

American soldiers, and we ended up in '68 with a President of

South Vietnam who was about like President Diem.

Senator Muddleston. I take it you still think your

original decision was correct?

stand that we cannot from Washington give you detailed instruc-

contacts may have kept the pot boiling on this thing. It

should be read into the record from the Inspector. General's

report certain cables, traffic and other memoranda from pages

32, 33 and 35 of these articles.

On 9 October the President of the United States

at a news conference in connection with the transfer of the

station chief of Saigon, Mr. John Richardson, was asked

question concerning the CIA being under control or out of con-

trol because there had been some articles in the press that the

CIA was running an assassination operation and stated the

following.

I know the transfer of Mr.. John Richardson, who is a

very dedicated public servant had led to some question, but

I can assure you flatly that the CIA has not carried out any

independent activities but is operated under close control

of the Director of Central Intelligence operating under and

with the cooperation of the National Security Council and

under my instructions:

that the U:S: exchange of government or denied ecomomic or ni

military assistance to Nhu regime if it appeared capable of

increasing effectiveness of military effort, insuring popular

support to win the war and improving work relations with the

The cable urges the contact with Minh press for detailed

information clearly indicating that Minh plans over a high

prospect of success.

Inaddition to these thoughts, it indicates that the

cable had been discussed

with the President of the United

States.

Later, on 10 October, DCI briefed the Foreign Relations

committee and gave the position of the CIA in its operations

in Saigon which was a matter of record.

I believe that the next comment is very appropriate

and should be read into the record.

Apparently there was some concern in Washington onthe

part of Mr. MeGeorge Bundy that Mr. Lodge and General

Harkins and the CIA should pull back temporarily from the

generals and the following was in a cable to Saigon of 24

October.

Eyes only for Lodge and Harkins from Bundy.

It seems wise to maintain close control over meetings between

The Immediate response on the same day, a CIA cable to

saigon, Bundy from Lodge indicates In part, I have, personally

approved each meeting between General Don and Conein who has

carried out my orders in each Instance explicitly.

On the 25th of October there was a Presidential meeting

immediately thereafter at which all details of this matter

were again discussed and are a matter of record before the

committce.

Mr. Schwarz.. I have understood from other sources some-

thing that is not in the report, which may have some 'bearing

on the attitude at the very moment of the coup, and that is

there was a telephone call from Diem to Lodge in which

Ambassador Lodge offered to help Diem get out of the country?

Mr. Colby. There is a state telegram, yes, which I

don't have, but which Diem called lodge and said that he was

having trouble with -- that an attack, an effort was being

made against him by his generals, and that he believed it

essential to put this down. He offered to, he urged that

the United States consult General Lansdale and me by name

because we understood something about this tiatuion there.

never politically objected to our actions flying in and

out of Vietnam, did 1t?

Mr. Colby. I don't think so. I think probably it didn't

want to associate Vietnam.': At that period there was a con-

siderable concern that our presence in South Vietnam would

somehow be translated into an act antagonistic to Mainland

China and get us into more trouble up there 1f we got too

closely involved with Taiwan.

Mr. Schwarz.. Did we have planes: in Vietnam at that time.

•Mr. Colby. I am sure we had air attache planes there.

Senator Tower.

Wasn't Air America opcrating there then?

Mr. Colby.

Idon't think yet. I am not sure.

MI. Kirbow. The largest aircraft availableat the time

would have been a C-46 or C-47 type?.

Mr. Colby Probably China Airlines under contract to us

then. China Airplanes, not CAT. CAT was Air America.

Senator Tower. Yes, I know.

Mr. Colby. I guess you are right, we did have air-

craft there for some

reason of another, and I don't know the

answer as to why we didn't use that.

Senator Huddleston. You are saying though that that

answer or that decision was

outside of the cIA?

MI. Colby. Yes, sir.

Senator Huddleston. The Ambassador himself?

McCone to the station chief,: that is put in the double negative

but in effect says don't associate yourself with the assassina-

tion, the question whether that was passed on to Mr. Conein put

not.

MI. Schwarz.:

Assuming that to be the fact, does it

tell the committee anything and what lessons could be

drawn from it, what kind of reasons are there for the

lack of communication on such matters between persons in the

agencies or persons in the agencies and outside of the.

Mr. Colby. Conein doesn't remember the incident.

Because it might have come in through someone else. That

• Mr. Kirbow. He does not.

Mr. Colhy.. The proposal was made to a different officer.

Mr. Kirbow. At this time he does not appear to be aware

of either: the submitted recommendation to the Ambassador

or the telegram that came out and indicates he would not

necessarily have. known from the cable traffic unless he heard

it at a meeting which was being

run practically everyday among

the senior CIA station personnel.

MI. Colby:I have a feeling in my mind, which I would

have to examine and clarify in the record, (a) that this pro-

posal came to us from somebody other than, through someone other

than Conein. Wehad another officer in touch with other

generals and so forth at that period and Idon't know whether

the advice was passed

back through that channel or not.

Mr. Schwarz: As a matter of general practice, the

attitude expressed by the McCone telegram was presumably

important and Mr. Conein was at least a significant actor,

whether or not he was the source of the telegram which Mr.

McCone responded to:

Mr. Colby..

Well, I, think that in terms of my experience

I would say that this is not a subject that you want to

talk about very much. You certainly don't want to participate,

stimulate, encourage or assistin

V9/:

On the other hand, if a total independent force has its

own independent reasons for proceeding, we hear of these, we

get reports of proposed assassinations and so forth... in our

regular reporting, and sometimes we warn people and sometimes

we don't. It depends on the overall situation. It doesn't

have any involvement with us. I mean hut it is an intelligence

report in a sense and then the action as to what to do about

it.

I think that, consequently, so long as it is clear that

we aren't involved in it, and that is what was wrong with

that particular message, is that it indicated support of the

idea, and that was immediately responded to.

If the message had merely been reported by the station

to the Ambassador that this proposal had been made by a

Vietnamese, I doubt that there would have been a cable from

Washington.

Mr. Schwarz. But once you knew the problem existed,

and Mr. Concin was the most important action officer with

Mr. Colby. Oh, yes:

• Mr. Schwarz: It was not. important to inform him of the

attitude of the Director concerning assansinations because

that attitude only extended to making sure that the United

States had no apparent. involvement.

Is that what you were saying?

MI. Colby. No involvement.

MI. Schwarz.

No Involvement.

If it was, McCone's attitude was the U.S. should have

no. involvement and Conein was the person most closely asso-

clated with the generals and the subject had come up. I

can't understand why he would not as a matter of ordinary

course be notified of the McCone telegram.

Mr: Colby. Because no proposal of the American involve-

ment was made through him. If this is another individual, as

I suspect it was.

Excuse me. It was Conein. I beg your

pardon.

In a meeting with Conein General Minh requetted a state-

ment of the u.s. position, said it did not expect U.s. support

of a coup effort but did need U.s. government assurances that

the U.s. would not try to thwart his plans. le outlined the.

three possible plans.

One, assassination of the two brothers,

keeping Diem in office, encircling of saigon by various

military elements, and thirdly, direct confrontation between

military units involved in the coup and loyalist military units

in Saigon. This was early October. This was the first effort

to generate an overthrow and this was replied to, this overall

proposal.

The first step was the immediate response with respect

to the assassination.

Mr. Schwarz.

"It is doubly important to understand (a)

whether Mr. Conein was notified and (b) if not, why not. And

I only have it from Mr. Kirbow's description of his interview

that he does not recall being notified.

Mr: Kirbow.. That is my recollection, MI. Chairman. I

guessMr.. Conein would be the best evidence. He will appear this

afternoon before the committee.

Mr. Colby. It the next meeting with General Don

Conein, under instructions, and I believe that means under

instructions from the Ambassador, passed the word that, passed

the word consitent with the response really to Minh's sugges-

tion of how they would, do it, why we do not wish to stimulate

a coup, we do not wish to leave the impression the u.s. would

thwart a change of government or deny military assistance

to a new regime if it appeared, et cetera, et cetera, to

win the war and improve the working relationship with the u.s..

The cable urges that Conein press for detailed information,

clearly indicating that Minh's plans offered a high prospect

of success.

government in response to the proposal by Minh, which included

those three courses of action, was that the United States would

not stimulate but it wouldn't thwart, and that it would con-

tinue assistance without commenting.on any one of thöse three

courses of action.

Mr. Schwarz

Then let's see'if we can understand what

that record says.

A proposal was made by Minh to Cönein that there

were three ways to accomplish a coup,' one of which was by

assassination.

McCone sent back a telegram

to someone other than Conein?

Mr. Colby.: Immediately.

Mr. Schwarz. which said the U.S. should not actively

condone assassination. As fat as the written record shows,

the next contact is between, the next relevant contact is

between Conein and Minh and there is no statement in this con-

tact one

way or the other about assassinations.

Mr. Colby. That is right; nor in the message from

washington which dealt with the whole, the three proposals.

Mr.. Schwarz. So the message from McCone to Vietnam, as

far

as the written record shows, and we have to explore this

further, obviously, suggests that the statement the U.s.

shall not condone assassinations just never got past Don to

the

generals.

Mr. Colby. That is right. The u.s, would not involve

subsequent meetings that Conein had with General Minh at

all?

MI. Colby. The general made the proposal,

described how

he would go at it, the three alternate positions, and the re-

would not stimulate a coup but it wouldn't thwart it: and.

the political section and the Ambassador, was much more sympa-

thetic to the proposition that the war could not success-

fully be conducted with President Diem still in power without

a major charge in his style of operation. However, there is

an additional factor in this which was the public pressure

on the policy levels of our government in Washington, and

in the United States, and I think this public pressure was felt

particularly by the people in the National Security Council

and

by the people in the State Department.

Senator Hart of Colorado. That public pressure --

Mr. Colby. WAs one of distaste for President Diem.

And it meshed with what the

Mr. Colby.

Xes,

sir there is Justification for'it.

Senator. Hart of Colorado. What was the Defense Department's

position on all' of this?

MI. Colby.! The Defense Department was almost totally

on the position that the war is in the countryside, that the

:?T'

countryside seems to be going along rcasonably well, that this

•is an urban problem, urban political problem which should not

Interfere with the main things going on.

This was true of the Secretary and General Harking out

there and the Joint Chiefs here and so forth.

Senator lart of Colorado.

When you say this thing should

not interfere -

MI. Colby. The political problems of niem with the dissi-

dents, political dissidents in the urban centers.

Senator lart of Colorado: Therefore, their conclusion

was it was no great matter,we should get rid of him?

Mr. Colby.

The most dramatic way in which this was

posed, this has been descrihed publicly a number of times, was

that at one time, particularly the frustrating period the

president faced with

these two strong positions, he

sent two officers, one a general Crewlack, who was an assistant

to Secretary. McNamara and

a Mr. Mendelhay, who had formerly

been the political counsellor in saigon, to saigon for about

five days to make an assessment on the spot and they came

back to the Cabinet Room and one sat on

one end of the room

and one sat on the other and General Crewlack first said he

had been to 20 privinces and talked to 20 province chiefs and

30 military chiefs and all that sort of thing and the war

business going on basically all right and there were some

problems but the thing :was they seemed to have a strategy

and they seemed to be moving along on it, and Mendelhay said

he want to three cities and talked to lots of civil servants

and political people and all the rest of it and there was

a general feeling that the cause was hopeless because there

was so much distaste for President Diem and so much opposi-

tion and the general feeling that the war could not be won.

And the President, of course, looked at them and said

did you two fellows go to the same country?

And the answer

is they did. They looked at two different parts of the elephant.

Mr. Colby. Excuse me, if I may.

I think the answer to your question, Senator, is

one that I have used with many foreigners, that you cannot

expect the American government to carry out a course of

action

which does not have the support of its people, that it just

won't work, and that if there is no public support of a

course of action the American government will move to a differ-

ent course of action, and that is

the way we run our country.

Senator lluddleston.. It sometimes takes a long time to

filter through, though?

MI. Colby. Yes, sir.

Senator Huddleston. I was going to inquire whether or

not there was ever any serious attempt on the part of our

government to persuade the President that he should leave

office voluntarily.

Did we express to him our unhappiness with the situation?

Mr. Colby.. We certainly discussed Mr. Nhu's leaving

Vietnam at various times.

I don't remember any.

There was

almost no contact, direct contact between our Ambassador Lodg

President Diem was a very special character in communicating

You had to spend about four hours listening to his dis-

to the Vietnamese Constitution and his office as president.

He was very stiff about his position as president. I don't

very clear.

Senator Huddleston. Wasn't there a telephone call or

conversation or a call in which the Ambassador indicated that

he would help him get out of the country?

MI. Colby.. I believe so.

Mr. Schwarz. It is not in your report?

Mr. Colby. No, it doesn't really have much to do with our

Senator Huddleston. Wouldn't that also have been

perhaps the reason he left the palace and went to another

location?

MI. Colby.. He left the palace because it was going to

be overrun.

Senator Huddleston.

He wasn't going to another loca-

thon where he might be picked up by the Americans and taken out

of the country, as he was led to belleve we would help him?

• Mr. Colby.

We had no contact with him after the coup

started after. the phone calls.

Mr. Kirbow. The record reveals the generals informed

him if he did not surrender they were going to totally

destroy the palace, and apparently from the record he was not

there while he was

making these phone calls, he was over in the

Cholan district, having left the day before from the palace

and having taken his children with

him.

Senator Hart of Michigan.. I think some of us were

struck by your statement that there was rclatively little

communication over this period with President Diem. You menn

of any sort or simply with respect to the suggestion he

leave?

MI. Colby, By the Ambassador himself. There was a lot

of contact. Aamiral felt, who was the CINCPAC, visited with

president Diem on the morning of the coup, and the generals

held up the coup long enough to escort Admiral felt to the:

repaired to the general staff headquarters and launched the

Senator Hart of Michigan.

I am backing up perhaps

a matter of months trying to understand.

We took certain actions, P.L. 480, for example, in-.

tending

that it persuade President Diem to fly right?

Did not the Ambassador go in and explain to him that that

was the purpose for this suspension, or was it just to be

understood by osmosis?

Mr. Colby. There

wan't very much direct contact of that

sort; I don't think. It was clear. from the public position be-

cause President Kennedy in a press conference, incidentally,

referred to the departure of certain personalities, which was

clearly a reference to Ngo Dinh Nhu. I have forgotten the exact

phrasing of it. But that was clear reference to the fact

we felt it necessary and that is really what the issue all hung

up on because we had identified Ngu as such a nepharious in-

fluence that if we could just get him out of the country,

and I mean out of the country, no assassination or

anything like that, out of the country, that then we could

manage the operation, and that was the official position..

I thought it was wrong but at one point I said fine,

why don't we go over and try to get him to leave in order

him to leave?

Mr. Colby.

No, I didn't.

Senator Tower. Any further questions?

senator Mathias?

Senator. Mathias. Thank you, MI. Chairman. I would like

to go back to a statement that Mr. Colby made sometime ago in

which he referred to many meetings in the basement of the white

House.

As I recall! MeGeorge Bundy and Walt Rostow had two

small offices down on the ground floor level and is that the

area that you are referring to?

Mr. Colby. Well, not their actual office but there is

a little conference room there called the situation room

where this kind of meeting takes place and still does.

Senator Mathias. Right. And who would typically be

involved in those conferences?

MI. Colby. Oh, at that time Mr. Bundy, Mr. Ball,

certainly Mr. Forrestal, Mr. Hillsman, Mr. MeCone, myself!

Mr. McNamara, Gilpatric, General Taylor, others perhaps or not

depending on the situation at that time.

In other words, the senior levels of the different

departments involved, and generally,I think, generally not

the Attorney Gencial. If we met with the President we met in

There would be quite a few of those where the President would

be up there and that would be upstairs in the Cabinet Room, but

not every day except sometimes it was every day, when it got

particularly hot and heavy.

Senator Mathias.

Now, when you say every day, does

that mean a downstairs meeting or upstairs meeting?

MI. Colby. Downstairs meetings every day.

Senator Mathias. It was every day?

MI. Colby. Almost, more or less.

And upstairs meetings. Sometimes every day and some-

times not.

Senator Mathias. And the Attorney General was

generally present at the upstairs meetings?

Mr. Colby. Yes, sir.

Senator Mathias. But not at the downstairs?

Mr. Colby. Not at the downstairs, as I remember. I am

dealing with an impression here.

Senator Mathias. I understand. And I think what we

are trying: to get at is a flavor of the direction.

present?

Mr. Colby. I think of him as Mr. Bundy's replacement,

really, and I am not sure whether he was there at that time or

not. Mr. Harriman would come sometimes, as I recall.

Senator Mathias. How about Vice President Johnson, dia

he ever attend any of those?

Mr. Colby.

He would

attend the upstairs ones.

Senator Mathias. He did attend the upstairs ones.

MI. Colby. A number of them.

Senator Mathias.

Did he take an active part?

Mr. Colby. No, he did not particularly. Certainly

he did not take what amounted to at that time in that

community a public position. What advice he may have given

the President alone I don't know. I don't recall his being

heavily involved:

Senator Mathias. Ambassador Nolting has said on various

occasions that Vice President Johnson was the principal spokcs

man in that circle for decreasing rather than increasing

our activities in Vietnam.

Did you ever get that feeling in any way at these meet-

ings?

that the whole move against Diem was a mistake. I don't

recall anything particularly on the degree of our involve-

See sta

ment, his feelings about, the degree of our involvement at

that time.

Senator Mathias,

How did you get the feeling that Lyn-

don Johnson was against; the Diem movement?

Mr. Colby®

Upwell, he Indicated very strongly after the

event and I think such

as he did say at the time indicated some

his vete

reserve, but interpreted, as a Vice: President doesn't take any

kind of a public argument position with the president, it

really is not very appropriate in that kind of

situation and

whatever private position he may have had he would have handled

outside of the gaze of, the lower level bureaucrats such

as

myself.

Senator Mathias.: Ambassador Holting was very much

opposed to any action:

Mr Colby.

Ambassador Nolting, of course, was replaced

in August. He was in Greece when the raid on the pagotas

took place. .

He was out of contact and was not aware of

that. When he did return to washington a week or two later he

took a very

active role opposing actions against President.

Diem to the extent he was invited to participate. And his

advice was not accepted.

Senator Mathias.. His pleas. fell on deaf ears as

far as

this was concerned?

MI. Colby: Yes, sir:

Any other members?

Senator Morgan. I have one. other question.: Reading

from this report, Mr. Colby, dated August 28, the CIA cable

from Saigon, it says Richardson reports that "The situation

here has reached the point of no return unless the generals

are neutralized before able to launch their operation. we

believe they will like and have a good chance of winning.

We all understand that the efforts must

succeed and that

whatever needs to be done on our part must be done."

Apparently at that point whatever action we had set

in motion Richardson felt was irrevocable.

Mr. Colby.

You will recall that followed the August

24 telegram which essentially told us to go out and see

what you can get down. Richardson's feeling there was that

we had launched something and that it was going to take place.

The generals then came back thereafter

and said no, we are

not going to do it. That is the sequence that occurred.

Senator MOrgan. One other question. Who is Marguarite

Higgins, the gal who --

Mr. Colby:. She is a reporter.

Senator Morgan. She apparently had all of the facts,

didn't she?

Mr. Colby. Yes. And a lot of this has been published in

all the books that have been written.

Do any of the Senators have questions? If not, I will.

Mr. Schwarz. I just have one question following up on.

your first exchange with Senator Morgan earlier in the morning

In focussing on the Trujillo matter and on

this matter, both

were

instances whatever was done was done by dissident

nationalists. In the Trujillo case there was some effort.

after the Bay of Pigs to slow down or pull back. In this case

there was some effort to disassociate, although I think not an

effort to slow down or pull back.

Is it a fair generalization to make that where the

United States seeks.to accomplish objectives through foreign

nationalists, It is difficult for the United States to

control: the actions of those foreign nationalists?:

MI. Colby. Certainly the foreigner makes his own

decisions at various times the degree to which he is going to

do one thing or the other.

The U.S. cannot control it.

The U.s. can assist him, the U.s: can

counsel him and

advise him, perhaps influence him, but the control, that is where

I got, Senator Morgon, when you are dealing with essentially

another sovereign, why there are limits to your degree of

authority over them.

Mr. Schwarz.

So when you start them down or we

start them down the path of overthrowing a government, it

follows from the comments you have just made and indeed from

the record as we have seen it, that even if we change our

mind as to whether that is a desirable result, we may not

be able to stop it from happening, we may not be able to stop

the consequences of the events we have set in motion?

Mr. Colby. Yes, except for the point of starting them

down. I don't think you can say that the United States has

the total decision there,

either. Because the decision to move

in a certain direction is a decision that they basically

make on their own. We may be able in a supporting, we may be

suggesting, simulating, indicating support for, but we do not

MI. Schwarz..

Once that is down, it follows, doesn't

it, from what we have gone through, that even if the govern-

ment changes its mind about the result, it is no longer able

to be sure it can control the result?

Mr. Colby. • Not entirely. It depends on the

situation. I can envisage a situation where we do reach

consensus that we ought to do a certain course of action.

We then have reservations about it. We consult with them and

we then indicate that we will no longer support it and they

then at that point they have the decision to decide whether

they have themselves enough force to go ahead with it, or

they are so limited that they can no longer go ahead with it.

This does occur in various ways of influencing people.

It occurs particularly in an agency relationship. If you

develop an agency relationship, not just to be an agent

to report intelligence to you, and. we aro having this a little

bit with some of our agents now, that we indicated that we would

work together, that they would give us information, we would

support them, give them some funds and so forth. If part

of the arrangement on our side becomes non-existent any more

and our current problem is they are concerned whether we can

keep their identity secret, there is an inclination on their

part to cool down the activity, and this is happening in this

sense today. It also can happen by decision on our

part to no longer do that particular activity, and we have a

number of relationships with forcign intelligence services,

for example, by saying, well, here is a certain program but

then we cut it off.

One example in this context was the program of

American support of the special forces in Vietnam. The

Agency was giving support to the special forces.

We helped

to get it started and formed it up, the Vietnamese

special

forces. As part of the pressure on the government in the

August period and in response to the fact that the special

forces with Victnamese military and with Vietnamese police

had conducted the raid on pagotas, CIA was directed to suspeni

its assistance to the special forces.

We did not suspend our assistance to the police or to

In a simple way I think that

has had a certain influence in what they did. I know it re-

where we said we would continue to support them.

Senator. Tower. Mr. Colby, I think that concludes our

questioning on this matter. Let me ask you a question that I

think is pertinent in the light of the event that occurred

last evening, that I will no doubt be quizzed about.

Does the CIA maintain any current and continuing contact

with any members of the underworld?

Mr. Colby. Well, Mr. Chairman, we have penetrations for

intelligence purposes of various criminal elements abroad.

Senator Tower.

I mean domestic underworld.

MI. Colby. The

answer, domestically in the United States,

not to my knowledge, and I believe we do not.

Senator Tower. You have no contacts that would provide

you with any information on the demise of Mr. Giancana?

Mr. Colby. I know nothing of that demise. I have no

connection with it and I can

say with, I believe, full

assurance, that CIA had no connection with it whatsoever.

charter to get involved after
