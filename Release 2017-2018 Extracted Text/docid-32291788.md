CG T-6 advised in late April, 1967, that a close

associate of CHARLES GIANCANA, the brother of SAM GIANCANA,

recently indicated to him that as of that time SAMUEL GIANCANA

"was still in Mexico.'U

IV. MISCELLANEOUS

CG T-7 advised in late March, 1967, that at that

time he received information that Chicago attorneys had been

requested through an intermediary on behalf of SAM GIANCANA

to conduct research to determine the identity of a country,

preferably in Latin America, where GIANCANA could reside and

not be susceptible to extradition or to being served by

the United States Government with a subpoena. The informant

noted that previously GIANCANA had made a request in this

regard insofar as Mexico was concerned and had been informed

that. Mexico would not be such a place. U

Intelligence and Investigations, Ottawa and

Windosr, Ontario,

were contacted regarding the possible appearance of

subject

in Windsor,

during the night club engagement of the MC GUIRE

Sisters.

Mr. HERST advised that all individuals in Windsor,

where the Mc GUIRE Sisters were appearing and at their hotel,

had been alerted to the possible appearance of subject.

On March 20, 1967, Mr. HERST advised that

not appeared in Windsor during the MC GUIRE Sisters' engagement.

Constable CHARLES BRUCHETT,

RCMP, Windsor, Ontario,

Canada, advised on March 9 and 20, 1967, that subject had not

appeared in the Windsor, Ontario,

Canada, area during the

engagements of the MC GUIRE Sisters.
