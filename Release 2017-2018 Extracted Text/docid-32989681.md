D. Manual on accounting procedures and account codes.

There is no overall manual on accounting procedures as such.

Due to the overwhelming increase in demands for financial data

regarding FBI operations and to meet requirements of the

general Accounting Office, an intensive effort to modernize

the

accounting system has been initiated. As a result, the

EBI's accounting manual is being formulated, however, this

manual has not progressed to that point where it can be disseminated.

There are now a General Ledger Instruction Manual and a Payroll

Manual which because of their volume and questionable assistance

to the committee have not been duplicated Ior the committee.

We believe a logical approach would be to have these items

reviewed by staff members of the Committee to ascertain

* t0g mendere at

their value

to the Committee and whether they should be

duplicated.

There is ättached a copy of the FBI Code Book.

criminal, security, and extremist matters.

review would require

month for which the information is required. The requirement

so sa teque ap coximately one man day he equirement

for any more detailed information relating to the payment of

informants would necessitate an indepth review of each

payment document and it is estinated it would take approximately

one man month to review all of the payment documents covering

a one-month period.

The information which the House Select Committee

hopes to receive from a count of the number of payments made

by the FBI to confidential informants is not known.

However,

the FBI believes that this information will prove of very

little benefit in understanding the Confidential Informant

Program. It is believed that if the House Select Comnittee

were to

describe in more detail the type information they

wish to receive that it would be possible to more readily

provide much more descriptive information of this program at

less cost to the Bureau.

Attached is a Departmental memorandum enclosing

two letters from Chairman Otis G. Pike of the House Select Committee

a retire de totan ere e regat, or tea on tre ta i ne

respectively, and contain general requests for information from the

Bureau. The 7-22-75 request asks for copies of all documents furnished

by the FBI to the Senate Select Committee, all documents and materials

relating to budgetary authority and procedures, all budget information.

for the past 15 years, and any "General Counsel's" opinions of the

authorities, mandates, or charters of the EBI. The request of 7-24-75

requests the Bureau make available to Committee staff members Richard

Vermeire and James B. F. Oliphant documents and material relating

to budgetary matters as contained in their aforementioned letter of 7-22=75.

This particular letter states Vermeire and Oliphant have received security L

clearances.

The Department asks in their memorandum that they

• be

advised whether Vermeire and Oliphant had been cleared for access,

to classified documents. After checking with SA Leon F. Schwartz of

the Intelligence Division, the Department was advised that Vermeire and

Oliphant had not as yet been granted clearances. This was the result

of a misunderstanding bỳ Chairman Pike as to the established procedures

for the granting of such clearances by the CIA. Representatives of the

CIA have explained the procedures to Congressman Pike. Michael E.

Shaheen, Jr, Deputy Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination of

the Department, was advised 7-29-75 of the fact Vermeire and Oliphant

had not been issued clearances.

make material concerning budgetary matters available. As to the request

concerning all material furnished the Senate Select Committee, Shaheen

indicated he would make a further study of this particular request and

l advise the Bureau as to the mode and type of response to be given.

In accordance with the desires of Mr. Shaheen and

in coordination with the Administration Division, a briefing has been w A s

arranged for 7-29-75 concerning budgetary matters by Assistant Director

Eugene W. Walsh. Mr. Shaheen was advised of this arrangement and

was very appreciative. He indicated it was obvious from the type of

requests in his conversations with the House Committee staff members

that they were lacking in the expertise concerning Bureau matters compared

to that existing in the Senate Select Committee.

ACTION:

As soon as further clarification is obtained from

Mr. Shaheen as to the type of Bureau response concerning other than

we will prèpare the appropriate responses.

Reference is made to memo Walsh to Mr. Jenkins dated

8/5/75 (copy attached) and attached communications from the House

Select Committee requesting information, interviews, and testimony We

of Bureau officials beginning at 10 AM on 8/7/75.

A part of the information being requested by the House Select

Committee relates to informants, confidential funds, and the Bureau's

procedures related thereto. 'The Computer Systems Division (CSD) has

been requested to prepare responses to questions raised in categories

F (4), H, and J. After reviewing the House Select Committee's request in

depth, it is the opinion of the CSD that the Committee is not requesting the

information be made available in preparation for the Bureau's testimony

beginning on Thursday. In the second paragraph in the letter from A. Searle

Field, Staff Director and Chief Counsel, for the House Select Committee

to Mr. K. William O'Connor, Special Counsel for Intelligence Coordination,

U. S. Department of Justice, the request is made to be given "... immediate

access to the following materials:". It appears then that rather than requesting

the information itself, the House Select Committee is requesting to be given

access to that information.

EX-1OZ RE0162116464

In reviewing the items related to informants and payment

matters, it is obvious the requested access would disclose the entire Bureal

operation and allydocumentation relating to confidential informants over

the Select Committee is given access to confidential informant informationges

Memorandum Neudorfer to Decker

Re: HOUSTUDY

it should be with the qualification that they will not be given access to any

information which will disclose the location or identity of the informant.

The information to which they have access should be the general policies

and procedures for handling this program and any monetary intormation

on an accumulated or gross payments basis. It is recommended the

information made available to the House Select Committee covering policies

and procedures be the same as that recently provided the Department of

Justice in this area.

It should also be recognized that the very general areas of

interest contained in this letter would present insurmountable problems

should we be required to provide information to meet these requests in the

future. It should be noted that almost all of our payments to informants are

multiple payments and the documentation of individual payments to informants

for any significant period of time (even for several months) would be a

monumental task and basically shut down our operation for handling our

routine work. Of course, their request under "all data pertaining to

confidential funds and payment procedures relating thereto" is so general

that they have given no limit to the documentation that we would have to

supply and we could not really respond in total unless we gave them every

available piece of documentation in existence in the Bureau on this matter.

It is further necessary then to come to some agreeable limit with the House

Select Committee as to the amounts and types of information we would have

to supply if it becomes necessary to actually provide the information in the

future.

RECOMMENDATION:

That this matter be brought to the attention of the Legal Counsel

and Administrative Divisions so that they may respond to the House Select

Committee and additionally negotiate reasonable limits to the amount of

information which might be supplied in the future.

ADDITIONAL VEINS ON THE HONORABLE

" JOHN BANDERSON*

At this critical impasso in the intelligence inquiry, the House must

decide whether it simply wants to play agame of reverse musical chairs

with its intelligence.committeo.(add more chairs for more/players

to march in wider circles to the same tune)

, or whethen it irantsito

seize.on the moment to take a inore constructive step forward by both

completing the present investigation and creating a more permanent

intelligence oversight mechanism for the Congress

House Resolution 591 adopts the former approach in the hope that

dilution is the solution (especially if certain active and inactive in-

gredients can be separated in the process). This yould seem to be a

workable formula (assuming the new solvent mixes well with the

base). But no mix of magic potions (or metaphors) can cloud the

fact that we are going to rather lengthy extremes to accomplish a very

of removing one or two members,

with an expanded membership.

As long as we're going to all this trouble, would it not make sense

to accomplish more in the process, namely, taking the first step toward

creating a permanent joint committee on intelligence oversight! Is

there any reason to wait another six months or more for the Flouse

and Senate intelligence committees to make this inevitable recom-

mendation, especially when it has already been proposed by the Rocke-

feller and Murphy commissions and numerous bills and resolutions

have been introduced to implement this proposal?

I intend to offer a substitute resolution aimed at achieving the dual

objectives of completing the present investigation and moving forward

on the joint committee proposal. Under the terms of my substitute, as

soon as the House adopts a bill or resolution creating a permanent

joint committee on' intelligence oversight (by whatever name), It shall

be in order to immediately appoint the flouse members for the purpose

of assuming the full authority presently delegated to our Select Com-

mittee on Intelligence. The House half of the joint committee would

serve as an interim ad hoc committee on intolligence until such time

that the Senate takes final action on the joint committee proposal. The

interim ad hoc committee would operate under the provisions and

Committee would be transferred to the interim ad hoc committee.

The main objection raised to this proposal is that there would be a

Jull in the investigation between the adoption of my resolution and

subsequent House action on the joint committee measure. I do not

think this presents a significant problem in that the chairman of the

Rules Committee pledged on July 10 to set hearings on the joint com-

mittee proposal at the earliest convenience of the committee. And, as

Sec. 5. To enable the select committee to carry. out the purposes of

this resolution, it is authorized to employ investigators, attorneys, con-

sultants, or organizations thereof, and clerical, stenographic, and other

assistance.

SEc. 6. (a) The select committee shall institute and carry out such

rules and procedures as it may deem necessary to prevent (1) the dis-

closure, outside the select committee, of any information relating to the

activities of the Central Intelligence Agency of any other department

or agency of the fedoral Government engaged in intelligence activi-

investigation, not authorized by the select committee to be disclosed;

This is to record a meeting .on.6/4/75 at CIA Headquarters to

review a drait copy of security regulations proposed by captioned Committee.

The meeting was attended by Mr. Richard Rininger, Intelligence Committee

Staff, CIA; John Greaney, Office of General Counsel, CIA; Robert Andrews, Office

of General Counsel, Defense Department, and SA Fred B. Griffith.

Mr. Rininger advised the rules of the House Select Committee as

well as a Committee draft of proposed security regulations were scheduled for

discussion. He said a discussion of the rules would be moot inasmuch as it was

his understanding they had already been approved and adopted by the Committee.

The discussion centered on the proposed security regulations wih the thought in

mind to make them more acceptable to the intelligence community if agreed to

by the Committee. Mr. Rininger stated it was necessary for him to prepare a

memorandum on 6/4/75 for Mr. Ick Boos, Administrative Assistant to

Congressman Lucien N. Nedzi, setting forth intelligence community recom-

mendations inasmuch as he understood the security regulations were to be voted

on by the Committee on 6/5/75. Participants in this conference then went over

the proposed security regulations point by point in an effort to plug loopholes

in order to protect classified information which will necessarily be made avail-

able to the Committee. This included requirements for a secure storage area,

a registry of classified information received from the intelligence community

and the implementation of strict need-to-know requirements.

Compartmented

information, designated by the contributing agency, was included in these provisions.

The question of appropriate security clearances was resolved in favor of requiring

such clearances be granted by the Chairman based upon information furnished him

by appropriate investigative agencies. It was also recommended access to the

committee space be limited to members of the Committee and staff personnel and

outside of the

requirement for the Committee Security Officer to insure classified documents

are returned to the secure storage area when not in use. A provision for

•sticipation a employment for violation of these regulations was added.

Congressman Nedzi has resigned this date as Chairman

of above-captioned committee.

We currently have ready for

delivery several summaxies containing results of investigations

conducted for the HSC. \ Others will be coming due. At the

request of the Chairman these summaries are directed and

delivered to him.

Since a new Chairman has not been named

we are holding the summaries in abeyance until a new Chairman

has been designated to whom we can disseminate results of

investigations.

It has been determined by SA Richard Taylor, Legal

Analysis Office, that a new Chairman will probably not be

named until the first part of the week of June 16. When a

new Chairman has been designated the summary memoranda which

have accumulated will be delivered to him by SA Taylor who

will explain the reason for the delivery of such a large

number of summaries at one time. This has been coordinated

with the Legal Analysis Office.

ACTION:

Attached for approval was a revised draft of the Memorandum of

Understanding concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members

with opinion expressed by John M. Clarke, Associate Deputy,

Intelligence Community Staff, and Donald E. Moore, Chairman,

Security Committee, U.S. Intelligence Board, a copy of the

Memorandum of Understanding will not be furnished to Senator Church.

The revised draft is to be furnished the Attorney General for

his approval.

It is felt that we are confronted with a complex legal

problem here and it would appear that if the Senate Select

Committee is a party to the Memorandum of Understanding, it is

entitled to a copy of such communication to prevent any

derstanding in the future and to

Memorandum to Mr. Cleveland

Re:

Senate and House Select Committees

on Intelligence Activities

Referenced memorandum pointed out that Mr. Clarke

and Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's

Committee was already following the procedures outlined in

the Memorandum of Understanding, and had completed the

Committee Staff, it would be inappropriate to furnish a

copy

of the Memorandum of Understanding to Senator Church.

How

would the Senate Select Committee know it is following the

procedures outlined in:the Memorandum of Understanding if

it does not have a copy? Does it have a copy of DCID 1/14

which has been, and possibly still is, classified?

The FBI has now received a request for a total

of 122 investigations from the Senate Select Committee.

This is many more than anticipated with all expenses absorbed

by the

FBI in connection with a function of the Legislative

Branch.

In addition, 16 requests have been received to

date from the House Select Committee, Also the FBI has been

asked by the Senate Select Committee to conduct additional

investigation concerning Patricia Ann Monaco, already employed

by the Committee, who admits living with Neal Stevens up

to 4-75, and frequenting a lounge known as a hangout for

prostitutes.

Neal Stevens has said he engaged "in all forms

'of sexual activities" with Monaco. There is also the definite

possibility that we will have to process many of these cases

under the Freedom of Information Act and the Privacy Act of 1974.

To date notification has been received from the

Director of Central Intelligence (CIA) thät a total of 49

employees of the Senate Select Committee have been certified

as meeting requirements of EO 10450 (Security Requirements

for Government Employment) for access to classified information

up to and including Top Secret. Of this number, 17 staff

members have been briefed on compartmented information and an

additional 5 staff members designated to receive compartmented

information. From the above it is not clear that, as stated

by Mr. Clarke and Mr. Moore, that the Senate Select Committee

"had completed the Committee

It is noted that CIA refers to EÓ 10450 but the.

Memorandum of Understanding, as approved by CIA, does

not

refer to EO 10450.

"Senstudy 75" dated 2/6/75, you were advised that

"Senstudy 75" is the code word for the control file (62-116395)

containing all communications relating to the Senate Select

Committee's (SSC) investigation and study of Governmental

operations with respect to intelligence activities.

911.

In mid-February, 1975, the House of Representatives

created a Select Committee on Intelligence Activities which

will have virtually the same jurisdiction, and responsibilities

as the above sSC.

To date, practically all our work has been

related to the SSC and only very recently has the House

Select Committee (HSC) made any efforts to commence staffing.

As it appears, we can expect in the near tuture

requests from the HSC similar to that already received from

the SSC and in order to facilitate the administrative handling:

and retrieval, where necessary, of HSC requests and this Bureau '8.

response to same, the code word "Houstudy 75" is being assigned

to the control file (62-116464) containing all communications

pertaining to the HSC and related matters.

Dear Bill:

Haustide 75

Director Soc'y -

On Thursday, May 29, 1975, SA John Dennis Miller,

Legal Analysis Office, met with Searl Field, Staff Director,

and John 1. Boos, Chief Counsel of the captioned Committee.

Field and Boos maintain their office in Room 433, Cannon House

Office Building. The telephone number is 225-9751.

SA Miller expressed the Bureau's desire to cooperate

with the Committee and offered his assistance.

Field has not selected

an individual to head the task

force for the Justice Department. Most of the attention of this

task force will be directed at the FBI.

Arrangements were made

for SA Miller to meet the head of the Justice task force as soon

as possible after he is selected.

Field is considering asking each of the intelligence

agencies to inform the Committee of their structures and operations

by presenting a one half hour briefing. If held, the FBI briefing

will be scheduled around June 15, 1975, and will include a

description of the organizational structure of the Bureau, the

authority for its operations, its relationship with the Attorney

General, the Executive, Congress, and other intelligence agencies,

Changes in the Bureau since the death of Mr. Hoover, and

suggestions from the Bureau of specific problems or areas: of

Interest which the Committee should address.

Field anticipates his staff REC-102 62-1/6b64

will request the FBI to

furnish some documents to it for review.

SA Miller explained"

the Chairman of the Committee should ask for FBI documents by

writing a letter to the Attorney General.

SA MiSlersuggested

he be notified when a request for documents is in preparation

so that the FBI will be able to begin work on the request as

rapidly as possible.

Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams, Memo

Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

Field also anticipates interviews of former and current

employees and, because of the Watergate experiences, his staff

may not desire to notify the FBI of all of these interviews.

SA Miller told Field neither the Committee nor its staff would

find an investigation of the FBI analogous to Watergate.

Field agreed. He thought 90% of the FBI's work is

good, 50% is outstanding, and there are questions about 5%.

Some of the questions concern the value of some intelligence

activities as compared with the cost of them.

On the same day, SAs Richard I. Taylor and John Dennis

Miller met with Representative Lucien N. Nedzi (D-Mich), the

Committee Chairman.

SA Miller told Mr. Nedzi of the Bureau's

desire to cooperate with the Chairman's Committee and asked the

Chairman to feel free to call him whenever he could be of

assistance. Mr. Nedzi expressed his appreciation.

Mr. Nedzi asked that the results of FBI background

investigations of the Committee staff be delivered to him

personally.

RECOMMENDATION:

(1) Legal Anälysis Office will maintain liaison

with the Select Committee and its staff, such liaison to

include meeting with the head of the Justice task force as

soon as he is

selected and discussing with him relevant topics

of interest, including the interviewing of former and present

FBI employees.

(2) Legal Analysis Office will deliver the results of

FBI background investigations of the Committee staff personally

to Chairman Nedzi.

Memorandum. W. R. Wannali to Mi. J. A. Minta 4/11/75010049

recommended that a draft of the proposed Memorandum of Understanding

concerning clearance procedures for Staff Members of the captioned

Committees be coordinated with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and

other appropriate members of the intelligence community.

On 6/2/75 the draft Memorandum of Understanding

was dis

cussed by SA L. F. Schwartz with Mr. John M. Clarke, Associate

Deputy, Intelligence Community Staff, and Mr. Donald E. Moore,

Chairman, Security Committee, U. S. Intelligence Board, who advised

that the draft had been reviewed by CIA and by the Security

Committee on behalf of the intelligence community. They requested

that the draft be revised in order to recognize the need for certain?

Staff Members to be cleared for access to compartmented information

(a procedure already being followed by the Church Committee) and

the desire of the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) that it

be made clear that the DCI will only offer his advice upon the

request of the Committee Chairman and that in all cases the final

Attached is a revised draft of the Memorandum of

ORI

Understanding incorporating the changes proposed by Mr. Clarkeand

Mr. Moore which changes are underscored.

Both Mr. Clarke and

Mr. Moore were of the opinion that since Senator Church's Committee

was already following the procedures outlined in the Memorandum of

Understanding, and had completed the Committee Staff, it would be

inappropriate to furnish a copy of the Memorandum of Understanding

to Senator ChurChEL INFORMATION, CONTAINE. !

Legal Counsel to Adams, Memo

Re:

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

Five task forces will be formed. Oné task force will

work with CIA and the National Security Council, the second

with the Department of Justice and its agencies

(including the

FBl), the third with the Department of Defense and its agencies,

the fourth with the National Security Agency, and the fifth

with other agencies including the Internal Revenue Service.

The head of each task force will be assisted by

Itwo or three "lawyer-investigator types" (Mr. Field's words)

and three or four clerical employees. Approximately 42 to 45

staff employees will be hired including, 20 to 22 professionals.

Also, great use will be made of consultants.

The staff has begun to collect public information

and informally has contacted the Rockefeller Commission and

the Senate. Select Committee about access, if any, to their

trom intelligençe agencies

The staff anticipates requesting information

in June, 1975.

The staff plans to present to the Committee for

its general information a general outline of the structure

and functions of the intelligence agencies.

Congressman Edwards (D-Calif.) thought most Members

Iwill do as much of the investigative work as they can, and

suggested a one or two day visit by the Committee at the

agencies for an orientation would be informative and helpful.

Representative McClory (R-Ill.) said he and

Representative Kasten (R-Wisc.) visited

the CIA and thought

the visit beneficial.

The Committee adjourned subject to the call of the

chair.

After adjournment, J. D. Miller advised Representative

Edwards that if the Committee desired to visit FBI Headquarters,

Miller will do whatever he can to assist the Committee.

Miller also met Mr. Field, Staff Director, and Jack

3o0s, Staff Member. Miller offered his assistance to Mr. BOO:

(formerly a member of Chairman Nedzi's (D-Mich.) staff). Cir-

cumstances did not permit a conversation with Mr. Field.

Rememos Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams dated 4/9/75 -ana 4/25/75,

concerning above-captioned matter, copies attached.

Liaison with Capitol Hill by the Office of Legal Counsel resulted

in an arrangement whereby Laboratory representatives could meet with those

members of the Capitol Police Force handling security surveys for the

U. S. Congress.

Laboratory personnel met with members of the Capitol Police

Force on 5/6/75 and 5/8/75 at their headquarters, 331 First Street, NE,

Washington, D. C.

At the meeting on 5/6/75 an examination of their survey

equipment revealed that it was adequate, however it did not meet the level

of sophistication or quality available at the present state of the art.

Further discussion revealed that the training received by members of the

police force handling their responsibility was limited.

•On 5/8/75 Laboratory Supervisors Wilbur G. Stevens and Joseph B.

•Parsons met with Chief James M. Powell and some of his staff members whicl

included Deputy Chief Garner, Captain Brannon, Head of the Investigative

Unit, and Lieutenant Bell, Head of the Bomo Disposal Unit.

The discussion

at this meeting centered around steps which could be taken to update their

present security survey equipment as well as additional measures which

could be put into practice to enhance their technical expertise in this

area.

Laboratory personnel furnished them with the names of manufacturers.

of additional survey equipment as well as suggestions as to the establish?,

ment of an in-house training program.

Memorandum W. E. Harward to Mr. Cochran

RE :

SECURITY SURVEYS - SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

ACTIVITIES - HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE ACTIVITIES -

CAPITOL POLICE DEPARTMENT

At the conclusion of this conference, Chief Powell expressed

his sincere appreciation to the Bureau for the excellent help and

guidance extended to him and his staff in this matter of mutual interest,

and expressed the hope that he could call on us again in the event he

or his staff needed to tap our resevoir of knowledge.

The Chief Was

assured that we would be available if needed in this capacity. I

It appears that the Capitol Police Force has been forced into

the untenable position of handling this responsibility for the Congress, .

and as a result are attempting to establish some degree of self-reliance

and outward credibility being completely inexperienced in this area of

technical expertise.

Because of this, it is felt that the Bureau should

move cautiously in any continuing liaison with the Capitol Police.

concerning security survey matters.

• RECOMMENDATION :

It is recommended that any continuing liaison with the

Capitol Hill Police Force be handled by mature and experienced

Special Agent Supervisors, who are completely familiar with security

survey matters.

Reference Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memorandum of

4-9-75 to which the Intelligence Division placed an addendum dated

4-14-75 showing that Roderick Hills, Counsel to the President, had

requested that the Sergeants at Arms of the Serate and House of

Representatives keep the Bureau advised regarding checks made for

electronic listening devices in the offices of captioned Select Committees.

This was discussed on 4-23-75 by Inspector Bowers with

Senate Sergeant at Arms William Wannall and his Deputy, Robert Hough.

They were amenable to notifying us concerning the checks they make of

Senate Select Committee space and the offices of the Members of this

• Committee. Hough was designated by Wannall to handle this matter.

Hough advised that the special Capitol Police unit had made a check

of Room S146 in the Capitol on that date (4-23-75) prior to a meeting

of the Senate Select Committee in that room and found nothing. Hough

stated they have received no requests whatever to make any checks of

the offices of individual Committée Members. He said he had discussed

this matter with William Miller, Staff Director of the Select Committee,

and Miller indicated it would bé taken up with the Committee but he has

heard nothing further from him.

captioned as above.

By referenced memorandum dated 3/12/75, Legal Counsel

recommended that the Intelligence Division (INTD) discuss with

representatives of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and other

members of the intelligence community procedures for clearing

staff members of captioned committees for access to classified

information when questions as to the

individual's trustworthiness

have arisen in the course of the FBI's background investigation.

Following such discussions, Legal Counsel recommended that a

Memorandum of Understanding concerning these matters be prepared

by the INTD which might be used by both Senate and House

Committees.

By memorandum 3/25/75; the INTD submitted for approval

a draft of a proposed Memorandum of Understanding concerning

clearance procedures for staff members of captioned committees.

Special Investigative Division disagreed with several features

of our draft memorandum and has prepared a revised memorandum,

which is attached for approval.

The INID has coordinated this matter with the Special

Investigative Division and

interposes no objection to the text

of the levised memorandum; however, it is suggested that considera

SElECT COMMiTTEE

ON INTElligENCE

This memorandum records the formal establishment

a task force entitled Project Senstudy 75.

The concept behind the establishment of this Project

is to develop a capability of implementing requests received

from Select Committees of the Congress in a comprehensive and

timely fashion but yet allow the Bureau to continue to conduct

its day-to-day business in as normal a manner as possible.

We believe that by creating this facility we will be able to

meet the requirements of these Select Committees with the

exception of the research that will have to be done in the

substantive Divisions.

Congress. They will receive all requests and deliver all

responses to these Committees.

In addition, they will meet

Memorandum to Mr. W. R. Wannall

Re:

Senstudy 75

Because of the White House insistence that all requests

and responses be completely coordinated and available for review

by White House representatives, it is imperative that the Project

have a self-sustained records facility to insure immediate access

to requests received from and responses furnished to the Select

Committees.

In addition, in those instances where certain FBI

documents furnished to the Select Committees must be sanitized

(excised), it is imperative this records facility not only retain

the sanitized documents but also copies of the original

For these reasons a senior clerical employee has been

requested to function as a Records Manager for the Project.

In addition to the above, there will be stenographic

and clerical personnel assigned to the Project to support the

work of the Bureau Supervisors.

We have not connitted any more

personnel to the Project than

are absolutely necessary at the

present time.

Should the requests of the Select Committees

require additional personnel, appropriate memoranda will be

submitted with

a complete justification for additional personnel

assigned to the

Project.

Although the physical space for

the Project is

limited, all personnel connected with Project Senstudy 75

will be located in Room 4063, J. Edgar Hoover Building. This

space is physically located within the Intelligence Division.

As a matter of interest, Mr. James Wilderotter,

| Associate Counsel to the President, has requested that should

any member of the intelligence community get requests from other

Committees of the Congress which impact on the intelligence

sensitivity that coordination is required, copies of both the

requests and an abstract of the responses should be made

available to the Interagency Registry.

For information and record purposes.

With the proliferation of committees in Congress looking into

FBI operations, it is essential that a standard procedure for the forwarding o

documents to the requesting committees be established. Inasmuch as request

such as the request of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

have been forwarded to this Bureau through the Department, it would appear

logical that responses to such inquiries and all other inquiries of Congressional

committees,

whether they be directed to the Department and/or the Bureau,

be responded to through the Department. Such a procedure not only will make

all our responses consistent but will also give the Department an opportunity

review and approve documents being made available to Congress.

In connection with our preparation of responses to requests di

Congressional committees, it is suggested that all responses should be by

Mr. Adams memorandum to Mr. Callahan dated 3/7/75,

captioned as above, copy attached, reported our conversation with

Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi.

As indicated in Mr. Adams' memorandum, Congressman

Nedzi asked that we prepare a memorandum of understanding to be

approved by CIA, FBI, and the House Committee concerning

investigative and clearance procedures for members of the Committee's

staff. It appeared appropriate to us to coordinate a memorandum

of understanding to be drafted for the House Committee with that to be

drafted for the Senate Committee. Therefore, following our return from

the meeting with Senator Church and Congressman Nedzi, I called Bill

Miller and advised him of the request made by Congressman Nedzi for us

to prepare a proposed memorandum of understanding. I asked him whether

it would be possible for us to coordinate the language of that memorandum

with the understanding that it will be drafted for use by the CIA, other

members of the intelligence community, and the Church Committee.

Mr.

Miller said that the proposal to coordinate the memorandum was completely

acceptable to him and he requested that the draft memorandum being

prepared for Congressman Nedzi be furnished him for review and possible

adoption as the memorandum to be used by the Senate Committee.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the Intelligence Division discuss this matter with

representatives of CIA and other appropriate members of the intelligence

community and prepare a draft memorandum of understanding that may be

used by both House and Senate committees.

On 3/7/75 Mr. Mintz and I called on Senator Church and his

staff director, Bill Miller, to further discuss the procedures for

investigating and clearing staff employees of the Committee, particularly

where information might be developed raising a question as to the propriety

of a clearance. It had previously been approved that the FBI would conduct

the background investigations, furnishing the results to Senator Church,

and after his determination that the individuals met the required criteria

for access to classified information he would notify. CIA of his determination

and intent to employ the individual involved, at which time CIA would grant

the necessary clearance based on the certification by Senator Church.

In discussions between CIA and FBI representatives, we raised

the question as to whether CIA would review the results of the investigation

prior to granting clearances and CIA representatives indicated they did

not intend to and were reluctant to inquire of Senator Church as to whether

they could be furnished the results of any investigations involving derogatory

information.

In discussing this matter with Senator Church, I inquired whether

he had any objection to our bringing to the attention of CIA any questionable

cases in order that CIA representatives, who have the responsibility of

granting the actual clearances, would be in a position to advise and counsel

with Senator Church on those individual cases. He had absolutely no objection

to this and, in fact, felt there should be an open communication between

FBI, CIA and his Committee to insure that no one was appointed and cleared

who did not measure up in every respect from a security standpoint.

Re: SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

formerly employed by CIA and resigned in December, 1974, after his

clearance for sensitive compartmented information had been lifted as a

result of his marrying an alien. This marriage would not preclude him

from clearance for access to lesser degrees of sensitive material but

only for the more sophisticated clearances. Mr. Miller advised that Sloan

had not been appointed and was not going to be appointed because of other

reasons unrelated to a security clearance.

Senator Church indicated that he felt it would be wise to prepare

• a memorandum outlining our security clearance procedures and his staff

would be glad to prepare such a document.

Following the meeting with Senator Church, Mr. Mintz and I

dropped by to see Congressman Nedzi, Chairman of the House Committee,

and delivered to him Mr. Kelley's letter congratulating him and offering

him our complete cooperation.

Chairman Nedzi stated that he was very

appreciative of this offer and would consider Mr. Kelley's request to confer

with him as an open invitation and as soon as things had shaken down he would

be in touch with us.

We discussed with him the investigative and clearance procedures

we were following with the Senate Committee and Chairman Nedzi agreed

the same procedures should be followed with his Committee, including our

making available to CIA any derogatory information which might be pertinent to

a clearance determination. At first, he suggested that we send the results

of our investigations to CIA before coming to the Committee but then

concluded that it would be more appropriate for them to come to him first

since some of the applicants under consideration would probably not be

appointed. He specifically asked that we prepare a memorandum of under-

standing to be approved by CIA, FBI and himself.

I asked Mr. Nedzi whether he felt the formulation of his Committee

would serve to trim down the number of requests for information being received

from various House committees and it was his opinion that it would help in

some instances; however, in others committee chairmen would pursue their

own inquiries.

He personally did not feel he had the clout nor the desire to

try to preempt this area entirely for his Committee. He also stated he

felt that CIA's problems had in the main been fully exposed and would soon be

of less concern, whereas the concern over domestic security policies of

the FBI would undoubtedly be greater in the future. He expressed his

appreciation for our cooperation and indicated he was striving for a

responsible approach to the inquiry.

Following the meeting with Mr. Nedzi, Mr. Mintz and l agreed

that it would be best for us to prepare a proposed memorandum of under-

standing concerning the investigative and clearance procedures for both

Committees in order to try to insure uniformity, and Mr. Mintz will get •

in touch with Bill Miller to seek his concurrence in that regard. Our efforts

will be coordinated with CIA and the proposed memorandum as drawn up

will be submitted for the Director's approval.

This memorandum reports the results of a meeting

of the Ad Hoc Coordinating Group on Congressional Review of

crystar

the Intelligence Community, (hereafter referred to as the

Group), held on 3/7/75.

The Group is chaired by Mr. John Clarke, Associate

• Deputy to the Director of Central Intelligence, and is made

up of representatives of agencies and departments having

membership on the United States Intelligence Board (USIB).

Its

purpose is to serve as a coordinating mechanism for future

testimony before various Congressional committees.

At the meeting of the Group on 3/7/75 the following

items were discussed:

congressman robert Mcclory has. been designated as

the minority leader of the House Select Committee

Copies of

the

annexes prepared by various members'of the Intelligence

• Community have been delivered to both the majority and minority

leader of the House Select Committee. Congressman McClory is

very security conscious, is concerned that sensitive relation-

ships are not inadvertently disclosed during forthcoming hearings

and according to Mr. John Clarke appears to have no questions

regarding FBl authority to engage in domestic surveillances.

CIA has prepared a draft letter to Senator Church releasing

CIA employees from any obligations imposed upon them by CIA's

Secrecy Agreement (draft copy furnished the Legal Counsel

On March 7, 1975, Associate Deputy Attorney General

Wilderotter called me and said that he had just returned from a

Mr. Wilderotter said that it was the consensus of the group

that the Department of Justice's responses in regard to the impeachment

inquiries, the COINTELPRO public statements, the Congressional hearings,

and the recent publicity concerning Congressman Drinan were classic

examples of how the Executive Branch should respond. It was their view

that the Department had kept its honor in tact. They suggested that the

Department adopt, a policy in regara to captioned committee of being super

cooperative in the beginning in order to build up credibility to use when

necessary for the President to invoke Executive Privilege. Director Colby

was opposed to that position and stated that the Congress should drag

out of the Executive all of the information it seeks. 62-116464-5

I reminded Mr. Wilderotter' of the fact that Director Colby

had indicated a very compliant attitude in regard to the Rockefeller

Commission and in fact Colby had a memorandum prepared releasing

his employees from the secrecy agreement and instructing them to

cooperate with the Congressional committees. Wilderotter said that

Colby said that at was not a carefully considered memorandum. In

regard to the Rockefeller Commission, Colby's position was that it was

nesessary for him to comply because of provisions in-the Executive Order

requiring cooperation.

Re: HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE

Mr. Wilderotter said that Senator Church has made a

request for a transcript of all of the Rockefeller Commission

proceedings and he understands that that request is being considered

by the Commission.

Mr. Wilderotter said that at the conclusion of his meeting

at the White House, Marty Hoffman requested that a notebook be prepared

of press clippings relating to the impeachment proceedings, plus any

other public record sources showing leaks of national security information

by Congressional committees. Mr. Wilderotter said that such material

would be used in negotiating security arrangements with the Congressional

committees.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the External Affairs Division prepare a compilation

of public source news items indicating leaks of national security

information from Congressional committees for submission to the

Reference Legal Counsel to Mr. Adams memorandum of

2-26-75 captioned, "Security With Respect to the House Select Committee on

Intelligence Activities and the House Subcommittee.on Civil Rights and

Constitutional Rights."

By appointment, Inspector Bowers called on Congressman

Lucien Nedzi (D-Mich.), Chairman of captioned Committee, on 3-3-75 and

discussed with him the matter of security clearances for members of the

staff. The Congressman was advised that arrangements had been worked out

with Senator Frank Church (D-Idaho), Chairman of the Senate Select Committee,

whereby CIA would issue a specific clearance for staff personnel following a

full field investigation by the FBI and certification that clearance was justified

by the Committee Chairman based on guidelines which the intelligence community

recommended be followed. He was told that a representative from CIA would

the handch ith lass indenor these guidelines as well as guidelines regarding

the handling of classified information.

Congressman Nedzi inquired as to whether or not the FBI would

coordinate its investigations with other security agencies such as the Defense

Intelligence Agency. He was told that we would, of course, check with these

agencies for any information theyERy lt have on the various staff members

under consideration.

REC-10 62-116

Congressman Nedzi advised that it is his intention to employ

probably no more than about 25 staff members. He said presently Jack Bows

on the staff of the House Armed Services Committee is working with him to

set up the new Committee operation. He said Bows,' however, will not be named

to head the Select Committee staff although he would use him to start processing

the applicants for staff positions. Congressman Nedzi was furnished a small

supply of the security data forms which he said he would have filled out aid

effort to comply with this request. The Congressman was told that we would

also need current fingerprints on the potential staff members and he was advised

these prints could be obtained through the Capitol Police Department.

Congressman Nedzi expressed his appreciation for our contacting

him regarding this matter, stating that he looks forward to continued cooperation

with the FBI and the hope that the inquiry of his Committee can be beneficial

As the security data forms are received from this Committee,

they will be furnished directly to the Special Investigative Division for

The C.I.A.

Thankagamittee did not, predictably,

provide searching

cross-examination.

Nevertheless, since Mr. Colby was

clearly

trying

to

suggest that the

endangered by irresponsible criticism,

certain responses have to be made

aside

from that

wisdom that

"bit dogs bark

the oldest

bureaucratic defense known to man is

to try to shift the focus of attention

from

By Tom Wicker

Every time the Pentagon wants more

money, it starts talking about the dan-

gers of war. And every time any so-

called "national security" agency finds

itself being criticized, it replies that the

national security is being endangered

Director William E, Colby of the

Central Intelligence Agency has taken

to that classic bureaucratic pattern,

claiming that

"exaggerated" charges

against the C.I.A. have resulted in "al-

most hysterical excitement" that has

"placed American intelligence in dan-

ger." But who's hysterical? Mr. Colby

sounds nearer to it than anyone else.

In fact, Senator Frank Church of

Idaho, who will chair the special Sen-

ate committee to investigate the "in-

telligence community,"

said in a

statement following

Mr.

Colby's-

though not specifically in response to

it-that he was "surprised in recent

days at the hysteria of those who are

fearful that this committee is out to

wreck these agencies." So should any-

one be surprised who knows Mr.

Church's moderate temperament, the

responsible makeup of his coi

those who

make them-to convince

the public that the critics are the

problem, rather than the thing being

criticized.

Even

before that friendly House

subcommittee, for example, Mr. Colby

conceded that the C.I.A. at one time

or another had kept files on four

members of Congress, some of them

"anti-war." How do we know there

iwere not others? For that matter, how

does he know? And just recently, in

an interview with Barbara Walters on

"Today," Charles Colson made a strong

case that the C.I.A. knew in advance

of the break-in at the office of Daniel

Ellsberg's psychiatrist.

Saying that

was

"beyond dispute,"" Mr. Colson

castinued:.

"They processed' the so-called 'cas-

ing' photos, they provided all the equip-

ment... it's very clear to me that

they knew about that and actively

participated in it and assisted it, pro-

vided the means for it, helped with the

operation from beginning to end...

some of the memos I saw certainly

went as high as Mr. Helms." (Richard

Helms was director of the C.I.A. in

1971, when the break-in took place.)

Mr. Colby has questioned Mr. Col-

IN THE NATION

son's credibility, which is indeed ques-

C.I.A., whose way of life is secrecy,

the fact that its senior Republican

member is the conservative, military-

oriented John Tower of Texas, and that

another member is that stanch de.

of national security, Barry

Goldwater of Arizona? Some wrecking

crew!

Who's being hysterical might also be

judged by the fact that Mr. Colby was

not forced to call a news conference

or to issue a press release to get his

fears for the national security on.the

record. The House Defense Appropria-

tions Subcommittee, which "oversees"

the C.I.A. budget to the extent that

anyone does, provided him a hospitable

jorum and three hours in which to

state

his views openly-something

C.I.A. directors rarely do except when

¡ the Associated Press,

"we would have

been in the position to elect whom-

ever we wanted to elect. Once you

learn to use the levers of power it

Were the F.B.I. and

the

C.I.A. such "levers of power"?

Could they ever be?

Mr. Colby does not seeit to under-

, stand that the question really is not

'the difficulties presently being caused

for the C.I.A. The question is about

what Representative Lucien Nedzi of

• Michigan has called "the appropriate

role of secret institutions in a free,

democratic society." The C.I.A. is not

a value in itself, to be protected or

fostered at whatever expense 10 sun

HOUSE SELECT COMMITTEE ON

Rm.

The House last week created a Select Committeé on Intelligence lon

Activities which will have virtually the same jurisdiction and responsibilities

of the previously established Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Activities

Congressman Lucien Neazi (D-Mich.

has been named Chairman of the House

Select Committee. Lucren

62-116464-1

The matter of security with respect to the House Select Committee

has been taken up with CIA through personnel of the Intelligence Division and they

agree the same security procedures should be worked out with the House Select

Committee as have been effected with the Senate Committee. This means that

staff members for the House Select Committee will be issued clearances by CIA

following a full field investigation by the FBI with the Chairman of the Committee

certifying which staff members are to be cleared following his review of the results

of our investigations. Inspector Bowers is arranging a meeting as soon as possible

to discuss this matter with Congressman Nedzi. CIA representatives illy meet

with Congressman Nedzi to present guidelines to be idaewed of

itteewith

respect to the storage of information, the handling of transcripts

of interviews and hearings.

With respect to the Subcommitter it Richts and Constitltional

Rights, Inspector Hotis inquired on 2-24-75 of Alan Parker, Chief Counsel of this

Subcommittee, if the Subcommittee intended to get into areas which would require

security clearances.

Parker, in the presence of Subeommittee Chairman

Don Edwards (D-Calif.), stated it is their intention to get into areas which will

require security clearances and that they would like to work out some procedures

along these lines. Since the FBI has no authority to issue clearances it probably

will be necessary for staff members of this Subcommittee to be issued security

clearances by the Department of Justice--the CIA and other intelligence agencies

are not involved in the hearings being conducted by the Edwards' Subcommittee.

The procedures for such clearances to be issued by the Department is being

explored with Department officials and appropriate arrangements will be made

with Parker concerning this matter as well as guidelines for the Committee's

storage and handling of classified information.

The Senate Subcommittee on FBI Oversight at this time has no

intention of conducting hearings regarding our activities. All staff employees

of the entire Senate Judiciary Committee, of which this is a Subcommittee,

already are the subject of full field FBI investigations at the request of

Senator James O. Eastland (D-Miss.), Chairman of the full Committee and the

Subcommittee.
