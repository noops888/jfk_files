RELEASE IN PART

$200.00 a month as an agent of the Dominican SIM has been

conducted and is reflected in Bufile 105-107621.

On November 19, 1962, while contacting MM 781-

EPSI, the matter of the receipt of money by Dominican

agents in the Miami area through the Dominican Consulate

was mentioned, and PSI stated that in all probability,

ONI

§SAPP is not even aware that his name appeared on the payroll

of the Dominican Government, because he never received

Jany money through the consulate.

According to the inform-

anti, some person in the Dominican Republic, or somewhere

in the Dominican service, quite probably received this

money. Informant is acquainted with SAPP, and stated

that the only money SAPP ever received was money paid to

him for his work of guard duty at the Dominican

Consulate

in Miami, and this work was approved by the Miami Police

Department, and performed by SAPP in his off-duty hours.
