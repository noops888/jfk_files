I. The presence of so many new desk personnel at

headquarters - people who are unfamiliar with station

history - means that we must turn to you with questions

oftener than you might wish.

Our present question

concerns property involved in LIEMPTY. (We are submitting

the project as received from the field, but do not

understand the background very well.)

2. EMMA-11257 of 16 January 1959, a project renewal, said

that "approximately one year ago the LICALLA base was

purchased by KUBARK through? LIMOUSINE', and we have not found

any cables or dispatches which would show a change in that

status.

Does MEXI 03 LIMUST/LIMESA (see Real Property

Report

of August 1967) Include LICALLA? If so, and if we own

LICALLA, why does it cost us $1800 a year for rent and

utilities?

(Up until the submission dated 1963 the project

renewal used to say "LIMITED and LICALLA rents are returned

to station by LIMOUSINE and credited to station miscellaneous

receipts" but after that time this sentence was eliminated.)
