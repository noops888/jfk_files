On December 28, 1959, H. Clifford Allder, a Washington, D.C.

attorney who is representing the above named defendant, advised

departmental attorneys that his co-counsel, Kenneth D. Wood, is

scheduled to appear in another case on January 11, 1960. Allder

advises that since there had been several continuances granted in

the other case, he would request a continuance in the Weinheimer

case.

Allder recontacted departmental attorneys in the afternoon

of December 28, 1959, and stated that District Judge Curran had"

granted a continuance until February 1, 1960.

On December 29, 1959, we ascertained from the Assignment:
