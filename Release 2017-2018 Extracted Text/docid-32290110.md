A. GAMBLING

I. BOOKMAKING

Investigation of bookmaking in the New Orleans

Area has revealed that up through September 13, 1961,

bookmakers were receiving results of out-of-state races

through Nola Printing Company, the local race wire service,

which discontinued operations

on that date because of the

existence of new Federal legislation pertaining to inter-

state gambling activities.

Investigation has disclosed that

since September 13, 1961, bookmakers in the New Orleans Area

have not been able to obtain out-of-tate race results on

the same day that races are run.. They have had to rely on

race results obtained through legitimate news media, and

the New Orleans Times Picayune Newspaper has been their prin-

cipal source of this information, in so far as horse races

are concerned.

Investigation has disclosed that from September

13, 1961, to November 23, 1961, local bookmakers' business

was seriously curtailed; however, the New Orleans Fair Grounds

Race Track began its 1961 winter meet on November 23, 1961.

This meet continued

until March 10, 1962.

During the period

of the Fair Grounds' meot, local bookmakers' business picked

up considerably and again fell off after March 10, 1962.

On

December 17, 195%, PCI ROLLING advised

that Nola is managed by PORETTO; that it is the

general opinion among bookmakers in Jefferson Parish

that Nola is controlled by CARLOS MARCELLO and that

one of MARCELLO! brothers, JOSEPH, was made a partner

of Nola to oversee the operation and protect CARLOS

races, but ceased operating as a race wire service

on September 13, 1961.

On February 2, 1962, PORTE

advised SA REGIS L. KENNEDY that Nola Printing Com-

pany is not putting out race results for the New

Orleans Fair Grounds Race Track or any other race

track.

He said he would not reactivate Nola

long as there is any doubt

about the new Federal legislation pertaining to

interstate gambling:

bookmakers in Jefterson Parish and the New Orleans

Area began to receiveng results of races being run

at the New Orleans Fair Grounds Race Träck when

that track opened its winter meet on Thanksgiving

Day. November 28. 1961.

On December 7, 1961, PCI

who operates a horse race

book at Manuel's Restaurant, 952 Jefferson Higlway,

advised that he had been receiving race results

from the Fair Grounds since November 23, 1961.

said he did not know who was operating the service

but ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN had contacted him about buying

the service.

said the service consisted of

actual

broadcast of the races as they were being

run at the Fair Grounds. It is to be noted that

the 1961 winter meet of

the Fair Grounds operated

from November 23, 1961, to March 10, 1962.

This

track has only one meet a year, which begins each

year on Thanksgiving Day.

CHAUVINI

advised

that on the previous day CHAUVIN announced over his

wire service that he had received information that

somebody, without his authority, was "bootlegging"

his service to the Mississippi Gulf Coast in viola-

tion of the new Federal laws pertaining to inter-

state gambling.

said CHAUVIN commented

that if this illicit transmission did not discontinue

immediately his service would shut down.

said that on December 22, 1961, when bookmakers

called CHAUVIN service for Fair Grounds results

of that day

they were advised that the service had

been discontinued.

CHAUVIN was interviewed on March 14, 1962,

CHAUVIN said he operated

this service from 3646 Airline Highway, Jefferson

(In this connection, investigation oi Nola Print

ing Company disclosed

that this was the central

point fron which Nola's race wire service was dissemi-

nated when Nola was in operation. › CHAUVIN said

the property.

CHAUVIN claimed that he had only

approximately 17 paying subscribers to his service

and complained that one of his main difficulties

in operating the service was that bookmakers in

Jefferson Parish were stealing it and not paying

for it. He said he determined that some 80 book-

makers

were

actually receiving the service but only

about 17 were paying him for it.

ANTHONY JOSEPH LUPO was interviewed by

Agents at Nola Printing Company, 550 iris Avenue,

on June 22, 1962.

LUP0 identified himseli

aS

the publisher of the Daily Sports Bulletin. He

sald the Bulletin is still being published and

that is

the only activity taking place at 530 Iris

Avenue.

LUPO said in the old days Nola employed

25 to 30 men but now there were only four or five

men on the payroll and only about 600 copies of

the Dally Sports Bulletin are printed each day.

LUPO said these are sold only in Louisiana and

are mailed out of the state, as he does not

desire to become involved in a possible violation

of any of the new Federal legislation pertaining

to interstate gambling activities..

After ABEL JOHN CHAUVIN cut off his

serrice to local bookmakers on December 22, 1961,

On February 2, 1962,

fron the Fair Grounds had been very poor since CHAUVIN

ceased operating in December and at that time various

bookmakers had devised their own systems of obtaining

race results from the Fair Grounds on an individual

basis:

Nola Printing Company went out of business in September,

1961, none of the bookmakers in the New Orleans area are

receiving out of state race results on the same day that

races are being run.. "All three have pointed out that

because of the fact that no race wire service is available

in the New Orleans area,

they are unable to past post book-

makers in this area.

They advised that one of the essential

elements to a successful past posting operation is that the

victim bookmaker must be handling considerable action and be

busily occupied in his profession.

Since there is no race

wire service in the New Orleans area at this time, the

business of the bookmakers has been seriously affected with

the result that they are unable to past post these books.

In this connection,

said he has traveled

throughout Louisiana,

both before and after September, 1961

and has found that the same conditions exist in such areas

as lonroe, shreveport, Baton fouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana.

He explained that without a race wire service in the Louisiana

area,

bookmaking business is "dead" and as long as it remains

"dead"" he cannot successfully past post bookmakers.

a PCI who is active as a

bookmaker at 952 Jefferson Highway, which is Manuel's Restaurant

and Bax, advised on May 22, 1962 and July 13, 1962 that there

is no service in the New Orleans area providing the identities

and the mutual prices of winners of horse races at out of state

racetracks.

this same procedure is used by all the other bookmakers in

the area.

He said that his volume of business prior to

September, 1961 was so large that he is positive that if

race wire service was available in the New Orleans area, it

would be offered to him; therefore he is positive that no

such service is available.

PCI

also an active bookmaker

in Jefferson Parish,

Louisiana, advised on April 16 and

September 12, 1962,

that there is no race wire service in

the New Orleans area and there has been none since Nola

Printing Company terminated 1ts service in September, 1961.

Recently, information has come to the attention

of this office concerning two sources through which some

bookmakers and betters can obtain the identities of winning

horses at out of state racetracks.

On June 6, 1962, [

referred to

above, advised that within the past few weeks he had been

able to obtain some of the winning horses at out of state

racetracks between 45 minutes to 12 hours after the races

were run.

in the city who occasionally would have the identities of

winning horses only. These individuals would not have the

identities of place and show horses nor would they have the

paramutual prices on these horses.

stated the source

of this information was an employee of the New Orleans Times

Picayune Newspaper who obtained the race information from the

Associated Press Sports Ticker. This employee would then go

out to a barroom located at the corner of st. charles and

where he would make the information available.

information was never available after 4:00 PM each day which

indicated to him that the employee of the newspaper got off from

work at that time. He said that the racing information

provided through this source was not complete enough or reliable

45760 DooId: 32290110 Page 8

## Page 9

NO 92-390/1am

enough for bookmakers to pay off bets and could only be

used by some to satisfy their curiousity as to what horses

may have won races at some of the lastern tracks.

said that on some afternoons the source would only be able

to provide the names of one or two winning horses at only

one track and on other afternoons the source might have the

names of considerably more winners but on no occasion has

this source ever had enough information to enable bookmakers

to use the information in connection with their business.

On September 21; 1962

advised that he had

determined that the employee at the Times Picayune Newspaper

is a person named "TONy" and that TONY is a relative of a

person named "JUNIOR" who he understands is a partner of

NICK NUCCIO, a bookmaker in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.

Investigation is continuing to determine the

identity of the Times Picayune employee and the identities

of the individuals utilizing the information supplied by

this employee.

With regard to the other source of out of state

race information available to certain bookmakers and betters,

Mr. T. CHANDLER JOSEY, Special Agent, Southern Bell Telephone

and Telegraph Company, New Orleans,

advised on September 18,

1962 that he was investigating a matter where an unknown

individual was using pay telephones in the New Orleans area

to make long distance calls to Chicago telephone Number WE-

9-1900.

The individual making these calls to this number is

retrieving the change he uses in making these calls thereby

defrauding the telephone company of the revenue of these

calls.

JOSEY advised that he had determined that this Chicago

telephone number dispenses horse race information approximately

30 minutes after races have been run.

He said that this

information is apparently put on a tape recording so that

when any

person calls the number they can receive the infor

mation along with a short commercial announcement advertising

a publication known as "The Green Sheet". Mr. JOSEY stated

that the identity of winning horses at various racetracks

are given along with the paramutual prices on the winning

horses.

He said that this telephone number does not

dispense the identities of second and third place horses

or the paramutual prices on these horses.

In this connection, PCI

advised

on September 21, 1962 that he was

aware of the Chicago

telephone number and he had called this number for his own

personal use to find out whether a particular horse he may

have bet on had actually won.

said calling parties

cannot determine the identities of second and third place

horses through this number nor can they obtain the mutual

prices for second and third place horses.

He said the

information which could be obtained by calling this number

was not complete enoughtfor any bookmaker to utilize the

information obtained in connection with his wagering business

as a bookmaker must have complete results, which would include

the three winning horses of each race at each major race-

track in the country.

Investigation is continuing to determine additional

information concerning this telephone number and the use of

this number by betters and bookmakers in the New Orleans area.

of Jefferson and was employed in the office of PHILLIP SMITH

then the Parish Attorney.

Information 1s avallable indicating a close

aligoment between CARLOS MARCELLO and Louisiana Governor

JIMMIE H. DAVIS.

In this regard, on May 4, 1961, Mr.

CHARLES W. ERDMANN, C1v11 Defense Director

• for the City

of New Orleans, furnished information to this office that

CARLOS MARCELLO endeavored to help him receive from Governor

DAVIS the appointment as New Orleans C1v11 Defense Director.

Mr. ERDMANN said he wanted it known that he did not solicit

MARCELLO's assistance, nor did he feel that MARCELLO's

actions in any way aided in his receiving this appointment.

He said that on March 14, 1961, at the suggestion of the

then Mayor of New Orleans, DE LESSEPS S. MORRISON, he

went to the office of Mr. CHARLES SPENCER, who was formerly

President of Jefferson Parish..

Mayor MORRISON felt that

ERDMANN should seek Mr. SPENCER's assistance in getting

the appointment of Civil Defense Director.

On his arrival

at Mr. SPENCER's office, ERDMANN found that CARLOS MARCELLO

was then in SPENCER's office.

MARCELLO told ERDMANN that he

was going to Baton Rouge to see Governor DAVIS on the

following morning and that he wanted to recommend to the

Governor that ERDMANN receive the appointment. • MARCELLO

said he was doing this as a personal favor not only for

ERDMANN but for Mr. SPENCER.

At MARCELLO's insistence.

ERDMANN prepared a short

resume or his background and left

the resume at the Town and Country Motel as MARCELLO had

suggested.

On March 24, 1961, MARCELLO telephoned ERDMANN

and criticized ERDMANN for having had Mayor MORRISON write

a letter recommending ERDMANN's appointment. MARCELLO

said that Governor DAVIS had not been pleased with receiving

the letter of nomination from the Mayor.

Parish coin machine distributor and a bail bondsman in

Jefferson Parish, advised

that there is no doubt in his

mind that Sheriff JOHN G. FIIZGERALD has allowed gamblers

to operate in Jefferson Parish.

_said that persons

Interested in seeing gambling operate in the parish have

"wined and dined" FITZGERALD ever since he became Sheriff.

said he has heard rumors that FITZGERALD has been

provided with women whenever he wanted them, and in this

way, persons interested in seeing gambling continue have

more or less compromised FITZGERALD to the extend that it

1s difficult for him to turn down their requests or refuse

them whenever they ask for a favor.

On September 12, 1962, PCI

advised of a conversation

he recently had with AL SCHORLING

after SCHORLING had been drinking. Investigation concerning

the Chesterfield Club, a gambling casino in Jefferson

Parish, has disclosed

that SCHORLING is conpected with

the operation of that club.

SCHORLING told

that the

profits of the Chesterfield Club are split as follows:

AL SCHORLING - 10%; ALBERT J. SALZER - 20%;

FRANK L. TRIDICO - 10%; CARLOS and JOSEPH

MARCELLO - 30%; SALVADOR BOHEMIA - 10%;

Jefferson Parish District Attorney FRANK

LANGRIDGE - 10%; Sheriff JOHN G. FITZGERALD - 10%.

SCHORLING told

that he was the one who

"took care" of the District Attorney and Sheriff FITZGERALD.

advised that he is of the opinion that the reason

CARLOS and JOSEPH MARCELLO receive 30% of the profits of

the. Chesterfield Club is because CARLOS MARCELLO 1s the

person responsible for insuring that the Chesterfield Club

can operate unmolested and without harassment by state

authorities.

prostitution for over a year with the full knowledge and

consent of Sheriff CURTIS O. DEDEAUX. The Sheriff allowed

GARRIGA to operate because GARRIGA was paying off DEDEAUX

and Constables PETE PARKER and JERRY TIBLIER. Another

reason, according to PARKeR, that GARRIGA could operate

without fear of molestation

from DEDEAUX, IS bECaUSe

GARRIGA knew that DEDEAUX previously had

sexual relations

with GARRIGA's young sister while the latter was a prisoner

in the Harrison County Ja1l.

PARKER stated that GARRIGA leased Bob and Joe's

Lounge to IVAN ORRELS in March, 1962, and later wanted to

get ORRELS out of the place so

he could take it over

again.

PARKER claimed GARRIGA used his influence over

DEDEAUX to cause DEDEAUX to conduct numerous raids in the

place thereby forcing ORRELS to close 1t.

PARKER said

this place is due to reopen with ASA and EDDIE GARRIGA

running it again.

PARKER said that while the GARRIGA brothers

were operating there at Bob and Joe's Lounge they were

paying Constables PARKER and TIBLIER $125.00 to $150.00

a month and allowing them free access to the prostitutes

PARKER said that since DEDEAUX has been sheriff

and until about three months ago there had been a monthly

payoff

going from the Sheriff's office to Jackson, Missis-

sippi, presumably to Governor BARNETT. PARKER said he did

not know the amount but had heard it ran in the vicinity

of $40,000.00 a month,

and he understood Deputy Sheriff

HUGH BROACH, Jr., would take the money to Jackson when he

delivered prisoners to the State Hospital at Whitfield near

Jackson.

PARKER said that HUGH BROACH has a one-half

interest in the Peppermint Lounge on Pat Harrison Avenue

in Biloxi.

ParKEr stated that some of the trusties working

in the Identification Bureau at the Sheriff's Office dispose

of records at random and on occasion have sexual relations

with women prisoners in the ja1l... He said Sheriff DEDEAUX

1s an alcoholic frequently coming to the office at night

drunk and belligerent, firing his entire staff only to

with regard to possible payoffs to Governor

BARNETT, on 9/12/62 NO 1002C, a gambler and tavern operator

in Pass Christian, in commenting about a payoff of $7.00

to $8.00 a case on whiskey sold in Harrison County, stated

that as far as he had been able to learn Governor BARNETT

1s still getting between $20,000.00 to $30,000.00 per month

from whiskey sales on the Gulf Coast.. Informant was unable

to advise the method of payment or who was Involved directly

in making the payment. The 8/22/62 issue of the Bilox1-

Gulfport Dally Herald newspaper reported that AARON M.

KOHN, Managing Director, Metropolitan Crime Commission of

New Orleans, in a speech on the Gulf Coast, stated that

JAKE and JOHN MLADNICH, operators of the Cabana Beach

Motel and Trader John's Sea In Sirloin Room in Mississippi

City were closely allied with the MARCELLO interests in

New Orleans

According to the article, KOHN linked a

coin-operated novelty company in Biloxi with one in New

Orleans, named people connected with book layoffs in the

area and called out the names of about a dozen lounges

on the Gulf Coast which he said had connections with New

Orleans racketeers;

The story reported that JAKE and JOHN

MLADNICH appeared at this meeting and publlely stated

that

they. had no

connection with the MARCELLO operation.

The 8/23/62 issue of this newspaper publicized

the fact that Sheriff DEDEAUX was critical of KOHN in his

remarks:

In this connection, No 11900; a professional

ball bondsman who frequents the Harrison County Sheriff's

office, sale on 9/13/62 that DEDEAUX had been highly:

incensed over KOHN's remarkse. THis informant said he had

heard it rumored before that CARLOS MARCELLO might have a

connection with the MLADNICH holdings in Mississippi City,

but he had no information that this was so and was of the

opinion

that these rumors merely developed because the

MLADNICH family have been successful in their business

interests and are moderately wealthy

Our investigation of CARLOS: MARCELLO has not

disclosed that he has any connection with gambling and

other vice on the Mississippi Gulf Coasta
