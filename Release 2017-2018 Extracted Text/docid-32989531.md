RACIAL MATTERS

The Atlanta Office has advised that an article appeared in the

"Atlanta Constitution" on 11-15-62 based on a study called "Albany,

A study of Racial Responsibility." The study was written by

Dr • Howard Zinn,

who has been the subject of a security investigation

by this Bureau (100-360217).

Zinn was reportedly a member of the

Communist Party from 1949 through 1953 and attended Communist Party

meetings during that period.

The study by Zinn criticizes the FBI,

the Federal Government, and

the administration of the City of Albany,

Georgia.

is a history professor at Spelman College in Atlanta,

Georgia, and the study was published by the Southern Regional Couneil,

a group formed to advance equal opportunity for all the South's peoplo.

The full context

of the article is attached,

The article in one section states:

"Albany Negroes,

said Zinn, who is white, tend

to distrust local members of the FBI.

Spelman historian urges the creation of a

special corps of Agents to investigate civil

rights cases.

"With all the clear violations by local police

of Constitutional rights,' said Zinn, ' the FBI

has not made a single arrest on behalf of Negro

citizens.'"

360217

The Atlanta Office completely covered the activities at Albany, &

with the racial situation.

RE:

The report appears to be a slanted and biased document

similar to a previous report written by Zinn on Albany. Again

Zinn does not add

anything to the clarification of the racial

problem in the south.

Zinn should not be dignified by contact by this Bureau,

opportunity for all the South's people.'

"Zinn's study aimed its chief criticism at the

Federal Government, pointing out that both Albany Negroes and

white citizens acted in accord with their expressed convictions.

"The 40-year-old professor said the Government reacted

'slowly and awkwardly' to the racial troubles which began in

Albany in December of 1961, during which nearly 1, 200 arrests

were made, chiefly of Negroes.

"Zinn was also critical of the 'failure of the city's

quietly arranged for compromise agreements with the Negro

population.'

"He also criticized the manner in which Police Chief

Laurie Pritchett handled the disturbances."

Deputy Attorney General White called and referred to the

Director's memorandum to the Attorney General of January 8, 1962.

In this memorandum the Attrney General was informed that Levison,

a New York attorney and businessman, who is a secret member of the

Communist Party, is allegedly a close adviser to the Reverend Martin

Luther King, prominent southern Negro leader. Levison is reported

to have written a speech delivered by King at the AFL-CIO convention.

Levison is also said to have access to the White House and to the Attorney

General through his association with King. SEuSIFivE

Our memaandum to the Attorney General was classified Secret

as information concerning him is known only to our informant and a limited

number of Communist Party leaders.

White asked that I meet with him so that the matter concerning

Levison could be discussed. It is White's feeling that definitely some action

should be taken.

c."!

Inasmuch as Levison is a secret member of the Communist

\ Party and his relationship with King is known only to our informant and a

limited number of Communist Party leaders, the Domestic Intelligence

Division will review our file for the purpose of determining if there is

any information of a non-classified nature which might be utilized by the

Department. As soon as this file review has been made, White will be

contacted in line with his request and a determination made as to what action

the Department has in mind with regard to this New York attorney, business-

Deputy Attorney General

(DAG) White has requested that

Assistant Director Evans discuss with him the association of the

Reverend Martin Luther King and Levison since he feels some action

must be taken.

The Attorney General (AG) by letter dated 1/8/62-was advised

that Levison, a secret member of the Communist Party (CP), is allegedly

a close

adviser of the Reverend Martin Luther King, prominent southern

Negro leader, and wrote the speech that King delivered at the American

Federation of Labor-Congress of Industrial Organizations convention.

The AG was also advised that Levison reportedly, through his associ

tion with king, had access to the Attorney eneral and to the hite

irritagions: 094-93

Information has since been received on 1/29/62 from

that Gus Hall, General Secretary, CPUSA, has claimed authorship of

King's speech.

New York and San Francisco have been requested to contact

the informants involved to see if they can throw any additional light

on specifically who was responsible for preparation of the speech,

although it is logical to assume that Levison consulted Hall

concerning the speech; thus, both may have had a part in its

preparation.

Af and to be hite House and of the possible communist influence

Is has been accomplished.

It appears that White desires to furnish King,

Or

someone close to him, some information about Levison and to suggest

lat least that King break off his relations with Levison.

Since

1i Levison's connections with the CP are known to only a few top CP

the disclosure of any specific information about his

who are vital to the internal

security of the country.

However,

a f White or the AG feel a

compelling need to furnish King information about Levison, it is

believed that it would minimize the risk to the informants if King

were told in strict confidence that Levison has in the past been a

member of

the CP and that indications are he is still under its

White should

be advised that under no circumstances

should specific information as contained in the Director's letter be

discussed with King, since it would definitely endanger our informant

That this memorandum be forwarded to Assistant Director

Deputy Attorney General White was contacted with reference to

the Bureau's letter of January 8, 1962. In this letter the Department was

informed that Levison, a secret member of the Communist Party, is

allegedly a close adviser to the Reverend Martin Luther King. Levison,

a New York attorney and businessman, is reported to have written a speech

for King. Levison is also said to have access to the White House and to

the Attorney General through his association with King see

In discussing this matter with Mr. White, it was pointed out that

under no circumstances should any action be taken which would endanger

the position of our informant. White said he fully appreciated this. He

stated he had contacted Assistant Attorney General Marshallof the Civil

Rights Division about this relationship between Levison and King and was

told by Marshal that sometime ago King had been alerted to the past history

of Levison. Deputy Attorney General White said his only concern at this

time was whether he should alert anyone at the White House in view of the

allegation Levison might have access to the White House SENd i fain!

When it was pointed out to White that the only information reported

was that such access would be through Levison's association with King

c White concluded that he may have read the Director's memorandum too

prapidly as he had the impression Levison might have some direct contact

with the White House White said from the character-of-some of the people

over at the White House he would not-have«been-surprised if it were reported

that Levison actually.did.have.such-a.contact. The matter having been

clarified for him, White said he did not propose to take any further action

but was appreciative of this matter having been brought to his attention.

been established as

recently as July, 1953, and who is a

key advisor to Martin

and thus

a most effective influence in the

civil rights movement. While King and Levison have attempted

to keep their relation nip secret, we have recently noted

personal meetings

between the two

with levison exerting

novement.

They met together in

a New York City hotel 5/13/65

when levison advised King relative to voter registration

activitics in Alabama and for sing to declare hinself strongly

for peace in Vietnam.

from time to tine in the past, we have had technical-

ipe coverage on Levison, both in his office and

residence.

The last coverage of his rocsdonce was installed 3/20/62 anc

discontinued 7/25/54 dus to she limited information being

obtained at that time which vas

With the increasing immortance of the civil rights

the principal target for connunice intiltration among the various

civil rights organizations.

John lewis, the Chairman, has stated

that he will accept any individuals, including conmunists,

Into

the organization.

He has publicly identified himself with

Communist Party members and as recently as April, 1505, he

spoke at an affair sponsored by "Freedomways" in tribute to

Paul Robeson.

On that occasion, he described Robeson as the

spiritual father of the Student

Non-Violent Coordinating Committee

and referred to his many years of "persecution" by the Government.

On April 30, 1965, James Forman, the Executive Secretary, met

wich Martin Luther King, JX., Harry Belafonte and Clarence Jones

to iron out differences existing between the Student Non-Violent L

Coordinating Committee and the Southern Christian Leadership

Conference,

At that time Forman refused to go along with King's

proposal that they make a public statement renouncing communism.

During the course of this and related investigations,

such as the Mississippi Summer Exoject, we have developed

evidence of communist participation in civil rights activities

sponsored by this organization.

At the present time, the Student

Non-Violent Coordinating Conmittee is preparing to send several

thousand individuals into Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas in

connection with voter registration efforts.

Since all this

activity will be directed through their headquarters in Atlanta,

a technical installation would provide excellent coverage of any

efforts by the Communist Party or Communist Party members to direct

these civil rights activities. This source nould supplement the

This is a recommendation requesting the Attorney General's

authority for the installation of a technical surveillauce covering

phones covering Jones's law firm and the Ghandi Society for Human

Rights, a Negro welfare organization in which Jones plays a ver

active part.

You will recall that on 7/16/63 the Attorney General

advised

Assistant Director Ivans that in view of the possible communist influ-

ence in the racial situation, he desired that consideration be given

to placing a technical surveillance on Maxein Lucher king, leader oi

the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and Clarence Benjamin

Jones, a New York City attorney, who is closely associated with sing.

The Attorney Generas indicated he was not concerned with the reper

cussions if it should ever become known that such surveillances had

been put into effect and that. he thought it advisable to have as

complete coverage as possible.

He is extremely active in racial matters and serves as the

Counsel for Martin Luther Ring. In 1953-54 Jones was an active member

of the Labor Youth League, an organization cited as subversive under

Executive Order 10450.

He has recently been in frequent contact with

Communist Party, USA,

leaders in New York City concerning racial

matters.

Pursuant to the Attorney General's request that considera-

tion be given to placing a technical surveillance on Jones, our New

York Office was requested to conduct a survey to ascertain if such

coverage is leasible and could be conducted with full security.

New

York teletype 7/19/63 discloses that technical surveillance coverage

Where Jones spends a

great

Background

• 11-1-00 SP-ZALMIZIG

Bayard Rustin, at one time an ardent pacifist, reportedly

joined the Young Communist League in 1936.

In a speech

• in 1950 he

stated he was a former Communist Party (CP) member. Rustin, who/was

the Deputy Director of the 8/28/63 March on Washington, has been

arrested on several occasions for activities in connection with racial

demonstrations.

He was secretary to Martin Luther King, Jr., 1956 to

1960 and recent information indicates he may take a position

• in the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

On 9/20/63 Rustin contacted

Benjamin J, Davis, National Secretary, Communist Party, USA (CPUSA) , atya

which time they (Rustin and Davis) mutually agreed to get together for

further personal discussions. At a meeting of the National Board, CPUS.

neld on 9/25/65, Davis stated that Rustin calls him constantly. bavis :

recently commented that the Negroes are now willing-to know what

has to say and will welcome whatever support, and leadershe communists

can give.

REC- 53"

NOV 7 1963

Observations

The increasing importance attached to communist influence

in racial matters necessitates our giving all aspects of this matter

preferred attention.

Coverage of contacts between Party lunctionaries

and recognized leaders in the current Negro struggle for civil rights

is one of the most important goals of our investigations. It is impera

tive that we penetrate the Party's liaison with Rustin in order to stay

on top of this matter. The requested tesur should aîford excellent

coverage not only of the Party influence on Rustin, but also furnish

current information concerning influential leaders

in the current

Negro struggle who are considered sympathetic and receptive to an

approach by

the Party.

state that Governor Ross R. Barnett of Mississippi testified on 7/12/63

before the Senate Commerce Conmittee in opposicion to a proposed public

accommodations bill.

According to the newspapers, Governor Barnett, during his

testimony, held up a printed sheet containing a picture

and titled

"Martin Luther King at Communist Training School""

Governor Barnett said

the picture showed King and some persons identified on the sheet as

communists at a school

in Tennessee.

In this connection, Senator Mike

Monroney D - Oklahoma) asked Governor Barnett if he had

checked the

picture and the printed allegations with the rBl. Governor Barnett said

he had not but suggested that the Committee might want to do so.

This printed sheet is undoubtedly a flier which consists of a

picture of a group of individuals seated in an auditorium, one of whom

is hartin Luther king, and actually relates to a 1957 Labor way week end

seminar at the Highlander Folk School (HES),

Monteagle, Tennessee,

which

was attended by King.

• According to a publication circurated extensively

by the Georgia Commission on Education, which allegedly had an "undercover"

agent in attendance,

the seminar "was held to discuss methods and tactics

for precipitating racial strife and disturbances."

The publication

Nfurther characterized the HFS as a "communist training school."

FBI files concerning the HES show that this school was the

subject of a security investigation which was closed in 1943. Information

was developed that Communist Party (CP) members had been on the school

staff.and the

school had followed the practice of welcoming communists

No information was developed that the schoot oftered

courses of instruction on communism nor that the CP ever succeeded

however, the HFS has been the subject of numerous past allegations

AUBREY WILLIS WILLIAMS

A United Press-International News Service release of July 12, 1963,

reported Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett displayed a poster-size photograph to

the Senate Commerce Committee which he claimed showed Negro leader Dr. Martin

Luther King "at a communist training school." Governor Barnett said the picture

was taken at the Highlander Folk School of Monteagle, Tennessee, and he identifieu

those in the picture with Dr. King as Abner Berry, Myles Horton and Aubrey Williams

Mr. Tolson noted, "We should check our files."

INFORMATION IN BUFILES:

Both Abner Winston Berry and Aubrey Willis Williams are Security

Index.subjects. Berry, a Negro, was born on June 12, 1902, at Beaumont, Texas.

He joined the Communist Party in 1929, and from 1930 until 1958, he held high-level

positions within the Party. In 1951, he relinquished editorship of the Harlem edition

of "The Worker" in order to assume the position of Negro Affairs Editor of the

"Daily Worker." He held this position until the "Daily Worker" ceased operation in

January, 1958. In'September, 1958, Berry was reported to have left the Party;

however, he attended the 17th Communist Party National Convention on December 9-12,;

11959 at New York City. He resides in Newark, New Jersey, and is currently employed

as an editor by the Antara Indonesian News Agency, with offices in the United Nations

Building, New York City. This Agency publishes a daily bulletin which has been

described as an Indonesian propaganda outlet owned and operated by the Government of

Indonesia; however, investigation indicates it actually appears to be a privately owned

firm with no subsidization by the Indonesian Government. Berry has been interviewed

on three occasions by Special Agents, but he refused to cooperate, saying only that he

had severed his connections with the

Party because it became a futile organization.

Aubrey Willis Williams is Chairman of the National Committee to

Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee (NCAHUAC) cited as an

organization set up to lead and direct the Communist Party's "operation abolition"

( campaign. The NCAHUAC was organized by Williams and Frank Wilkinoong

individual with a known and admitted past Communist Party membership and

continued Party affiliation. Over the years, Williams has spoken before and supported

a number of left-wing and communist-led groups, although he has publicly

and in

appearance before Senate investigating committees, disclaimed any connection with or

knowledge of the Communist Party. He has worked energetically to discredit the FBI

and Director Hoover. As of July 19, 1961, Williams was president and a member of

the board of directors of the Southern Conference Educational Fund, Inc. (SCEF)?

originally known as the Southern Conference for Human Welfare which had been cited as

a communist front. A listing of the officers of SCEF, dated January, 1963, indicates

Williams is now President Emeritus of the organization. A confidential informant

advised on June 29, 1956, that during the time the Southern Conference for Human

Welfare was in existence, Communist Party members were affiliated with it and worked

actively in it. Since the formation of SCEF, rank and file Party members have not

been encouraged to work in it; however, certain Party members in the New Orleans

area had been assigned to participate in the organization to further communist

principles.

On June 20, 1963, Myles Horton identified himself to the FBI as

Director of the Highlander Research and Education Center of Knoxville, Tennessee.

This is the successor to the Highlander Folk School, originally at Monteagle, Tennessee,

of which Horton was also the director. The latter school was supported primarily by

donations from individuals and labor unions and it offered courses of instruction in labor

organization, social economics and the 'eneral field of labor education. It was known

to have Communist Party members on its staff and it followed the practice of securing

communists as students. It was never known to have offered courses of instructions in

communism nor vas the Party known to have succeeded in gaining control of the school.

There were many allegations that it represented the headquarters for communism in

Eastern Tennessee; however, these claims were never substantiated. The Tennessee

Courts revoked the Highlander Folk School's charter on the grounds that it violated the

criminal laws of the State. A State Charter for the Knoxville School was issued on

August 28, 1961.

On April 21, 1942, a confidential informant advised that Myles Horton

was a speaker before the Southern Conference for Human Welfare. On April 19, 1949,

Paul Crouch, a self-admitted former Communist Party member, described Horton as

a left-wing Socialist who was always close to the Communist Party, meeting with

officials and representatives to discuss policy and procedure during the period from

2939 to 1941. Crouch said Horton could be described as a close follower and sympa-

thizer of the Party line in 1941. He also said Horton's wife, Zylphia, was even closer

to the Party than her husband and that when Crouch last saw her in 1941, she was giving

serious consideration to joining the Party. Another confidential informant stated in

December, 1950, that Horton continued to follow the Party line during the period 1947 to

1950, and that he associated with known Party members. This informant doubted that

Horton was actually a communist member. On December 7, 1950, and January 5,

1951, another confidential informant who is a former member of the Party, advised

that Horton was not a member even though he had close association with Party mem-

bers. He said Horton had been criticized by Party members as an opportunist who

used the Party for his own purposes.

Horton was reported to be listed as one of the speakers for a "Bill

of Rights Dinner' which was to be sponsored by the Emergency Civil Liberties

Committee on December 15, 1959.

ENTIAL

The Attorney General

and in appearances before Senate investigating committees,

disclaimed any connection with, or knowledge of, the Communist

Pasty.

He has worked energetioally to discredit the FBI and

the Director.

As of July, 1951, Willzams was President and

& member of the Board of Directors of the Southern Conference

Iducational Fund, Incorporated, previously known as the

Southern Conference fOr Human Heliare, Cited as & Communist

tront.

& iisting or the oiiiceig of the Southern Conterence

[ducational fund dated in January, 10S3, Indicates Williams

is now president emeritus of this orgarization.

According

to a confidential informant, in June of 1956, during the time

the Southern Conference So% Human Welfare was in existence,

Commnist Pasty nembers were affiliated with it and worked

actively in it. Jince the lormation of the Southern Conference

Educational Fund, mark and file Party members have not been

encouraged to work in it; however, cartain Party menbers in

the New Orleans area had been assigned so participate in the

organization to further communist principles.

on June 20, 1903, Myles Horton identified himsels

to the FBI as Director of the lighlander Research and

Education Center of Knowville,, Tennessee.

This is the

successor to the Highlander Folk School, originally at

Monteagle, Tennessee, of which Horton was also the director...

The latter school was supported primarily by donations from

individuals and labor unions and it offered courses of

instruction in labor organization, social economics and

the general field of labor education. It was known to have

and it followed the

practice of securing communists as students.. However,

according to information received,. it was never known

have offered courses of instructions in communism, nor was

the Party inown to have succeeded in gaining control of the

school:

There were many allegations that it represented the

headquarters for communism in eastern fennessee; however,

these claims were never sabstantated. The Tennessee Courts

revoked the lligilander Folk School's charter on the grounds

that it violated the crininal lavs of the state. A state

charter for the Knoxville school was issued on hugust 23, 1961.

On April 21, 1942, a confidentini Informant advised

that lyles liozion was a speaker before the Southern Conference

fox luman Welfare.. On April 19, 1949, Paul Crouch, a sell-

admitted

former Communist Party

member, described Horter as

CONFIDiTIAL

The Attorney General

a Left wing scolalist who was always close io the Communist

Party, meting with officials and representatives to discuss

policy and procedure during the period from 1959 to 1941.

This informant also described Horion's wife, Zylphia, as

being even closer to the Party in 1941.

Another confidential

Informant advised this Bureau in 1950 that Ilorton continued

to follow the Communist Party line during the period 1947 to

1950 and that he associated with know Party members.

This

informant doubted that Horion was actually a Communist Party

member. In 1950 and 1951 a third contidential informant,

who is a former member of the Party, advised that llorton

was not a member even though he had close association with

Party members. He stated Horton had been criticined by the

Party members as an opportunist who used the Party los his

ow purposes.

Forton was reported to be listed as one of the

spoakers for a "Bill of Rights Dinner' which was to be

sponscred by the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee on

December 15, 1959.

We can, at the same time, prepare a memorandum to the Attorney General

advise him of the information contained in Mr. Sullivan's memorandum

STATEPENT BY GOVERNOR ROSS R. BARNETT OF

SENATE COMMERCE COMMITTEE, JULY 12, 1963.

SSISSIPPI BEFORE U.S.

Gentlemen, we are facing one of the most critical times in the

history of our nation. Minority groups in our country have taken to

the streets to agitate, to demonstrate; to breach the peace, and to

provoke violence calculated to blackmail this Congress into passing

legislation in direct violation of thu u........

"--tes Constitution.

You have been forced to consider this legislation through the

pressure.and blackmail of mobs in the streets.

The President and the Attorney General have encouraged

somonstratiors, fraçdon rides, alt-ins, pieketing and actual violation

of local laws. What is happening in our nation today fits the

pattern of what has "been happaring throughout the world insofar as

the Conmunist activity 1s concerned. Compare the Communist tastics

With a Cuba, a Laos, a Berlin, a Viet Nam, a Haiti, or other parts

of the world. Communist tactics are to create a crisis and let 1t

cool off. The same tactics are being practiced in the United States

through a Ermingham, and letting 1t cool off; a jackson, and

letting 1t cool off; a Danville, Virginia; a Cambridge, Maryland;

riots in Philadelphia; and in New York City. It's the same old

Communist offensive of attack with a hammer and then withdraw.

Attack with a hammer and then withdraw--each time causing more 111

will, more racial unrest and pushing a weage further between

existing good relations of the people of a nation. It is the divide,

disrupt and conquer technique. The passage of this Civil Rights

legislation will positively provoke more violence, not just in the

South, but throughout all areas of our nation. I am convinced that

this is a part of the world Communist conspiracy to divide and

conquer our country from within.

The Communists are, therefore, championing the cause of the

Negroes In America as an Important part of their drive to mobilize

- both colored and white for the overthrow of our government.

There are those who are so anxious to hold high the banner of

the Civil Rights Issue that they fail to read some of the writing

on the banner.

They all to realize that the comminist Party hopes

areas.

Io date, they have been disappointed and defeated by the due

process of law in the South where law enforcement agencies and level-

headed citizens have been able to contain the aggravations of the

outside racil agitators.

Gentlemen, It is obvious to many of us throughout the country

chat the racial agitation, strife and conflict that has been stirred

up throughout our entire nation is largely Communist-inspired. Racial

agitators In Mississipp1 and leaders of demonstrations in other

states have backgrounds that have made many of us, Including our

ocal police, state investigating ageneles, and the PEl, to be

concerned about the real motivation behind these so-called Civi

Rights leaders. *.

Your passage of this legislation will be no cure-all for the

problems that this nation faces because of racial strife and conflict.

The passage of this legislation will, however, mean the complete end

of Constitutional government in America and result'in racial violençe

of uninaginable scope. Even the New font Ilmes hag said that "with :

every negro advance, momentum for more violence and agitation

Increases, not decreases."

This legislation is so all-inclusive and so sweeping in its

scope that it has been termed by many as the "WHITE SLAVE BILL".

Gentlemen, you have all learned through your personal

experiences that to try to appease, accommodate, or give concessions

to the demands of the arrogant leads oniy to additional conflicts and

additional problems which you didn't face before." Certainly, you

are familiar with the results of our policy of appeasement towards

Cuba and Laos. The passage of this Civil Rights legislation will

lead

us into an area of conflict between the races, the Ilke of which

have never known. There will be no end to the constant pressure

for more

and more and more.

e purpose of government should b

protect the Individual and

to see to 1t that no one interferes with his private property. The

present administration seems to have adopted the very heart of the

Soclalistic philosophy that the private rights of men are to be

tolerated only at the suffrage of the State. What we are seeing

today 1s a grasp for power by certain men in public nifice who would

give to an all-powerful central Government full control over all.

phases of the lives of our neople. I see this legislation as an

attempt by greedy, minorities to prostitute the purpose of law and

government

as a

protector of private property,

and

to use the law to

plunder the property of others.

If you pass this legislation, you are allowing a minority in our

country to force Itself upon the majority of the citizens of our

nation. What and where are the rights of the majority? The powers

Oi the Attorney General under this legislation will be so sweeping

and so encompassing as to comprise a serious threat, in Itself, to

the safety and stability of the nation. The Attorney General in his

testimony has stated, "I think that It is an Injustice that needs to

be remedied. We have to find the tools with which to remedy that

Injustice," In other words, regardless of the constitution, bes

through this legislation, asks for the power to run roughshod over

the rights of every individual and dictate to every citizen what he

coula or could not do with his prevate property and business, ei

1s the equal protection of the law?

I challenge the newspapers and news media of our country to :

awaken the man on the street, the small business man, all those who

respect law and order; to the fact that this legislation 1s an open

attack on the rights of every individual to the control of his

personal, private property.

Every citizen has the right to own and operate his own business

as he sees fit without interference

from any source. To give to an

011-powerful Contral Adverument the right to force the owner of a

private business to unwillingly do business with anyone creates a

new and special right for a minority group in this nation that

destroys the property and personal rights of every citizen.

enator Russell has stated and the

ess has failed to report,

"Our American system has always rejected the idea that one group of

citizens may deprive another of legal rights and property by process

of agitation, demonstration, Intimidation, law defiance and civil

disobedience. Every Negro citizen possesses every right that is

possessed by any white citizen. But there is nothing in either the

Constituton or in Christian principles or common sense and reason

which would compel one citizen to share his rights with ore of

another

race at the same place and at the same time. Such compulsion

would amount to a complete denial of inalienable rights of the

adividual to choose or select his

associates."

Gentlemen, what could be more unequal and discrimatory than to

give one particular class of citizens the privilege of by-passing the

normal channels of Justice, which other catizens must follow. Under

this legislation, any agitator or irouble-maker of crank could bring

the owner of any business

establishment into federal court by merely

writing a letter to the U.S. Attorney General. The agitator would.

be represented, at no vost to hiraselt, by the orridiale and attoreys

of the Federal Government. If this legislation passes, American

citizens will have no rights in the ownership and use of their

private property, unless they use it in a way that federal officialdom

considers to be consistent with the so-called public interest. Today,

It seems to many Americans, the demands of the racial agitation

groups fix official opinion as to what 1s the public interest.

Tomorrow, the public interest could well be something else. It

could even invade the home--or even the bedroom of the individual.

The legitimate purpose of government is to protect a man's home

as his castle. Does not this same basic American Constitutional

fact

of life apply equally to a man's own private business? The

legislation you have under consideration would use federal police

power (as exemplified in our system of Federal courts) to destroy a

- man's personal property simply to satisfy racial minorities. Can

there be no end to the current insanity that would compel the mixing

of races in social activities to achieve WHAT? You can name It

The head of the NACP here in Washingtos

D. C. (where Negro

criminal violence against white people is creating something akin

to a reign of terror) said on a national television program in

early May of this year, that Negro violence is coming and that the

NAACP Will promote the violence 1f whites do not immediately give

the Negro what he demands. What does he demand. Does he honestly

know just what he'really wants? Whatever he may want will not come

as a result of this or any other legislative act. You can be certain

of that basic fact!

The race problem can never be solved by passage

of laws, court edicts, or by breaches of the peace.

ONE ESTABLISHMENT GOES OUT OF BUSINESS

I have said that the free enterprise system has contributed much

to making our nation great and that many establishments would go out

of business if they were required to integrate.

I am prepared to

gIve you one specific example in Mississippi.

Mrs. Marjorie Staley of Winora, Mississippi, has operated a

restaurant as a Continental Trailways Bus Terminal for quite a while.

Apparently, she was making good and had a good business but she sias

told to either integrate or close the business. She chose to close:

her business rather than integrate. It Is my understanding that

Trailways officials had been directed by the Justice Department to

warn her to either close or integrate. She has approximately

$20,000.00 of equipment in the restaurant. She had seven or eight.

people employed - three whites and three or four Negroes. She had

a payroll of $2,000.00 per month:

Now her business is closed, seven

or eight people, Negroes and whites, are out of employment, and she

has $20,000.00 worth of equipment on her hands.

Prior to the time she closed this business,

she served both

white and colored in separate compartments - one for the whites and

one for the Negroes. Apparently, everyone was happy the way it was

being operated. Everyone was well pleased--customers as well as

employees, and Mrs. Staley.

This is one example that neither Congress nor the courts can

change attitudes and custor.s.

Mrs. Staley is a widow and earned her livelshood operating her

restaurant.

There is a communist nation just 90 miles from our shores and

yet, with this and all the other problems we face as a nation, the

whole attention of the congress and our nation at this critical era

in history is diverted to this tragic and mis-named Civil Rights

legislation.

Perhaps this is all a part of a great conspiracy to

divert our attention to this domestic Issue so that we may neglect

other and far more important matters..

Gentlemen, I have done some research on this matter as to the

constitutionality of the proposed bill.

Section 3 0f Senate Bill 1732 provides that all persons shall

pe entitled, without discrimination or segregation on account of

race, color, religion, or national origin, to the

full and equal

enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,

and accommodations. of hotels, motels and numerous other private

business

enterprises.

section 2(n) provides that alleged existing discriminatory

practices "take on' the character of action by the states and there:

fore fall within the ambit of the equal protection of the Fourteenth

Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."

Section 2(1) takes the position that congress has the right

to enact this proposed legislation in order to remove alleged

burdens on and obstructions to commerce under the Commerce Clause

of the constitution of the United States.

Congress does not have the

power to enact this legislati on

under the Fourteenth Amendment

The businesses sought to be controlled are purely private in:

as such fall within the ambit of what Is commonly

known as "free enterprise." Every loyal conservative American has

a deep and abiding faith in our free enterprise system. He also

stands ever vigilant to protect the citizen's right to own, control

and operate his private business as he sees fit. The right to do

business or to decline to do business with any individual is an

inseparable part of said citizen's right to operate and control his

privately owned business. If this right is destroyed by the Federal

Government, the citizen has been deprived of one of his inalienable

"No State shall make or enforce any law which

shall abridge the privileges or immunities of

citizens of the United States; nor shall any

State deprive any person of life, liberty, or

property, without due process of law; nor deny

to any person within its jurisdiction the

equai protection of the laws."

It should be noted that the Fourteenth Amendment 1s a pro-

hibition against State action. It is not a prohibition against

the action of one citizen against another. Each Individual has a

legal right to discriminate against another individual. Any

control over such individual action by the operation of a private

business lies wholly within the power of the

State legislatures

under the Tenth Amendment to the constitution of the United states.

Some states have passed legislation similar to this; some have not.

Each State has the right to make its own decision.

Mississippi has taken no action on this question. In our state

the owner of each business is free to make his own decision as to

whom he will serve:

Eighty years ago in United States v. Nichols, entitled the

Civil Rights cases, 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.CT. 18, 27:1. Ed. 835, the

supreme court of the United States held Sections I and 2 of the

Civil Rights Act of 1875 unconstitutional, said gots provided that

all persona in the United itates were entitled to the sull and

equal enjoyment of accommondations, advantages, facilities and

privileges of inns' and places of amusement. In holding that

Congress had no right to pass such a law under the Fourteenth

Amendment, the Court said:

"It is state action of a particular character

that 1s prohibitod. Individual invasion or

Individual rights is not the subject-matter

of the Amendment. "

"And so in the present case, until some state

law has been passed or some state action

through its officers or agents has been taken,

adverse to the rights of citizens

sought to be

protected by the 14th Amenament, no legislation

of the United States under said Amendment, nor.

any proceeding under such legislation,, can be

called into activity; for the prohibitions of

the Amenament are against state laws

and acts

"Such legislation cannot properly cover the

whole domain of raghts appertaining to life,

liberty and property, defining them and

providing for their vindication. That would be

to establish a code of municipal law pegulative

of all private rights between man and man in

society. It would be to make Congress take the

place of the State Legislatures and to supersede

them. It is absurd to affirm that, because the

rights of life, liberty and property, which

include all civil rights that men have, are,

by the Amendment sought to be protected against

Invasion on the part of the State without due

process of law, Congress may, therefore provide

due process of law for their vindication in •

every case; and that, because the denial by a

State to any persons,

of the equal protection of

Congress may establish laws for their eçual

are prohibited from comnitting or taking."

"An inspection of the law shows that it makes no reference

whatever to any supposed or apprehended violation of the lith

Amendent on the part. of the States. It is not predicated on

and lays down rules for the conduct of individuals in society

"If this legislation is appropriate for enforcing the

prohibitions of the Amendment, It is difficult to see where

It is to stop. Why may not Congress with equal show of

authority enact a code of laws for the enforcement and

vindication of all rights of life, liberty and property? If It

Is supposable that the States may deprive persons of life.

Amendment itself does suppose this, why should not Congress

proceed at once to prescribe due process of law for the

unsound. It is repugnant to the 'lOth Amendment of the

attorney for the Internal Revenue Service. He brought suit claiming

thạt such action violated the Civil Rights Acts of 1875 and the

Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. In Williams V. Howard

Johnson Restaurants, U.S.C.A.4th, 258 F.2d 845, the Court re-affirma

the doctrine of the Civil Rights Cases, and said:

"Sections 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, upon which the

plaintiff's position is based in part, provided that all persons

In the United States should be entitled to the full and equal

enjoyment of accommodations, advantages, facilities and

privileges of inns, public conveyances and places of amusement,

and that any person who should violate this provision by denying

to any citizen the full enjoyment of any of the enumerated

accommodations, facilities or privileges should for every such

offense forfeit and pay the sum of $500 to the person aggrieved.

• The Supreme Court of the United States, however, held in Civil

Rights Cases 109 U.S. 3, 3 S.Ct. 18, 27 L.Ed, 835,, that these

sections of the Act were unconstitutional and were not

authorized by either the Thirteenth or Fourteenth Amendments of

the Constitution. The court pointed out that the Fourteenth

Amendment was prohibitory upon the states only, so as to

Invalidate all state statutes which abridge the privileges or

Immunities of citizens of the United States or deprive them or

life, liberty or property without due process of law, or deny to

any person the equal protection of the laws; but that the

perfectly clear that

Congress does not have the power to control the activities of private

business owners under the Fourteenth Amendment.

*;

r."

Congress does not have the power

to enact this legislation under

the Commerce Clause of the

• Constitution of the United States.

Article I, Section VIII, Clause 3 provides:

"The Congress shall have Power: . . . to regulate Commerce

with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and

with the Indian Tribes; ..."•

No one can reasonably contend that the operation of a

hotel, restaurant or drug store in Mississippi constitutes commerce

among the several States. The Supreme Court of the United States

clearly did not think so in the CIvil Rights Cases, because it said:

"Has Congress constitutional power to make such a law? Of

course, no one will contend that the power to pass it was

contained in the Constitution before the adoption of the

last three Amendrients."

The last three Amendments referred to were the 13th, 14th,

and 15th. The Commerce Clause was a part of the Constitution

from it inception. The Supreme Court, therefore, said that no one

would even contend that Congress had the power to pass such law

prior to the adoption of the 13th Amendment.

Of course, the right to control commerce among the States

Includes the right. to control interstate transportation, and

Congress has done so in this field by Iitle 28 U.S.C.A., Section 3(1),

which forbids a carrier to subject any person to undue or unreasonable

prejudice or disadvantage in any respect. The right of the Congress

to deny discrimination Incident to interstate commerce has been upheld

In a number

of

cases.

Henderson v. United States, 339 U.S. 816, 70 S.Ct. 843, 94 L.Ed. 1302.

In like manner, the Supreme Court has also held that certain State

action constituted an unlawful burden on interstate commerce in this

field. Morgan v. Virginia, 328 U.S. 373, 66 S.Ct. 1050, 90 L.Ed. 1317.

In the Civil Rights Cases, the Supreme Court recognized the

power of Congress to regulate public conveyances passing from one

state to another, and said:

"And whether Congress, in the exercise of its power to

regulate conmarce amongst the several States, might or might

not pass a law legulating rights in public conveyances passing

from one State to anothes, is also a question which is

not now before us, as the sections in question are not

conceived in any such view."

It is clear, therefore, that the Supreme Court was not unmindful

of the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause when it decided:

the Civil Rights Cases and when it held that no one would even

contend that Congress had the right to pass this type of legislation

under the Commerce Clause of prior to the adoption of the 13th, 14th,

and 15th Amendments.

Who would seriously contend that the operation of a restaurant

on Capitol Street in Jackson, Mississippi, could be classified as

as commerce among the several States? If such action constitutes

commerce among the States simply because some of the products handled

were manufactured outside of Mississippi, every act of every citizen

• in every State could be controlled by Congress on the same basis.

The Constitution should not be stretched entirely out of shape in an

effort to reach what is believed by some to be an evil, the correction

of which is a matter for each State to make its own decision. This

issue was raised in Williams v. Howard Johnson Restaurant, supra, and

interstate commerce because it is

highway and serves interstate travelers.

He suggests that

a Federal policy has been developed in numerous decisions

which requires the elimination of racial restrictions on

transportation in interstate commerce and the admission of

Negroes to railroad cars, sleeping cars and dining cars

without discrimination as to color; and he argues that

the commerce clause of the Constitation (Article I, Section 8,

• Clause 3), which empowers Congress to regulate commerce among

the states, is self-executing so that even

without a prohibitory

statute no person engaged in interstate commerce may place

undue restrictions upon it.

"The cases upon which the plaintiff relies in each instance

disclosed discriminatory action against persons of the

colored race by carriers engaged in the transportation of

passengers in interstate commerce."

"In every instance the conduct condemned was that of an

organization directly engaged in interstate commerce and the

line of authority would be persuasive in the determination of

the present controversy if it could be said that the defendant

restaurant was so engaged. We think, however, that the cases

cited are not applicable because ve do not find that a restaurant

• Is engaged in interstate commerce merely because in the course

of its business of furnishing accommodations to the general

public it serves persons who are traveling from state to state.

As an instrument of local commerce, the restaurant is not

subject to the constitutional and statutory provisions

discussed above and, thus, is at liberty to deal with such

persons as it may select."

v. Richerdson, U.S.C.A.8th, 269 F.2d 167, the Court held

that the treatment of some patients wilo were travelling in

Interstate commerce did not destroy the purely local character

Congress is now asked to control the operation of country

stores and hotels. on the theory that their operation constitutes

commerce among the several States. The statement of the

proposition is so ridiculous that it need not be further

refuted.

It is my understanding that the Attorney General of the

United States has suggested to this Committee that it disregard

the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in

the Civil Rights Cases. I have always been under the impression

In conclusion, I would like to a

certain members of the

Congress two questions: (1) How long do you plan to bow to the

unrcasonable and unconstitutional demands of selfish minorities

In your state? (2) When do you expect to begin to, represent the

great majority of your own people?

Another question naturally follows--how far do you think the

great white majority of this nation will stand to be pushed?

I have received and am receiving daily letters from substantial

eVeryday citizens in every state of this nation and I say to you

seriously that our

fine white citizens have stood just about as

much of this minority insanity as they can take..

Centlemen, you are just 'about to hear fron that great, silent,

substantial whete majority back kome.

When John Doe and Ole Joe Q. Doakes on Main Street in every

city, town, village and cross-road in your state, finds out exactly

what is really in this legislation--just what the present U.S.

Attorney General and the Negro minorities want today-turmoil

will really break loose in this nation.

If you think 500,000 Negroes marching on Washington is something,

pass this legislation and you'll find out what one hundred million

angry white Americans will do.

Please think deeplyion these matters. Think seriously as to

how much the white man will take in having his rights chipped

away with new legislation such as this and by each decision of the

Federal Courts. Are there no rights of the individual sacred

today in this country?

Equality in a social sense is attainable only in total

slavery. Justice Brandeis said, "One of the inalienable rights

of men is to be let alone." This certainly applies to the hard-

working, snall business man?

What we are about to experience ir

our nation today is tyranny

of the mob. The intent of this legislation is to steal away the

fundamental rights of man to own and manage his private property

The President and Attorney General are sewing the seeds of

hate and violence. The nation could reap a bloody harvest.

From the Erecutiv- Bianch of this government. This legislation

Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall of the Civil Rights

Division was contacted this morning and this natter was discussed with him

further?

He pointed nut that he had not received any additional requests for

such information as to communist influence in the racial situation irom any

other members of Congress but that he fully expected there would be further

inquiries, In this connection it was pointed out to Marshall the undesirability

of making the specific comments previously noted as to giving complete clearance

to Martin Lutheil King and the use of the language "communist-controlled" as

Marshall has had fuit details as to King's association with Stanley Levison, the

concealed communist,and Hunter Pitts O'Deli, who had been elected to the

National Committee of the Communist Party (USA), og under an anas e

ensite sign tille

In addition, as a illustration, Marshall was informed of the case

involving Lee Pressman who had denied for years being a communisi and then •

later admitted it for a Congressional Committee.

Marshall said that he was most appreciative of our warning him

about these pitfalls and he would be guided accordingly in any future statements.

He added that he would also appreciate our continuing to highlight for him any

information indicating communist activity in the Negro movement.

Marshall said he had been endeavoring to see Senators Monroney

(D. - Okla.) and Magnuson (D. - Washington) but had not accomplished this to

date. Senator Magnuson is reportedly seriously ill in the hospital; (This has

not been publicized.) and Senator Monroney has cancelled two appointments

Marshall had with him as Montoney was tied up with the railroad strike

legislation.

Memorandum to Mr. Belmont

RE: REQUESTS FROM MEMBERS OF

CONGRESS CONCERNING ALLEGED

COMMUNIST INFLUENCE IN THE

CURRENT RACIAL SITUATION

Marshall said that over the weekend he had received information

that the United Mine, Mill and Smelters Workers in Savannah was making

available office space for use by the Negro groups. He noted that the Negros

are short of tunds and are prone to accept aid wherever they can obtain it. fi

this represents communist activity in Savannah, Marshall said he would

appreciate recsiving any details we might obtain.

ACTION TO BE TAKEN:

The Savannah Division will be instructed to ascertain whether

the local of the United Mine, Mill and Smelters Workers in Savannah is subjecied

to communist influence at this time and whether such intluence may be a factor

in the support that union is reportedly to be currently giving to the Negro

movement. A memorandum should be prepared following the results of this

inquiry.

RE: HUNTER PITTS O' DELL

100-358916

Although we could, of coursé, respond directly to Senator

Russell's inquiry, such action could well result in the Director's

being subpoenaed.

We believe the Senator's communication should

be handled by referring it to the Attorney General for his

consideration. He have followed this procedure in connection with

prior correspondence from members of Congress regarding possible

communist activity in the current racial situation. In the

transmittal letter to the Attorney General, we are pointing

out that the Bureau has submitted investigative reports regarding

O'Dell to the Department of Justice and that by letter dated

July 17, 1963, and in prior communications directed to him, we

have furnished the highlights and pertinent information regarding

O'Dell's Communist Party affiliation and his connections with ..

King and the SCLC.

We are also directing a short note to Senator Russell

acknowledging receipt of his communication and advising that, in

line with Department policy, his letter has been transmitted

to

the Attorney General for appropriate consideration.

RECOMMENDATION:

That the enclosed letters be transmitted.

The Attorney General asked me to see him this morning. On being

also referred to the statement on page two of the report under the heading "Evidence

of Communist Party Sympathies; Martin Luther King, Jr. has been described as

The Attorney General stated that if this report got up to the Hill at

t his time, he,would be impeached. He noted that it this report got out, jeworla

be alleged the FBI said King was a confirmed Marxist Leninist as ate as r

June, 1963. - The Attorney General went on to say that the report had been reviewed

in detail by Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall who had told him there

wasn't'anything new here concerning King's alleged communist sympathies but

that it was the timing of the report and its possible misuse which concerned him.

The Attorney General went on to say that he didn't feel he could fully trust every-

one in the Internal Security Division of the Department.

I pointed out to the Attorney General that first of all this report was

classified secret and was just a summary report to bring our files and that of the

Department's up to date.

He said that while this was undoubtedly true, the sub-

MARTIN LUTHER KING was asked by a group of

newspaper reporters whether he takes orders from

"the Communists,"

and also, whether he took "orders from

STANLEY LEVISON.

" KING's response was that he took

orders only from Goà.

By reason of the fact that the LEVISONs feel

that the Party has done little, if anyühing, to assist

the fight for civil rights for Negroes, and further, since

they fee. that the Party, as a result of this "do nothing"

attitude, has lost prestige, they will no longer permit

the Party to dominate or control

their activities in

the MARTIN LUTHER KING movement. They are severing

themselves financially and in a

disciplinary way, from

Party.

The LEVISONS and O'DELL are still Party members

but"do not desire to be openly

"linked up" with the Party.

Although they are "disenchanted" with the Party, they

are not quitting the Party.

With respect to the MARTIN

LUTHER KING movement; they will act on their own initiative

and will not accept

instructions from the Party.

he went to church and told LEVISON that "COBERTA" had

been invited to go to Geneva by the women's. Strike

for Peace Convention. KING stated that Mrs. CYRUS

EATON would be going with the delegation of about

30 women, most of whom are housewives.

LEVISON at this time told KING that he was

glad that KING had followed his advice in calling off

the - planned sit-in demonstration in Atlanta, following

the plane crash which took the lives of many prominent

Atlantans •

KING agreed it was a good idea, a smart

i move which undoubtedly achieved better feelings toward

his group.

LEVISON and KING discussed future affairs

planned by the National Association for the Advancement

of Colored People (NAACP). KING detailed one in particular

which they planned to hold at the Waldorf Hotel, Indicating

it would be saled at $25.00 a plate with an expected

attendance of 1,000.

LEVISON commented that he thought

it was priced too high, and thought that 300 would

be a more accurate figure for attendance.

KING referred to

the schizophrenic

trend of the administration, on one hand it appoints

a THURGOOD MARSHALI, as a Federal Judge, and then

appoints judges in the south who are outright segregatzonists."

KING stated that "KENNEDY has often said to me

that you can't get this through.... there is no point

in introducing strong civil rights legislation because

you can't get it through."

KING concluded by stating

that his contention is that if he (President KENNEDY)

would get out and really fight - crusade for it,

it wouid have a stronger chance of getting through."

we make a move before that time, he could use that

to his advantage.

KING then tola LEVISON that going into Birmingham

Is going to be a difficult matter; that they are going

to do everything they can to destroy the image of the

Southern Christian Leadership Conference, particularly

the Birmingham newspapers. Now, since they played this

thing up so much 'we were wondering if it would be

better to continue sending the circulars through

the usual channels."

LIVISON agreed and conluded

by stating, "There is no sense giving them a timely

red herring."

a lengthy discussion with

STANLEY LEVISON. LEVISON

inquired of king as to the feeling of the Birmingham

community to the

expulsion o1 Negro students by the

Birmingham Board of Education.

KING replied that he

thought "we" could hold them together.

He does not,

In his opinion, want to follow an unwise act on the

part of the Board of Education, with an unwise act

"our part." KING believes that (EUGENE) "BULL"

O'CONNOR, City Commissioner of Public Safety, is

doing this to provoke the Negro community to the point

that they will do something to so confuse the situation

that it will upset the agreement now in effect.

LEVISON suggested that KING issue a statement that

he will not be trapped by these tactics. KING stated

chat he had made it very clear that this was a temporar

nove and that it would be unwise to move without

looking at the total situation.

LEVISON told KING that he had a discussion with

CLARENCE JONES, Chief Counsel, Ghandi Society of Human

Rights, concerning setting up temporary educational

for this purpose.

LEVISON explained that it was his thought that

"the Birmingham pattern" can be followed in other cities

where there are unresolved problems.

He noted that in

Atlanta, there is no bi-racial committee and the

establishment of one could be a first demand.

In other

cities, it may be desirable to have

direct action first

"followed by the Birmingham pattern."

LEVISON said

that each city should be examined separately.

KING commented that he las never seen the

Negro community as arousea, as determined, as enthusiasti?

as at this time. He said that "more than ever before

is this national determination and feeling that time

Is running out."

He stated that he thought "we are

on the threshold of a significant breakthrough and

the greatest weapon is mass demonstration."

KING stated "we are at the point where we can

nobize all tene righteous indignation into a

KING suggested that there be a mass march

or the impression be given that a mass march of "literally

thousands and

thousands of people is going to be organized

on Washington."

He added "the threat itself may so

frighten the president that he would have to do something."

He asked IEVISON "are we ready for that?"

LEVISON said there were two things which must

i be considered:

1. There must be unanimity among all groups.

Is there more pressure generated on

Washington by the series of local situations than by

a mass march on Washington?

KING said that he felt there could be unanimity.

"pressure builds from the bottom"

and the NAACP would

exert much pressure on WILKINS.

With respect to the second point raised by

LEVISON, KING pointed out he was not thinking of

concentrating on Washington alone,

but was thinking

of activity in every state. He said there should

be simultaneous protest on the local level "and at

the same time a work stoppage would be called for

He stated that the sort of thing he

envisioned would have such an impact that "something

would have to give." He again asked LEVISON if

LEVISON thought the time was right for such a move •

and LEVISON agreed that "the time is now."

CLARENCE JONES suggested that KING should

discuss his proposal with ROY WILKINS and PHIL,

before any announcement is made publicly. He felt the

timing of such a move is most important.

LEVISON felt that KING was the proper person

to make such an announcement and felt that it could

be announced when KING addresses a scheduled Trade

Union meeting and at his commencement address at City

College of New York on June 12, 1963. Following this,

LEVISON felt

KInG sould discuss. it with both ROY

WILKINS and 'PHIL" LEVISON felt that since it was then

publicly announced, WILKINs would have a hard time

objecting.

KING was of the opinion that he should call

a special press conference, possibly in Atlanta, and

make his announcement.

. with this proposal and suggested he implement it in

his speeches.

The Identity of PHIL Is unknown to the source.

KING stated that in all probability, he would

get a call from Washington, suggesting that since

the

president is leaving for Europe shortly, it would

be embarrassing for him.

LEVISON commented that because of the President's

trip to Europe,

he will nave to pay attention.

He

again suggested that a press conterence would have

a real impact, but suggested that PHIL" should be

advised belorehand.

KING said that such an undertaking would

require a reai job of mobilization and people would

be needed Iult time.

LEVISON said the eflect of such an announcement

will "tip" une President

"towards Civil Rignts LegislatiOi

KING suggested that either LEVISON Or JONES

see "PHil" and "two of you work out ine statement

coutry.

KING Jelt tnat such undertaking wouid take

six to eight weeks to organize.

LEVISON said that the summer can ve a lactor

as many organizations are on vacation.

It was indicated

that CLARENCE JONES nad attended

a meeting at which

the National Council of Churches had expressed

LEVISON

meetings as

"this is new when White Church leadership

Is looking for something in the way of direct action."

He said this would give it the biggest, broadest front

ever as "you can see the effect of Negroes joined

When JONES demurred to LEVISON's proposal,

LEVISON asked KING if he would bewilling to

KING was not enthusiastic about the idea

because he felt that BALDWIN was uninformed regarding

his movement.

KING noted that BALDWIN, although

considered a spokesman of the Negro people, by the

press, is not a civil rights leader..

the march by his organization, and that proposed by

KING could be coincided in the immediate future: LEVISON

suggested that KING attempt to contact PHIL as soon as

pussible in order to discuss this matter in detail.

KING asked LEVISON If LEVISON, along with

JACK O'DET,I (HUNTER PITTS O'DELL) WOuld

be able to

get some statistics on the annual Negro income of

the average Negro family, as against the annual income

of the averag: white family on a national level, and

then for some southern states, like Alavama, where

"we" are now working.

KING would like to use these

statistics at a

luncheon in New York City on June 12,

1963.

LEVISON stated that hewould attempt to get

the statistics along with JACK O'DELL, and

pointed out

that the main poiht of these statistics is that the

gap between Negro and white income today is greater

than the gap that existed between Negro and white

income during the Depression days.
